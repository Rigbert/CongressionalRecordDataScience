 Now, I heard from the other side of the aisle what a stunning success it is. We are protecting the profits of the pharmaceutical industry. They will get an extra $139 billion in profits. We are subsidizing the insurance industry to offer these plans, plans which can be changed on a weekly basis even though seniors can only sign up for one plan a year.  Yet as great as they say these things are, about half the seniors in my State and across America who were not mandatorily enrolled are not yet participating in the plans, in part, because in my little State, there are some 46 plans in my district, I guess in Portland a few more, so there are actually a total of 96 variants available to seniors.  They describe to us what happens when you go on these sites, these are the advocates, not the seniors. You will get, and there will be a little tiny asterisk by certain drugs, and they have given you some plans that might be good for you because you need a plan that will pay for the drugs your doctor has prescribed.  If you hit the little tiny asterisk, then a drop-down window comes out. Most seniors don't know about drop-down windows. The drop-down window says limits may apply. It turns out the limits might be you take 60 of those twice, two a day. The limit might be one a day, but it is not very explicit about that. When you call the 1-800 number, you can't get a human being to get information. So seniors are, for the most part, totally confused. They are having trouble, even when they try to focus in on a plan that might give them help, getting to a point where they can make a choice.  Of course, even if they do choose a plan that pays for that plan, that plan can change the drug benefit on a weekly basis, not something that a senior can do.  Now, we also heard from a small pharmacist, because of the confusion in the transition for the dual eligibles, her pharmacy, her little pharmacy, had to front $45,000 in prescriptions to seniors and has yet to be reimbursed. The reimbursements are starting to trickle in. She had spent 8 hours the day before trying to reconcile some of those to the actual outlays in the drugs that she had fronted for her seniors.  We heard time and time again about problems. My doctor has hired an additional person to try and deal with all the prior approvals required for seniors who have been taking a drug for years, many of these new plans will require all sorts of documentation on why they should get that drug. Many seniors don't know, who have already subscribed, that they are temporarily getting their old drugs until the 1st of April. On the 1st of April, they will fall under their new plan's mandates, and they may not be able to continue taking the drug their doctor has prescribed.  Minimally, Congress should revisit this punitive time limit. The time limit, you have to sign up by May 15, or we will penalize you. They say 1 percent per month; but guess what, you can't sign up again until next fall.  Any senior who doesn't sign up by May 15 will be penalized 6 percent tax, 6 percent extra for life as a bonus to the already subsidized insurance companies on top of their premium. That is not fair. Congress should undo that arbitrary mandate. That was to try and stampede seniors into plans that they don't understand that they might not want, and that should go.  But then perhaps we should do what the head of Walgreens has suggested. He said there are so many plans out there, so many benefits, so many formularies, his pharmacist can't figure it out.  Like Congress did 25 years ago, he says Congress should standardize these plans and say, there will be five or 10 plans out there with standard benefits, so everybody can understand what the 10 options are. They can just learn 10 options and then let the private companies compete over price, perhaps without a subsidy from the taxpayers.  Or, God forbid, we could actually take on the pharmaceutical industrysince the drug prices under these plans are actually on average higher than the prices offered by Costco. What a great deal. The President likes to talk about how these insurance companies, or PBMs, how they have just bargained so hard and driven down the prices. They are only 50 percent higher than the prices that the VA gets through negotiations for our veterans. But the Republicans outlawed, they outlawed, Medicare bargaining lower drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.  Now, who does that help? They said that was un-American to negotiate lower drug prices. It is not un-American to give huge windfall benefits to the pharmaceutical industry.                          ____________________
