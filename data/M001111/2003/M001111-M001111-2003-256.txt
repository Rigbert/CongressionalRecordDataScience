 President, it says:       Thank you for your efforts to alleviate my concerns. Here      are just a few edits, which are necessary to avoid the      problems we discussed earlier. Please be sure to observe the      deletion of the citation of Sect. 104 (a) (4).  What is Section 104 (a) (4)?  It is a clause in the Superfund law, which enables the EPA to declare a public health emergency.  And why did OMB tell the EPA to ``delete the citation'' to Section 104 (a) (4)?  We don't know for sure, but if EPA had issued the public health emergency for Libby under Superfund, then the agency would have had to answer questions about asbestos-tainted insulation from every other homeowner in the country.  Here is what the St. Louis Post-Dispatch investigation concluded:       The Environmental Protection Agency was on the verge of      warning millions of Americans that their attics and walls      might contain asbestos-contaminated insulation. But, at the      last minute, the White House intervened, and the warning has      never been issued.  The Post-Dispatch got reaction from an EPA staffer about OMB's intervention:       It was like a gut shot,'' said one of those senior staffers      involved in the decision. ``It wasn't like they ordered us      not to make the declaration, they just really, really      strongly suggested against it. Really strongly. There was no      choice left.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Dec. 29, 2002]         White House Office Blocked EPA's Asbestos Cleanup Plan                         (By Andrew Schneider)       Washington.--The Environmental Protection Agency was on the      verge of warning millions of Americans that their attics and      walls might contain asbestos-contaminated insulation. But, at      the last minute, the White House intervened, and the warning      has never been issued.       The agency's refusal to share its knowledge of what is      believed to be a widespread health risk has been criticized      by a former EPA administrator under two Republican      presidents, a Democratic U.S. senator and physicians and      scientists who have treated victims of the contamination.       The announcement to warn the public was expected in April.      It was to accompany a declaration by the EPA of a public      health emergency in Libby, Mont. In that town near the      Canadian border, ore from a vermiculite mine was contaminated      with an extremely lethal asbestos fiber called tremolite that      has killed or sickened thousands of miners and their      families.       Ore from the Libby mine was shipped across the nation and      around the world, ending up in insulation called Zonolite      that was used in millions of homes, businesses and schools      across America.       A public health emergency declaration had never been issued      by any agency. It would have authorized the removal of the      disease-causing insulation from homes in Libby and also      provided long-term medical care for those made sick.      Additionally, it would have triggered notification of      property owners elsewhere who might be exposed to the      contaminated insulation.       Zonolite insulation was sold throughout North America from      the 1940s through the 1990s. Almost all of the vermiculite      used in the insulation came from the Libby mine, last owned      by W.R. Grace & Co.       In a meeting in mid-March, EPA Administrator Christie Todd      Whitman and Marianne Horinko, head of the Superfund program,      met with Paul Peronard, the EPA coordinator of the Libby      cleanup and his team of health specialists. Whitman and      Horinko asked tough questions, and apparently got the answers      they needed. They agreed they had to move ahead on a      declaration, said a participant in the meeting.       By early April, the declaration was ready to go. News      releases had been written and rewritten. Lists of governors      to call and politicians to notify had been compiled. Internal      e-mail shows that discussions had even been held on whether      Whitman would go to Libby for the announcement.       But the declaration was never made.                        Derailed by White House       Interviews and documents show that just days before the EPA      was set to make the declaration, the plan was thwarted by the      White House Office of Management and Budget, which had been      told of the proposal months earlier.       Both the budget office and the EPA acknowledge that the      White House agency was actively involved, but neither agency      would discuss how or why.       The EPA's chief spokesman Joe Martyak said, ``Contact OMB      for the details.''       Budget office spokesperson Amy Call said, ``Those questions      will have to be addressed to the EPA.''       Call said the budget office provided wording for the EPA to      use, but she declined to say why the White House opposed the      declaration and the public notification.       ``These are part of our internal discussions with EPA, and      we don't discuss predecisional deliberations,'' Call said.       Both agencies refused Freedom of Information Act requests      for documents to and from the White House Office of      Management and Budget.       The budget office was created in 1970 to evaluate all      budget, policy, legislative, regulatory, procurement and      management issues on behalf of the president.                        office interfered before       Former EPA administrator William Ruckelshaus, who worked      for Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, called the      decision not to notify homeowners of the     dangers posed by Zonolite insulation ``the wrong thing to      do.''       ``When the government comes across this kind of information      and doesn't tell people about it, I just think it's wrong,      unconscionable, not to do that,'' he said. ``Your first      obligation is to tell the people living in these homes of the      possible danger. They need the information so they can decide      what actions are best for their family. What right does the      government have to conceal these dangers? It just doesn't      make sense.''       But, he added, pressure on the EPA from the budget office      or the White House is not unprecedented.       Ruckelshaus, who became the EPA's first administrator when      the agency was created by Nixon in 1970, said he never was      called by the president directly to discuss agency decisions.      He said the same held true when he was called back to lead      the EPA by Reagan after Anne Gorsuch Burford's scandal-     plagued tenure.       Calls from a White House staff member or the Office of      Management and Budget were another matter.       ``The pressure could come from industry pressuring OMB or      if someone could find a friendly ear in the White House to      get them to intervene,'' Ruckelshaus said. ``These issues      like asbestos are so technical, often so convoluted, that      industry's best chance to stop us or modify what we wanted      to do would come from OMB.''       The question about what to do about Zonolite insulation was      not the only asbestos-related issue in which the White House      intervened.       In January, in an internal EPA report on problems with the      agency's much-criticized response to the terrorist attacks in      New York City, a section on ``lessons learned'' said there      was a need to release public health and emergency information      without having it reviewed and delayed by the White House.       ``We cannot delay releasing important public health      information,'' said the report. ``The political consequences      of delaying information are greater than the benefit of      centralized information management.''       It was the White House budget office's Office of      Information and Regulatory Affairs that derailed the Libby      declaration. The regulatory affairs office is headed by John      Graham, who formerly ran the Harvard Center for Risk      Analysis.       His appointment last year was denounced by environmental,      health and public advocacy groups, who claimed his ties to      industry were too strong. Graham passes judgment over all      major national health, safety and environmental standards.       Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., urged colleagues to vote against      Graham's appointment, saying Graham would have to recuse      himself from reviewing many rules because affected industries      donated to the Harvard University Center.       Thirty physicians, 10 of them from Harvard, according to      The Washington Post, wrote the committee asking that Graham      not be confirmed because of ``a persistent pattern of      conflict of interest, of obscuring and minimizing dangers to      human health with questionable cost-benefit analyses, and of      hostility to governmental regulation in general.''       Repeated requests for interviews with Graham or anyone else      involved in the White House budget office decision were      denied.                       ``It was like a gut shot''       Whitman, Horinko and some members of their top staff were      said to have been outraged at the White House intervention.       ``It was like a gut shot.'' said one of those senior      staffers involved in the decision. ``It wasn't that they      ordered us not to make the declaration, they just really,      really strongly suggested against it. Really strongly.      There was no choice left.''       She and other staff members said Whitman was personally      interested in Libby and the national problems spawned by its      asbestos-tainted ore. The EPA's inspector general had      reported that the agency hadn't taken action more than two      decades earlier when it had proof that the people of Libby      and those using asbestos-tainted Zonolite products were in      danger.       Whitman went to Libby in early September 2001 and promised      the people it would never happen again.       ``We want everyone who comes in contact with vermiculite--     from homeowners to handymen--to have the information to      protect themselves and their families,'' Whitman promised.                        suits, bankruptcies grow       Political pragmatists in the agency knew the administration      was angered that a flood of lawsuits had caused more than a      dozen major corporations--including W.R. Grace--to file for      bankruptcy protection. The suits sought billions of dollars      on behalf of people injured or killed from exposure to      asbestos in their products or workplaces.       Republicans on Capitol Hill crafted legislation--expected      to be introduced next month--to stem the flow of these suits.       Nevertheless, Whitman told her people to move forward with      the emergency declaration. Those in the EPA who respect their      boss fear that Whitman may quit.       She has taken heat for other White House decisions such as      a controversial decision on levels of arsenic in drinking      water, easing regulations to allow 50-year-old power plants      to operate without implementing modern pollution controls and      a dozen other actions which environmentalists say favor      industry over health.       Newspapers in her home state of New Jersey ran front page      stories this month saying Whitman had told Bush she wanted to      leave the agency.       Spokesman Martyak said his boss is staying on the job.                         EPA WAS POISED TO ACT       In October, the EPA complied with a freedom of Information      Act request and gave the Post-Dispatch access to thousands of      documents--in nine large file boxes. There were hundreds of      e-mails, scores of ``action memos'' describing the      declaration and piles of ``communication strategies'' for how      the announcement would be made.       The documents illustrated the internal and external battle      over getting the declaration and announcement released.       One of the most contentious concerns was the anticipated      national backlash from the Libby declaration. EPA officials      knew that if the agency announced that the insulation in      Montana was so dangerous that an emergency had to be      declared, people elsewhere whose homes contained the same      contaminated Zonolite would want answers or perhaps demand to      have their homes cleaned.       The language of the declaration was molded to stress how      unique Libby was and to play down the national problem.       But many in the agency's headquarters and regional offices      didn't buy it.       In a Feb. 22 memo, the EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention      and Toxics said ``the national ramifications are enormous''      and estimated that if only 1 million homes have Zonolite      ``(are) we not put in a position to remove their (insulation)      at a national cost of over $10 billion?''       The memo also questioned the agency's claim that the age of      Libby's homes and severe winter conditions in Montana      required a higher level of maintenance, which in turn meant      increased disturbance of the insulation in the homes there.       It's ``a shallow argument,'' the memo said. ``There are      older homes which exist in harsh or harsher conditions across      the country. Residents in Maine and Michigan might find this      argument flawed.''       No one knows precisely how many dwellings are insulated      with Zonolite. Memos from the EPA and the Agency for Toxic      Substances and Disease Registry repeatedly cite an estimate      of between 15 million and 35 million homes.       A government analysis of shipping records from W.R. Grace      show that at least 15.6 billion pounds of vermiculite ore was      shipped from Libby to 750 plants and factories throughout      North America.       Between a third and half of that ore was popped into      insulation and usually sold in 3-foot-high kraft paper bags.       Government extrapolations and interviews with former W.R.      Grace Zonolite salesmen indicate that Illinois may have as      many as 800,000 homes with Zonolite, Michigan as many as      700,000. Missouri is likely to have Zonolite in 380,000      homes.       With four processing plants in St. Louis, it is estimated      that more than 60,000 homes, offices and schools were      insulated with Zonolite in the St. Louis area alone.       Eventually, the internal documents show, acceptance grew      that the agency should declare a public health emergency.       In a confidential memo dated March 28, an EPA official said      the declaration was tentatively set for April 5.       But the declaration never came. Instead, Superfund boss      Horinko on May 9 quietly ordered that asbestos be removed      from contaminated homes in Libby. There was no national      warning of potential dangers from Zonolite. And there was no      promise of long-term medical care for Libby's ill and dying.      The presence of the White House budget office is noted      throughout the documents. The press announcement of the      watered-down decision was rewritten five times the day before      it was released to accommodate budget office wording      changes that played down the changes that played down the      dangers.                          dangers of zonolite       The asbestos in Zonolite, like all asbestos products, is      believed to be either a minimal risk or no risk if it is not      disturbed. The asbestos fibers must be airborne to be      inhaled. The fibers then become trapped in the lungs, where      they may cause asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma, a      fast-moving cancer of the lung's lining.       The EPA's files are filled with studies documenting the      toxicity of tremolite, how even minor disruptions of the      material by moving boxes, sweeping the floor or doing repairs      in attics can generate asbestos fibers.       This also has been confirmed by simulations W.R. Grace ran      in Weed-sport, N.Y. in July 1977; by 1997 studies by the      Canadian Department of National Defense; and by the U.S.      Public Health Service, which reported in 2000, that ``even      minimal handling by workers or residents poses a substantial      health risk.''       Last December, a study by Christopher Weis, the EPA's      senior toxicologist supporting the Libby project, reported      that ``the concentrations of asbestos fibers that occur in      air following disturbance of (insulation) may reach levels of      potential human health concerns.''       Most of those who have studied the needle-sharp tremolite      fibers in the Libby ore consider them far more dangerous than      other asbestos fibers.       In October, the EPA team leading the cleanup of lower      Manhattan after the attacks of Sept. 11 went to Libby to meet      with     Peronard and his crew. The EPA had reversed an early decision      and announced that it would be cleaning asbestos from city      apartments.       Libby has been a laboratory for doing just that.       Peronard told the visitors from New York just how dangerous      tremolite is. He talked about the hands-on research in Libby      of Dr. Alan Whitehouse, a pulmonologist who had worked for      NASA and the Air Force on earlier projects before moving      to Spokane, Wash.       ``Whitehouse's research on the people here gave us our      first solid lead of how bad this tremolite is,'' Peronard      said.       Whitehouse has not only treated 500 people from Libby who      are sick and dying from exposure to tremolite. The chest      specialist also has almost 300 patients from Washington      shipyards and the Hanford, Wash., nuclear facility who are      suffering health effects from exposure to the more prevalent      chrysotile asbestos.       Comparing the two groups, Whitehouse has demonstrated that      the tremolite from Libby is 10 times as carcinogenic as      chrysotile and probably 100 times more likely to produce      mesothelioma than chrysotile.       W.R. Grace has maintained that its insulation is safe. On      April 3 of this year, the company wrote a letter to Whitman      again insisting its product was safe and that no public      health declaration or nationwide warning was warranted.       Dr. Brad Black, who runs the asbestos clinic in Libby and      acts as health officer for Montana's Lincoln County, says      ``people have a right to be warned of the potential danger      they may face if they disturb that stuff.''       Marytak, chief EPA spokesman, argues that the agency has      informed the public of the potential dangers. ``It's on our      Web site,'' he said.       Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is sponsoring legislation to      ban asbestos in the United States. She said the Web site      warning is a joke.       ``EPA's answer that people have been warned because it's on      their Web site is ridiculous,'' she said. ``If you have a      computer, and you just happened to think about what's in your      attic, and you happen to be on EPA's Web page, then you get      to know. This is not the way the safety of the public is      handled.       ``We, the government, the EPA, the administration have a      responsibility to at least let people know the information so      they can protect themselves if they go into those attics,''      she said.
