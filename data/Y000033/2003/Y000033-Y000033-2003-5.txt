Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my strong support for H.R. 3198, ``The John F. Kennedy Center Reauthorization Act of 2003.''  The Kennedy Center serves an important role in our Nation. Not only is it one of the most active theaters in the world, hosting millions of patrons each year to its seven stages, but is also one of the most recognizable theater buildings.  The legislation we are considering this afternoon, which I have offered with my colleagues Mr. Oberstar, Mr. LaTourette, and Ms. Holmes-Norton, reauthorizes the Capital Infrastructure program of the Kennedy Center for an additional three years. The bill also makes a number of important changes that will improve the management of large construction projects at the Kennedy Center.  This legislation will help ensure that the Kennedy Center continues to have a world class facility to house world class entertainment, which includes everything from classical opera to cutting edge films.  In addition to authorizing funds for maintenance, repair, and security as well as other capital projects, this legislation puts into place important tools for improved project management.  The legislation creates a project team for the plaza project. This team will include the secretary of transportation, administrator of general services, and chairman of the board of trustees of The Kennedy Center. This team will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the plaza project through a project director, who reports to the project team and is appointed by the Secretary of Transportation.  The legislation also provides for ongoing review by the General Accounting Office of the plaza project until its completion, with periodic reporting to the Congress. The GAO will be looking at the personnel, policies and procedures used to carry out the project.  I support The Kennedy Center Reauthorization and encourage my colleagues to do the same.
