Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  What he didn't mention was the Benghazi Gowdy commission was the eighth Republican-led investigation of that matter. They all reached the same conclusion and found no evidence of wrongdoing; eight Republican-led, and they kept after it, over and over and over again.  Why? As the minority leader said, on television, well, no, we got something out of it. We got some dirt on Hillary Clinton.  I don't think it was dirt. It was the use of a computer which, by the way, some of the Trump family is doing the same thing--somewhat irrelevant.  What is relevant is not all this stuff about fairness and this, that, and the other. We are following the Constitution. We are following the rules of this House. We are following the law, and every legal scholar that I have read asserts that. The only people who don't assert that are the people who are afraid of the facts, afraid of what has been done.  I asked the gentleman questions: Do you think this is right? Do you think the President is above the law? He mentions the Mueller report.  What he fails to mention and he just ignores is the Mueller report said there was evidence to suggest that there was the failure to follow the law and cooperate with the law, in other words, obstruction of justice. But he said Justice Department rules, of which he was an employee, do not provide for the ability to indict a President of the United States. That did not mean that there wasn't obstruction of justice.  But what he said was this is the body to deal with this matter. So we are following our constitutional duty, and we are going to continue to do so, and there are going to be public hearings. There is going to be debate. There is going to be a vote on the rule if something is brought to the floor and full opportunity to debate on both sides of the aisle.  Right now, of course, there are members of the committee--you would think this was somehow Mr. Schiff and the Democrats meeting in some secret room. They are meeting with the Republican members of the committee.  And, by the way, I asked the gentleman the question about Mr. Nunes. But Mr. Nunes, apparently, comes sometimes and he doesn't come sometimes. And Mr. Meadows is apparently always there, so he can always tell you what is going on. This is an endless debate.  If the Republicans think we are violating the law, of course they can go to court, as we have been forced to do by this President who has instructed people not to cooperate with Congress, not to testify before the Congress because he feels aggrieved.  He will have his day in court. That is how we run these kinds of events in America: under our Constitution, under our laws. And, yes, he will have due process.  But right now we are trying to find out whether there is probable cause to believe the President of the United States committed high crimes and misdemeanors and abused the power of his office, as Hamilton said the purpose of the impeachment provision was designed to address. Hamilton said that in two of the Federalist Papers.  But we are going to endlessly talk about fairness, with Republicans sitting in the committee. He asserts, with no knowledge, that somehow the Democratic members of the committee released this information.  I am not sure how the paper got this information. I know they get almost all the information on all these networks. But this was the testimony that was prepared by the witness who was there--who was there.  He talks about the whistleblower and hearsay, but what he doesn't talk about: Does he believe the President is above the law? Does he believe it is appropriate?  And the transcript--I could read it again. I keep saying ``transcript.'' It is not a transcript. A report of the phone call that the President thought was okay, that is why he released it. He thought it was perfect.  In addition, he said: The other thing, there is a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecutor, and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General--he wants his lawyer. It should be the Justice Department's lawyer, but Mr. Barr to participate. And, of course, he wanted Mr. Giuliani to participate as well.  So, Mr. Speaker, I would conclude, we are going down this rat hole too long. We are going to have hearings. We are going to find out the truth, and we are finding out the truth every day, and every day our Republican colleagues get more nervous.  Every day there is some Republican who says: I don't know how long I can defend President Trump. Every day that is happening now, because the facts are coming out.  When you don't have the facts, as I have said, Mr. Speaker, you attack the process. Republicans know the facts aren't on their side. They can't answer the fundamental question: Is it acceptable for a President to seek foreign interference in elections?  They will say: Oh, there is no proof of that. And the problem they have is almost every day there is proof of that, not hearsay.  Yes, the whistleblower did the right thing. The whistleblower heard something that he felt was dangerous to our national security, to our men and women in uniform, and to the democracy that we hold so dear, and so he said something. You have seen the signs: You see something, say something. He heard this.  One could say, well, he didn't hear it, but then the President admitted it. Then the Chief of Staff, Acting Chief of Staff, Mr. Mulvaney, said, yes, that is what we did. And he instructed, don't get that money to the Ukrainians.  Those are facts. We know those are facts.  So I tell my friend, we really ought to conclude this. We believe we are following the law. If you don't feel we are following the law, go to court, just as we had to go to court with the President refusing to cooperate with the Congress of the United States in its constitutional duty.                                {time}  1915  And we are going to be fair, and I am sure the Senate will be fair if we take action here. And I don't know that we are going to take action. That hasn't been decided. But we are going to continue to try to find the truth, to try to get to the bottom of what has happened.  I, frankly, think what we did in Turkey in that Erdogan phone call is as damaging to the interests of the United States of America. And the President talks about the public. The public ought to know.  I want any Member of the Congress I will yield to to tell me what the deal was between Putin and Trump when they met in private and refused to tell anybody.  Mr. Trump is great at disclosure. He says, I have nothing to hide in my tax returns. I will show my tax returns. That was 3 years ago. We have, by law, requested those returns. It has been denied. It has been denied.  No openness. No, Mr. and Mrs. America, this is what my interests are. I am acting in your interests, not in mine. Doral. He decided that was too much, and Republicans criticized him.  And, Mr. Speaker, on Turkey we had a vote in this House. He was really angry about that vote. 354 people of this House said this is wrong, Mr. President, this is harmful to our allies. You are exposing allies that we asked to participate to confront terrorists. You are letting them out perhaps to be murdered and slaughtered. 354-to-60. We voted on that.  We need to deal with the facts. And we are going to find out the facts no matter how hard the Republicans want to pound on the table and talk about process and ignore any discussion on the substance of what is being disclosed.  So, Mr. Speaker, we can conclude this colloquy because it is not going to come to any end. I understand the gentleman's perception. I think he is misrepresenting each time he says that this is not a fair procedure or that this is not a procedure consistent with the rules that the Republicans adopted in their rules package when they were in the majority.  So I hope that we can move on, decide what the facts are, have a committee recommendation as is the process of this House and then have a vote on the floor of the House, if such is required, and the committees decide that moving forward is appropriate under the facts adduced by those committees.
