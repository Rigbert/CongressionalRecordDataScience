Speaker, I rise today to recognize an historic occasion. Memorial United Church of Christ in East Toledo celebrates its 100th anniversary this month.  In early 1899, Mr. J. Herman Overbeck was inspired to form a mission church of the First Reformed Church. On May 7, 1899, shortly after Mr. Overbeck's death, Reform Church leaders including Reverend Henry Gersmann, Eberhard Gerkens, John Olrich, Frederick Dahn, August Overbeck, Karl Benner, and Wilhelm Dahlmeyer came together as a committee to bring Mr. Overbeck's dream to fruition. The fully paid building was formally dedicated on November 12, 1899, the church's official anniversary date. Services were conducted and a church school was organized. On Palm Sunday, April 18, 1900, the German Evangelical Reformed Memorial Church was formally organized with 37 original members. The membership flourished with the neighborhood, and in 1920 the congregation decided to build a new church. The new building was dedicated on February 26, 1922. In 1943, Memorial Church became independent, no longer a mission church. The church grew large in both membership and property. Both the neighborhood and the church began to change in the 1970's, and Memorial grew with these changes as well. Women were allowed a more active role in the church beginning in the 1970's and 1980's, serving as deacons and church elders. The 1990's have brought Reverend Jena Garrison as Pastor, and a renewed spirit among members. Generations of families now attend the church together, as it has moved from a neighborhood church to a family church.  Throughout its century of worship, the congregants of Memorial United Church of Christ have lived the Ecclesiastes verse ``To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under Heaven . . .'' As the seasons changed into decades and then a century, the congregation has grown, flourished, and redirected itself. It was born at the twilight of the last century, yet is poised on the dawn of the new century to continue to meet the spiritual needs of the faithful. Its future is challenged by its promise as the congregation of Memorial United Church of Christ recalls their journey: the road, the people, the vision and the faith which brought them to this milestone.                          ____________________
