 It is not only that mistakes are made; it is that when you don't open the doors to the American people, to economists, to mayors, to Governors, to businesspeople, and to leaders in the labor movement to see what do you want in tax reform--when you don't do that--and when you conduct your business behind closed doors, you end up with legislation that represents the needs of the billionaire class, which also makes a number of mistakes.  In that regard, I would tell my friend that this afternoon, the Senate Parliamentarian advised that certain provisions of the Republican tax legislation violate the Byrd rule, including a provision allowing for the use of 529 savings accounts for home schooling expenses; the short title--the Tax Cut and Jobs Act--and part of the criteria used to determine whether the endowments of private universities are subject to the legislation's new excise tax.
