  I think there is not much of an environmental debate, I would say to my very good friend, the gentleman from Ohio, that there are certain locations in the country, given the fact that we have low-level waste, that can from an environmental point of view absorb and sustain that waste better than others. There is no question about it.                              {time}  1700  The gentleman is wrong, I believe, and I think most environmentalists and geologists would tell the gentleman that he is wrong by saying that it is good environmental policy to force communities which, from a geological point of view, would have a very difficult time containing that waste. I do not think that there is much argument about that.  The difference that we have is, the gentleman is opposed to nuclear power. I am opposed to it. But the reality is, we have waste. The environmental challenge is, how do we get rid of that waste in the most effective and safe way?  The gentleman from Ohio seems to think if it gets into a truck, that is more dangerous than if we store it in an unsound environmental location. I would strongly disagree and would argue that I think most geologists and environmentalists would also disagree.
