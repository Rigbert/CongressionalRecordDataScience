There is a very good answer. That is no. In fact, the regulatory overkill of the Clinton administration has already exceeded the savings projected by the balanced budget amendment. Medicare for home health fell nearly 15 percent last year, and CBO now projects the reductions in home health care will exceed $46 billion over the next 5 years. That is almost three times greater than the $16 billion estimate that the Congressional Budget Office originally estimated.  It is yet another indication that these cuts are far too deep, and that they are hurting far too many people completely unnecessarily. They have been far too severe and much more far reaching than Congress ever intended when it was trying to bring a measure of fiscal restraint to the Medicare Program.
