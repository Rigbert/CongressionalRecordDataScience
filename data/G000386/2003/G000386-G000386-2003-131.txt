 President, reserving the right to object--and I will object--first of all, we have advanced this bill according to the rules of the Senate with the provisions that are necessary to go to conference. I am disappointed we don't have that opportunity to go to conference. This will not be our last effort to try to get to conference.  I appreciate the unanimous consent request by my friend from Nevada, the assistant minority leader, because I know he is sincere in proceeding along the lines he would like to proceed. But I think it does suggest that there is a nervousness on the other side as to the rightness of my original request and that we ought to get this to conference.  The conference could be settled very quickly. We could get the bill back here and for charitable organizations and for military families, and also try to help low-income families with refundable tax credits, as has been the position of the Senate for a long period of time.  I also suggest he may be legitimately concerned about how the other body handles conferences. I appreciate his understanding that I try to be fair. But in the process, comity dictates that what the other body does the other body does, and we have to work within the environment of what we can control. What we can control is what the Senate does. Along those lines, I have made my commitment that there be full Democrat participation, and that is about as far as I can go.  So I object to the unanimous consent request by the Senator from Nevada, the assistant minority leader.
