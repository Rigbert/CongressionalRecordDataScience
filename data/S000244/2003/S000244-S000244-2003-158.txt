Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the Senate bill (S. 1435) to provide for the analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape in Federal, State, and local institutions and to provide information, resources, recommendations, and funding to protect individuals from prison rape, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
