Chair, the gentleman wants to ensure that funds are being expended on climate and sustainability executive orders issued by the President.  Simply put, the President did not consult Congress on these executive orders. We would not be doing our job if we allowed this President or any President to unilaterally make policy decisions without allowing Congress to weigh in with appropriate policy debates.  In the meantime, we must use our congressional power of the purse to rein in executive branch overreach, which is exactly what we are going to do.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
