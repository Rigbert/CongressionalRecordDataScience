Speaker, to say that the Republicans are saving Medicare is like saying Colonel Sanders is saving the lives of chickens. Republicans are cutting Medicare with their budget today. They are lowering the amount of money available. They know there will not be enough as the population grows of seniors needing Medicare and health care costs go up.  So as they talk about more money for Medicare, sure, they are tossing a 25-foot rope to someone 30-feet offshore drowning. They say that is compassion.  So why are the Republicans cutting Medicare and Social Security in their budget? It is simple. To give tax breaks to wealthy Americans. It is a tax break plan that even 100 Republicans wrote their leadership and said, please do not do this; it is unfair. But Speaker Gingrich pushed it through, and now with this ironclad discipline, the Republicans will be voting for it today.  I hope America tunes into this debate. What is at stake is not only health care for seniors and their out-of-pocket costs, but for a lot of working families with senior parents and grandparents this debate gets right to your pocketbook.                          ____________________
