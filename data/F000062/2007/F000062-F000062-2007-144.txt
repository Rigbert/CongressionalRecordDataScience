 It does. It pulls together all of us. We believe we have 60 votes in this body for AgJOBS because we believe there are 60 Senators at least who understand what the problem is, there is no question about it.  Senator Boxer has been on this issue for at least 7 years. Senator Craig, the Senator from Idaho, was the original sponsor of AgJOBS, along with Senator Boxer and Senator Kennedy. That was 7 years ago. Is that not correct, I ask the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig?
