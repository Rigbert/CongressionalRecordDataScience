President, the statement notes the President's deep commitment to volunteer and service activities, indeed his AmeriCorps initiation and participation at the summit are both noteworthy examples of his commitment. The statement notes as I have the overbroad definitions in the bill and its unnecessary takeover of State law, among other serious problems.  The principal sponsor came to the floor this morning to say that the Ku Klux Klan is not included within the bill's definition of nonprofit organizations that would be covered by its provisions. Unfortunately, he did not say why. Wishing does not change the words of the bill.  To my colleagues who believe S. 543 could not immunize the Ku Klux Klan from liability, let me refer you to a letter to me from Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center. As many of us know, this organization has been on the front lines in the battle against hate groups like the KKK. The Southern Poverty Law Center is acutely aware, probably more so that most of my colleagues, of the hateful acts perpetrated by groups like the KKK. Yet the Senate is considering a bill that would potentially bestow liability immunity upon the KKK.  I know that every one of my colleagues violently opposes the KKK and would not support liability protection for them, but because we have not been given adequate time to consider this bill, flawed provisions like this overbroad definition remain.  The definition of nonprofit organizations includes the Government and not-for-profit organizations. Not-for-profit organizations appear to be self-defined to include any organization ``conducted for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes.''  Who decides which groups qualify for limited liability under this definition and what happens when groups like the KKK declare themselves a noncommercial, nonprofit volunteer organization?  The Southern Poverty Law Center realizes this and opposes S. 543 because they know the Senate bill before us would make it more difficult to prosecute hate groups like the KKK. To quote Morris Dees, the highly respected director of the Southern Poverty Law Center:       We strongly urge you to withdraw this legislation and vote      against any law that limits the ability of our civil justice      system to punish those people and organizations that inflict      unspeakable injuries on our friends, neighbors, family      members and communities. Please, do not help protect white      supremacists, neo-Nazi organizations, violence-prone militia      groups and others who commit hate crimes.  Mr. President, I don't know about my colleagues, but when Morris Dees speaks, I think we should pause and listen. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Dees' letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      The Southern                                           Poverty Law Center,                                   Montgomery, AL, April 29, 1997.     Sen. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The Southern Poverty Law Center opposes      Senate Bill 543, legislation that would make it more      difficult to sue non-profit organizations. Because the bill      broadly covers all non-profit organizations, it would protect      white supremacists, neo-Nazi and violent militia groups.      These are the types of organizations the Southern Poverty Law      Center has crippled over the past ten years through the use      of both federal and state tort laws.       Senate Bill 543 raises the standard of care and the      standard of proof in punitive damages cases, making it harder      for the victims of hate activity and racial attacks to punish      wrongdoers. For example, it would allow punitive damages      against non-profit organizations or its volunteers if their      misconduct constituted ``willful or criminal misconduct, or a      conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of      the individual harmed.'' However, misconduct that constitutes      ``gross neligence'' or ``recklessness'' would be exempt from      such damages. In other words, if a cross burning were legally      held on Ku Klux Klan property and a larger fire ensued,      spreading to a neighbor's home and killing the neighbor, the      KKK would be immune from punitive damages if its conduct      constituted ``recklessness'' or ``gross negligence.''       The bill does contain a number of narrow exceptions for      volunteers, including misconduct that constitutes a crime of      violence, hate crime, sexual offense or civil rights      violation. However, these kinds of misconduct are only exempt      from the bill's restrictions if the defendant was first      convicted in a criminal court. Our cases against Klan and      White Aryan Resistance leaders would not have fallen under      Senate Bill 543's exemptions, since these individuals had no      prior criminal convictions. Moreover, the $12.5 million      judgment we obtained against the White Aryan Resistance,      which put this group out of business, consisted mostly of      punitive damages which may have been subject to Senate Bill      543's limitations.       Important questions relating to a non-profit organization's      responsibility and conduct are liability issues judges and      juries should decide, not Congress. We strongly support your      opposition to this legislation that would limit the ability      of our civil justice system to punish those people and      organizations that inflict unspeakable injuries on our      friends, neighbors, family members and communities. Thank you      for not helping to protect white supremacists, neo-Nazi      organizations, violence-prone militia groups and others who      commit hate crimes.           Sincerely,                                                      Morris Dees.
