Speaker, although I had not intended to include this, let me say ``amen'' to the remarks of the gentleman from Florida. He is absolutely right. We ought to get a handle on that.  The gentleman from Michigan who preceded him was absolutely wrong, however. He talks about reducing bureaucracy.  This administration, ladies and gentlemen, has reduced bureaucracy by 272,000 over the next 6 years, actually the next 4 years. We have already reduced over 100,000 Federal employees. This administration, contrary to the previous two administrations, is not just talking about it, and has saved $30 billion in Federal expenses, which is funding the crime bill.  Whether you take the 1994 Crime Act, which I think was a smart and tough crime act, or the crime act that passed this House, both relied on the reductions in Federal employees that this administration, in its reinvention of Government, of doing more with less, has led and the Congress has supported.                          ____________________
