 President, the amendment I am offering has the support of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and AMVETS, and it is cosponsored by Senator Menendez.  In a $109 billion piece of legislation, this $20 million amendment is not significant from a monetary perspective. It is, however, very significant in terms of the message we send to veterans throughout our country, especially disabled veterans, the men and women who have lost arms and legs defending us, who move around in wheelchairs, who are blind and/or deaf.  In the 1990s, as a temporary measure, Congress initiated the so-called rounding down of veterans' disability benefits. Under this rounding-down process, a disabled veteran who is supposed to receive, for example, a check for $200.99 has that 99 cents taken away from him and only gets the $200.  A veteran in a wheelchair opens his envelope check every month and is reminded that the United States Government is saving 99 cents a month. What a message that sends to the veterans.  This is an important amendment. It should be adopted.
