 President, I think we went through similar debate and a vote yesterday on an approach by the senior Senator from West Virginia. So here we are again.  In March, we heard from people on the other side of the aisle that we need an economic stimulus immediately. And now we see an amendment--and it isn't just this amendment; it is amendment after amendment--seeking to delay the tax reduction.  This is another attempt to delay a tax cut until other programs are passed. We are working on making sure that Social Security and Medicare are solvent. Our budget agreement of 2 weeks ago speaks to that. And that does not mean we cannot provide tax relief for American taxpayers, and do it right now.  I strongly urge the defeat of the amendment.  Mr. President, this amendment is not germane to the provisions of the reconciliation bill before us. I raise a point of order against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.
