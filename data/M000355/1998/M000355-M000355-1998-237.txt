 President, I had earlier offered to enter into a much shorter time agreement, because this amendment really requires very little explanation.  Last year, in the Treasury-Postal bill, we enacted term limits for the FEC Commissioners, and the terms of the Federal Election Commission members, Mr. President, are now one 6-year term.  This amendment continues the necessary reform of the Federal Election Commission by providing that two critical staff members at the Federal Election Commission--the staff director and the general counsel--serve a 4-year term, but it is important to note, these important staff members could continue to serve with the vote of four of the six FEC Commissioners. It is important to remember the FEC is a 3-3 Commission, three Republicans, three Democrats. It was structured that way on purpose. It is necessary that it be structured that way.  A very important part of the Federal Election Commission team is the staff director and the general counsel. Under the amendment that I have offered, cosponsored by Senator McCain, Senator Bennett and Senator Warner, the chairman of the Rules Committee, beginning in January, the general counsel and the staff director will be subject to a 4-year term, and in order to achieve that 4-year term, Mr. President, they would have to enjoy the confidence of both parties; that is, they would have to achieve four votes which means at least three of one party and one of another----
