Speaker, what happened on the floor of the other body yesterday is a shame and a disgrace. Leaders of this country must be headlights and not taillights. Leaders must lead.  More than 91 percent of the American people say they want us to put strong background checks in place before someone can buy a gun in this country. This is not about preserving Second Amendment rights; it is about saving lives.  How many more little babies, how many more little children, how many more American citizens must die of gun violence?  How many more funerals must we attend before we act?  The blood of the innocent is crying out to us. Where is our courage?  What happened to our heart?  When will we have the guts to do what is right?  We need to pass a strong gun bill, and pass it now.
