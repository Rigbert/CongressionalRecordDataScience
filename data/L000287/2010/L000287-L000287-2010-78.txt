Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, March 30, an Atlanta icon passed away. Robert Hiestand sold roses and carnations on the corner of Northside Parkway and West Paces Ferry for 20 years and, in the process, became a ubiquitous fixture in the daily routine of Atlantans from all walks of life. He was 55 when he passed.  Over the years, Governors, state legislators and Members of Congress including myself have stopped for a few kind words and a few beautiful flowers from Robert. Yet it is the students who often saw him on their way back and forth from school that have most loudly opined his loss.  I have heard a few different versions of how Robert ended up in Atlanta but the version he told was that his motorcycle ran out of gas as he was passing through and he decided to stay. For two decades after that, come rain, come summer heat, come winter cold, come what may, Robert's only condition to go to work was whether the flowers could survive.  The vibrant remembrances of the Atlanta community reflect the tremendous impact of his character, of his hard work and of his staunch individualism that allowed him to carve out his own niche and leave a lasting impression on the lives of so many. He will be missed and I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring his contribution to Atlanta.                          ____________________
