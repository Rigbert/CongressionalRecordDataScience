 President, today Representative Lois Capps and I are introducing legislation to help teachers use technology in their teaching, the Teacher Technology Training Act of 2001.  This bill has three major provisions:  It authorizes $100 million for state education departments to award grants to local public school districts on the basis of need to train teachers in how to use technology in the classroom.  It specifies that grants may be used to strengthen instruction and learning, provide professional development, and pay the costs of teacher training in using technology in the classroom.  It requires the Secretary of Education to evaluate the technology training programs for teachers developed by school districts within three years.  This bill is needed because teachers say they need to learn how to use computers and other technology in their teaching. A 1999 Education Week poll found that 27 percent of teachers have had no training in computers, 31 percent have had one to five hours, and 17 percent have had six to ten hours. This means that 75 percent of teachers have had less than ten hours of training in how to use computers. In a 1999 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, only 23 percent of teachers said they felt ``well prepared'' to integrate educational technology into instruction. ``Most teachers want to learn, but they say it takes time and they need help,'' says Linda Roberts, Director of Educational Technology, U.S. Department of Education.  In many schools, the students know more about how to use computers than the teachers do. In one Kentucky school profiled by Inside Technology Training magazine, the students run the school's computer systems. The article quoted the school district's technology coordinator as saying that the students had ``long surpassed'' what the teachers could do and reported that one student had recently trained twenty teachers on software for Web page construction (``Fast Times at Kentucky High,'' Inside Technology training, June 1998).  In addition to helping teachers teach, technology proficiency is becoming crucial to survival. Most good jobs require experience using computers. Former U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley has said, ``Opportunities are now dependent upon a person's ability to use computers and engage in using the Internet,'' CQ Weekly, ``Digital Haves and Have Nots,'' April 17, 1999.  The economy of California is a case in point as it shifts away from manufacturing and toward higher-skill service and technology industries. Employers are placing a high premium on the computer skills necessary for these positions. Students are better prepared when their teachers are well trained. We cannot educate students for the increasingly technological workplace without trained teachers.  We have made great efforts to make technology available to students in their classrooms. Eighty percent of California's schools have Internet access.  But computers are of little value if people do not know how to use them and in school, they can become diversions or entertainment, instead of learning tools without trained teachers.  If we expect teachers to be effective, we must give them up-to-date skills, knowledge, and tools. This includes training.  By introducing this bill, I am not suggesting that technology is a cure-all for the problems in our schools. Technology is one of many teaching and learning tools. It can bring some efficiencies to learning, for example, providing a new way to do math and spelling drills, making learning to write easier, providing easier access to information that without a computer is time-consuming and cumbersome to obtain.  We expect a great deal from our teachers and students. We must give them the resources they need. This bill is one step.                                 ______                                       By
