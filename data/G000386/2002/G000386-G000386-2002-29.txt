 President, I rise today to place a hold on the nomination of Ms. Maura Harty to be Director of the Office of Consular Affairs within the Department of State. Ms. Harty was voted out of the Committee on Foreign Relations today by voice vote. My reason for placing a hold on this nomination is to hear from Ms. Harty regarding a number of controversial cases that were under her jurisdiction as an employee of the Office of Consular Affairs.  First, I am seeking to know more about cases of international child abductions, which have left many parents frustrated with our Government. Many parents do not believe that Ms. Harty, in her capacity as the Managing Director of the Office of Overseas Citizens Services, vigorously pursued the interest of American abducted children.  Second, I wish to convey my concerns about personal appearance waiver programs, such as Visa Express. I am seeking assurance from the nominee that visa issuing procedures will be improved, and future recommendations from the inspector general will be seriously considered by the Office of Consular Affairs.  Finally, I intend to question the nominee on allegations that she fired an employee for blowing the whistle on a Foreign Service national who committed visa fraud. I have been a longtime champion for protecting the rights of those who shed light on the problems in our Government, so I take these allegations very seriously and look forward to hearing from Ms. Harty regarding this matter.                          ____________________
