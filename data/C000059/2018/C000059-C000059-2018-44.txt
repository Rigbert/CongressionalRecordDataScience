Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment. Suing the government and settling has become a lucrative business that is supported by taxpayer dollars. The Endangered Species Act, for example, has become wrapped around the axle of the judicial system by excessive litigation.  We are essentially paying people to sue the Federal Government. This needs to stop.  Mr. Chairman, I urge an ``aye'' vote on the amendment.
