Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me just say that over the last 6 or 7 years under the leadership of the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell] and the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Markey], our subcommittee has held more than 20 hearings to examine the kinds of fraud that this amendment deals with.                              {time}  1630  That has been the bipartisan tradition in the Committee on Commerce. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Fields] for continuing that bipartisan tradition. I think this is going to help reduce the kind of problems that make for securities litigation.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
