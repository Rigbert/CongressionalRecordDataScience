Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside County, California are exceptional. Riverside County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Ben Wicke is one of these individuals. On Tuesday, November 25, 2014, Ben was honored for his service with the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District Board of Directors.  For twenty years, Ben has faithfully served his community. After being first elected to the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District Board of Directors in 1994, Ben ran unopposed in 1998 and was selected by the County Board of Supervisors to fulfill a four year term. In 2002, Ben again ran unopposed, and was appointed to carry out another four year term. Throughout his tenure on the Board, Ben's heralded leadership was often called upon, serving as President in 1997, 2000, 2004, 2007 and finally, in 2011. In addition, Ben also represented the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District Board of Directors to several community organizations. These include Western Municipal Water District, the Eastern Municipal Water District, the Canyon Lake Water Sub-Committee and the Quail Valley Coalition Corporation.  Due to his combined passions for water and for the residents and communities of Southern California, Ben also volunteers his time throughout the region on additional Boards of Directors. Since 1995, Ben has held a seat on the Meeks and Daley Mutual Water Company Board of Directors, working as its President since 2001. The Association of California Water Agencies Region 9 Board of Directors also utilizes Ben's talents as he represents all of the water agencies in San Bernardino, Imperial, and Riverside counties in the advancement of legislative and regulatory priorities. Ben has always emphasized working with officials throughout the state to develop plans that would effectively manage one of our most important natural resources--water.  In light of all that Ben Wicke has done for the community of Lake Elsinore, it is only fitting that he be honored for his many years of dedicated service. Ben's tireless passion for conservation and public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community. I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
