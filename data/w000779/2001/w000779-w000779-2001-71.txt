President, when Americans see people in need, their first instinct is to help. It is the kind of attitude that makes our Nation great. But imagine if you had the knowledge and the tools to help someone in need--but weren't permitted to lend a hand.  Health care professionals all across our country are prevented from donating their services in the free clinics that serve those most desperate for medical care, because these practitioners do not have malpractice coverage that will cover their work in volunteer clinics. Today, I urge Secretary Tommy Thompson and his Department of Health and Human Services to finish a job that Congress started 5 years ago and solve this problem once and for all.  For several years now, doctors and dentists in Oregon have been calling me, saying they want to give back to their communities by volunteering in free clinics, but are not allowed to do so. I also have been contacted by an organization--Volunteers in Medicine--that operates free clinics across the country. They know of many health care providers who want to volunteer but cannot.  When Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, in 1996, one small provision was included, aimed at helping health care providers who wanted to volunteer in free clinics but were concerned about malpractice claims. Section 194 of HIPAA would let free clinicsapply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to have health providers certified and given immunity from malpractice claims.  This small provision could be a big help to the uninsured and those who count on free clinics for health care. The problem is, this provision of HIPAA has been overlooked and regulations for this section--detailing how the legislation should be implemented--were never written.  I am sending a letter to Secretary Thompson calling on him to get those regulations written and published as soon as possible. This should not be difficult. Legislation passed in 1992, which extended the Tort Claims Act coverage to volunteers in community health centers, can serve as a model.  Congress did the right thing in 1996 in recognizing this problem, but we need to finish the job. Two things need to happen now. We need those regulations published, and Congress needs to appropriate funding for the provision.  This will not solve the problems of the more than 40 million Americans without health insurance, but it sure could make a big difference in making care more accessible. It could make a big difference in the lives of the many health professionals who want to give back to their communities.  I again want to urge Secretary Thompson today to get these regulations published as soon as possible. For my part, I intend to stay on the job to assure his Department has funding for this provision.                          ____________________
