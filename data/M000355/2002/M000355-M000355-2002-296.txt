 The Senator has 5 minutes.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will not need to use the whole 5 minutes. Let me restate what this is about. This is about working families with children and disabled people who are eligible for food stamps. It has been suggested by my friend and colleague from Iowa that the amount involved for those people would not be noticed. I would respectfully suggest that $16 a month for a family of four will be noticed and that the loss of thirteen-hundredths of 1 percent on the loan rate will not be noticed by the farmers.  This is an amendment that ought to be approved. As I said earlier, it is supported by a vast array of groups led by the Children's Defense Fund that believes it is necessary to bring this program up to the level that it ought to achieve when looking into the future.  I hope that the Harkin second-degree amendment will be defeated and that the underlying McConnell amendment, supported by the Children's Defense Fund and an array of different organizations, which I listed a few moments ago, will be approved.  Again, this is about $16 a month for working families with children and the disabled, paid for by a thirteen-hundredths of 1 percent reduction in loan rates.  I think this is a tradeoff that every farmer in America would understand. I consider myself a friend of farmers as well. I will bet there is not a farmer in Kentucky who wouldn't think this is an appropriate step to take.  Is the Senator from Iowa out of time?
