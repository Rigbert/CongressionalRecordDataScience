Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  First of all, let me say two things:  We are confronting, in my view, an unprecedented refusal of an administration to cooperate with the Congress in the exercise of its constitutional duties. I refer specifically to the issuance of subpoenas, either for testimony or for documentary evidence, so the Congress can properly exercise its oversight responsibilities under the Constitution.  I have been here for some almost four decades, and I have never seen any administration, essentially, direct across the board no response to the Congress of the United States or to its committees. So, yes, we are pursuing.  The gentleman referred to the contempt citation dealing with Mr. Barr and Mr. Ross. Now, the issue at the center of that, as the gentleman knows, is the administration ultimately decided it would not pursue the policies that were the subject of that investigation. However, it is not about the specific, but it is about the general constitutional responsibility that this Congress has to the American people.  We ask for information not on behalf of ourselves individually, but on behalf of the American people, so they will know what their government is doing, there will be a transparency to the operations of government, and they will be able to determine whether or not any administrative official, or the administration generally, is acting on its behalf personally or whether it is acting on behalf of the American people.  So, from that perspective, I think the resolutions that we have offered, of which there, essentially, have been two dealing with this issue, and maybe more, the refusal to cooperate with subpoenas has continued.  I hope the gentleman will understand that we are trying to protect the responsibilities and authority of the Congress of the United States, the people's body, the article I body, to do its duty properly.  Secondly, yes, we did have a very difficult day yesterday. But I will tell my friend from Louisiana that I think it is the absolute responsibility of this body to respond if it sees things that are being done by the administration or by others that it perceives to be contrary to the ideas of this country, contrary to the declaration that we believe that all men and, yes, all women are created equal; contrary to the extraordinary wrenching war that we had among the States to determine that all were equal. And a construction period.  And then, as I grew up in the 1950s and the 1960s, looking racism in the face and saying, we reject it, that we reject racism, we reject prejudices, we reject simplifying if people are a certain color, a certain race, a certain nationality, or a certain gender, that somehow, they are less than other Americans. I think it is our responsibility to confront that.  That is what we did yesterday. It was difficult, I understand. I was sorry that it was not a bipartisan vote, because Idon't believe that Members on your side of the aisle want to tolerate racism any more than we want to tolerate racism. And if we see it, I think we have a responsibility to speak out, to stand up, and to say this is not right in America, this is not America.  So, yes, we had a resolution yesterday that the gentlemen refers to in response to a tweet. It was not the tweet, it was what the tweet said, what it implied, what it diminished in terms of America's sense of decency and equality and tolerance and inclusion for our people.  Now, let me go to legislation. As the gentleman knows, we have passed substantial pieces of legislation.  We passed H.R. 1. No Republicans voted for that, but it seeks to make it easier for people to vote in America, make sure their vote is protected and counted.  It made sure that we have transparency in the financing of campaigns.  It made sure that our redistricting was fair to our citizens and that we politicians were not drawing the districts, but that the districts are drawn in fairness to the American people.  It also demanded ethics performance.  But then we passed an anti-hate resolution. It was just words, but it said no to hate: 173 Republicans voted for that. It overwhelming passed bipartisan.  We passed a Land and Water Conservation Fund that made that fund permanent, a very important bill for a State like Louisiana and, quite frankly, my own State of Maryland, who are all surrounded by water, have a lot of water. That bill got 133 Republicans. It languishes still in the Senate.  We passed the SECURE Act, which makes it easier for people to get retirement security. That was supported by 187 Republicans.  We passed the violence against women reauthorization. Unfortunately, it didn't get overwhelming votes, but it got 33 Republicans voting for it. It languishes in the Senate.  We passed a provision that said we want to protect preexisting conditions in the Affordable Care Act. We got 8 Republicans. I would have wished we had gotten more.  We passed disaster relief. The gentleman knows a lot about disaster relief, important to his State. Unfortunately, we only got 34 Republicans, but it was a bipartisan bill.  We have also passed background checks, which are supported by 90 percent of the American people, to try to make gun violence lessened in the United States of America. For that bill, we only got 8 Republicans.  But those two bills, supported by 90 percent of the American people, languishes in the United States Senate, the majority leader not bringing up that legislation.  We passed a national emergency resolution, which said, Mr. President, you can't take money that we appropriated for X and just send it over to Y. That was, I thought, a protection of our constitutional authority. The Constitution says we raise, and we spend money and we direct the executive--we direct the executive--how to do that. That got 13 Republicans supporting it, a major piece of legislation.  We passed a Dreamer legislation. We have been asking for that legislation for almost a decade, or at least 6 years, I should say. And that legislation got no vote over the last 5 years. It got a vote this year. We got a number of Republicans--7 to be exact--to vote for that.  Now, I could go through a number of other pieces of legislation, including, lastly, the minimum wage bill. This was about capitalism, not socialism. We are capitalists over here. We believe in the free market system over here. And any assertion to the contrary, Madam Speaker, is absolutely false.  It is a good political tactic, it is a scare tactic, Madam Speaker, but I reject it out of hand. We believe in the free market system. We believe the free market system has been the system that has provided the most benefits for the broadest number of people.                              {time}  1230  We believe that is one of the great facets of our democracy, our free market system. And I will tell my friend, Madam Speaker, that it was Democrats in the 1930s that saved the free market system. It was Democrats in December of 2007 that came in and made sure that the free market system did not crash after 8 years of Republican leadership.  I would hope that the gentleman would not make the assertion that surely he knows is not true, Madam Speaker, that we on this side are looking to support a socialist agenda. We are promoting and continue to promote a socially sensitive agenda for the American people to make sure that they have healthcare.  Medicare was called a socialist program, Madam Speaker, when it was adopted. That is a program that millions and millions of Americans rely on and have been brought out of poverty. Medicare was a called a socialist program when it was adopted. That program, combined with Social Security, has millions of Americans having a sense of security, a sense of independence, a sense that they are not going to fall through the cracks.  So we ought not to be debating, I say, Madam Speaker, this phony shibboleth of socialism.  The minimum wage is simply saying, in America, we value people who work, and we want to ensure that people who work are not living in poverty and have some ability to support themselves and their families in a decent way. We passed that bill today. We are proud of passing that bill.  Very frankly, for 10 years of Republican control of the House of Representatives, we pleaded with them to bring a minimum wage bill of whatever number to the floor, and they didn't bring a single cent raise in a decade, the longest time since the minimum wage was adopted in the 1930s, to make sure that Americans were lifted out of the deepest recession that this country has ever had.  So I say to my friend, we have done a lot. I wish the Senate would move it.  Let me close in terms of this response. I am very proud of this. We have passed 10 appropriations bills out of 12, the most since 2006.  Now, in 2006, the Republicans were in charge. I don't refer to the gentleman personally, but the Republicans were in charge, and they didn't bring the Labor-Health bill to the floor. I am not sure why, but I had offered a minimum wage increase in that bill, in the Labor-Health Subcommittee, and they never brought it to the floor.  It passed in committee, even though the Republicans were in charge and the majority of Members in the committee were Republicans. That minimum wage increase passed, but they refused to bring it to the floor. I can only conclude that they are not for increasing the minimum wage.  We disagree with that position. We believe that in America, if you are working, playing by the rules, and making our economy grow, then you ought to be paid a wage that you can survive on and, better than that, live on.  And so I am proud of the legislation that we passed, and I am proud of the 10 appropriations bills, which, by the way, fund 96 percent of the government.  Our colleagues in the Senate, Madam Speaker, have not passed a single appropriations bill through committee, not one.  So we are doing our job, Madam Speaker, and we are addressing the issues of the American people.  I agree 100 percent with the minority, with the Republican whip that we need to deal with drug pricing. We have pledged to do that. We are working together. The President says he wants to do that. Hopefully, we can get to a consensus.  I agree with the gentleman from Louisiana, Madam Speaker, we haven't gotten there yet. Hopefully, we can get there. Hopefully, we can strengthen the Affordable Care Act so that people will have the confidence that it will be available to them.  I know that was a relatively--maybe not relatively--a long answer, but I think we have done a lot of work. I am very proud of the 6 months that we have had.  We spent the first 35 days trying to open up the government. This is the first Congress in the history of the United States in which the government was shut down when the new Congress started. It has been shut down before, but this was the first time when we started. It took us 35 days to get it open. And when we did get it open, we started on an agenda of which I am proud.  Do we have more work to do? We do. Madam Speaker, we intend to continue on an agenda that does that work.
