 President, this measure has broad bipartisan support. It was referred to the Foreign Relations Committee, not the Finance Committee. Both the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking member support this measure, as do the majority and minority leaders of the Senate.  It is time to act. Aung San Suu Kyi, we hope, is still alive.
