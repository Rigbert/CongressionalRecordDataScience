President, today I am introducing the Genetically Engineered Foods Act. This legislation would strengthen consumer confidence in the safety of genetically engineered foods, and in the ability of the federal government to exercise effective oversight of this important technology. This bill requires an FDA pre-market review of all genetically engineered foods, and grants FDA important authorities to conduct oversight. In addition, the Genetically Engineered Foods Act creates a transparent process that will better inform and involve the public as decisions are made regarding the safety of genetically engineered foods.  In the past five years, genetically engineered foods have become a major part of the American food supply. Many foods on the grocery store shelves now contain genetically engineered ingredients such as corn, soy, and potatoes. These foods have been enhanced with important qualities that help farmers grow crops more efficiently. But they have also raised significant concerns as to the safety of these new foods, and the adequacy of government oversight. These concerns were heightened by the recent recall of taco shells that contained a variety of genetically engineered corn that was not approved for human use.  Up until now, genetically engineered foods have been screened by the federal Food and Drug Administration under a voluntary program. The Genetically Engineered Foods Act will make this pre-market review program mandatory, and strengthen government oversight in several important ways.  Mandatory Review: Companies developing genetically engineered foods will receive approval from FDA before new foods could be marketed. FDA will scientifically ensure that genetically engineered foods are just as safe as conventional foods before allowing them on the market.  Clear-cut Authority: FDA will be given authority to review all genetically engineered foods, whether produced domestically or imported, including authority over genetically engineered food supplements (such as ginseng extract, for example). Genetically engineered foods not approved for market will be considered ``adulterated'' and subject to FDA recall.  Public Involvement: Scientific studies and other materials submitted to FDA in their review of genetically engineered foods will be available for public review and comment. Members of the public can submit any new information on genetically engineered foods not previously considered by FDA and request a new review of a genetically engineered food, even after the food is on the market.  Testing: FDA, in conjunction with other federal agencies, will be given the authority to conduct scientifically-sound food testing to determine whether genetically engineered foods are inappropriately entering the food supply (for instance, whether a food cleared for use only as an animal feed is showing up in food for humans).  Communication: FDA and other federal agencies will establish a registry of genetically engineered foods for easy, one-stop access to information on which foods have been cleared for market, and what restrictions are in place on their use. Federal agencies will report regularly to Congress on the status of genetically engineered foods in use. The genetically engineered food review process will be fully transparent so that the public has access to all non-confidential information.  Research: An existing genetically engineered foods research program will be expanded to focus research on possible risks from genetically engineered foods, with a specific emphasis on potential allergens. Research is also directed at understanding impacts, to farmers and to the overall economy, of the growing use of genetically engineered foods.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation. The American people should be assured that the food they feed their families is the safest in the world. The Genetically Engineered Foods Act can help provide that assurance. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3184       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Genetically Engineered Foods      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) genetically engineered food is rapidly becoming an      integral part of the United States and international food      supplies;       (2) the potential positive effects of genetically      engineered foods are enormous;       (3) the potential for negative effects, both anticipated      and unexpected, exists with genetic engineering of foods;       (4) evidence suggests that unapproved genetically      engineered foods are entering the food supply;       (5) it is essential to maintain public confidence in the      safety of the food supplies and in the ability of the Federal      government to exercise adequate oversight of genetically      engineered foods;       (6) public confidence can best be maintained through      careful review of new genetically engineered foods, and      monitoring of the positive and negative effects of      genetically engineered foods as the foods become integrated      into the food supplies, through a review and monitoring      process that is scientifically sound, open, and transparent,      and that fully involves the general public; and       (7) since genetically engineered foods are developed      worldwide and imported into the United States, it is also      imperative to ensure that imported genetically engineered      foods are subject to the same level of oversight as domestic      genetically engineered foods.     SEC. 3. PREMARKET REVIEW OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOODS.       Chapter IV of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21      U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the      following:     ``SEC. 414.
