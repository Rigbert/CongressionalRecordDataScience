 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:20 today, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the Reed amendment No. 40; provided that immediately following that vote, Senator Daschle be recognized in order to offer an amendment relating to drought assistance; provided further that following the reporting of the amendment, Senator Cochran be immediately recognized in order to offer another first-degree amendment relating to the same subject. I further ask unanimous consent that there then be a total of 70 minutes of debate on both amendments, to be divided equally between the two sponsors of the amendments.  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Cochran amendment, to be followed immediately by a vote in relation to the Daschle amendment, with no further intervening action or debate and no amendments in order to either amendment prior to the votes.
