 President, I will not oppose this amendment. I am delighted to see another deficit-neutral reserve fund put into place on this bill that I know my colleagues on the other side of this aisle have not been very happy about throughout the process. But in the spirit of good will, I am happy to accept this amendment on a voice vote.
