President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his continued interest in international development and in the Cooperative Development Program. I assure him that the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee intends to continue our strong support of the Cooperative Development Program in the fiscal year 2009 State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill.
