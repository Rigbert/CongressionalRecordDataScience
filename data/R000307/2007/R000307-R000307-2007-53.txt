FEINGOLD. I would object on behalf of the leadership because I agreed that this should be the next step and we should take up this resolution.  I say to the Senator from Kansas, this resolution before us, the Reid resolution, makes perfect sense. What it does is it says: Look, we no longer believe the authorization that was given in 2002 makes sense, and it severely limits that resolution and moves us in the right direction. So I think that is the proper step.
