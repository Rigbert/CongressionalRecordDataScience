President, there is a bill that passed the House of Representatives with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. Its supporters have characterized it as a jobs bill. It is a bill which, frankly, changes many laws and comes over to the Senate. The minority leader, the Republican leader, has been on the Senate floor almost every single day urging us to take up this bill as quickly as possible and to pass it because of the impact it might have on employment across America.  I might say for the record, I believe the bill we passed today, the Transportation bill, is the true jobs bill--2.8 million jobs across America. I will tell you, the House bill will not even get close to that on a good day. Our bill will save and create millions of jobs. It will build an infrastructure for our economy for years to come, and it passed with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. Over 70 Members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, voted for this bill. An extraordinary effort bySenator Boxer of California and Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma and many others resulted in a bill that was well crafted, balanced, and will, in fact, fund our infrastructure needs in this country for the next 2 years.  The House has been at a loss to produce a similar bill, even though we are both facing a March 31 deadline for this trust fund that is used across America to maintain our infrastructure. The House has moved from one extreme to another. They have crafted bills which were way too partisan.  This used to be the easiest lift in Washington. Every 5 years, the Federal Transportation bill was an opportunity for both parties to work together. Oh, it is true, Members would put in projects for their districts and States. That is to be expected. But at the end of the day, a bill would emerge which ultimately had strong bipartisan support. I cannot think of a single instance in the time I have been in the House and the Senate that was not the case.  The House effort, however, to this date has failed. I hope they can use our bill as a starting point. They should. If they bring our bipartisan bill to the floor of the House of Representatives and open it to amendment, then we will be at a position where we can sit together in a conference committee and work this out, as we should, on a bipartisan basis. It is a good jobs bill. In fact, it is the biggest jobs bill the Congress will have considered in the last year.  Let's go back to the bill that passed the House, which the Republicans have characterized as a jobs bill. I think it is important that before we rush into this, taking a look at it, we take a careful look at it and ask: What does this bill do?  This bill is designed to change disclosure, accounting, and auditing standards, and to exempt many firms and corporations from the Securities and Exchange Commission's oversight. One part of the bill exempts newly public firms with less than $1 billion in revenue from certain disclosure, accounting, and auditing standards over a transition period of 5 years after they first go public. It exempts firms with less than $1 billion in revenue and less than $700 million in traded stock--what they characterize as ``emerging growth companies.'' They would be exempt from regulation for the most part. That would, in fact, exempt more than 90 percent of the companies going public in America.  These so-called emerging growth companies would be exempt from SOX 404(b), which requires a firm's auditor to attest to and report on internal controls. It would exempt firms from safeguards we adopted in this country after Enron.  There is little justification for rolling back the Dodd-Frank provisions on executive compensation. But firms would be exempt in many respects because of this bill. It is hard to imagine that a firm with $1 billion in revenue does not have the resources to disclose golden parachutes in executive compensation agreements.  Exempting firms from new accounting standards would create a two-tiered accounting system that is bound to be confusing. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB, says provisions legislating accounting standards would ``undermine the rigorous, independent standard-setting process [already] undertaken. . . . '' One other part of this bill increases the amount of capital private companies may raise under a public offering from $5 million to $50 million annually and remain exempted from SEC oversight.  They want to take a lot of this capital formation and business formation off the grid. They do not want oversight and disclosure and transparency. That is what this bill does. It fails to include a multiyear cap on the amount firms may raise and allows firms to raise $50 million annually indefinitely while avoiding SEC registration and disclosures.  It goes on with something called crowdfunding. It allows firms to remain exempt from SEC registration and raise up to $1 million annually through crowdfunding. What does that mean? Large numbers of individuals contributing a small amount of money to a company. Retail and unsophisticated investors will be allowed to invest up to $10,000 through crowdfunding sites with few disclosure requirements.  There is another provision that allows private firms that sell more than $5 million in securities to generally solicit or advertise private offerings without being required to register with the SEC, provided the firm verifies all purchasers are accredited investors. The risk of fraud through cold calls and other sales tactics increases significantly with the elimination of the requirement that firms have a preexisting relationship with potential investors.  In the early 1990s, the SEC allowed general solicitation but again restricted general solicitation in 1999 because of widespread fraud. The accredited investor standard is so low as to include individuals whose net worth is $1 million or who have earned $200,000 annually. It allows banks to raise capital while avoiding SEC registration by increasing the shareholder threshold from 500 shareholders to 2,000 and from $1 million in assets to $10 million.  It is no surprise that when we look carefully at this bill, even though it received a large vote in the House--I do not dispute that--many organizations oppose it. They include the Consumer Federation of America, AARP, Americans for Tax Reform, AFL CIO, the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, U.S. PIRG, the National Education Association, the National Consumers League, and the National Association of Consumer Advocates. There are other organizations with serious concerns, which include the Council of Institutional Investors, FASB, and North American Securities Administrators Association.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial from the New York Times from March 11 entitled ``They Have Very Short Memories.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     They Have Very Short Memories       House Republicans, Senate Democrats and President Obama      have found something they can all support: a terrible package      of bills that would undo essential investor protections,      reduce market transparency and distort the efficient      allocation of capital.       Of course, supporters don't describe it that way. They say      the JOBS Act--for Jumpstart Our Business Startups--would      remove burdensome regulations that they claim have made it      too difficult for companies to raise money from investors,      impeding their ability to grow and hire.       Never mind that reams of Congressional testimony, market      analysis and academic research have shown that regulation has      not been an impediment to raising capital. In fact, too      little regulation has been at the root of all recent bubbles      and bursts--the dot-com crash, Enron, the mortgage meltdown.      Those free-for-alls created jobs and then imploded, causing      mass joblessness.       Unfortunately, election-year politics and powerful      constituencies--rather than research and reason--are driving      the JOBS legislation forward. It passed the House on      Thursday, after the Obama administration endorsed it; the      Senate leadership is expected to introduce a similar package      this week.       Republicans love it because deregulation is at the core of      their corporate-centered agenda. President Obama wants to      burnish his pro-business credentials. Most Senate Democrats,      keenly aware of big business's deep campaign contribution      pockets, are eager to go along.       The centerpiece of the bill would curb investor protections      in the Sarbanes-Oxley law that require companies to meet      specific disclosure, accounting and auditing standards before      going public. The legislation is promoted as applying only to      small companies, but the parameters would encompass all but      the nation's biggest new companies.       It would also let new public companies delay compliance      with provisions of the Dodd-Frank law on executive      compensation and shareholder ``say on pay.'' Another      provision would permit ``crowd funding''--raising money from      small investors through the Internet--without requiring those      companies to provide meaningful disclosure and without      adequate oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission.      John Coffee Jr., a securities law expert, has dubbed that the      ``Boiler Room Legalization Act.''       Yet another provision, opposed by AARP and state      regulators, would allow private companies to solicit      investors, a move that could expose unsophisticated investors      to offerings that they cannot properly evaluate.       Dozens of legal experts and advocates for investors and      consumers have written to Senate leaders warning that      extensive revisions must be made to the House legislation for      it to be even minimally acceptable.       We know memories are short in Washington. But Enron was      just 10 years ago. And the entire system almost imploded in      2008. There is no excuse.
