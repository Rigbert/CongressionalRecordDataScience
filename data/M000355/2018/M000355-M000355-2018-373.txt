 This storm has already claimed multiple lives and left the gulf coast communities wounded by surging waters and high winds. As Michael continues inland, those left in its wake can count on the Senate's support for responsive recovery efforts and trust in our continued prayers. We remain grateful for the vigilance of first responders and emergency preparedness organizations as they work to keep residents of affected communities safe and for all of those who will help to rebuild after the storm has passed.                          ____________________
