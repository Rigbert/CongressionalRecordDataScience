Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 794) recognizing the 17th anniversary of the massacre in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, in the People's Republic of China, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 794       Whereas freedom of expression, assembly, association, and      religion are fundamental human rights that belong to all      people and are recognized as such under the United Nations      Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on      Civil and Political Rights;       Whereas the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square were the      manifestation of a peaceful democratic movement throughout      China calling for the establishment of a dialogue with      government and party leaders on democratic reforms, including      freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and the      elimination of corruption;       Whereas on June 3-4, 1989, Chinese authorities ordered the      People's Liberation Army and other security forces to use      lethal force to disperse demonstrators in Beijing, especially      around Tiananmen Square;       Whereas independent observers report that hundreds, perhaps      thousands, were killed and wounded in 1989 by the People's      Liberation Army soldiers and other security forces;       Whereas 20,000 people throughout China suspected of taking      part in the democracy movement were arrested and sentenced      without trial to prison or reeducation through labor, and      many were reportedly tortured;       Whereas credible sources estimate that the Communist      Government of China continues to imprison hundreds, and      perhaps thousands, of Tiananmen Square activists, such as      United States permanent resident Yang Jianli, and denies such      activists their basic human rights;       Whereas the Communist Government of China undertakes active      measures to deny its citizens the truth about the Tiananmen      Square massacre, including the blocking of uncensored      Internet sites and weblogs, and the placement of misleading      information on the events of June 3-4, 1989 on Internet sites      available in China, often with the collusion and cooperation      of United States Internet companies such as Yahoo, Google,      Microsoft, and Cisco;       Whereas the Communist Government of China continues to      suppress dissent by imprisoning pro-democracy activists,      lawyers, journalists, labor union leaders, religious      believers, members of ethnic minority rights organizations,      and other individuals in China and Tibet who seek to express      their political or religious views in a peaceful manner;       Whereas the Communist Government of China kidnapped long-     time democracy activist Dr. Wang Bingzhang, a United States      permanent resident, and sentenced him to life imprisonment      for espionage and terrorism;       Whereas the Communist Government of China continues its      extraordinarily brutal persecution of the peaceful spiritual      movement of Falun Gong;       Whereas the Communist Government of China continues its      reprehensible policies of organ harvesting of executed      prisoners; maintenance of hundreds, perhaps thousands of      slave labor camps; coercive sterilization and forced      abortions resulting in sex-selective abortions, female      infanticide, and trafficking in persons; and forcible      repatriation of thousands of refugees to North Korea to face      persecution, imprisonment, and death in violation of its      international commitments; and       Whereas June 4, 2006, is the 17th anniversary of the      Tiananmen Square massacre: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) expresses sympathy to the families of those killed,      tortured, and imprisoned as a result of their participation      in the democracy protests of June 3-4, 1989, in Tiananmen      Square, Beijing, in the People's Republic of China, and to      all those persons who have suffered for their efforts to keep      that struggle alive during the past 17 years, and to all the      people of China who lack fundamental human rights;       (2) commends all peaceful advocates for democracy and human      rights in China;       (3) calls upon those nations planning to participate in the      2008 Olympic Games in Beijing to insist that China comply      with the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights; and       (4) condemns the ongoing and egregious human rights abuses      by the Communist Government of China and calls on that      Government to--       (A) release all prisoners of conscience, including those      persons still in prison as a result of their participation in      the peaceful pro-democracy protests of 1989 and put an      immediate end to the harassment, detention, and imprisonment      of all Chinese citizens exercising their legitimate freedoms      of expression, association, and religion;       (B) end its censorship of legitimate free speech on the      Internet, and its persecution of Internet dissidents;       (C) end its persecution of Falun Gong;       (D) end organ harvesting and ensure that its organ donor      programs proceed only on a purely voluntary and non-     commercial basis;       (E) end its coercive one-child policy;       (F) grant the United Nations High Commission on Refugees      access to all refugees, and end forcible repatriations of      refugees, particularly to North Korea;       (G) close its ``re-education through labor'' camps, respect      the rights of workers, and end police detention without      trial;       (H) release United States permanent resident Dr. Yang      Jianli, a participant in the Tiananmen Square protests of      1989, who has been illegally detained by the Communist      Government of China since April 26, 2002, and whose wife and      two children are United States citizens; and       (I) release United States permanent resident Dr. Wang      Bingzhang, long-time peaceful democracy activist, who was      abducted in June 2002, and illegally imprisoned for life on      false charges of espionage and terrorism, and whose sister,      son, and daughter are United States citizens.
