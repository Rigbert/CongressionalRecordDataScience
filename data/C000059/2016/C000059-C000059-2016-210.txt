Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the remarkable Jacques `Jack' Yeager who passed away in California on Wednesday, April 20, 2016. Jack was a pillar of the community in Riverside, California, and he will be deeply missed.  Born in Riverside in 1921, Jack went to local schools and graduated from Poly High School in 1939. While attending college at UC Berkeley, Jack left school to join the U.S. Navy Seabees and eventually helped build airports throughout the South Pacific during World War II. Jack eventually returned home to join the family construction business, E. L. Yeager Construction Company, which was founded by his father. At Yeager Construction, Jack worked alongside his brothers, Dick and Gene, and played an important role in the growth and success of the company. Yeager Construction was responsible for building many significant highway and other construction projects in Southern California and around the country. I had the privilege of working together with Jack on a number of projects and causes over the years, and felt fortunate to see his passion and dedication to improving our community first-hand.  In 1948, Jack Yeager married Mary Barbara Gibbs and the couple had two sons and three daughters. Mary passed away in 1990. Later, Jack would marry Helen Hays, who died in 2009. As an active member of his community, Jack participated in a number of organizations, often in a leadership role, including: Co-founder and member of the Monday Morning Group, Board Member of the Riverside Community Hospital Foundation, Board Member of the UC Riverside Citizens University Committee, member of the Riverside County Transportation Commission, Board Member of the March Field Museum Foundation, and Board Member of the UC Board of Regents.  The way in which Jack lived his life should serve as reminder that the power of an individual with drive, perseverance and a strong work ethic can do great things. His dedication to his work, family, and community are a testament to a life well lived and a legacy that will continue. I was proud to call Jack my friend and I will deeply miss him. I extend my condolences to Jack's family and friends; although Jack may be gone, the many incredible contributions he made to our region and the country remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
