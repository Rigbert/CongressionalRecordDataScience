 President, reserving the right to object, last week, Secretary Geithner brought up for the President an offer that was so not serious it makes me wonder what the point of it was. In light of that offer, I would like to see if our Democratic friends are willing to support it. It includes a $2 trillion tax increase over 10 years, which would be the biggest real-dollar tax increase in U.S. history. It increases taxes on nearly 1 million small businesses and increases the taxes paid by family farmers and small businesses at death in the middle of a jobs crisis.  Most outrageous of all, it gives the President of the United States unilateral power--unilateral power--to raise the limit on the Federal credit card, the so-called debt ceiling, whenever he wants, for as much as he wants.  I don't think we should have to speculate how Democrats might feel about this. I think we should give them a chance to demonstrate for themselves how serious the President's plan was and how serious they are.  I would like to ask consent to offer an amendment to the Russia trade bill--this is Secretary Geithner's proposal right here--an amendment to the Russia trade bill that gives our friends on the other side of the aisle a chance to vote on this proposal Secretary Geithner brought up last Thursday. It gives the President's proposal to solve the fiscal cliff, as delivered by Secretary Geithner and outlined in the President's budget, an opportunity to be voted upon.  I should note I would be happy to have this vote right here or as an amendment to the next bill or as a stand-alone. It will not slow down what I hope is swift passage of PNTR for Russia. If this proposal was made in good faith, our friends on the other side, I am sure, would be happy to vote for it.  Let me just say I expect my good friend, the majority leader, to decline this chance to support the President and this laughable proposal because they know it couldn't even pass if it was sent to their majority.
