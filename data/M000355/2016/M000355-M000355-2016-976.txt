 President, I want to take a moment here to congratulate Chairman Murkowski for what could best be described as a long march. Her persistence and determination to pull this very important bill together with a lot of Senators with different views at points along the way has been a really extraordinary accomplishment and, frankly, has been fun to watch because she certainly knows how to manage a bill, how to get to a conclusion, and she did that in an extraordinary fashion.  I also want to thank Senator Cantwell, her ranking member. The two of them worked well together, and I think we are on the cusp here of something very important and very much worth doing for the American people.
