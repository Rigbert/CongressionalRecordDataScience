President, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a relatively new organization designed to enhance U.S.-Cuba relations. The Alliance for Responsible Cuba Policy was created in early 1998 to foster better political, economic and cultural relationships between our country and Cuba. Its board is compromised of distinguished Americans, including some of our former colleagues in the Congress.  Clearly the time has come to bring ``responsibleness'' to the debate regarding U.S.-Cuba relations.  The Alliance has briefed me and my staff regarding their first-hand experience in Cuba. I encourage them to continue their fact finding and information gathering missions to Cuba.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an Activities Report of the Alliance.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Alliance for Responsible Cuba Policy Activities Report--Fact-Finding               Mission; Republic of Cuba, July 10-12, 2000       This report summarizes the activities of a fact-finding      mission to the Republic of Cuba conducted on July 10-12,      2000. The fact-finding mission was organized by the Alliance      for Responsible Cuba Policy (the ``Alliance''), a non-     partisan, non-profit organization incorporated in the      District of Columbia. The delegation included former      Congressman Beryl Anthony, partner, Winston & Strawn; Mr.      Albert A. Fox, Jr., President of the Alliance, Mr. Paul D.      Fox, Vice-President Atlantic Region, Tysons Food, Inc. and      Managing Director, Tyson de Mexico; Ms. Nanette Kelly,      President and Mr. John Spain, Managing Director, The Powell      Group of Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Mr. Edward Rabel, former      news correspondent with CBS and NBC, and currently Senior      Vice President of Weber McGinn; and Gregory J. Spak, partner,      White & Case LLP.       This fact-finding mission was the second such trip      organized by the Alliance. The first mission occurred on      September 26-29, 1999. An Activities Report related to that      mission is available from the Alliance's web site at      www.responsiblecubapolicy.com.       During the July 10-12, 2000 mission, the delegation met      with the following persons and entities in Cuba:       Ministry of Foreign Trade       Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment       Ministry of Agriculture       Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation       Mr. Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, President of the National      Assembly       Ministry of Justice     The following summarizes the discussion at each of these      meetings.                       Ministry of Foreign Trade       The delegation met with Maria de la Luz B'Hamel, Director      of the North American Division of the Foreign Trade Ministry,      and with Mr. Igor Montero Brito, Vice President of ALIMPORT.      Ms. B'Hamel's division is responsible for international trade      issues relating to the United States and Canada, and the      Foreign Trade Ministry in general has jurisdiction over all      foreign trade issues, including issues arising in the World      Trade Organization and other international and regional trade      agreements. Ms. B'Hamel noted that Cuba is a founding member      of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (``GATT'') and      the World Trade Organization (``WTO'').       The Foreign Trade Ministry has a practical role in foreign      trade through its authority to grant licenses to Cuban      enterprises engaging in international trade. Ms. B'Hamel      described two important trends that have emerged since the      dissolution of the Soviet Union and the resulting rupture of      Cuba's traditional trading relationships:       (1) Diversification of Cuba's foreign trade. Currently,      Cuba's two largest trading partners are Spain and Canada, and      no more than 10-12 percent of Cuba's trade is with any one      country. As part of this diversification process, Cuba has      been negotiating trade agreements with its regional trading      partners in order to promote Cuba as a strategic bridge to      the Caribbean region.       (2) Decentralization of foreign trade issues. Ms. B'Hamel      stated the Foreign Trade Ministry is deemphasizing its direct      involvement in international trade transactions, and is      assuming more of a trade regulation role. Companies engaged      in foreign trade today in Cuba include state enterprises,      private enterprises, and international joint ventures or      branch offices of foreign companies. More than 250 private      and state enterprises are actively engaged in foreign trade,      and there are approximately 600 Cuban branch offices of      foreign companies engaged in trade in Cuba.       Ms. B'Hamel explained that, since 1994, Cuba has      experienced steady improvement in foreign trade and GDP      growth. Her Ministry forecasts continued GDP growth, even      assuming no relaxation of U.S.-imposed trade restrictions.      She stated that the U.S. trade restrictions (which she called      the ``blockade'') have affected Cuba, but that other trends      in business and world trade were creating new opportunities      for the Cuban economy.       One particularly dynamic sector of the Cuban economy is      tourism, which is growing by 16-20 percent per year. These      statistics do not include U.S. tourists, which Ms. B'Hamel      estimates to have numbered approximately 180,000 last year.      She noted that this increase in tourism will have a ripple      effect on the Cuban economy and will increase the demand for      food goods, and other services.       Mr. Igor Montero explained that ALIMPORT is the principal      Cuban state enterprise dedicated to importing foodstuffs into      Cuba and distributing imports to the public. ALIMPORT is      dedicated almost exclusively to the primary foodstuffs which      are considered to be staples of the Cuban diet (e.g., rice,      beans, etc.). Cuba currently imports approximately $1 billion      in foodstuffs annually, $650 million of which is imported      through ALIMPORT. Principal food imports are wheat, soybeans,      and rice.       Cuba currently is importing approximately 400,000 metric      tons of rice per year, principally from China, Thailand, and      Vietnam. Delivery time for rice imported from these countries      is approximately 60 days, and the quality is considered only      fair. Mr. Montero acknowledged that transportation costs to     acquire this rice represent a significant expenditure.       Mr. Spain, whose Louisiana-based company, the Powell Group,      is involved in the rice milling business, pointed out that      his company used to supply rice to Cuba before the U.S. trade      restrictions. While clarifying he was not in Cuba to develop      business. Mr. Spain noted that his company could supply high-     quality rice to Cuba with a turnaround time (from order to      delivery) of approximately one week and insignificant freight      costs.                           *   *   *   *   *            Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment       The delegation met with a number of representatives from      this Ministry (``CITMA''), including the Minister, Dr. Rosa      Elena Simeon Negrin. Dr. Simeon described the Ministry's      creation in 1994 as a result of the reorganization and      consolidation of other Cuban ministries. Dr. Simeon      distributed to the delegation the following publications      regarding the Ministry's activities (1) ``Law of the      Environment''; (2) ``Cuba Foreign Investment Act of 1995'';      and (3) ``National Environmental Strategy.'' These documents      are available from the Alliance upon request.       Much of the discussion focused on environmental issues. Dr.      Simeon noted the importance of environmental education to the      Ministry's mission. She described the results of a recent      survey revealing that although 73 percent of the Cuban      population recognize the threat to the environment, only 30      percent believe they can improve environmental conditions      through their own actions. The Ministry is attempting to      increase awareness among the Cuban population of the role the      individual plays in improving the environment.       Dr. Simeon also portrayed alternative fuels as an important      focus of the Ministry's efforts. Approximately 5,000      facilities in the mountain areas of the country operate with      solar energy, but the solar energy panels necessary to      continue the development of this energy source are      prohibitively expensive. Notwithstanding the cost, the      Ministry is committed to solar energy.                           *   *   *   *   *                        ministry of agriculture       The delegation met with Dr. Alfredo Gutierrez Yanis, Vice      Minister of Agriculture, and several other officials from the      Ministry. Dr. Gutierrez explained that Cuba's traditional      relationship with the Soviet Union had allowed for a stable      agriculture policy. Cuba exported sugar and citrus to the      Soviet Union and Soviet bloc countries, and imported      machinery, fertilizer, and pesticides from those countries.      Ten years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cuban      agriculture is in the midst of a recovery program (known as      the ``processo de Recuperacion en Agricultura'' or the      ``Agriculture Recovery Process''). Recovery has been uneven,      however, with some sectors advancing beyond pre-crisis      performance levels (notably vegetable production) and others      continuing to experience difficulties (poultry, livestock,      and rice production).       Dr. Gutierrez offered poultry products as an example of a      sector that has not recovered. Prior to 1991, the Cuban per-     capita annual egg consumption was 230, nearly double the      current per-capita rate. Similarly, Cuban agriculture once      produced approximately 117,000 tons of chicken meat annually,      but now can only produce approximately 30,000 tons. Cuba has      been forced to import chicken meat, with Canada emerging as      the principal supplier. Dr. Gutierrez attributed the decrease      in chicken and egg production to lack of available feed. This      lack of feed results from both the disruption in the      traditional trading relationship with the Soviet Union, and      changes in the economic restrictions imposed by the United      States. During the 1980s, Cuba imported approximately 2      million tons of feed, and reported much of this was purchased      from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. After the      enactment of the Toricelli Act, the value of this trade      dropped from $400 million per year to approximately $1      million. Also, the provisions of U.S. law restricting access      to U.S. ports for those vessels which have engaged in      commercial activity in Cuba to obtain feed at a reasonable      price.       With respect to milk, Dr. Gutierrez reported that for all      practical purposes, the dairy herds ceased to produce when      grain was no longer available for feeding. Many cows died of      starvation and others were slaughtered while still at a      productive age. The Cuban Government has since developed a      breed of dairy cow that is \5/8\ Holstein and \3/8\ Zebu in      order to facilitate milk production without excessive      grain consumption, but current productivity per head has      declined with these genetic changes. The Government is      importing powdered milk, but not in sufficient quantities.      One of the delegation members touring a neighborhood away      from the tourist areas was told that the milk formula sold      in state stores is supposed to be consumed exclusively by      children from 3 to 7 years old.       Dr. Gutierrez also mentioned difficulties in the rice      sector, in that Cuba has been forced to import most of its      rice from distant sources, thereby increasing costs and      lowering quality of the rice. The Ministry would like to see      an increase in local rice production, and a corresponding      reduction in imports to approximately 200,000 tons per year.      Dr. Gutierrez feels that this would permit a per-capita rice      consumption of approximately 50 kilograms.       Dr. Gurtierrez cited pork and cirrus production as two      examples of a successful recovery. Cirrus production has      recovered and could increase if new markets were opened for      Cuban citrus goods. Israel is providing assistance to the      Cuban Government on citrus production, and an Italian firm is      helping with production of citrus derivation products.                           *   *   *   *   *       Dr. Gutierrez described developments he believes will help      the Cuban agricultural sector continue its post-crisis      recovery. First, state farms play a less significant role in      the agricultural sector, with the percentage of farm land      cultivated by state farms reduced from 67 percent to      approximately 33 percent. Thus, according to Dr. Gutierrez,      approximately two-thirds of the land is being cultivated      today by small private companies and cooperatives. When asked      how the small companies and cooperatives sell their crops, he      replied that it would be typical for such companies and      cooperatives to contract with a Cuban state enterprise for a      specific supply quantity, and that the companies and      cooperatives would then be free to sell any additional      production privately.       Secondly, individual farmers now operate in a relatively      free market, and are permitted to farm areas of 75 hectares      (approximately 200 acres). Nearly 800,000 hectares      (approximately 2 million acres) are now in the hands of      individual farmers. The farmers do not own the land (land      ownership is reserved to the state), but they are allowed to      cultivate the land and are entitled to sell the production as      they wish. Many of these farmers have formed privately-     operated cooperatives.                           *   *   *   *   *        ministry of foreign investment and economic cooperation       The delegation met with Mr. Ernesto Senti Endarias, First      Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Investment and      Economic Cooperation, and various members of his staff.      According to Vice Minister Senti, the Cuban economy is in its      fifth year of a gradual economic recovery, and foreign      investment has played an important role in this recovery.      Sales from enterprises resulting from direct foreign      investment account for approximately 3-4 percent of the Cuban      GDP, nearly twelve percent of all exports, and such      enterprises employ approximately one percent of the labor      force.       Direct foreign investment is affecting various sectors of      the Cuban economy, including (1) tourism, (2) heavy industry      (petroleum (especially deep-water drilling)), (3) mining,      (4) light industry, (5) telecommunications, (6) energy      (especially alternative sources), (7) sugar (especially      derivatives from sugar production), and (8) agriculture.      Only three sectors are not open to direct foreign      investment health, education, and national security.      Fifty-two percent of direct foreign investment is from      countries in Europe, particularly Spain and France.       Vice Minister Senti believes that direct foreign investment      in Cuba will continue to grow. He observed the companies      investing in Cuba typically are large companies, and these      companies exhibit a high level of professionalism in their      business ventures, which is beneficial for Cuba. In return,      Cuba offers foreign investors highly-trained workers,      political stability, and a government interested in helping      companies that are willing to help Cuba.                           *   *   *   *   *                  president ricardo alarcon de quesada       The delegation met with Mr. Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada,      President of the National Assembly, former foreign minister      and former ambassador to the United Nations. The discussion      with President Alarcon was wide-ranging, and he was      forthcoming on all issues raised by the delegation. He showed      particular interest in the status of the various legislative      proposals in the U.S. Congress that might permit the sale of      U.S. food and medicine to Cuba. When asked whether Cuba would      commit to purchasing U.S. food and medicine after the      legislation passed, he stated Cuba would like to do so, but      ultimately it would depend on the text of the legislation and      on timing. He explained they were monitoring the various      versions of the legislation and that certain provisions      (especially the increased restriction on travel and the      limited duration of the export licenses) might make      purchasing U.S. food and medicine difficult.       The Alliance then briefed President Alarcon on the upcoming      visit by Senators Pat Roberts and Max Baucus. The Alliance      explained the importance of these senators to any passage of      legislation regarding the sale of food and medicine to Cuba.      President Alarcon expressed his pleasure in visiting with the      Alliance again.                          ministry of justice       The delegation met with Lic Robert Diaz Sotolongo and other      members of the Ministry. Mr. Diaz began the meeting by      stating his satisfaction with the manner in which the United      States and Cuba were able to resolve the recent controversy      regarding Elian Gonzalez. He noted that this is a visible and      helpful example of how the two governments and their      societies can interact successfully despite differences of      opinion.       Mr. Diaz then directed the discussion toward drug      interdiction, another area in which he believes Cuba and the      United     States can increase cooperation. He noted that in the last      meeting with the Alliance, the Cuban Department of Justice      had asked for assistance in facilitating the placement of a      U.S. Coast Guard representative to the U.S. Interest Section      in Havana to help increase cooperation on drug interdiction.      He thanked the Alliance for its assistance, noting with      satisfaction that the U.S. Coast Guard representative had      arrived in Havana. Mr. Diaz went on to describe the      celebrated case of the ``Limerick,'' a Belize-flagged vessel      that began to sink in Cuban waters in 1996. The cooperation      of British, American, and Cuban officials led to the      discovery on the vessel of six tons of cocaine believed      destined for the United States. The Cuban officials turned      over the drugs and the persons involved to the U.S.      authorities and actively assisted in the successful      prosecution of the individuals traveling to the United States      to testify in the criminal trial.                           *   *   *   *   *                              observation       All the Cuban Government officials and the Cuban people      with whom we visited were friendly and answered our questions      in a forthright manner. They made it clear they have no ill      feeling toward the American people or the U.S. form of      government. They expressed bewilderment that the U.S.      maintains its economic sanctions against Cuba despite other      developments, including the normalization of U.S. trade      relations with China, Vietnam, and North Korea, the      increasing foreign investment in Cuba by the rest of the      world (especially Europe and Canada), and the overwhelming      U.S. public opinion in favor of removing the sanctions.       The Alliance is grateful for the opportunity to have      concluded a second successful fact-finding mission to Cuba,      and intends to continue this process. The Alliance is      convinced that the U.S. trade restrictions must end and that      we must deal with the Cuban Government as it is, not as we      wish it to be.                          ____________________
