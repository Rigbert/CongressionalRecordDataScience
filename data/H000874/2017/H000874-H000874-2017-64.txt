Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.  I will say on this floor--the fact-checkers check me--millions and millions and millions of middle class taxpayers will get a tax increase under this bill. Check me. Millions of people.  Why do I say that?  The Joint Committee on Taxation tells me that. Other think groups tell me that from the conservative side of the ledger.  So we will argue this bill, but I will repeat again that I have heard that argument over and over and over again. I heard it in 1981, and we exploded the debt. I heard it in 2001 and 2003, and we exploded the debt. We had the deepest recession anybody on this floor who is sitting here now has experienced. I hear it today.  The reason the Peter G. Peterson Foundation is against this is because they believe exploding the debt by another $1.5 trillion will be an extraordinary detriment to our country.  I want to say to every Member, Mr. Speaker, when you get up and say: I don't want to hurt my children, there may be people who get a tax cut under this bill, but I guarantee you the people who are getting a tax increase, in addition to the middle class I have just talked about, are the children. They are going to have to pay off this debt. We will not pay it off.  When you speak on this floor and say it is an immoral act to put our children more deeply into debt, if you believe that, you will not be able to vote for this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
