President, I was proud to cosponsor the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act of 1996 and am again proud to cosponsor this bill, S. 1525, the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance Act of 1998. I am delighted that the Senate is finally sending this important bill to the President's desk for his signature into law.  Our legislation extends the educational benefits that we previously provided to the children of federal law enforcement to the families of State and local public safety officials who die or are disabled in the line of duty. Those families make the ultimate sacrifice for our public safety and deserve our support and assistance. I commend Senator Specter and Senator Biden and all the cosponsors for their work on these measures.  The Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act of 1996, known as the Degan Act after U.S. Deputy Marshall Bill Degan, who died in the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992, provides Federal educational assistance to families of Federal law enforcement officerskilled in the line of duty. It is proper that we expand this educational assistance to the families of state and local law enforcement officers because most law enforcement needs are met at the state and local level. I would have preferred to send the President the original text of our legislation since it provided full assistance to these families, but the House of Representatives decided to impose a sliding scale means test to our bill.  This past May, I called for Congress to pass this legislation during National Police Week and the annual memorial activities for law enforcement officers. I believe it would have been a fitting tribute to those who gave their lives in preserving our public safety for Congress to enact the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance Act, S. 1525; the Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998, S. 1985; and the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998, S. 1605. Fortunately, President Clinton signed the Bulletproof Vests Partnership Act and the Care for Police Survivors Act into law on June 16, 1998 and now he will have the opportunity to sign into law this third piece of legislation. Together these measures make a significant package of legislation to benefit the families of those who serve in law enforcement.  The unfortunate reality of contemporary life is that we may still lose upwards of 100 law enforcement officers a year nationwide. I wish there were none and I will keep working to improve the assistance and support we provide our law enforcement officers. For those families that sacrifice a loved one in the line of duty I support the college education assistance that will be made possible by the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance Act. I look forward to the President signing this important legislation into law.                          ____________________
