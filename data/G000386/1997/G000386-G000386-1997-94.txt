 President, I come to the floor today to announce my support for Mr. John J. Hamre's nomination to be the next Deputy Secretary of Defense.  Mr. President, my support in favor of the Hamre nomination may come as a surprise to some of my colleagues.  A yes vote on the Hamre nomination may appear to be totally inconsistent with all that I have said here on the floor about the nominee.  I have made a series of critical speeches about Mr. Hamre since January.  I have criticized Mr. Hamre for failing to control the money and make sure it is spent according to law.  I have attempted to hold him accountable.  In my book, accountability in government should be a top priority.  My criticism of Mr. Hamre boils down to one main problem area.  As Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Defense [DOD], Mr. Hamre pursued a policy on progress payments that the Inspector General [IG] had declared illegal.  The General Accounting Office [GAO] has just completed another review of the Department's progress payment policy.  As of July 21, 1997, the GAO report indicates that the policy declared illegal by the IG remains in operation.  It remains in operation today--at this very moment.  Mr. President, I am happy to report that Mr. Hamre has promised to change the policy.  He has made a commitment to bring the Department's progress payment policy into compliance with the law.  This happened at an important meeting on Tuesday evening, July 22d.  The meeting took place in the office of Senator Strom Thurmond, chairman of the Armed Services Committee.  This meeting was attended by Senators Thurmond, Levin, Warner, and the Senator from Iowa.  The nominee, Mr. Hamre, was also present.  Mr. President, I don't quite know how this meeting came about, but I suspect that my good friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, was the motivating force behind it.  I would like to extend a special word of thanks to my friend from Virginia for helping me out.  He helped me find a reasonable solution to a very difficult dilemma.  The Senator from Virginia was instrumental in resolving the dispute.  At this important meeting, Mr. Hamre made a commitment to bring the department's progress payment policy into compliance with the law.  To do that, the IG says DOD has taken two distinct steps.  Step One: The Director of Defense Procurement, Ms. Eleanor Spector, is issuing a new contract regulation--known as a DFAR.  The DFAR will authorize contracting officers--or ACO's--to require that each contract contains specific funding instructions.  These would be fund citations.  Step Two: The Comptroller, Mr. Hamre, has ordered the Defense Finance and Accounting Service or DFAS to shut down the current operation.  DFAS must issue payment instructions that match up with the DFAR.  This would allow DFAS to match the money with the work performed--as required by law.  This would allow the disbursing officers to post payments to the correct accounts.  Since DOD makes about $20 billion a year in progress payments, this should help to clean up the books.  It should cut down on overpayments and erroneous payments.  It should cut down on costly reconciliation work done by the big accounting firms like Coopers & Lybrand.  The new policy should save money.  But the fix won't happen overnight.  It will take time to phase down the old system and get the new policy up and running.  The IG is planning on a kick off date of October 1, 1997.  At the meeting, Senator Levin raised questions about the cost of the new policy.  Mr. Hamre responded by saying that he would have to add 50 people to the DFAS work force.  The extra people would be needed to manually process the payments under the new policy.  The software necessary to support automated computer processing will not be available until the year 2000 or beyond, according to Mr. Hamre.  Now, Mr. President, that sounds like more Pentagon nonsense to me.  Businesses, like NationsBank, routinely conduct 15.5 million comparable matching operations in a single day--using computers.  The software is here--now!  This is off-the-shelf stuff--not leading edge technology.  DFAS needs to get on the stick.  Senator Levin also insisted that the new policy should apply just to new contracts--and not be retroactive.  That makes sense to me.  Senator Levin raised one other very valid concern.  He said: ``Maybe we need to change the law? Maybe the law governing these payments doesn't make sense?''  These are valid questions. They need to be explored.  But I would like to offer a word of caution on this point.  If Congress should decide to change the law--as Mr. Hamre proposed late last year, Congress must then change the way the money is appropriated.  We must never allow DOD to merge the appropriations at the contract level, while Congress continues to appropriate and segregate money in special accounts.  That would subvert the whole appropriations process.  If DOD were authorized to merge the money at the contract level, then Congress would have to consolidate accounts upstream in appropriations.  We might, for example, create an acquisition account by merging R and procurement money in one big account.  Quite frankly, Mr. President, I don't think that idea would be a very popular around here.  Segregating the money in the R and procurement accounts gives Congress some broad and general control over how the money is used--as intended by the Constitution.  Mr. President, I left the meeting in Sentor Thurmond's office believing that something important had been accomplished.  First, Mr. Hamre made a commitment to bring the Department's policy into compliance with the law.  Second, it was agreed that the IG would send a letter to the committee.  This letter would serve two purposes.  The IG would certify that the Department had taken the two steps necessary to bring the policy into compliance with the law.  And the IG would agree to provide Congress with periodic follow-up reports to ensure that the new policy is, in fact, executed.  Mr. President, I have the IG's letter here in my hand.  It provides the assurances I sought.  With those assurances in hand, I can support the Hamre nomination with a clear conscience.  I ask unanimous consent that my letter requesting certification by the IG and the IG's response be printed in the Record.                                                Inspector General,                                        Department of Defense,                                     Arlington, VA, July 23, 1997.     Hon. Strom Thurmond,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your request for      my views as to whether the Department of Defense has made a      good faith effort to address previous audit findings on      progress payments to contractors and whether the Department      has established a reasonable schedule to implement the      changes needed to bring progress payment practices into      compliance with fiscal law.       On June 30, 1997, the Director, Defense Procurement, issued      the requisite contracting guidance in draft form for comment.      While we cannot prejudge or speculate as to the outcome of      the comment period, I can tell you that at this time this      office concurs with the draft guidance as written. The      guidance should be issued in final form by October 1, 1997.       The first elements of the necessary guidance for paying      offices, two Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)      memoranda, were signed out today. Given current statutory      requirements, we believe that the procedures and timelines      outlined in those memoranda are appropriate at this time and      demonstrate positive movement toward fixing this longstanding      problem. Between now and the planned October 1, 1997,      implementation date for the new progress payment distribution      policy, we will work with the Comptroller and the Defense      Finance and Accounting Service to ensure that sound desk      procedures are developed for the paying offices.       This office is already auditing various aspects of DoD      vendor payment operations and will ensure that coverage of      the implementation of the new progress payment procedures      receives high priority. We will provide periodic status      reports to the Department and the Congress starting in      January 1998.       Thank you for seeking our views on this important issue. If      we can be of further assistance in this matter, please      contact me or Mr. Robert J. Lieberman, Assistant Inspector      General for Auditing, at (703) 604-8900.           Sincerely,                                                     Eleanor Hill,     Inspector General.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1997.     Hon. John W. Warner,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear John: I am writing to clarify my position on the      nomination of Mr. John J. Hamre to be Deputy Secretary of      Defense.       My opposition to Mr. Hamre's nomination boils down to one      main problem area. As Chief Financial Officer at the      Department of Defense, Mr. Hamre aggressively pursued a      policy on progress payments that the Inspector General (IG)      declared illegal. The General Accounting Office has just      completed a review of the department's progress payment      policy. This report clearly indicates that the policy      declared illegal by the Inspector General remains in      operation today--at this very moment.       John, that's the bad news. There is some good news,      however.       I can see a solution looming up on the horizon.       The IG is telling me that Mr. Hamre is moving to bring the      policy into compliance with the law. The IG says that the      department must issue: 1) new contract (DFAR) regulations;      and 2) The Defense Finance and Accounting Service must issue      new payment instructions to match the DFAR regulations. The      IG says the new policy directives are in the process of being      issued. The new policy must then be put into practice.       John, I will not oppose the Hamre nomination if two      conditions are met: 1) The IG certifies in writing that the      department has taken the two steps necessary to bring the      policy into compliance with the law; and 2) The IG provides      Congress with periodic reports to ensure that the new policy      is, in fact, being executed.       Your assistance in this matter is appreciated.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senator                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                  Committee on Armed Services,                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 1997.     Senator Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear Chuck: Enclosed is a copy of a letter from the      Department of Defense Inspector General received today by the      Committee on Armed Services. The letter addresses the      concerns that you expressed in the meeting in my office on      July 22.       With kindest regards and best wishes,           Sincerely,                                                   Strom Thurmond,                                                         Chairman.
