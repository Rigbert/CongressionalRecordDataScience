Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of a woman of our community as she prepares to retire from professional life. Jan McBride has spent a career in the service of health care delivery, and her imprimatur is throughout our region of Northwest Ohio.  Starting as a pediatric nurse, Jan McBride rose through the ranks of Toledo Hospital and its parent ProMedica Health System, and has been the President of Toledo Children's Hospital since 1998. A balance of compassion and business acumen has marked her tenure in the corporate structure. An engaging leader, Jan McBride has developed many people while moving the Toledo Hospital and ProMedica Health System forward.  Even while pursuing an extensive corporate schedule, Jan McBride has never neglected her civic responsibilities as a community citizen. She has gone ``above and beyond'' in her commitment to a variety of health, community, and business concerns, serving as an active officer of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's NW Ohio Chapter, the Hospital Council of NW Ohio, Junior Achievement of NW Ohio, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Lucas County ARC (Association of Retarded Citizens), the National Youth Sports Program, the Neighborhood Health Association, Ohio Children's Hospital Association, Ronald McDonald House Charities, Rotary Club of Toledo, United Way of Greater Toledo, the University of Toledo Alumni Association, and the Zonta Club of Toledo. Her efforts have earned her awards of recognition including the Tribute to Women in Industry, Women in Communication, Alpha Omicron Pi Fraternity, and Juvenile Diabetes Foundation honoree.  For forty years, Jan McBride has given of herself to her career and the causes in which she believes. She leaves our community richer, stronger, healthier, and kinder. I know my colleagues join me in wishing Jan McBride well as she writes new chapters in her book of life. Onward!                          ____________________
