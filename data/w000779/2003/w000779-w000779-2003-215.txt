President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor of the McLoughlin House Preservation Act.  Dr. John McLoughlin, a powerful 6'4" man, is known, officially and fondly, as the ``Father of Oregon.'' His compassion played a critical role in the settling of the Northwest by Oregon Trail pioneers. Dr. McLoughlin's generosity to these early pioneers who arrived in the Oregon Territory after their incredible five month journey sick, hungry and without provisions was often the difference between survival and failure during their first winter.  This bill is a testimony to the hard work that one community can achieve. Preservation of the McLoughlin House and the nearby Barclay House, located in Oregon City, Oregon, is important to the cultural identity of Oregon. This bill would make them part of the Fort Vancouver National Park Service administrative site, thereby highlighting the interwoven connection between Fort Vancouver, the fur trade and the beginnings of the Oregon Territory.  Dr. McLoughlin first came to the Northwest in 1824, arriving at Fort George, now called Astoria, Oregon, to establish a supply center for the Hudson's Bay Company. Within a year, he moved to a more favorable location on the northern side of the Columbia, in what is now Washington State, and built a new trading post and named it Fort Vancouver. As the Post Administrator, the good hearted doctor maintained a very good relationship with neighboring Indians and used his medical skills to tend to the terrible fevers that broke out among them.  The Fort belonged to the Hudson's Bay Company that was a rival of American trappers, and although company policy discouraged American settlers, Dr. McLoughlin was not one to refuse a helping hand to any trapper or settler in distress. When frustrated with the Hudson's Bay Company policy opposing American settlers, Dr. McLoughlin resigned and moved to Oregon City on the Willamette Falls. By 1848, Oregon had grown so much that it was officially designated a territory, and by 1859, it became the nation's thirty-third state. McLoughlin remained a vibrant public figure and became the Mayor of Oregon City in 1851. Many of the debates concerning Oregon's statehood are said to have taken place in McLoughlin's living room, and the Oregon State Legislature aptly named him the ``Father or Oregon.''  The McLoughlin House was designated as the National Historic Site, one of the first in the west, in 1941. I thank my constituents in Clackamas County, particularly John Salisbury and the McLoughlin Memorial Association, for all of their hard work to preserve this Oregon treasure. Additionally, I thank Tracy Fortmann with the National Park Service at Fort Vancouver for her advocacy on behalf of the McLoughlin House. Mayor Alice Norris and the former mayors of Oregon City who have worked together to bring this legislation to the attention of the Oregon delegation deserve our thanks as well. Finally, I thank Representative Hooley for having the foresight to introduce this legislation in the House of Representatives in the 107th Congress and again in the 108th.                                 ______                                       By
