Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the suffering of the people of Burma. They continue their valiant struggle for human rights and democracy despite brutal human rights violations committed by the illegal ruling military regime.  In a few days, Burma's military regime will reconvene a sham ``National Convention'' under the guise of facilitating a transition to democracy in the country. In reality, the Convention is filled with handpicked delegates of the ruling regime. It is simply an attempt to legalize the regime's grip on power and guarantee the military's permanent role in the future of the country.  Why do I call the Convention a sham? Because the country's democracy movement, led by the world's only imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi, is not invited. Her political party, the National League for Democracy, is similar to the African National Congress in South Africa under apartheid rule in the 1980s and enjoys universal support from the people of Burma. In Burma's last election, the NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament, only to have the results annulled by the regime. They are completely excluded from the Convention.  As if that's not bad enough, the Convention is being held at a military camp which is surrounded by several military battalions. Among the regime's hand-picked participants are members of the United Wa State Army, whose leaders were indicted in absentia by a U.S. Federal Court in New York on January 24, 2004. The Department of Justice rightfully stated that the UWSA is one of the largest heroin producing and trafficking organizations in the world and is responsible for the production of more than 180 tons of opium in 2004. It is estimated that the UWSA has exported more than $1 billion worth of heroin to the United States alone since 1985, as well as vast amounts throughout the world.  The proceeds from this drug money have kept Burma's military regime in power. Burma's regime is a narco-dictatorship, addicted to the proceeds of the international drug trade. The UWSA and the regime have worked together to launder billions of dollars in drug profits into the Burmese economy.  We should not tolerate this orchestrated play by members of the military junta and drug traffickers, at the cost of thousands of lives of Burmese non-violence activists. As a Member of Congress who has been engaged on human rights and promoting democracy for 25 years, I am proud that our country has taken a firm stance against thugs who now control Burma. This pressure has been from both Republican and Democrats in Congress and the last two administrations. We should publicly denounce this sham convention and the drug traffickers that plan to attend.  In late 2004 Congress unanimously passed a resolution calling for the U.N. Security Council to address the Burmese military regime's threat to regional peace and security. I am also encouraged by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's labeling of Burma as an ``outpost of tyranny'' and I fully support her assessment. Now, I respectfully encourage President Bush and Secretary Rice to follow-up on our resolutions and take the issue to the U.N. Security council, where it belongs.                          ____________________
