 President, I would like to wish my colleagues happy new year. It is a time for new beginnings. Tomorrow, we will kick off the 116th Congress.  Of course, there is urgent business that the new House and the new Senate will need to tackle immediately. Democrats will finally have to get serious about border security so a government funding agreement can be reached that can pass the House, earn 60 votes in the Senate, and get a Presidential signature. All three of those things are needed to make a law. One partisan vote in the House tomorrow is not going to solve anything.  I made it clear to the Speaker that we are not interested in having show votes in the Senate. We are interested in bringing up something the House has passed, 60 Senators will support, and the President will sign; in other words, make a law.  The legislation House Democrats are reportedly planning to introduce and have voted on tomorrow will not be a serious contribution to the negotiations that are going on between the administration and the incoming Democratic majority in the House. It isn't comprehensive. It ignores the needs of border security. It is exactly the kind of proposal you would expect if the incoming House Democrats were choosing to stage a political sideshow rather than doing the hard work of helping to govern the country; in other words, it is a total nonstarter.  Will these new Democrats come to Washington ready to roll up their sleeves, work together, and make laws or are they going to waste time on partisan show votes that will do nothing to move the country in a forward direction? That is the question, political performance art or responsible governance?  We will get an early signal in the next few days, but let me make it perfectly clear one more time, as I havesaid consistently for the last 2 weeks: The Senate will not waste its time considering a Democratic bill which cannot pass this Chamber and which the President will not sign.                              Nominations  Mr. President, on another matter, I am pleased to announce this evening that the Democratic leader and I have reached an agreement to confirm a number of the administration's nominees. In a few moments, I will be asking unanimous consent to confirm a series of several well-qualified individuals to serve in important executive branch posts. Each of them will be confirmed. I am glad the President will have more of his rightful team in place, and I am glad this group of newly confirmed nominees will be able to get to work on important business for the American people.                          ____________________
