 4986. Senator Bond's amendment would specifically undermine the goal of protecting the American taxpayer from the costs of the HOPE Program.  I have often said--and I will repeat once again--that we should do whatever we can to help people stay in their homes short of sticking taxpayers with the tab.  The Banking Committee has worked long and hard for months on this issue and has found a way to accommodate a wide range of goals and concerns with this legislation.  The affordable housing fund and the funding mechanism--which is important here--for the HOPE Program are two of the most critical elements that allowed us to reach a bipartisan agreement. Eliminating either one of these now would simply unwind the entire bill, would destroy the whole bill, and neither I nor Senator Dodd nor a lot of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle can support that.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join us in opposing the first Bond amendment.                           Amendment No. 4985  Madam President, I would like to speak for a minute on the Bond amendment No. 4985, the second amendment.  While I am sympathetic to and share many of Senator Bond's concerns regarding FHA's longtime management problems and resource constraints, I cannot support this amendment.  The proposed HOPE for Homeowners Program establishes a new board to oversee the implementation of this program. Included on this board, in addition to HUD, are the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury Department. It is our intention that the expertise and experience of this board will compensate for FHA's longstanding management problems.  Additionally, the bill would provide--this is important--at no cost to the taxpayer, funding for additional resources, particularly in the form of increased staff, to manage and implement the proposed HOPE Program.  While I agree with Senator Bond that depending solely on existing FHA resources, the HOPE Program would be unworkable, I believe the increased resources and board oversight provided in this legislation sufficiently address those concerns.  I encourage my colleagues to oppose this second Bond amendment, too.
