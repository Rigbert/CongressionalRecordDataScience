President, Internet communications are increasingly important to Americans' daily lives and business. However, as the public's reliance on online and Internet services continues to grow, so do the burdens and frustrations stemming from unwanted junk e-mail.  This type of e-mail is commonly known as ``spam,'' and it isn't hard to see why. Getting spam e-mail in your in-box is a lot like getting its namesake lunchmeat in your lunchbox: You didn't order it, and you really can't tell where the stuff comes from.  Until now, you also have been virtually powerless to stop it. The recipient has no opportunity to refuse to accept the message, and thus is forced to take the time and bear the costs of storing, accessing, reviewing, and deleting such unwanted e-mail. In short, spammers have all the power. A spammer can send a recipient whatever messages it wants, and the recipient has no choice but to deal with them.  Technology is on the side of the spammer. E-mail technology enables spammers to send huge quantities of messages quickly and cheaply. With the stroke of a key, a spammer can let fly a torrent of tens or hundreds of thousands of identical e-mails at minimal cost. Such bulk spam can clog up the network, impairing Internet service for everyone. For example, back in December, an influx of millions of junk e-mails slowed Verizon's network to a crawl, causing delays of several hours for customers trying to send and receive messages.  Spam affects Internet companies as well as end users. Internet service providers are the ones who have to deal directly with the traffic jams caused when bulk spam floods their networks. And when consumers become frustrated by the receipt of spam, the first place they turn to complain will be the Internet companies from whom they purchase service. Left unchecked, spam could have a significant impact on how consumers perceive and use Internet services and e-commerce.  Because of this, Internet service providers have often played a major role in trying to shield their customers from spam. But the bottom line is that existing laws do not provide the tools to deal with the mounting problem of junk e-mail.  That is why I am teaming up again today with my good friend Senator Burns to introduce the ``Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act,'' the CANSPAM Act, for short. This bipartisan legislation says that if you want to send unsolicited marketing e-mail, you've got to play by a set of rules, rules that allow consumers to see where the messages are coming from, and to tell the sender stop. The basic goal is simple: give the consumer more control.  Specifically, our bill would require a sender of any marketing e-mail to include a working return address, so that the recipient can send a reply e-mail demanding not to receive any further messages. A spammer would be prohibited from sending further messages to a consumer that has told it to stop.  The bill also would prohibit spammers from using falsified or deceptive headers or subject lines, so that consumers will be able to tell where their marketing e-mails are coming from.  The bill includes strong enforcement provisions to ensure compliance. Spammers that intentionally disguise their identities would be subject to misdemeanor criminal penalties. The Federal Trade Commission would have authority to impose civil fines. State attorneys general would be able to bring suit on behalf of the citizens of their states. And Internet service providers would be able to bring suit to keep unlawful spam off of their networks. In all cases, particularly high penalties would be available for true ``bad actors''--the shady, high-volume spammers who have no intention of behaving in a lawful and responsible manner.  Our goal here is not to discourage legitimate online communications with consumers. Senator Burns and I have no intention of interfering with a company's ability to use e-mail to inform customers of warranty information, provide account holders with monthly account statements, and so forth. Rather, we want to go after those unscrupulous individuals who use e-mail to annoy and mislead. I believe this bill strikes that important balance.  Senator Burns and I have worked with a number of different groups in shaping this legislation, and we believe we have made real progress in addressing some concerns that were raised about the spam bill we proposed last year. We feel that the version of the bill we introduce today is a workable, common-sense approach. I am pleased that Senators Lieberman, Landrieu, Torricelli, Breaux, and Murkowski are cosponsoring this bill today, and I look forward to working with them and the rest of my Senate colleagues to see that the bill moves forward as quickly as possible.                                 ______                                       By
