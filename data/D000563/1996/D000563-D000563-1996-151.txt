Speaker, continuing to reserve my right to object, I think it is clear that one of the reasons this temporary spending bill is being brought to the floor is to avoid any debate over no budget, no pay, to make sure that this House does not go on record on the proposition as to whether or not Members of Congress will continue to take recesses and vacations, will continue to receive paychecks while this group of Republicans decides that 280,000 Federal employees will be furloughed and hundreds of thousands of innocent people will be penalized by the strategy. That is part of the strategy behind this temporary spending bill.
