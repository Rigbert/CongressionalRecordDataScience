One additional question, which this is sort of a follow-up on what I have just discussed. In the past, as the gentleman knows, we have had a number of substitutes which have been offered. Our Congressional Black Caucus has offered substitutes, our Blue Dog Caucus has offered substitutes, and I know the gentleman will be happy to hear that it is fully my expectation that the minority on the Committee on the Budget will have a Democratic alternative. I noted that the gentleman urges us to do that; and he and I share that view, and we are going to do that. But will we be allowed, Mr. Leader, to offer those substitutes as we have in the past as well as offer amendments that are requested?  I realize the gentleman cannot answer to all the amendments, because I do not know what amendments will be asked for; but will there be consideration of valid amendments that have broad-based support?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will further yield.
