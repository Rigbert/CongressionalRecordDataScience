President, among the most gratifying aspects of the confirmation of Justice Sonia Sotomayor for me was meeting her mother Celina. Anyone who knows their story knows how much Justice Sotomayor owes to her mother. She paid tribute to her mother during her opening statement at the confirmation hearing last month when she poignantly said: ``I want to make one special note of thanks to my Mom. I am here today because of her aspirations and sacrifices for both my brother Juan and me. Mom, I love that we are sharing this together.''  One of the good things about the hearing was that Americans were able to meet Celina Sotomayor, a woman admired across America. I will never forget her own participation at that hearing. She sat just behind her daughter, nodding in agreement when her daughter spoke. She followed the questions and answers, the give-and-take. She was focused, protective and justifiably proud of her daughter.  Justice Sotomayor's story is her story too. Justice Sotomayor's triumph is her triumph too. This confirmation is the realization of the American dream that she lived and for which she worked, sacrificed and overcame adversity. She is an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
