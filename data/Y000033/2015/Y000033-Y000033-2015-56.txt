Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of an Alaskan pioneer, a lifelong dedicated civil servant and volunteer, Mrs. Kathleen ``Mike'' Dalton. Life was not easy in any way for the pioneers of Alaska; only the strong in heart and mind would thrive in such an unforgiving environment. Mike's life epitomizes the spirit of resilience and strength which advanced an early Alaskan frontier.   As a young girl, Mike moved to Alaska in 1949. She began her lifelong involvement in politics and public service in 1962, and quickly became the backbone of the Fairbanks Republican Women. She has proudly served in numerous political positions throughout her life, and played an integral role in the office of Senator Ted Stevens.   Civic service was only one effort of the Dalton family. Mike's husband, Jim was instrumental to advancing U.S. energy and defense as a pioneer engineer of the early oil exploration efforts in the Arctic and the Distant Early Warning radar line (DEW line). Both of which made a great impact to the nation.   On a personal note, the Daltons have always treated me as one of their own. I will never forget the many times they opened their house off Dalton Trail to my late wife Lu, my daughters and me. I will always cherish the memories, friendship and unwavering support we've shared over the years. Alaska would be a different place without Mike, and it is only fitting that she be recognized for all her efforts.                          ____________________
