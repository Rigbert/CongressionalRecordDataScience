 President, I want to congratulate the chairman for reporting out a bill that provides funding for many important programs, while at the same time moving toward our goal of balancing the budget. Of particular interest to me, this bill funds the activities of the Federal Communications Commission which is currently undertaking the important task of implementing the historic Telecommunications Act of 1996.  Mr. President, I would like to raise a concern that many of us have relating to the FCC's implementation of the act, and I would therefore ask the indulgence of the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee to allow me to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the authorizing committee, the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
