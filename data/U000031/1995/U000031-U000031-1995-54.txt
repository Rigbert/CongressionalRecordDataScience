 Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I very much am pleased with what the gentleman has to say. I have been listening to the other side of the aisle have a long litany of things that they have been making comments about and so forth.  My judgment on this is like yours. This is maximum flexibility. There is no way anybody loses. Everybody gains by this. Local communities get to decide this themselves, rather than our making those decisions for them. Yes, as I heard one of the gentleman over there say, I did say earlier that the 100,000 cops on the streets appears to be the President's pet project. If there is any politics in this, it is trying on his part and on some of the Democrats' part trying to keep that 100,000 cops on the street image out there.  In reality, there never were going 100,000 cops anyway, because most communities in this country cannot afford to pay the additional cost it takes to get that kind of police officer on the streets. They do not have the money to do that. And in the end, the net result is what we are proposing today, to let every community share in this, if they are a high-crime-rate community, particularly, to do it if they want to do, they can get a cop if they want, they can get a police car if they want, or they can use it for prevention if they have a desire to do that, instead of getting a policeman, which is a much preferable way, and that is the way the Washington Post editorialized that way this morning, saying let us not hang up on this, on politics, on veto, et cetera. The commonsense thing to do is [[Page H1719]] to let the flexibility reign, which is what we do in our proposal.
