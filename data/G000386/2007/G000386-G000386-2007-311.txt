 President, I am pleased to join my colleague today, Senator Feinstein, in introducing the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act of 2007. I believe we have a moral obligation in this country to ensure our young people have every opportunity to grow up without being accosted by drug pushers at every turn, whether on TV, in the movies, or on the way to school.  This important legislation comes in response to the recent warnings issued by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Office of National Drug Control Policy of candy-flavored meth and other illegal drugs being colored, packaged, and flavored in ways that appear to be designed to attract use by children and minors. As co-chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I can tell you that the most at-risk population for drug abuse is our young people. Research has shown time and again that if you can keep a child drug-free until they turn 20, chances are very slim that they will ever try or become addicted. Unfortunately, unscrupulous drug dealers are all too aware of statistics like these and have developed new techniques and marketing gimmicks to lure in younger users. As a parent and now grandparent, this is extremely worrisome.  Last year, we worked to pass the Combat Meth Act into law. Since that time, the number of clandestine meth lab seizures have dropped dramatically across the country. By placing the essential ingredient pseudoephedrine behind the counter, we have lifted a heavy burden from the shoulders of our local law enforcement and made our communities a safer place to live and raise a family. In my home State of Iowa alone, the number of seizures fell a remarkable 73 percent since the sale of pseudoephearine was restricted. But as anyone can tell you, we have a long way to go.  Despite our best efforts and recent success, meth continues to wreak havoc on families and communities across the country. While local ``mom and pop'' meth labs are being dismantled everywhere, drug dealers continue to look for new ways to market their poison. This legislation is intended to protect our young people by expanding existing penalties for those marketing their poison to kids.  Currently Federal law enhances Federal penalties for selling drugs to anyone under the age of 21. When a violation occurs, the Federal penalties are doubled--tripled for a repeat offense--and a mandatory minimum of at least 1 year also applies. However, only the dealer who directly sells drugs to someone under 21 is subject to a double sentence.  The Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act would expand the circumstances under which these enhanced penalties apply. Under our bill, the enhanced penalties that already exist would also apply to anyone who ``manufactures, creates, distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute a controlled substance that is flavored, colored, packaged or otherwise altered in a way that is designed to make it more appealing to a person under 21 years of age, or who attempts or conspires to do so.''  The fight against meth and other dangerous drugs is and will continue to be an ongoing struggle. We must adapt and change our tactics just as the dealers, distributors, and pushers have changed theirs. We must do all we can to protect the most vulnerable among us and send a clear message to those wishing to prey on our youth.  I ask that my colleagues join us in support of this important legislation and pass the Drug Endangered Children Act of 2007.                                 ______                                       By
