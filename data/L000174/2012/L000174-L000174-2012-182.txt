President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion be withdrawn and that the time be equally divided between now and the hour of 5:30 in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.
