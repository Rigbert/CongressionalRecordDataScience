 President, I believe I am to be recognized by unanimous consent directly following the tributes to Senator Corzine. I would like to give my heartfelt thanks to the Senator from New Jersey. He has been indeed a good Senator. His tenure here has distinguished him. That is clearly recognized by people of New Jersey. I believe he is going to be a great Governor for that great State.
