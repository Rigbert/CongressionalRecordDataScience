In the last 2 days, there has been a lot of discussion on the Senate floor about the medical malpractice crisis in this country that involves an increasing incidence of medical malpractice. In fact, the Bush administration says it has reached epidemic proportions.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, what in his bill, S. 11, would deal with the problem in his home State of Nevada, reported by Business Week on March 3 of this year, in which they reported that in his home State of Nevada, which adopted a $350,000 cap on recovery last year, it was discovered that two doctors in his State were responsible for $14 million of the $22 million in claims awarded in Nevada in 1 year? What in this legislation would make certain that those doctors, guilty of malpractice, would be held accountable for their wrongdoing and would be removed from practice if, in fact, they are not meeting the standards of professional conduct?
