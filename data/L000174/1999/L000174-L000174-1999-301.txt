President, the Supreme Court ended its term last week with a trio of deeply disturbing decisions regarding the role of the States and Congress in our federal system. In Alden v. Maine, the Court made it impossible for State employees to enforce their rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which for decades has guaranteed public and private employees nationwide a fair minimum wage.  In College Savings Bank, the Court deprived private parties of the ability to enforce federal unfair competition law against the States. And in Florida Prepaid, the Court held that Congress can execute its constitutional mandate to protect patents as against States only if the Court is satisfied that there is a sufficient ``pattern of constitutional violations'' of patent rights by the States. The Court also made an unprecedented suggestion about how we must write legislation: that we must expressly invoke a constitutional provision before it will honor our authority to legislate.  These three decisions, all by the same bare majority, are disturbing on three fronts. First, they seem to be premised on obsolete notions of natural law, with no basis in the text of the Constitution, and they expressly depart from established constitutional precedent. Second, they will make it harder for ordinary Americans to enforce their federally-protected rights against States. Third, they will make it far more difficult for Congress to enforce uniform policies on matters of national concern.  Justice Souter has eloquently explained how the Court's decisions will harm individuals. Dissenting in the Alden case, Justice Souter pointed out that the majority's decision left Maine's employees with a federal right to get paid for overtime work, but no way to enforce it. This flies in the face of logic, precedent, and common sense. As every first-year law student knows, where there is a right, there must be a remedy.  The maintenance of State sovereignty is clearly a matter of great importance. For this reason, I have been critical of the increasing intrusion of federal regulation into areas traditionally reserved to the States.  In particular, I have expressed concern about the seemingly uncontrollable impulse to react to the latest headline-grabbing criminal caper with a new federal prohibition. This Congress has also extended the federalization of State laws to civil law matters traditionally the province of the States, as in the Y2K bill. But though I watch the federalization of the law with concern, I cannot agree with the Court's decisions, which privilege States' rights over those of both the individual citizen and the federal Government. It is one thing to say that Congress should forbear from interfering in areas that are adequately regulated by the States; it is quite another thing to say that Congress may not exercise its constitutionally-delegated authority even when the national interest so demands.  We on the Senate Judiciary Committee hear a good deal of rhetoric about judicial activism. Here we have the real thing. The Court's so-called conservatives, who routinely limit individual constitutional rights on the basis of supposed strict adherence to the constitutional text, have suddenly developed a natural law concept of State sovereignty that even they admit has no basis in the constitutional text.  These conservative activists have reached out to overrule solid legal precedent. Thirty-five years ago, in Parden v. Terminal Railway Company, the Court held that States may lose their immunity by engaging in ordinary commercial ventures. This makes a good deal of sense.  Why should States that choose to act outside their core sovereign powers and compete in the marketplace get an edge over their regulated private competitors? Certainly, nothing in the Constitution suggests that they should. By overruling Parden, the Court's ``conservatives'' abandoned all pretense of judicial restraint.  Let me turn now to the flip-side of the Court's new emphasis on States' rights. In strengthening the power of the States, the Court has weakened the power of Congress and the federal Government.  We should, I believe, pay particular attention to the Court's restrictive reading of Congress's authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.  This amendment grants the Congress the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, federal constitutional rights. Last week, for the second time in as many years, the Court invalidated an Act of Congress because of the perceived deficiency of the legislativerecord. The Court held, in effect, that Congress may not exercise its power pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment unless it justifies itself, in advance, to the satisfaction of the federal courts. This demonstrates a breathtaking lack of respect for a co-equal branch of Government. Congress is not an administrative agency, and it should not be required to dot every ``i'' and cross every ``t'' before taking action in the public interest.  The Court's ``no-deference'' approach could complicate a broad range of current legislative initiatives. I will note just two that are of critical importance to me: civil rights and intellectual property.  The Religious Liberty Protection Act, which was recently reported by the House Judiciary Committee, is an important congressional effort to protect religious liberty after the Court struck down our previous attempt in the 1997 City of Boerne case. To the extent that any new bill rests on our authority under the Fourteenth Amendment, we must now do the work of an administrative agency to develop an evidentiary record that will satisfy the Supreme Court.  The end-of-term decisions will also make it harder for Congress to design a uniform system that will apply throughout the nation to protect important intellectual property interests. Intellectual property rights are deeply rooted in the Constitution, which provides in Article I that ``The Congress shall have power . . . [t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' I have worked hard over the years to provide the creators and inventors of copyrighted and patented works with the protection they may need in our global economy.  Yet, the Court's decisions will have far-reaching consequences about how these intellectual property rights may be protected against even egregious infringements and violations by the States. For example, in light of the Court's decisions, will Congress now have to write one law for private universities, libraries and educational institutions, while State-run institutions are free to do whatever they please. This is a matter that Chairman Hatch and I will have to examine closely in the Judiciary Committee as we consider a host of intellectual property matters ranging from distance education, database protection, cyberpiracy of domain names, and others.  The Court's new conception of federalism poses an interesting challenge to Congress. Over the coming years, we can expect a flurry of lawsuits aimed at testing the limits of last week's rulings and of this body's legislative authority. In fact, the Court has already agreed to decide next term whether States are immune from suits charging that they have violated the federal law against age discrimination and whether they may be sued for defrauding the federal government.  I have risen to discuss the Court's end-of-term decisions for two reasons. First, I agree with the four dissenting Justices that these decisions are an egregious case of judicial activism and a misapplication of the Constitution. The four dissenters expressed their belief that the Court's new direction will eventually be reversed. I hope this is so. In the interim, however, we need to determine what means remain to Congress to fulfill the promise of the Constitution, which guarantees national supremacy to federal law and to federally-protected rights.  At least three paths remain open to us. First, Congress can require States to waive their immunity from suit as a condition of receiving federal funds. Second, since the States are not immune from suit by the federal Government, Congress can empower federal authorities to collect damages on behalf of private citizens whose federal rights have been violated by States. Third, Congress can give more emphasis to preventative remedies, since nothing in the Court's decisions affects the ability of individuals to sue States for injunctive relief.  I urge all Senators to study the Court's decisions. We need to work together with a clear understanding of the Court's new constitutional order.                          ____________________
