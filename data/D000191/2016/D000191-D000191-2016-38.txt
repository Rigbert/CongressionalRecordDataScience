Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The last few speakers have made a great point--how critical this bill is--and they have listed projects that are important to their districts and the Nation. The gentleman from Alaska said we shouldn't quibble over details.  Well, the bottom line is we have assessed a tax on all imported goods. That tax is collected every day. It is essentially a sales tax. It is added into the price of the goods that Americans buy. That tax comes in at about $1.6 billion a year; and yet Congress sees fit to spend somewhere around $1.1 billion a year, even though the Corps of Engineers has a $64 billion backlog. So I guess, at some point, 100 years from now--well, no, because things will keep deteriorating. I guess we will never catch up.  So taking out the creation of the harbor maintenance trust fund, something I have been working on for 20 years--started with the previous chairman, Bud Shuster, and now Bill Shuster supports the concept--we keep hearing tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. Tomorrow came. It came out of committee. But because some appropriators and the chair of the Budget Committee object to using the taxes collected from the American people for the only lawfully intended purpose and, instead, disappearing it into the maw of the Federal Government, it got stripped out of the bill--very, very unfortunate. That means these critical projects you are talking about are going to the back of a very, very, very long line. $64 billion today, pass the bill, another $10 billion, $74 billion tomorrow; and we will chip away at it, and very, very slowly if we continue to divert the trust funds.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
