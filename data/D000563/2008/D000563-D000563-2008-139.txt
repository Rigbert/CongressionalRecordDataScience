I did. Then Senator Gramm came over and represented the State of Texas in the Senate. For the longest time, Senator Phil Gramm was the economic adviser to John McCain, not just on a campaign basis but on a personal basis. They shared a lot of thinking together. It was Phil Gramm's inspiration that moved us to this moment now where we have a lack of oversight, a lack of accountability when it comes to basic investments and credit institutions. The Gramm-McCain view of the world was government should step aside and get out of the way for the magic of capitalism and the magic of the free market. There is no question that the entrepreneurial spirit is a major part of the success of America, but time and again in history we have seen that if there is not a government entity involved in oversight, demanding accountability, many times the forces in the market go to extremes.  What we have seen in the last 2 weeks are the extremes of the Phil Gramm-John McCain approach to regulation. In fact, Senator McCain prided himself by saying he was one of the leading deregulators in the Senate. In the last couple days, as companies have been crashing and taxpayers have been picking up the bills, he now says he favors regulation. I ask the Senator, isn't this part of the same mindset, privatizing Social Security, privatizing health care, and basically removing the government from market operations that can ultimately damage investors, savers, retirees, and the taxpayers?
