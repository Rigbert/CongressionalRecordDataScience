 President, among the unfinished business before the Senate is the consideration of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. I am asking today for unanimous consent to approve this legislation with a managers' amendment worked out both with vice chairman Chambliss and the chairman and ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in consultation with the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees.  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported its Fiscal Year 2013 bill, S. 3454, with its accompanying report, S. Rpt. 112-192, on July 30, 2012 by a vote of 14-1. The bill and report have been publicly available since it was reported. The classified annex reported from the Committee was also available for all Senators to review in the Committee's office.  S. 3454 as reported from our Committee was not without controversy, especially with regard to provisions in the bill that were meant to address the wholly unacceptable and large-scale disclosures of classified information to the media.  Since the bill was reported out, the Committee has received thoughtful comments from our colleagues, media organizations, and from organizations that advocate for greater governmental transparency. As a result of these comments, and technical suggestions received from the Executive Branch, we have decided to remove ten of the twelve sections in the title of the original bill that addressed unauthorized disclosures of classified information so that we might ensure enactment this year of the important other provisions of the bill.  Unfortunately, I am certain that damaging leaks of classified information will continue, and so the Committee will need to continue to look for acceptable ways to address this problem.  Let me briefly describe the managers' amendment and where we have made modifications in what was reported from the Committee.  As always, the intelligence authorization bill has two pieces: the legislative text, which is unclassified, and a classified annex that contains the Committee's authorization of intelligence spending.  The bill contains a number of legislative provisions requested by the Administration to give the intelligence community the authorities and flexibilities it needs to continue protecting the American people and providing policymakers information for foreign policy and security decisions, as well as for the effective and appropriate functioning of our intelligence apparatus.  Among other things, this bill includes:  Repeal of four recurring reporting requirements burdensome to Intelligence Community agencies when the information in such reports is duplicative, or is provided to the Congress through other means. We regularly hear from intelligence officials that they spend so much time writing reports that it interferes with collection, analysis, and management of intelligence activities.  Modification of personnel authorities to facilitate more ``joint duty'' assignments within the Intelligence Community that will create shared knowledge across different elements of the IC.  These provisions, and several others that are mainly technical in nature, were requested by the director of National Intelligence and incorporated into the bill.  Other sections were initiated by the Committee to assist Congressional oversight efforts. These include, for example, a requirement for corrective action plans to be developed to addressthe issue of improper payments made by intelligence agencies. We also require notification to the congressional intelligence committees under certain circumstances with respect to certain disclosures of national intelligence information.  As this managers' amendment represents the combined efforts of the Senate and House, we have also included three provisions from the House-passed bill which were not in the Committee's original bill. These address security clearance reciprocity, subcontractor business opportunities in the Intelligence Community, and a report on supply chain vulnerabilities.  I am attaching at the end of this statement a section-by-section analysis that describes each of the sections of this managers' amendment.  It is my hope that the provisions in this bill will continue to aid the Intelligence Community as it conducts its missions, ensure better stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and support the thousands of civilians and military employees who work throughout the Intelligence Community.  As I mentioned, this managers' amendment also includes modifications to the classified annex and the Schedule of Authorizations, modified to represent the consensus of both congressional intelligence committees. I am unable to describe in detail the Committee's classified schedule and annex, but it is available to all Senators for their review in the Committee's spaces. The Committee has sought to ensure that funding is authorized to continue and enhance important intelligence collection and analysis programs, covert actions, and counterintelligence. At the same time, we have cut funding for programs that were functioning poorly or at expenditure rates below expectations, and to shift funding from lower priorities to higher ones.  As always, the Committee has held numerous hearings and briefings on the President's spending request. As was announced in late October, intelligence spending decreased slightly in Fiscal Year 2012, and that trend will continue in Fiscal Year 2013. Our annex contains an overall funding level that is very close to the President's request, and we have attempted to find places to reduce spending that will not sacrifice any important work of the intelligence agencies.  I believe we have addressed all of the concerns that have been brought to our attention by our colleagues and the public. I thus urge passage of this managers' amendment and enactment of this important legislation before the end of the session.  I ask unanimous consent that the section by section analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              Section-by-Section Analysis and Explanation       The following is a section-by-section analysis and      explanation of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal      Year 2013.              TITLE I--BUDGET AND PERSONNEL AUTHORIZATIONS     Section 101. Authorization of appropriations       Section 101 lists the United States Government departments,      agencies, and other elements for which the Act authorizes      appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related      activities for Fiscal Year 2013.     Section 102. Classified Schedule of Authorizations       Section 102 provides that the details of the amounts      authorized to be appropriated for intelligence and      intelligence-related activities and the applicable personnel      levels by program for Fiscal Year 2013 are contained in the      classified Schedule of Authorizations and that the classified      Schedule of Authorizations shall be made available to the      Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of      Representatives and to the President.     Section 103. Personnel ceiling adjustments       Section 103 is intended to provide additional flexibility      to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in managing      the civilian personnel of the Intelligence Community. Section      103(a) provides that the DNI may authorize employment of      civilian personnel in Fiscal Year 2013 in excess of the      number of authorized positions by an amount not exceeding 3      percent of the total limit applicable to each Intelligence      Community element under Section 102. The DNI may do so only      if necessary to the performance of important intelligence      functions.       Section 103(b) requires the DNI to establish guidelines      that would ensure a uniform and accurate method of counting      certain personnel. The DNI has issued such a policy.      Subsection (b) confirms in statute the obligation of the DNI      to establish these guidelines.       The DNI must report the decision to allow an Intelligence      Community element to exceed the personnel ceiling in advance      to the congressional intelligence committees.     Section 104. Intelligence Community Management Account       Section 104 authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence      Community Management Account (ICMA) of the DNI and sets the      authorized personnel levels for the elements within the ICMA      for Fiscal Year 2013.       Subsection (a) authorizes appropriations of $540,721,000      for Fiscal Year 2013 for the activities of the ICMA.      Subsection (b) authorizes 835 positions for elements within      the ICMA for Fiscal Year 2013 and provides that personnel      serving in such elements may be permanent employees of the      Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) or      detailed from other elements of the United States Government.       Subsection (c) authorizes additional appropriations and      personnel for the classified Community Management Account as      specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations and      permits the funding for advanced research and development to      remain available through September 30, 2014. TITLE II--CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY SYSTEM     Section 201. Authorization of appropriations       Section 201 authorizes appropriations in the amount of      $514,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2013 for the Central      Intelligence Agency (CIA) Retirement and Disability Fund.           TITLE III--GENERAL INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY MATTERS     Section 301. Restriction on conduct of intelligence          activities       Section 301 provides that the authorization of      appropriations by the Act shall not be deemed to constitute      authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity that      is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of      the United States.     Section 302. Increase in employee compensation and benefits          authorized by law       Section 302 provides that funds authorized to be      appropriated by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and      other benefits for federal employees may be increased by such      additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for      increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law.     Section 303. Non-reimbursable details       Section 303 amends Section 113A of the National Security      Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 404h-1) to increase the length of time      an officer or employee of the federal government can be      detailed to the staff of an element of the Intelligence      Community funded through the National Intelligence Program      (NIP) from two years to three. In addition, Section 303      clarifies that a non-reimbursable detail made under Section      113A shall not be considered an augmentation of the      appropriations of the receiving element of the Intelligence      Community.       The DNI requested that an extension of the length of      service from two years to three years be made for members of      the Armed Forces detailed to an element of Intelligence      Community. This request was intended to align Section 113A      with requirements for joint duty assignments among the      military. Section 664(a) of Title 10 provides that joint duty      assignments for military officers, other than general and      flag officers, shall be no less than three years. Section 303      provides the flexibility of a three-year length of service to      civilian employees as well as military officers.     Section 304. Automated insider threat detection program       Section 304 extends by one year the milestones for      establishment of an automated insider threat detection      program under Section 402 of the Intelligence Authorization      Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 112-18). The      administration had requested a two-year extension of the      milestone for ``initial operating capability'' and a three-     year extension of the milestone for ``full operating      capability.'' The one-year extensions are intended to ensure      that the Intelligence Community moves more rapidly toward      establishment of this program.     Section 305. Software licensing       Section 305 requires the chief information officer for an      element of the Intelligence Community to conduct an inventory      of software licenses held by such element, including those      utilized and unutilized, by the element. This inventory is to      be conducted in consultation with the Chief Information      Officer of the Intelligence Community (CIO) and completed      within 120 days of enactment. Not later than 180 days after      enactment, the CIO shall provide the congressional      intelligence committees with a copy of the reports along with      any comments the CIO wishes to provide. The CIO shall      transmit any portion of a report involving a component of a      department of the U.S. government to the congressional      committees with jurisdiction over such department      simultaneously with submission of such report to the      congressional intelligence committees.     Section 306. Strategy for security clearance reciprocity       Section 306 requires the President to develop a strategy      and process for carrying out the requirements of section      3001(d) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention      Act of 2004, which concerns reciprocity of security clearance      access determinations across agencies.     Section 307. Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act          of 2010 compliance       Section 307 requires the DNI and the directors of the CIA,      the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the National      Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the National      Security Agency (NSA) each to develop a corrective action      plan, with major milestones, that delineates how such      agencies will achieve compliance with the Improper Payments      Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010, not later than      September 30, 2013. Section 307(b) requires the relevant      inspectors general to review the corrective action plan and      assess whether it is likely to lead to compliance. Each      assessment is to be provided to the congressional      intelligence committees. The corrective action plans and      inspector general assessments involving the DIA, NGA, and NSA      shall also be submitted to the armed services committees of      the Senate and House of Representatives.     Section 308. Subcontractor notification process       Section 308 requires the DNI to submit a report to the      congressional intelligence committees assessing the method by      which contractors at any tier under a contract entered into      with an element of the Intelligence Community are granted      security clearances and notified of classified contracting      opportunities within the Federal Government and      recommendations for the improvement of such method.     Section 309. Modification of reporting schedule       Section 309 changes the dates by which the inspectors      general of the Intelligence Community and the CIA are      required to prepare and submit semiannual reports on the      activities of their offices from a calendar year basis to a      fiscal year basis. This change will align these reporting      requirements with the reporting requirements of other      inspectors general in the Intelligence Community and      facilitate joint audits, inspections and investigations.     Section 310. Repeal of certain reporting requirements       Congress frequently requests information from the      Intelligence Community in the form of reports, the contents      of which are specifically defined by statute. The reports      prepared pursuant to these statutory requirements provide      Congress with an invaluable source of information about      specific matters of concern.       Congressional reporting requirements, and particularly      recurring reporting requirements, can place a significant      burden on the resources of the Intelligence Community. In      some cases, annual reports can be replaced with briefings or      notifications that provide the Congress with more timely      information and offer the Intelligence Community a direct      line of communication to respond to congressional concerns.       In response to a request from the DNI, Section 310      eliminates four reports that were burdensome to the      Intelligence Community when the information in the reports      could be obtained through other means or was no longer      considered relevant to current concerns.     TITLE IV--MATTERS RELATING TO THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY     Section 401. Working capital fund amendments       Section 401 amends Section 21 of the Central Intelligence      Agency Act of 1949 (50 U.S.C. 403u) to provide authority for      the service providers under the CIA Central Services Program      to use resources to make their services known to their      authorized customer base through government communication      channels, but clarifies this authority shall not be used to      distribute gifts or promotional items. In addition, Section      401 authorizes service providers to deposit receipts from the      sale of their recyclable materials into the CIA working      capital fund.                         TITLE V--OTHER MATTERS     Section 501. Homeland Security Intelligence Program       Section 501 establishes the Homeland Security Intelligence      Program (HSIP) within the Department of Homeland Security for      activities of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA)      that serve predominantly a departmental mission. The OIA is      currently funded through the NIP.     Section 502. Extension of National Commission for the Review          of the Research and Development Programs of the United          States Intelligence Community       Section 502 extends the date by which the National      Commission for the Review of the Research and Development      Programs of the United States Intelligence Community is      required to submit a report on its findings from ``not later      than one year after the date on which all members of the      Commission are appointed pursuant to Section 701(a)(3) of the      Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010'' to not      later than March 31, 2013, which is effectively one year      after the Commission was able to begin its review. The      extension was requested by the co-chairs of the Commission.     Section 503. Protecting the information technology supply          chain of the United States       Section 503 requires the DNI to submit to the congressional      intelligence committees a report that identifies foreign      suppliers of information technology that are linked directly      or indirectly to a foreign government and assesses the      vulnerability to malicious activity of the telecommunications      networks of the United States due to the presence of      technology produced by such foreign suppliers.     Section 504. Notification regarding the authorized public          disclosure of national intelligence       Section 504 requires government officials responsible for      making certain authorized disclosures of national      intelligence or intelligence related to national security to      notify the congressional intelligence committees on a timely      basis with respect to such disclosures. On a timely basis in      this instance does not mean at the exact same time but should      be sufficiently timely to keep the committees fully and      currently informed.       This provision is intended to ensure that the intelligence      committees are made aware of authorized disclosures of      national intelligence or intelligence related to national      security that are made to media personnel or likely to appear      in the press, so that, among other things, these authorized      disclosures may be distinguished from unauthorized ``leaks.''       Section 504(c) provides that the notification requirement      does not apply to a disclosure made pursuant to statutory      requirements, in connection with civil, criminal or      administrative proceedings, as a result of a declassification      review process under Executive Order 13526, or to cleared      government representatives with a need to know.       Section 504(e) provides a one-year sunset for the      notification requirement in this section.     Section 505. Technical amendments related to the Office of          the Director of National Intelligence       Sections 2302 and 3132 of Title 5 of the United States Code      exclude from the definition of ``agency'' under those      chapters certain specifically listed agencies such as the      CIA. In addition, Sections 2302 and 3132 exclude from the      definition of ``agency'' those executive agencies that the      President determines have as their principal function ``the      conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence      activities.'' Section 505 amends the definition of agency in      Sections 2302 and 3132 to expressly identify the ODNI as an      agency excluded from the definition of ``agency'' under those      chapters.     Section 506. Technical amendment for definition of          intelligence agency       Title VI of the National Security Act of 1947 imposes      criminal penalties for the disclosure of the identity of      covert agents of an intelligence agency. The current      definition of an ``intelligence agency'' does not include the      counterintelligence elements of the Department of Defense or      the intelligence and counterintelligence components of other      elements of the Intelligence Community despite the fact that      these components may be conducting counterintelligence      operations jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation      or under their own independent authority. Section 506 thus      amends Section 606(5) of the National Security Act of 1947      (50 U.S.C. 426) to revise the definition of ``intelligence      agency'' to include all elements of the Intelligence      Community, as found in Section 3(4) of the National Security      Act.     Section 507. Budgetary effects       Section 507 provides that the budgetary effects of this      Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-     You-Go-Act of 2010, shall be determined by reference to the      latest statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO      Legislation'' for this Act, submitted for printing in the      Congressional Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget      Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted      prior to the vote on passage.                          ____________________
