Speaker, as the 104th Congress considers changes to the unemployment compensation [UC] system, I would like to bring to your attention a recent speech by Leon Lynch, Vice President of the United Steelworkers of America. Mr. Lynch's views, which focus on the unemployment insurance reforms recommended by the Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation, were delivered to the National Foundation for Unemployment Compensation and Workers Compensation last month in Atlanta. These remarks provide an important viewpoint that should become part of the debate over UC reform.   Remarks of Leon Lynch to the National Foundation for Unemployment                  Compensation and Workers Compensation       The focus of my presentation today is unemployment      insurance reforms recommended by the Advisory Council on      Unemployment Compensation. To date, the Council has issued      two reports containing a number of recommendations to improve      our unemployment insurance program. The Council's major      recommendations are focused on bringing the unemployment      insurance system more into line with the realities of the      1990s economy and labor market. I believe they deserve the      support of business and labor, and I want to explain why.       Since I joined the Advisory Council only late last summer,      I did not directly participate in the adoption of the      recommendations of the first report, which dealt mostly with      the reform of the extended Benefits (EB) program. The second      Council report, released in February 1995, focused broadly on      the regular UI program. I was on board last year and I voted      in favor of the recommendations of that report. The third and      final report, due in February 1996, will focus on the      administrative aspects of UI.       In all honesty, I am continuing to learn about our      unemployment compensation system from the testimony presented      by witnesses at Advisory Council meetings, the briefing      papers prepared by Advisory Council staff, discussions among      the Advisory Council, and meetings such as this. I have      enjoyed my participation in the work of the Advisory Council      and I hope to work for the adoption of the Council's      recommendations at both the federal and state levels.       Having admitted that I am not an unemployment insurance      expert, however, should not be taken as less than my full      endorsement of the recommendations of the Advisory Council to      date. You don't need a Ph.D to understand that our UI system      is neither serving the needs of unemployed workers nor      employers as well as it should.       As a trade union leader, I have long understood the      terrible human impact of the defects in our UI system. These      defects are much clearer to close observers. If you haven't      done so, I encourage you to review the Advisory Council      reports. They contain many more facts supporting the      Council's recommendations than I can cover today. I hope you      will take the time to review the reports since even those      who regularly deal with UI will find a fair and impartial      review of all aspects of the UI program.       I often hear employer representatives claim that our UI      system isn't broken. I challenge you to read the reports with      an open mind and come away with anything but a conclusion      that, in key respects, our UI system can be improved and made      to work better for all interested parties.       I want to begin my discussion by pointing out some of the      factual findings from the February 1995 Advisory Council      report. Many of you may be generally aware of UI      developments, but I think these particular findings deserve      mention.       First, there's been a serious erosion in the number of      unemployed workers getting UI benefits. The ratio of insured      unemployed workers (those that file a claim and have monetary      eligibility) and the totally unemployed (those who are      unemployed and actively seeking work) is widely used as an      indicator of how many unemployed workers get UI benefits. In      1993, 32 of the 52 jurisdictions had an IU/TU ratio under 33      percent. Twelve states had a ratio of less than 25 percent.      South Dakota had a ratio of 15.3 percent. In other words, the      ratio of unemployed workers getting UI benefits was a third      or less in a majority of the states, and less than 2 in 10 in      South Dakota.       Complaints about the declining proportion of unemployed      workers getting UI have not been met with sympathy by      employers. However, even so-called ``job losers'' are no      longer getting UI benefits at past levels. Job losers fall in      the unemployed workers category which is closest to the      involuntarily unemployed workers who are supposed to get UI--     even according to most employers.       The 1995 report finds a steep decline in receipt of UI      benefits in the ``job losers'' category. In fact, the ratio      of UI claimants to job losers has fallen nearly forty percent      since 1970.       The other reason cited for the reduced number of unemployed      workers getting UI benefits is that eligible workers      apparently aren't applying. While the research on non-     applicants is not as clear as we might wish, on a practical      level there are many things we can do to encourage      potentially eligible UI claimants to apply for benefits.      These include providing better UI claims information to      workers at the time of layoff, permitting electronic and      telephone claims, prohibiting employer retaliation, and      continuing to improve the customer service aspects of agency      claims handling. I believe that the Advisory Council will      consider some of these administrative matters in the coming      year.       Analysts disagree about why the ratio of insured unemployed      workers to totally unemployed workers has fallen, but all      recent studies show that legislative restrictions on UI      eligibility and disqualifications have contributed. The only      argument among the experts is the weight assigned to federal      and state UI law changes as compared to other factors.       In fact, in most states, there are dollar estimates made on      the amount of money to be ``saved'' when legislative      restrictions on UI are passed. Since many of you have pushed      for this so-called ``cost saving'' legislation to reduce the      number of UI benefits recipients in your states, we should      have few claims of innocence in this audience. We in      organized labor are past the point of needing more studies      concerning the reasons for the decline in receipt of UI      benefits. We expect positive action to reverse the decline.       Often, when government is slow to act or fails to act, we      have to looked for solutions elsewhere. That's what we've      done in the Steelworkers--in this and other areas, such as      employment security, pensions and health care.       For the unemployed, we have negotiated supplemental      unemployment benefits--commonly known as SUB. The fair-minded      employers we have contracts with recognize that unemployment      compensation by itself--where it exists--is nowhere near      sufficient to keep a family going.       With SUB, however, circumstances improve substantially.      When one of our members is laid off, SUB will provide      benefits ranging from 70 percent to 90 percent of the      worker's wages. And it provides these benefits for two years.       When the worker is receiving UC, that amount is deducted      from the SUB payment. When UC expires, SUB makes up the      difference. The result is that no matter what the level of UC      is, the worker receives the same percentage of wages.       The rationale is simple: Workers should not suffer for      events over which they have no control. SUB payments help      them to survive until they are recalled to their former jobs,      or until they find new employment.       Even though we are proud of what we have done in this area,      we feel this is an area that is properly the government's      responsibility. Is any that with full knowledge of the      atmosphere in Washington--an atmosphere with which I disagree      completely. But that's a different story for a different      time.       The problem we are dealing with today has its own import,      and I'm pleased that the Advisory Council report this year      makes specific recommendations to reverse the decline      [[Page E1200]] in UI benefits. In the meantime, the various      experts can argue about the weight of factors that cause the      decline.       Let me discuss two recommendations which would start to      move our UI system in a positive direction.       First, the Advisory Council recommends that no state set      its monetary eligibility requirement higher than the      equivalent of 800 hours of work at the state's minimum wage,      with the higher quarter wages requirement no more than 200      hours of minimum wage work. This should encourage states to      resist the trend toward requiring more and more earnings to      gain UI monetary eligibility.       The factual basis for this recommendation was a staff study      of the monetary eligibility provisions of all state UI laws.      This study showed that lower wage workers and part-time      workers with substantial labor market participation still      failed to meet monetary eligibility requirements in some      states. The 800 hour recommendation converts to roughly a      fifteen hour week for a full-year worker. I do not think      these workers have shown so little attachment to the labor      market that we should exclude then entirely from the UI      system and force them onto welfare and Food Stamps.       Another recommendation would begin to move part-time and      low wage workers back onto UI. It is the adoption of a      moveable, or flexible, base period. Under a moveable base      period, workers with insufficient earnings in the first four      of the five completed calendar quarters, can use their      ``lag'' quarter wages to meet the monetary eligibility. In      Vermont, workers can even use the current, or ``filing''      quarter wages, to meet the monetary eligibility standard.       At this time, eight states have some form of flexibility as      to the period over which they measure monetary eligibility      for UI benefits. Six states have a so-called moveable base      period. Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont,      and Washington. California and New York permit different      periods of measurement as well. In 1997, Michigan will adopt      a moveable base period as part of its conversion from a wage      request state to a wage record state.       The rest of the states define their base periods as the      traditional first four of the last five completed quarters.      As a result, wages can be as much as eighteen months old,      depending on when the unemployed worker files and when she or      he worked. A worker who needs his or her ``lag quarter''      wages to meet monetary eligibility standards must wait up to      three months to obtain benefits under the traditional      definition of base period. The moveable, or flexible, base      period permits these workers to gain UI benefits much sooner,      by counting the lag quarter wages toward monetary      eligibility.       The Advisory Council relives that workers needing the      moveable base period to gain UI eligibility have demonstrated      adequate labor market attachment, as defined by each state.      They should not be denied UI benefits solely because of the      distribution of their wages in their base periods. For this      reason, all states should consider the Advisory Council's      moveable base period recommendation. Especially those which      are currently paying UI benefits to very low percentage of      their unemployed workers.       We also believe that the U.S. Department of Labor should      encourage this action. Another important area of Advisory      Council activity has been our examination of state UI trust      fund solvency. Here, I believe the Advisory Council has made      good progress toward increasing the solvency of the UI      system, while maintaining a good deal of state flexibility.       Analysis by the Council staff has shown clearly that states      with lower reserves are much more likely to be forced to      borrow from the feds, raise taxes, or cut UI benefits in a      recession--or a combination of FUTA penalty taxes and      interest payments. Both benefit cuts and increased taxes      during recessions should be avoided. Workers need the      benefits during      any period of unemployment, but especially during a      recession. And employers need the spending boost provided      by UI benefits during a recession, and can least afford a      tax increase during economic downturns.       For this reason, the Advisory Council has recommended that      States avoid so-called, ``pay as you go'' financing, and      provide for forward funding of UI. In other words, during      periods of economic recovery, the state should permit funds      to accumulate in its trust fund for payment later during a      recession.       Rather than debating continuously over the exact level of      reserves that are desirable, the Council compromised on a      level somewhat lower than the 1.5 high cost multiple which      has been historically defined as prudent. There was some      feeling that requiring this level of reserves drew too much      capital out of the economy and was less productive. Instead,      the Council recommended that states maintain a reserve equal      to one year of benefits at the average of the three years of      highest payouts over the past 20 years.       The innovative part of the Council's solvency      recommendation was the suggested use of federal interest      premiums on trust fund deposits over the desired level of      reserve, and interest breaks for states forced to borrow      despite having reached the desired level prior to the      recession. In other words, the Council did not set a      ``federal standard'' for solvency, but, set up a method of      encouraging states to accumulate higher reserves prior to the      next recession.       The Advisory Council also made a number of recommendations      related to the budgetary treatment of UI by the federal      government. For years, both labor and employers have urged      the removal of the UI trust funds from the budget. The      Council recommended that all UI trust funds be removed from      the federal unified budget.       The inclusion of the UI trust funds causes a number of      distortions. Dedicated UI revenues have been treated as      offsets against the budget deficit allowing regular state UI      benefit payments to be counted in federal spending. In      addition, the tightening of administrative funding over the      last several years, and the recent difficulty in getting      supplemental appropriations for unexpected UI workload is a      result of having the UI trust fund in the budget. We say this      must end.       Another result of having UI in the budget is to make it      subject to cost cutting measures designed for budget      balancing, rather than for UI policy. One example is the      federal income taxation of UI benefits. This is nothing more      than a federally imposed reduction in state weekly benefit      amounts. The Council has recommended the repeal of income      taxation on UI benefits.       In the coming year, the Advisory Council will be looking at      administrative financing of UI. Last year, the Council      recommended that the state agencies collect the federal FUTA      taxes used for administrative financing. Currently, the      Internal Revenue Service assesses charges of up to $100      million a year to collect the FUTA revenue, and the states      feel that they are in a position to collect FUTA taxes      without using scare resources.       I believe that administrative financing will be a matter      for continued examination because proper levels of      appropriations and proper use of the administrative funds are      so critical to the UI system. As Bruce Springsteen has said,      ``sooner or later, it all comes down to money''.       Employer support for UI and ES will increase, if they feel      that their FUTA taxes are wisely spent. State agency      employees need and deserve adequate wages and benefits. State      administrators need flexibility and better incentives for      meeting UI program goals. The federal partner needs to better      ensure that service improvements and efficiency are a product      of its financing. And, unemployed workers need pleasant,      accessible, and effective UI and ES offices.       The Advisory Council often refers to the two traditional,      and inter-related, national goals of the UI program. That is,      adequate wage replacement for unemployed workers and economic      stabilization. It is critical that both of these national      goals be met, and that state and federal actions undercutting      these goals be reversed.       Wage replacement at an adequate level of benefits is of      obvious interest to organized labor. But, in addition,      organized labor recognizes that the overall level of workers      getting UI benefits must also be improved. Otherwise, the UI      programs are only a hollow shell, leaving many workers who      have substantial labor market involvement without UI      benefits.      For these reasons, the Advisory Council should consider      methods to encourage states to pay adequate levels of UI      benefits to a higher proportion of unemployed workers in      the coming years. Possible solutions include trust fund      enhancements, administrative funding incentives, and      federal goals for states in these areas.       Let me close with some comments directed to the employer      community and its approach to UI. I believe employers need to      take a broader view of UI than what I usually hear from their      representatives.       The other side of the coin from adequate UI benefits is      economic stabilization. This is the other national goal of      UI, and it still deserves our combined support. It truly      helps employers.       UI benefits buy groceries, pay rent, keep the utilities      connected, and purchase other necessities for unemployed      workers and their families. In other words, all UI benefits      are spent with employers--a fact that some employers have      apparently forgotten. The unemployed worker's pocketbook is      merely a way station for UI benefits on their way to an      employer's bank account.       Most employers are also on fairly thin ice on the cost      issue. Nationally, state UI payroll taxes amounted to .9      percent of total payrolls in 1993. This is not insignificant,      but it is near the historically lowest levels of the early      1970s, and well below the 1.4 percent level reached in the      recession of 1982-1983.       The federal FUTA tax rate is at historic low levels,      amounting to only 36 percent of average wages. This has      severely eroded the actual FUTA tax rate, which has fallen in      relation to inflation since the federal taxable wage base was      last increased in 1983. At that time, the FUTA payroll tax      amounted to $81--today it's $56. So even with the much      maligned .2 percent surcharge, FUTA taxes, in terms of real      dollars, are at the same level as they were in 1970. In 1970,      the net FUTA tax rate was .5 percent and the taxable wage      base was still $3000.       While each employer naturally concerns itself with its      labor costs, employers as a group should recognize that UI      benefits help maintain a stable economy and society. While      $25 billion or so are paid in UI benefits in any given year,      these 25 billion were also spent. And, unlike defense      spending or social security benefits or highway construction      funds, these UI dollars were mostly spent in areas where      unemployment was higher and local employers most needed a      spending boost.       [[Page E1201]] In short, the business approach to UI      doesn't seem to have changed, even though the bad old days of      higher UI taxes and lenient treatment of unemployed workers      are long gone. Whatever the validity of the cost-cutting      approach of the mid-1970s to mid-1980s period, employers,      should rethink their ``cost above all else'' approach to UI.       Especially in the current political climate, the views of      employers are of paramount importance. Unless the policies      advocated by employers change, the downward trend of the past      fifteen or twenty years will continue, and this will have      serious impacts on employers and the larger society--not just      on unemployed workers.       The developments of the last fifteen or twenty years have      undercut the achievement of our national UI goals. This was      mainly due to the effective elimination of the EB program in      1981, the spread of state restrictions on UI eligibility and      the adoption of harsher disqualifications during the 1970s      and 1980s. Meeting these national UI goals is important to      workers and employers. For this reason, favorable action on      the recommendations of the Advisory Council on Unemployment      Compensation is important to employers as well as the rest of      our society. I hope that employers will review their UI      policy positions in light of the Advisory Council's      recommendations. This would be an important step in restoring      the vitality of our UI system.       Thank you, and I look forward to your questions following      the remarks of Bob Mitchell.                               ____________________
