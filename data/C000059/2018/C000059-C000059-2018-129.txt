Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Major Kyle Schull who will receive an honorable discharge from the United States Marine Corps after over eleven years of service. I had the distinct pleasure of hosting Major Schull in my office as a Defense Fellow in 2015. Major Schull's extensive military experience benefited the office tremendously and he offered a unique perspective, was always prepared, and took on any task with a smile.  Major Schull was born in 1984 and grew up with his three younger siblings, Katie, Kari and Collin, in the beautiful, albeit chilly, town of Watertown, South Dakota where his parents, Lee and Jan, still live today. In 2003, Major Schull graduated from Watertown High School.  Upon his graduation, Major Schull was accepted to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, where he earned a B.S. in Political Science. Upon his graduation from the Naval Academy, Kyle was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps.  Following commissioning, Major Kyle Schull served at his first duty station, the Marine Air Control Squadron 4 Okinawa, Japan, from June 2008 through December 2010 as a Logistics Officer. He was then assigned to Combat Logistics Battalion 6; Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where he served as the Future Operations Officer from January 2011 through April 2012. Major Schull was then promoted to Transportation Support Company Commander at Combat Logistics Battalion 6; Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where he remained from April 2012 through February 2014. He was then assigned to Combat Logistics Regiment 2; Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, as the Assistant Regimental Operations Officer from March 2014 through August 2014. In 2014, Major Schull was selected for the Department of Defense Congressional Fellowship Program where he severed as my Defense Fellow in support of California's 42nd Congressional District from January to December of 2015. During his time as my Defense Fellow, he met his lovely future wife, Chelsea Schull. Following his fellowship, he was assigned to be the Staff Secretary and Legislative liaison to the Deputy Commandant of the Marine Corps for Installations and Logistics from January 2016 to May of 2018. He served in an array of positions within Headquarters Marine Corps Installations and Logistics Command and currently serves as the 04xx Occ Field Sponsor and LPC-3 Section Head.  As a civilian, Major Schull enjoys traveling, helping others realize their love of traveling, and hopes to one day see the Pyramids. Kyle is also an entrepreneur at heart and will begin working for his family's company, Building Products, Inc. and Schull Construction Co., after separating from the Marine Corps. I have no doubt that he will succeed in this new phase of his life.  During his time in my office, Kyle focused his efforts on defense acquisition, defense appropriations, the intelligence community, veterans affairs, and many other policy areas. He was an invaluable resource to all my staff and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank his family for supporting him through the years; he truly is one impressive guy. On behalf of everyone in the office, I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Major Schull for all his hard work, his dedicated service to our country and let him know that my office door is always open to him.                          ____________________
