Joseph Beckman as he celebrates an extraordinary milestone, the 100th anniversary of his company, Home Lumber Company, headquartered in Crown Point, Indiana. To commemorate this special occasion, an anniversary celebration took place on Friday, August 24, 2007, at the Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana.  A fifth-generation family-owned business, Home Lumber Company was co-founded by Joe's great-grandfather in 1907. After graduating from Indiana University in 1971, Joe worked outside the company for a brief period before returning to the company in 1973 as a manager in manufacturing, a position he would hold for 8 years. It was during that time that Joe, highly regarded within the company and his community, was elected president of Home Lumber Company in 1979. From there, Joe went on to purchase the company from his father and other stockholders in 1982.  As president and chief executive officer of Home Lumber Company, Joe has been responsible for an overwhelming expansion of the business. While Joe is quick to credit his outstanding staff for the company's success, it is undoubtedly Joe's leadership, as well as his knowledge of, passion for, and commitment to his trade, that has been the catalyst for such improvements. Since taking over the reins, Joe has spearheaded several major expansions, including the addition of a new lumberyard in Stevensville, Michigan, the relocation of its main facility from Dyer, Indiana, to Crown Point, Indiana, which is where Joe now resides, and a new manufacturing facility in Michigan City, Indiana. However, these expansions, while quite impressive, do not appear to be the end of the company's growth. These new additions, paired with Home Lumber Company, have now become the Lumberplus Companies. Throughout his tenure, Joe has not lost sight of the goals of his father and grandfather, as he has continued to build and improve northwest Indiana by developing over 1,000 commercial and industrial properties throughout Lake County.  Aside from his business, Joe has always made it a point to give back to the community through his involvement with various service organizations, including: the Crown Point Community Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, and the Carmelite Home for Girls. Not only has he been active in these endeavors, but he has also taken a leadership role, serving on several of their executive committees and advisory boards. Furthermore, Joe has been active in the economic and educational development of his community through his service in several capacities, including: president of the Dyer Chamber of Commerce, treasurer of the Dyer Economic Development Steering Committee, president of the Dyer Economic Development Committee, treasurer of the Lake Central Multi-District School Building Corporation, and as a member of the Purdue University Calumet Chancellor's Advisory Committee.  For his service and his commitment to improving northwest Indiana, both economically and socially, Joe has received many accolades throughout the years. Joe was the recipient of the 2005 NLBMA Award for Excellence in Human Resources and the 2006 Business Investment Award by the Michigan City Economic Development Corporation. Quite an impressive accomplishment, in 2001, Joe was also named the Northwest Indiana Small Business Person of the Year and Indiana Small Business Person of the Year, a distinction that earned him recognition from President George W. Bush at a White House reception.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Joseph Beckman and his team on the 100th anniversary of Home Lumber Company. Joseph and the entire staff at Home Lumber Company are to be commended for their dedication to improving northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
