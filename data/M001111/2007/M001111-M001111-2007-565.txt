 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand adjourned under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:44 p.m., adjourned until Thursday, March 29, 2007, at 9:00 a.m.                           ____________________
