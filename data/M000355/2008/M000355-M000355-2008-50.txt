 President, I did not hear all of my good friend's, the majority leader's, remarks, but I did hear the end of them, and I do want to underscore that he is entirely correct, that this crisis we face in the financial markets is about Main Street.  A good example of that is a community of mine that wanted to issue municipal revenue bonds the other day. These were highly rated bonds. There was no buyer. This is going on all across the country. It underscores the need to act responsibly and quickly, which we anticipate doing on Monday.                          ____________________
