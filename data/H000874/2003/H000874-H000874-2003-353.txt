 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under the suspension of the rules, and a final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on those measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m. on Monday. For Tuesday and the balance of the week, we expect to consider additional bills under suspension of the rules, as well as H.R. 1904, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003, and the Department of Defense authorization bill.  And, finally, I would like to note for all the Members that we are waiting on Senate action on a variety of issues such as the jobs and growth package and the President's Global AIDS Initiative. Members should be aware that we are likely to be in session Friday next, possibly late into the evening, as we work to resolve these important pieces of legislation.
