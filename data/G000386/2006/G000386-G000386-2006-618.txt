 President, I want to comment on what the Senator from Massachusetts said.  First of all, I think everything he said about the AMT, I agree with; what he said about the capital gains, I disagree with.  I am only going to comment on that part that I agree with him on about the AMT.  But let us have a little history in the process of doing that.  No. 1, either in 1998 or 1999, we repealed the AMT. President Clinton vetoed it.  So we wouldn't be dealing with this issue if President Clinton had signed that bill.  In a sense I am kind of asking for support from anybody on the other side of the aisle who thinks we are not doing enough on AMT. I happen to be one of those who even today, 6 to 7 years later, is for repeal. I believe it ought to be repealed. We ought to have a standup vote, without any points of order, and get rid of this.
