 President, approving the Helms amendment is fine.  I indicated to the Senator from New Mexico that the Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, will want to speak on his amendment, so we will not be able to go forward on the Bingaman amendment yet.  I see no problem in moving ahead on the Helms amendment that is currently before the Senate. I am aware of no opposition to it, Mr. President.
