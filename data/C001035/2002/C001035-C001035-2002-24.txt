President, I rise today to discuss the very important issue of chemical and biological research. The threat of a chemical and biological attack is no longer an emerging threat: it is very real, and it affects not only our nation, but our allies as well. The risks associated with chemical and biological weapons are growing, and our capacity to assess, counter, and deter these threats needs to be addressed. That is why it is critical to see continued investments made in diagnostic tools for biowarfare-inflicted agents, chemical and biological detection devices, and sensors to ensure the safety of food and water supply.
