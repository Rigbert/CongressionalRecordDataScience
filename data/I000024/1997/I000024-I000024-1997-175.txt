I will just read the last paragraph.       Ultimately the treaty's most pernicious effect is that it      would lull most responsible nations into the false belief      that they'd ``done something'' about the chemical weapons      problem and that it now was behind them. Yes, the world would      be a better place without chemical weapons. But this treaty's      attempt to wave them away isn't going to make that happen.
