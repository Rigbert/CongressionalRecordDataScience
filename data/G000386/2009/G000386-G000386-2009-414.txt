 Obviously, from what I stated yesterday, I have a difference of opinion on that issue. I am not going to speak about that because I spoke about it yesterday.  Madam President, I would like to speak generally about the SCHIP bill, not about a specific amendment at this point, although I might mention some differences we have with the original bill.  I have been a Member of the Senate now for quite a few years. I have worked across the aisle on many initiatives in my time in the Senate. We have worked together--we meaning Democrats and Republicans, and in my case as an individual, the Senator from Iowa--and I am speaking about a close working relationship I have with the Senator from Montana, the chairman of the committee now. We have worked together on major tax, trade, and health care legislation over the last few years where we were able to set aside partisanship and work together to make good policy. I know what it means to make a compromise. I know what it means to keep that compromise.  In 2007, I worked with my friend Senator Baucus, as well as Senator Hatch, a Republican, and Senator Rockefeller, a Democrat, to pass the reauthorization to the Children's Health Insurance Program. We twice passed a bill in the Senate with wide bipartisan margins. Was it a bill Senator Hatch and I as Republicans would have written? No. Was it a bill Senator Baucus and Senator Rockefeller would have written if they were writing the bill all by themselves? No.
