 President, yesterday the Senate took the next step in allowing us to eventually pass a continuing resolution. While negotiations are ongoing, I want to thank colleagues on both sides for their cooperation in voting to proceed to the bill that will be used as a shell for the CR-Zika legislation. This will allow us to start work so that when we have an agreement, we will be able to review and debate it.  We all know how important these funds are for combating Zika and supporting our veterans. Let's continue to work quickly so we can eventually pass an agreement as soon as possible.                          ____________________
