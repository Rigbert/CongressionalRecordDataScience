Mr. Speaker, first let me compliment the gentleman on his outstanding piece of legislation. It does bring to the forefront the lack of an energy policy, and his bill does set up a commission to say, we have to address all forms of energy so we have what I call the wheel of energy to provide the necessity for the center of the wheel to make it work.  As the gentleman mentioned, with coal, 64 percent develops our electrical energy now. We need nuclear. We need gas. We need oil. And, yes, even some hydro, wind power, solar power, all collected in the need for the BTUs.  We have requested, I have requested, an energy policy for the last 20 years and been turned down by the past administration that has not sought to not seek an energy policy.  So I want to compliment the gentleman for bringing this to the forefront. Because gas right now, natural gas, 1 year ago was $2 and today it is $9 on the market. So we do need this policy, and I want to compliment the gentleman for his resolution.
