In a few minutes, it will be our intent to begin a series of rollcalls. Apparently, there are a number of amendments Senator Gregg and I were willing to accept, but the Senator said he would prefer having rollcalls. That means we will be here for a few more hours than we needed to be.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
