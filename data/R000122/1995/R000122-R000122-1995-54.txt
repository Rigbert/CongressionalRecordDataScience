Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 961. The Clean Water Act has been instrumental in cleaning up our waters and protecting our environment. H.R. 961, if enacted, would devastate Rhode Island, both its environment and, just as importantly, its economy. We depend upon a clean Narragansett Bay to support not only environmental activities, but also our economy.  In 1989, $42 million was generated by our commercial fishing industry. $11 million was generated by our shellfishing industry. If we lose the Clean Water Act, we will lose a lot of these profits and a lot of the jobs associated with them.  We depend on tourism: $146 million in 1989 for marine recreation activities; $637 million in 1989 for the marine industry in general. Without the Clean Water Act, we will not be able to realize this type of economic activity.  We have to support a strong Clean Water Act. This bill does not do that. We also have to provide the States the resources through the revolving fund to provide cleanup until Rhode Island and elsewhere. Again, this act does not do this. Mr. Chairman, we should reject this provision and support a Clean Water Act.
