Not at all. In fact, let me again read from our legal analysis:       The economic loss rule is a widely recognized legal      principle that has been adopted by the United States Supreme      Court in the vast majority of States. It states a party who      has suffered only economic damages must generally sue to      recover those damages under contract law, not under tort law.      Tort law generally applies only where a party has suffered      personal injury or damages to property other than the      property in dispute.  So we are having, I guess, a duel of legal analyses. But we are happy to share ours. We believe, again, the court precedents and the specific analysis I am citing make it very clear that recovery that is available today for economic losses under State contract law is not being altered in any way by this bill.
