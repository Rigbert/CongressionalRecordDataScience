 President, my special thanks to Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, and Senator Daschle for allowing this debate to go forward in an orderly fashion.  As we all know here in the Senate, any Senator at any moment can kick off a debate on any subject. That, of course, gives each Senator a good deal of power in determining what we debate. But what we have essentially agreed to here today is an orderly process by which the Senate can go on and engage in other business and have another debate on another day on this very important issue which we have debated almost yearly for the last decade. Let me say that I think this is a very sensible way to do it.  Finally, I want to commend the distinguished majority leader. He has stood fast on principle over a difficult several-week period. The principle was that the majority leader should set the agenda for the Senate. I want to just say to my friend, the majority leader, that I have never seen a better example of leadership than he has exhibited over the last few weeks.  Senator McCain said the majority leader saw a lot of Senator McCain. He saw an equal amount of Senator McConnell over this period. And I think he is probably ready to see less of both of us for a few weeks.  But in any event, in his position as leader, Senator Lott obviously would like to see things go forward. On the other hand, there are from time to time matters of great principle where it is important to stand up and take a position. I say to my friend, Senator Lott, that I can't think of a better example in the 13 years I have been here of standing steadfast for principle when it counted than the performance of the distinguished majority leader over the last 3 weeks.  I thank him on behalf of all the members of our conference, the vast majority of whom agree with the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Mississippi.  I yield the floor.
