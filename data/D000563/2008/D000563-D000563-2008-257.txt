President, I am trying to visualize somewhere in America where a father walks into his living room and says to his son: What are you watching?  The son says: Well, I was watching C-SPAN. I was watching the Senate.  The father says to the son: What were they talking about?  The son says: Filling the tree.  The father says: What is that?  The son says: I don't have any idea.  The father says: You would think they would talk about things that were important to us. Turn off the television. Watch the cartoons.  I listened to this debate and wondered how we can get tied into knots, just as we have today. I will tell you that we had 34 bills before us today. They were in a package. These are 34 bills that were considered noncontroversial bills--bills that had passed the House of Representatives without dissenting votes, in many cases, or overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. These are bills reported out of our committees--including the Judiciary Committee Senator Specter and I serve on--unanimously. These are bills which, in the ordinary course of business in the ordinary history of the Senate, wouldn't have caused a ripple because they had been agreed to and written and both sides said: This is a good idea; let's do it.  However, under the rules of the Senate--and it is a unique institution--any Senator can object to any bill. They can stop the train and say: Don't go forward, don't consider the bill, if one Senator--just one Senator--should object. Well, in this case, the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, objected.  Senator Coburn is a friend of mine. We use that term a lot around here, but this is for real. He is a friend of mine. He is the ranking Republican on a subcommittee that I chair, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law of the Judiciary Committee, and we have done a lot of work together. In fact, he has been the cosponsor of some bills that have been enacted and signed by the President which I initiated and he joined me, so we truly do have a good working relationship.  I think he has a peculiar fiscal philosophy, and here is what it is. There are two kinds of bills that we consider. One is an authorization bill, and the other is an appropriations bill. Let me use an example.  That same father I mentioned earlier says to his son one day: Why don't you go out and buy a bicycle.  The kid says: You mean I can buy a bicycle? Great, he says.  At that point, the son says: Can I have some money?  The father says: No, we don't have the money, but you can buy one if you want to.  The kid says: I don't have the money.  That turns out to be the important question--not whether you have the permission to buy the bicycle but whether you have the money to buy the bicycle. Permission--authorization. The money to make it work: appropriation. So the 34 bills here are all permissions to spend money. That is it. They don't provide any money. That is another part of the process.  I think that is the critical difference which Senator Coburn does not acknowledge. We are authorizing these. We are permitting these things to occur, but we are not spending the money for them. That comes later. We have a finite, limited amount of money to spend in our Federal budget and we will decide: Will this be the priority or will it be something else? Senator Coburn believes that if you give permission, all the money is going to be spent. Historically, that never happens, but that is his philosophy, that is his point of view. So he objected to some 34 bills.                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3297  Now, it is my understanding that there is a consent script available which I would like to propound before Senator Specter leaves the floor.  Of the 34 bills which were included in S. 3297 which was considered today, Senator Coburn has come to the floor and asked that 1 or 2 of the bills be modified, changed, and passed. I wish to make sure it is clear for the record that we are asking consent on our side, unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to S. 3297, the bill in its entirety, that the bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements be printed at the appropriate place in the Record as if read.
