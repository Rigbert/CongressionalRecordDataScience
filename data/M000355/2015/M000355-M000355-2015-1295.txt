 President, one of my home State's great newspapers, the Advocate-Messenger, is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, and I want to congratulate the staff and publishers of this venerable institution that is published out of Danville, Ky.  The newspaper that would become the Advocate-Messenger was first published on June 24, 1865, as The Kentucky Advocate. Created by James L. Marrs, it was guided to considerable success by a trio of editors: G.W. Doneghy, W. Vernon Richardson, and W.O. McIntyre. The paper became a daily in 1911 and a member of the Associated Press in 1914.  In the meantime, a local merchant named Hubert McGoodwin founded the Danville Messenger in 1910 as a competitor of the Kentucky Advocate. This paper was purchased in 1918 by J. Curtis Alcock, an experienced editor and publisher, and he guided The Danville Messenger to considerable success in the ensuing decades while also serving as secretary-treasurer of the Kentucky Press Association from 1911 to 1942.  In 1940, the two newspapers merged to become the Advocate-Messenger and published Monday through Friday under that name. The Kentucky Advocate became a Saturday afternoon paper for a decade before switching to a Sunday-only paper in 1950, continuing to this day.  Many able hands have steered the ship of the Advocate-Messenger over the years. Enos Swain, formerly the director of Centre College's public relations, became the Advocate-Messenger's editor in 1944 and served the longest tenure of any editor, 34 years. In 1977 current owner Schurz Communications bought the paper, and Mary Schurz became the editor and publisher in 1978 upon Enos Swain's retirement.  From 2006 to 2014, Scott Schurz, Jr., served as editor and publisher, and in July 2014, Larry Hensley was named president and publisher, posts he continues to fill today. John Nelson is the executive editor.  Under the supervision of Mr. Hensley, the Advocate-Messenger enjoys a healthy circulation throughout southcentral Kentucky, with distribution primarily in Boyle, Lincoln, Casey, Mercer, and Garrard counties. Danville benefits from being recognized by Time magazine as one of 10 successful Main Street communities in the country and is the home of Centre College, one of the top liberal arts colleges in the region. I can attest to my colleagues that Danville is a wonderful place, and I believe the Advocate-Messenger truly has its finger on the pulse of the region.  A strong and vigorous free press being vital to the freedoms of our country, I wish to recognize the Advocate-Messenger as a newspaper that takes its dedication to journalism and to serving the people of its community seriously. One hundred and fifty years in publication is quite an accomplishment that few newspapers can claim, and I know my colleagues join me when I say congratulations to the Advocate-Messenger on the occasion of its sesquicentennial and best wishes for many more years of publication to come. And congratulations to the newspaper's president and publisher, Larry Hensley, and its executive editor, John Nelson.                          ____________________
