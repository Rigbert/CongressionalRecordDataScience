  I do not think there has been any American President that has reached out more fully to the rest of the world with more humanitarian work and more concern about human rights and labor rights than Jimmy Carter.  I understand several of my colleagues believe labor and environmental provisions of the agreement fall short of what is needed to protect workers' rights and the natural resources of the CAFTA countries. I think free-trade advocates often make the mistake of arguing that these agreements are a panacea for the ills of the developing world, including lax labor and environmental standards. I certainly do not believe that.  The passage of the CAFTA alone will not bring labor and environmental standards and the capacity to enforce those standards up to United States levels. We have to admit that. But--and I say ``but''--combined with a robust assistance package to help the CAFTA countries identify shortcomings and improve the enforcement of their laws, this agreement will mark an important step in the right direction. This is not about sacrificing the rights of workers and the protection of the environment for open markets and increased trade. We can provide new opportunities for American and Central American goods and services and establish programs to help those countries raise their labor standards.  What Senator Bingaman said when he came to the floor is very constructive. I give him a great deal of credit and credit to the administration. This is the first trade treaty I can remember when they have been open to change.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent just 5 additional minutes.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so ordered.
