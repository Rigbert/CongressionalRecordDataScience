Speaker, I am pleased and honored to recognize the valuable services of Mrs. Margaret Willis, as she retires as a director of the Northeast-Midwest Institute. For the past 9 years, Margaret has provided commonsense leadership by arguing effectively for policies that protect the environment and provide valuable comfort and dignity for those who are less fortunate. She has also served as the Northwest-Midwest Institute's treasurer and has been very active on several committees of the organization.  Margaret Willis is from Chesterton, IN, and has formerly served as both a member of the Porter County Council, as well as a board member and officer of the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District. While serving as a Democrat County Council member, Margaret was also a liaison to the Porter County Health Board. She has been a true leader within my Northwest Indiana community by serving as an editor of the Chesterton Tribune, as well as several other local community organizations.  Before her dedicated work in government service, Margaret was the founder of the Indiana Coalition Against Sexual Assault within her community, which was the first support group in Porter County. She has given her time and efforts selflessly through many generous avenues. She has also served on the Chesterton Adult Learning Center Advisory Board, the Porter County League of Women's Voters, as well as the Porter/LaPorte County AIDS Task Force and the Duneland Sierra Club.  Mr. Speaker, I have personally served as vice-chair of the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition. The Institute and Coalition provide many valuable information resources to both Republicans and Democrats. They help to ensure that the region's lawmakers advance Great Lakes restoration, brownfield redevelopment, as well as many other very important environmental issues. I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join with me in congratulating and applauding Margaret Willis for her sincere dedication and guidance to not only the Northeast-Midwest Institute, but for her lifetime of hard work and leadership to all members of her community.                          ____________________
