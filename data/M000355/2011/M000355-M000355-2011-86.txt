 I want to echo the comments of the majority leader. In my time in the Senate some of our best work has been done on Thursday night. Usually when we are passing bills around here, we are working on Thursdays into the evening and finishing them. It is my hope that we will continue on that path and finish this bill tonight. Frequently coming back on Friday is counterproductive, and I would encourage all of the Members to cooperate to the greatest extent possible. I think we were, the last time I checked, making progress toward getting a lot of amendments in the queue hopefully to be voted on tonight.
