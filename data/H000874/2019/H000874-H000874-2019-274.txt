Now, this dealt with natural disasters, not the humanitarian crisis at the border. I understand that.  We passed that Monday ultimately because the administration wanted to undermine very badly the American citizens who live in Puerto Rico. Finally, we got agreement that that was the right thing to do and the Senate passed it overwhelmingly, then sent it over here. We tried to pass it by unanimous consent, and your side objected. You objected three times. So we had to pass it this Monday. We did overwhelmingly. Not as many perhaps on the gentleman's side as on my side, but we passed it handily.  The fact of the matter is, we need to deal with this humanitarian crisis. We need to deal with the humanitarian crisis, and if we limit it to dealing withthe humanitarian crisis, Madam Speaker, we will do it. And, in fact, Ms. Lucille Roybal-Allard is in discussions on that now. My view is the four corners, meaning the Speaker, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, the majority leader, and Mr. Schumer are dealing with it. I hope they get it done very soon. And if they get it done we are going to move it because there is a crisis and we need to deal with it.  But I would urge my friend to urge his colleagues not to try to do some of the President's agenda unrelated to the humanitarian crisis. And if we can do that, we will get to an agreement, in my opinion.  Now let me go back to your what I believe to be inaccurate, recitation--as I believe Attorney General Barr's recitation of what the Mueller report says, and Mr. Mueller clearly made that very, very crystal clear that he had a different view as to whether that was.  Now, I have got a whole page here of things that the Mueller report says with reference to--``collusion'' is a word that the President has created. It is not collusion, not a crime, per se. Conspiracy is a crime, but the President uses this word ``collusion'' as fake news, as a distraction, as a magician's trick to look over here, not here, so that I can fool you.  I asked the gentleman to yield when he said, well, the special counsel decided to do nothing. The special counsel made it very clear that under Justice Department directives, a sitting President cannot be indicted. And Mr. Mueller said if he can't be indicted, I don't want to make an allegation, which would not be fair because he cannot be indicted, and therefore, there will be no fora on which to defend himself. But he observed there was another forum, that was inappropriate for him, that did have the responsibility and the ability to take action, and that, as I said, is us.  Now, I won't go through this list of findings that the Mueller committee or task force, the special counsel concluded, but in my opinion, and I said this in a release 2 days after, were pretty damning and at a minimum worthy of the Congress of the United States trying to get to the bottom of what Manafort and Stone and others did in reference to WikiLeaks, welcoming the Russian participation that they thought was helping them. Mueller report.  So we can go into that at great length, but the proper way to do that is to do what we are doing, ask questions, have witnesses, review documents and other communications to get to the bottom of this, and we intend to do that. And we intend to do it in a considered, focused way.  Neither the Speaker nor I, as the gentleman has read, are saying that we are seeking impeachment, but we are seeking to do our constitutional duty, our responsibility to the American people and to the Constitution to ensure that, in fact, the American people know what this administration or individuals who work with this administration or others were doing.                              {time}  1115  Madam Speaker, lastly, because we can go on at length about this, let me say that the gentleman protests too much. The Republicans control the United States Senate. Very frankly, the Intelligence Committee is working in a bipartisan fashion with Mr. Burr from North Carolina and Mr. Warner from Virginia.  Madam Speaker, if the gentleman, my friend, the whip, is frustrated, I suggest he call up his friends in the United States Senate to say they ought to do this; they ought to do that; and they ought to do the other.  If they think it is the right thing to do, maybe they will do it. But we intend to do our responsibility here.  Again, I would hope that we could join together in defense of the Congress' responsibility and authority and not have any administration--Republican, Democratic, Obama, Trump, any President--say, no, it is not going to give us any information, that some other body has disposed of that question.  Some other body is not us, and we need to move ahead on doing our responsibility.  Again, I would hope the gentleman would cooperate, but we are going to continue to do the business of the people of this country as well.  We have differences on that. We think this was a pretty historic week. We passed the disaster bill. We extended flood insurance, and we extended TANF, so neither one of them expired. Then, we passed the American Dream and Promise Act, legislation that will relieve the fears of 2-plus million people who are positive participants in the American Dream.  It was a bipartisan bill, not a lot from your side, but we think it is a historic piece of legislation. We hope the Senate takes it up.  We have been trying to get that bill on the floor for 8 years, without success. We got it on the floor. As I knew it would, it passed. I think it would have passed had we put it on the floor in the previous Congress, but we didn't get it to the floor.  Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with the whip toward reaching some bipartisan resolutions.  In particular, I agree with him, and I think we all agree that we want to make sure that we have the resources necessary to handle what is, in fact, a humanitarian crisis, with so many people fleeing natural disasters and man-made disasters--terror, murder, mayhem--for safety for themselves and their families, as have millions and millions and millions of people who preceded them who came to this country. Whether they came from Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, Central America, they came here because America had a beacon that they saw as a land of opportunity and a land of freedom, equality, and justice, a land in which they wanted to live and make better.  Madam Speaker, we will continue to do our business as well as exercise our responsibilities.
