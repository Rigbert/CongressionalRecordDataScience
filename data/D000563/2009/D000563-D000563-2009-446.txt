President, I will respond to the Senator from Arizona after I speak to an important issue in my home State.  My first comment relates to an important VA hospital in Marion, IL. In the fall of 2007, there was an alarming number of deaths at the Marion VA hospital, causing a thorough investigation to be initiated in Washington. At the end of the investigation, they found that nine veterans who had gone into this hospital for surgery had died under what were considered extraordinary circumstances. The investigation went deeper. As it went deeper, they found clear evidence of malpractice on the part of doctors at this veterans hospital and mismanagement by those who brought these doctors to the hospital and by those responsible for supervising them in their activities.  As a result of that startling and shameful disclosure in the treatment of the veterans, the surgical unit was basically closed--at least inpatient surgery and many other medical activities were restricted until the investigation was complete, changes were made, and new personnel were brought in so that veterans receive the kind of protection and care they deserve.  That investigation resulted in several doctors being dismissed. After the most cursory examination, we found that doctors had been brought to this hospital--at least a particular doctor who had been the subject of malpractice complaints in another State had not been thoroughly reviewed in terms of his background before he was brought into this veterans hospital, and he, in fact, was performing surgeries at this hospital beyond his competency and beyond his authority. That was a fact.  We started this thorough review with new people at the Marion VA Center.  I might say to the Presiding Officer and those following this debate, southern Illinois is a long way from Chicago. It is 400-plus miles away from Chicago. It is an area I know well. It is where my family roots are. It is an area once represented in Congress by Paul Simon, when he was a Member of the House, and then, of course, he later served in the Senate. Paul Simon used to say southern Illinois is the land of grits and gospel music. There are parts of southern Illinois that are south of Richmond, VA, in terms of latitude, to give an idea. It is the South.  I say that because I want to let people know, in following this particular development, that for many of the people who live in southern Illinois, in small towns in southern Illinois, in northern Kentucky, and in eastern Missouri, the Marion VA Medical Center is critically important. It is a long drive from where they live to St. Louis or to Indianapolis or some other place. They count on the Marion VA hospital. We told these veterans they could count on it, that it would be there to help them when they needed it. So this scandal which came out 2 years ago caught everyone's attention and focused all of us on solving this problem as quickly as possible.  We responded in the Senate. I had a colleague in the Senate then, a fellow Senator by the name of Barack Obama. He and I introduced a bill that went after the systemic weaknesses at the VA medical center structure that allowed these deaths to occur. Our bill imposed an accountable quality management system on VA medical centers, on regional networks that monitor and manage the medical centers, and the VA health care system as a whole. We proposed designating a person at each level who would be directly responsible for quality management and only quality management of health care for veterans. The Veterans' Affairs Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Akaka of Hawaii and Senator Richard Burr, a Republican, approved the legislation last Congress and reported it out of committee and to the full Senate, where it died on the floor.  Yesterday, I was shocked to learn that a new inspector general's investigation of the Marion VA Center in August of this year by a medical doctor and his team found that problems identified 2 years ago have not been addressed at the Marion VA Medical Center. Despite this national scandal and the concern we all had about the treatment of veterans, many of the concerns and many of the issues that led to the deaths of these innocent veterans have still gone unheeded. In 2 years' time, the medical center responsible for treating veterans living in southern Illinois has not been able to meet the required standards in facilities safety, patient safety, peer review treatments, and, yes, limiting surgeries to those surgeons who are only approved and licensed to perform them. These continued failures are shocking and inexcusable.  I and my staff and my colleagues in the House have pressed the VA and the medical center itself repeatedly about bringing this center up to the highest standards. We have visited the facility, convened meetings with employees, administrators, and written letters. We have done all we can think of to make sure our veterans have access to the highest levels of medical care in Marion, IL. We have been told time and time again that Marion's quality of care is being closely monitored and all appropriate steps are being taken to rectify the problem. I don't know what went wrong here, but I know now that these efforts have failed.  The inspector general's report of this August is an indictment of all of the efforts undertaken by the previous administration and this administration to remedy the problem. I am deeply disappointed that yet another report identifies entrenched and serious problems at Marion.  In the report finally released yesterday, the inspector general details appalling failures of quality management and patient safety standards. I have read the report. Some failures they found are the same ones they found 2 years ago: physicians performing procedures without required privileges and authority; review of treatment recordsthat is not regular or systematic; where there were reviews of treatment records, no one followed up on questionable treatment decisions as they were made; and, in fact, substandard, unacceptable record keeping of the deaths after treatment.  Other failures in patient care the inspector general found: not complying with guidelines for patients with a history of methicillin-resistant staff infection, known as MRSA. It is a deadly infection that can claim lives. They found an example where an individual who had a history of this infection was left in an environment where he was exposed to other innocent patients. Totally unacceptable. Not grounding electrical equipment in bathrooms, raising the danger of patient electrocutions at one of our veterans hospitals. That is what the inspector general found.  After 2 years to focus on bringing the Marion VA Center up to the basic standards we should expect of every VA facility, those in the direct line of command at Marion have violated the public trust and should be relieved of their duties until serious questions about this management have been answered and resolved.  Secretary Shinseki called me on the phone last night, and we had a lengthy conversation about Marion. When I first met the general and told him I would support him because of his service to our country and his obvious leadership skills, I talked about the Marion center. I told him it had to be high on his priority list. He said he would take the initial step of removing the Marion director and naming a replacement with a long and respected record of leadership.  I wish this new director the best and offer all the help I can to provide and assure veterans in southern Illinois they will receive the best possible care. However, since the problems at Marion have not been fixed, more comprehensive and immediate action is required.  Yesterday's inspector general report is only one of several revelations of quality-of-care issues in VA facilities to gain notice this year. In June, the inspector general reported that several VA facilities were not properly cleaning endoscopy equipment, potentially exposing veterans to infection. In July, weak oversight led to errors in cancer treatments at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, resulting in mistreatment of several veterans. Taken together, the series of problems raise serious questions about how quality of care in the veterans health system is monitored and enforced.  Since that initial, awful discovery of these unnecessary, shameful deaths in Marion, IL, 2 years ago, we have asked a lot of questions about quality of care that have gone unanswered. We have learned some things. We have learned that VA health care quality assurance programs at every level--Federal, regional, and local--could be better. Where good policy is in place, not all health care officials and practitioners are following the guidance fully. The shortage of health care professionals means VA hospitals are not doing all they can to weed out mistake-prone doctors.  I wish to go back to the legislation Senator Obama and I introduced in the last Congress. This bill would create a network of health quality assurance officers. The idea is we need one designated person at each VA facility, in their VISNs and in VA's headquarters, to pay attention, strictly, to quality and patient safety issues.  So the bill establishes quality management officers at the national, VISN, and medical center levels. These officers would be responsible for peer-review mechanisms and for confidential reporting systems, so VA employees can literally blow the whistle when they see things happen that endanger the lives and treatment of our veterans.  The bill also requires potential VA physicians to disclose their employment history--that is not too much to ask--including negative elements in their resume, before they are hired.  It also mandates that directors of the regional Veterans Integrated Service Networks--or VISNs--investigate and personally approve the candidates.  Again, this year, as it did in the previous Congress, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee has reported the bill. They agree with me. They know it is a bipartisan bill, and they support it on a bipartisan basis. This year it is part of the Caregiver and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009.  Where is this bill? Why wasn't it passed before this inspector general came and found the same problems at Marion VA today that led to the deaths of nine innocent veterans 2 years ago? What happened to the bill after it was reported to the Veterans' Committee?  Well, I can tell you. The bill is sitting on the Senate calendar. It is being held by one Senator who opposes moving to the veterans bills. He says it costs too much money. Well, what is a veteran's life worth? We lost nine 2 years ago. The latest report is that there is another one whose death has not been investigated, which has not had the appropriate level of review we would expect in a veterans facility, and this Senator says it is too much to ask that we would put someone in place at that Marion VA, and every VA facility, who would focus on patient safety.  I want to tell you, that is unacceptable. Putting a hold on a bill that, if it is not passed, could endanger the lives of veterans is absolutely unacceptable. I hope this Senator will have second thoughts now that this inspector general's report is out. We need this quality management network in the veterans health system. If this were in place and working properly, we could catch those who are taking shortcuts and compromising the quality of care our veterans deserve.  But we also have to acknowledge that policies are only as effective as the people who implement them. Good practices depend on the professionals on the ground, so we have to educate and hold professionals accountable, as well as enacting appropriate quality control measures. We have to make veterans hospitals attractive employers so the scarcity of doctors does not create a perverse incentive to overlook potential shortcuts.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, the Veterans' Administration of the United States of America provides veterans with care of the highest quality. VA personnel--and I have met hundreds of them--similar to all health care workers, enter their professions because of a genuine personal desire to heal the sick and mend the wounded, particularly those women and men who have served our country. They do outstanding work for our veterans every single day, and they deserve our gratitude for that effort. We want to help them provide the very best care for veterans everywhere in America.  I wish to thank Chairman Akaka and Senator Burr for noting that quality management in the VA needs to be restructured to ensure accountability. I agree with them completely. But despite the good work of the VA, and the wonderful people involved in the VA, clearly, at the Marion VA Center our veterans deserve better.  I hope we can pass this bill and put in place the kind of safeguards that are needed so we will never have to face another inspector general's report such as this. You would think after nine veterans have lost their lives, and all the effort that has gone in to understand why--and stop it from occurring--that we would not be facing an inspector general's report that says we are still harboring people who are not of the highest quality, in terms of their talents, and protecting procedures and approaches which jeopardize the lives of many of these veterans.  This bill should be removed from the calendar, brought to the floor, and passed immediately. I hope it will pass in an overwhelming fashion with bipartisan support.  Mr. President, as to the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act, I heard the Senator from Arizona come out and talk about the unwillingness of the Democratic majority to allow the Republicans to offer amendments. He used that as his reason to explain why, for 26 days, the Republicans have held up the extension of unemployment benefits to thousands of people across this country.  During that 26-day period of time the Republicans have stopped us from extending unemployment benefits, 180,000 Americans have seen their unemployment benefits end. We know because many of us have heard from them. They are people who have been out of work for a long time and looking for a job without luck. When the unemployment check ends, they know it because that is the check that puts bread on the table. That is the check that paysthe mortgage and the utility bills. It keeps their family together.  So for almost one calendar month, the Republicans in the Senate have stopped the extension of unemployment benefits. Why? The Senator from Arizona said: Well, because we had some amendments we wanted to offer.  Well, this is a legislative body. It is not unreasonable to offer an amendment. But what he did not say is that some of the amendments had nothing to do with unemployment or the state of the economy. Some people may have heard of this organization ACORN. They have been in a lot of news recently--videotapes of ACORN employees doing bad things. They were fired. Some are being investigated.  We have had about four or five amendments on the floor about ACORN. Are we going to investigate them? I am for that. I put an amendment in to do that. Are we going to cut off all their government contracts? Are we going to limit the work they can do on this agency or that agency? Amendment after amendment after amendment. At a time when we are in the midst of a deep recession, with high unemployment, fighting two wars, debating health care, some Senator thinks this is all about ACORN.  So one of the Senators from Louisiana said: I am going to hold up unemployment benefits for people across America until I can have another chance to have another debate on another ACORN amendment. Well, forgive me, but I think the majority leader was right. That does not relate to unemployment. It does not relate to the state of the economy. It is simply one Senator who is stuck on one theme that has nothing to do with the economy and that Senator was insisting on his amendment or unemployment benefits would not move forward.  So when the Senator from Arizona talks about the decision of the majority not to allow every amendment to be offered and tie up the Senate for days or weeks at a time, it is understandable. I do have to take exception to remarks that were made by my minority whip and friend from Arizona when he said we are not offering amendments to the Republicans on the unemployment compensation benefits bill.  I call his attention to the amendment he voted for yesterday. It was a cloture motion, which means ending debate on a substitute known as the Reid-Baucus substitute. The Reid-Baucus substitute, which is being added to this unemployment benefits bill, includes, within its pages, two Republican amendments, the major Republican amendments that have been offered; one by Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia about the home buyers credit. It is in here. A Republican amendment is in here. He and Senator Dodd have worked out the details. It is included. The second is an amendment by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, and it relates to some net operating loss tax treatment, which we think may help some businesses hire people back. Senator Bunning is a Republican. The amendment was incorporated as a part of it.  So for the Senator from Arizona to argue that we are not allowing any amendments is to ignore the very amendment we voted for yesterday. There are Republican amendments here, and they were worked out, as they should be.  Does that explain why we have waited almost 4 weeks to extend unemployment benefits? The Senator from Arizona takes exception to the idea that we would use the insurance fund that is collected from employers and employees across America for unemployment to extend unemployment benefits. Well, this is an insurance fund we all pay into, in the unlikely event we lose our job, so we can get unemployment insurance.  The Senator from Arizona says we should not do that. It is unfair to collect that tax--or FUTA tax, as they call it--to fund unemployment benefits. I think it is perfectly fair. I have never used it once in my life. I do not mind paying into it. I think it is reasonable. If the day comes when I need it, it is there. So to say we should stop funding this kind of unemployment insurance benefit is, in my mind, to jeopardize a safety net many people count on across America.  I have received calls from people in my State telling their stories. I hope the Senator from Arizona can receive a few of those calls, too, from his State. I am sure there are people who would contact him on this issue.  One lady wrote me and she said:       I am a 57 year old professional woman [with a masters      degree] who was laid off in November 2007, before things got      really bad. My unemployment ran out in mid September.  When this debate had not started, but it was beginning here in the Senate. She said:       I have closed my 401K, my retirement accounts and have      spent all my savings to survive thus far--and without having      had the help of unemployment benefits, I would have lost      everything I have long ago.       And don't get me started on my health insurance issues.       As Congress debates, people lose everything. Good people      who worked their whole lives. Please help pass this bill. It      will be too late for me, I am totally tapped out next month,      but it will save others.  A man writes me:       I am 60 years old. My wife is 56. We were both laid off. Me      first, then her.       We have worked all our lives. Our unemployment benefits      have expired.       We were unable to continue paying for Cobra--  Which is a health insurance option for those who are out of work--       so we lost that. So now we have no health coverage for the      first time in our lives and no benefits.       We try to stay optimistic, but the reality is things are      tough. We look for work, to no avail. What will happen?       Benefits should be extended indefinitely until the job      situation improves to the point where people can get a job.      In the meantime we'll take what we can get, and hope      something good happens.  This woman, who has never contacted a public official before, writes me and says:       This is my first time writing to any political figure. I      will keep my thoughts and concerns short and sweet.       I am currently unemployed, a mother of 3 and live in a      suburb in Illinois. I have been looking for work for over 1      year now to no avail.       It is my hope that you will vote YES in the Senate this      week to pass the unemployment extension and hopefully there      will be no more delays.       My husband and I have been struggling to make ends meet for      months now and with the money I would collect from      unemployment, my family would be able to stay afloat [until I      can get another job].       My son has some major medical issues at this time and even      though we carry insurance, it's just not enough to pay the      bills.       I pray the Senate makes a positive and quick decision about      extending unemployment benefits.       I appreciate your time.  How do you explain to this woman, and others who wrote to me, what we are doing right now on the floor of the Senate? Are we debating a bill on the floor of the Senate? No. We are burning 30 hours off the clock because the Republicans insist we delay this as long as the Senate rules will allow. They do not want us to extend unemployment benefits 1 minute sooner than they can extend this debate. Under the Senate rules, they have extended it now for 26 days. So another 2, 3 or 4 days are necessary before the Republicans use up all the time they could possibly use.  What happens in the meantime? Well, for the three people who wrote me from Illinois, I am not sure. I do not know how they will get by in the meantime. I hope they will. But for them, it must be hard to understand why they have to be held captive to the procedural rules of the Senate that I think, in this case, are being clearly abused.  We have adopted now Republican amendments that they have asked for. At least we have cleared them to be adopted. The vote last night had only two dissenters. Two Republican Senators dissented. Everyone else voted for it. This is now, apparently, a wildly popular bill but not popular enough for us to vote on it and get it done. No, we are going to have to wait for another day or two or three under the scenario that has been created on the Republican side.  Last week, one of my Republican colleagues was talking on the floor about how we should be in no rush to do anything on unemployment insurance. He said:       The benefits haven't run out yet. We're going to pass this      before the benefits run out. That's not the question.  Well, unfortunately, that is not true. When you hear statements such as that, the Republican delays start to make a little more sense. Americans need help right now, but some Republican Senators do not understand that.Some Republicans, apparently, do not know that 600,000 Americans have already lost their unemployment insurance benefits--Americans who would be benefited if this bill passed--extending the coverage for an additional 14 weeks across the country and for 20 weeks in areas of higher unemployment.  These 600,000 families have no place to turn. Their benefits are exhausted. The job market is still weak and the Senate talks and talks and talks and, even worse, goes into these quorum calls, where people do not even talk.  We sit in our offices waiting to reach a point where we can take the next vote the Republicans will allow. We finally managed to make a little progress last night to move the bill forward. Now Republicans have said let's wait another 30 hours before we consider what we even passed last night. We have to wait so the Republicans can talk more about whatever it is they think is more important than helping the victims of this recession and dealing with the safety net we desperately need. So America waits and waits some more.  I hope the Senate can finally provide the assistance that hundreds of thousands of Americans are waiting for. There is no excuse for us not to do it right now--today.                 Major Opposition to Health Care Reform  Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee was here earlier. It appears now that the major Republican opposition to health care reform comes down to something very basic, which I never would have guessed.  It turns out the Republicans object to the length of the bill. It turns out they are offended, and are carrying that offense to an extreme, because they believe the Senate bill for health care reform is over 1,000 pages long. I don't know if the Republicans can help me understand this. Maybe there are a number of pages that they think would be appropriate. I don't know if it is 900 or 500. But, apparently, in their mind there is an appropriate number of pages for a bill. When the bill goes beyond a certain number of pages, whatever it says is unacceptable. That, apparently, is the new approach being taken by the Republicans.  Last week, I asked one of the Republican Senators how many pages the Senate Republican health care reform bill comprised. He didn't answer me, because he knows, and I know, that no such bill exists. There is no Senate Republican health care reform bill. Maybe some day there will be. I hope so.  We have taken two major committees of the Senate and put them to work for weeks to devise health care reform bills. Now we are trying to blend those bills into a final product, which is in the works. Yet they come to the floor and complain it is too long. It turns out that one of the committee bills they are objecting to for being too long contained 150 Republican amendments. Guess what. Those amendments comprised 300 pages.  Am I supposed to be outraged that we would have 300 pages of Republican amendments and say they should not be considered because I have in my mind a number I cannot quite disclose to you as to what a maximum number of pages might be for a bill? In a debate as serious as health care reform, have we reached these depths, where the only complaint we can find from the Republican side is that the bill has too many pages in it? I think that is a sad state of affairs.  People across this country, and family after family, know the cost of health care is out of control for businesses, families, individuals, and governments. We cannot sustain it. Health insurance companies will keep piling on premiums and raising costs beyond the reach of families every single day. We have to do something about it now. If it takes 100 pages, good. If it takes 1,000 pages, that is fine, too. Let's get it done.  I keep waiting for the first Republican Senator to stand up and say we are going to join with Democrats in fighting the abuses of health insurance companies, which deny people coverage because of preexisting conditions, which bail out on those who are insured once they get sick, which won't allow you to take your insurance from one job to another, which say that your son or daughter at age 23 is cut off from the family plan.  When will Republicans join us in pushing for real health insurance reform, which gives peace of mind to families across this country? I don't care if that takes 1,000 pages to do it. Let's do it and get it done.  Finally, let's make sure that we push prevention and wellness, so people will have better health outcomes at lower costs, so that more people can qualify for health insurance, so that fewer people turn up in the emergency room without health insurance, or with poor health insurance, desperate for care.  Again, how many pages are acceptable to the Republican side of the aisle? I am waiting to hear.  I yield the floor.
