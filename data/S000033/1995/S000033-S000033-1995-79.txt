 Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Defense appropriations bill, especially given the priorities currently being established in Congress.  Now that the cold war is over, why do we continue to spend $100 billion a year to defend Europe and Asia against a nonexistent enemy, while at the same time this Congress proposes major cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid?  Why are we continuing to fund the absurd star wars program, but make disastrous cuts in student loans and education, the future of America?  Why are we expanding the B-2 program at over $1 billion a plane, when the Pentagon has not even asked for any more planes, but we are cutting back on school nutrition programs and child care?  Why are we not cutting the CIA and the other intelligence programs now that the Soviet Union does not exist, but instead are cutting back on Head Start?                          ____________________
