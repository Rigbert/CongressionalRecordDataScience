Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I still believe that health care is a right and not a privilege, and this Congress must not rest until we make health care a reality for all Americans. I know we will get the job done for the American people, but until that day comes, we must do what we can to make health insurance work for people who depend on it.  This bill, this piece of legislation is long overdue. The health insurance industry has been treated differently for over 60 years, and they have abused that privilege. In too many States there is no competition and no choice for consumers.  Insurance companies are raising rates, denying care, and dropping people when they get sick, all the while making record profits. We need to put people first and not profits.  For too long, insurance companies have had the upper hand. It is not fair, it is not just, and it is not right. Today, at this hour, we said, ``No more.'' It is time to repeal the antitrust exemption and put the American people first.
