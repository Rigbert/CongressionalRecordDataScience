Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 604, I call up the Senate bill (S. 1132) to modify the boundaries of the Bandelier National Monument to include the lands within the headwaters of the Upper Alamo Watershed which drain into the Monument and which are not currently within the jurisdiction of a Federal land management agency, to authorize purchase or donation of those lands, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.  The text of S. 1132 is as follows:                                S. 1132       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Bandelier National Monument      Administrative Improvement and Watershed Protection Act of      1998''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:       (1) Bandelier National Monument (hereinafter, the Monument)      was established by Presidential proclamation on February 11,      1916, to preserve the archeological resources of a ``vanished      people, with as much land as may be necessary for the proper      protection thereof . . .'' (No. 1322; 39 Stat. 1746).       (2) At various times since its establishment, the Congress      and the President have adjusted the Monument's boundaries and      purpose to further preservation of archeological and natural      resources within the Monument.       (A) On February 25, 1932, the Otowi Section of the Santa Fe      National Forest (some 4,699 acres of land) was transferred to      the Monument from the Santa Fe National Forest (Presidential      Proclamation No. 1191; 17 Stat. 2503).       (B) In December of 1959, 3,600 acres of Frijoles Mesa were      transferred to the National Park Service from the Atomic      Energy Committee (hereinafter, AEC) and subsequently added to      the Monument on January 9, 1991, because of ``pueblo-type      archeological ruins germane to those in the monument''      (Presidential Proclamation No. 3388).       (C) On May 27, 1963, Upper Canyon, 2,882 acres of land      previously administered by the AEC, was added to the Monument      to preserve ``their unusual scenic character together with      geologic and topographic features, the preservation of which      would implement the purposes'' of the Monument (Presidential      Proclamation No. 3539).       (D) In 1976, concerned about upstream land management      activities that could result in flooding and erosion in the      Monument, Congress included the headwaters of the Rito de los      Frijoles and the Canada de Cochiti Grant (a total of 7,310      acres) within the Monument's boundaries (Public Law 94-578;      90 Stat. 2732).       (E) In 1976, Congress created the Bandelier Wilderness, a      23,267 acres area that covers over 70 percent of the      Monument.       (3) The Monument still has potential threats from flooding,      erosion, and water quality deterioration because of the mixed      ownership of the upper watersheds, along its western border,      particularly in Alamo Canyon.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to modify the      boundary of the Monument to allow for acquisition and      enhanced protection of the lands within the Monument's upper      watershed.     SEC. 3. BOUNDARY MODIFICATION.       Effective on the date of enactment of this Act, the      boundaries of the Monument shall be modified to include      approximately 935 acres of land comprised of the Elk Meadows      subdivision, the Gardner parcel, the Clark parcel, and the      Baca Land & Cattle Co. lands within the Upper Alamo watershed      as depicted on the National Park Service map entitled      ``Proposed Boundary Expansion Map Bandlier National      Monument'' dated July, 1997. Such map shall be on file and      available for public inspection in the offices of the      Director of the National Park Service, Department of the      Interior.     SEC. 4. LAND ACQUISITION.       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and      (c), the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire      lands and interests therein within the boundaries of the area      added to the Monument by this Act by donation, purchase with      donated or appropriated funds, transfer with another Federal      agency, or exchange: Provided, That no lands or interests      therein may be acquired except with the consent of the owner      thereof.       (b) State and Local Lands.--Lands or interests therein      owned by the State of New Mexico or a political subdivision      thereof may only be acquired by donation or exchange.       (c) Acquisition of Less Than Fee Interests in Land.--The      Secretary may acquire less than fee interests in land only if      the Secretary determines that such less than fee acquisition      will adequately protect the Monument from flooding, erosion,      and degradation of its drainage waters.     SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.       The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director      of the National Park Service, shall manage the national      Monument, including lands added to the Monument by this Act,      in accordance with this Act and the provisions of law      generally applicable to units of National Park System,      including the Act of August 25, 1916, an Act to establish a      National Park Service (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.),      and such specific legislation as heretofore has been enacted      regarding the Monument.     SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be      necessary to carry out the purpose of this Act.
