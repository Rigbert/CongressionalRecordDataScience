 The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the regular order?  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator is to be recognized to offer an amendment.                            Amendment No. 54  Mr. McCAIN. On behalf of Senator Kennedy, Senator Kyl, Senator Feinstein, and myself, I believe there is an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.
