. policy toward Cuba which should be read by every Member of Congress. The findings of this thorough and wide-ranging poll will surprise many. For instance, not only do Floridians--and Cuban-Americans in Florida--favor new policy approaches, but they do so in even larger numbers than do Americans in other regions of the Nation.  It is time--past time--to modernize our policies and the frozen-in-time embargo on Americans' travel and trade with Cuba that have accomplished nothing but to give the Cuban regime a scapegoat for the failures of the Cuban economy. Change will come to Cuba, but our policies have delayed and impeded change. It is time to elevate the voice of a crucial stakeholder: the American people. Thanks to this poll, they are silent no longer.  It is time to recognize that U.S. policy toward Cuba has been unsuccessful in achieving any of its objectives. There is no disagreement among Americans on both sides of the issue about the desire for a government in Cuba that respects individual liberties. We want to see freedom of expression Cuba, just as we want to see American citizen Alan Gross, who has been imprisoned there for more than 4 years, come home. The disagreement is over how best to achieve that.  Just about the only beneficiary of our embargo has been Cuba's current regime.  The poll shows that a solid majority of Americans, including Cuban-Americans, favor a different course.  Trade with Latin America is the fastest growing part of our international commerce. Rather than isolate Cuba with outdated policies, we have isolated ourselves. Our Latin, European and Canadian friends engage with Cuba all that time. Meanwhile, U.S. companies are prohibited from any economic activity on the island.  This new detailed survey paves the way for a policy toward Cuba that is in the national interest of the United States as a whole. That is what the country needs, it is what the American people have made clear they want, and it is the responsibility of the White House and the Congress to act.  Let us have the common sense, and the courage, to finally put an end to the Cold War in our own hemisphere.  In this same spirit of bipartisanship as this public opinion poll, Senator Jeff Flake and I joined together in writing a guest column about the compelling reasons to change these antiquated policies. Our piece appeared today in the Miami Herald. I call it to the attention of the Senate, and I invite other Senators to join in re-examining and changing our self-defeating approach in our relationship with Cuba and the Cuban people. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Miami Herald, Feb. 11, 2014]                     Time for a New Policy on Cuba                   (By Patrick Leahy and Jeff Flake)       We are in the fifth decade--more than half a century--of      our country's embargo toward Cuba. During that time the      Soviet Union has ceased to exist. Apartheid in South Africa      has ended. We have re-established diplomatic relations with      the communist governments of China and Vietnam. Still, the      United States has refused to reexamine the political and      economic embargo on Cuba.       A majority of Americans, including Cuban-Americans, wants      to change course. So do we.       A new public opinion poll commissioned by the Atlantic      Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center and carried out      by a team of highly respected pollsters from both sides of      the aisle shows a stark contrast between current American      attitudes and the archaic U.S. embargo.       A solid majority of Americans from every region and across      party lines supports normalizing relations with Cuba. When      asked about specific elements of the policy--such as undoing      the ban on travel by Americans to Cuba, facilitating      financial transactions,     meeting with the Cuban government on bilateral issues like      fighting drugs and smuggling--the margin is more than 61      percent.       Challenging conventional wisdom that Floridians--and      especially the state's large Cuban-American population--are      in lockstep with the embargo, the poll finds stronger support      for normalization in Florida (63 percent) than in the country      overall (56 percent). A full 67 percent of Floridians support      removing all restrictions for Americans to travel to Cuba,      and 82 percent favor meetings with the Cuban government on      issues of mutual concern.       Simply put: The state that reportedly once had the greatest      reluctance to re-engage has reversed its position.       Having jailed political opponents, Cuba has a political      climate that is far from free. The Cuban government continues      to hold former USAID subcontractor Alan Gross in prison. The      Cuban government has inched toward loosening its grip on the      island's economy. Despite that, however, the Cuban people      continue to live under a repressive regime.       However, it would appear that a standard of 100 percent      political alignment with the United States before allowing      freedom of travel or economic activity with another country      is only applied to Cuba. For instance, U.S.-China trade      topped $500 billion in 2011, and we granted permanent      normalized trade relations to Russia in 2012. American      tourists visit both countries without restriction. It is easy      to see why most Americans now oppose our frozen-in-time      policies toward Cuba.       Trade with Latin America is the fastest growing part of our      international commerce. In 2014, economic growth in Latin      America is expected to continue to outpace U.S. growth.      Rather than isolate Cuba with outdated policies, we have      isolated ourselves.       For example, the presidents of our Latin American partners,      including close allies such as Colombia and Mexico, recently      traveled to Cuba alongside the U.N. secretary general. In      January, Brazil joined Cuba in inaugurating a huge new      shipping terminal on the island. And our European and      Canadian friends engage with Cuba. Meanwhile, U.S. companies      are prohibited from any economic activity on the island.       Just about the only beneficiary of our embargo has been      Cuba's current regime. The embargo actually has helped the      Castros maintain their grip on power by providing a reliable      and convenient scapegoat for Cuba's failing economy. Change      will come to Cuba. These counterproductive U.S. policies have      delayed it.       President Obama has already relaxed some facets of our Cuba      policy, lifting restrictions on Cuban-American travel and      remittances, which have had positive effects. Anecdotally,      U.S. remittances have been crucial in allowing Cuban      entrepreneurs to take full advantage of economic openings      that the Castro regime has been forced to allow. This not      only improves Cubans' lives but will make future economic      contractions by the Cuban government difficult for the regime      to attempt. Current policy boxes U.S. entrepreneurs and      companies out of taking part in any of this burgeoning Cuban      private sector.       Further, there is simply no legitimate justification for      restricting any American travel to Cuba. The travel ban, like      the rest of the embargo, only bolsters the Cuban government's      control over information and civil society. Instead of      willingly restricting the liberty of our own citizens, we      should be taking every opportunity to flood Cubans with      American interaction, with our ideas, with our young people.       Americans want a change in our Cuba policy. The president      should heed the majority of those across the country who      recognize that we have much to gain by jettisoning this Cold      War relic.                          ____________________
