President, I greatly appreciate the comments of the distinguished Senator from New York. He and I have been friends for over a generation. I for one have learned from him and have been inspired by him. He is so right on this. This debate is treated as a matter of such passing moment that nobody is here. I want them to have a chance to come back.  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time for the quorum be charged not against any individual Senator but against the overall 30 hours.
