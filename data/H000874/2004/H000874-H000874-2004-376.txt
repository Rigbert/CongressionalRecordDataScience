Speaker, do not take it from me, my Republican friends, listen to a respected Member of your own party, the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young.) In February Chairman Young said, and I quote, ``No one should expect a significant deficit reduction as a result of austere nondefense discretionary spending limits. The numbers simply do not add up.'' So said the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, one of the most respected Members of this body.  And why do not the numbers add up? Because nondefense discretionary spending represents only 17 percent of the entire Federal budget. The fact of the matter is we could wipe out all domestic discretionary spending, the funding for this House, the funding for the Senate, FBI, CIA, NIH, NASA, all of that. If you wipe it all out, we would still be running a deficit of more than $100 billion.  Yet this week the Republican majority continues its markup of a budget resolution for fiscal year 2005 that utterly ignores mathematical and fiscal reality. By applying pay-go rules to spending only, the Republican budget resolution pretends that making existing tax cuts permanent or enacting new ones are a freebie with no budgetary impact. But, of course, that is false. And if one said it, it might even be a lie.  The truth is this Republican budget resolution cuts taxes while spending the entire $1 trillion Social Security surplus between fiscal year 2005 and 2009. All of it. Every nickel of Social Security surplus, spent. And it would continue to do so in subsequent years.  The truth is the Republican budget resolution would make our deficits $247 billion worse over the next 5 years under current law. And over 10 years it would increase the deficit, already projected by the Congressional Budget Office at $2 trillion, by another $1.6 trillion.  There are a lot of young people who are going to pay the price for our profligacy and irresponsibility. Indeed, this budget resolution proposal, as has the economic policies of this administration, been immoral to the extent that they adversely affect generations to come. And the truth is this budget resolution would freeze funding for domestic appropriations outside of Homeland Security to make room, not for defense, not for homeland security, but for new tax cuts.  For years House Republicans preened as, quote, deficit hawks. Some even suggested that tax cuts are not in fact sacrosanct. For example, in 1997 the majority leader himself, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) who I quoted earlier, said of Jack Kemp, you all remember Jack Kemp, he served in this body, a member of the Committee on Appropriations, candidate for Vice President of the United States, he quoted and he said the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) said this: ``Jack Kemp worships at the altar of tax cuts. Jack has always said that deficits do not matter.''  Now, this is the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) the majority leader, the Republican leader of this House. He concluded by saying, quote, ``We think that deficits do matter.''  What a tragedy for our country and for our young people that the policies do not follow that conviction. My Republican friends, this week and next you are going to show the American people whether you are really serious about reducing the deficit you created or whether you are simply taking it and lack the courage to make the tough choices.  Now, when I say the deficit of your creation, let me remind all of our colleagues the first 4 years took us on a straight line out of deficit financing and the last 4 years, for the first time in 8 decades, in the lifetime of anybody older than 80, was in surplus for 4 years straight. So this administration inherited a budget surplus which they said, not what we Democrats said, which they said was $5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years that they had to work with. It is now $4 trillion of debt. That is what I refer to as immoral.  As Republican Senator John McCain said last week in supporting pay-go rules that apply to existing as well as future tax cuts, and I will quote again, Senator John McCain.
