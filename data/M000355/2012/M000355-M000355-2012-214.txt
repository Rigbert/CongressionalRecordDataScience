 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great educator who has impacted the lives of thousands of Kentuckians over the course of his career. My good friend, Dr. Larry D. Shinn, will retire in a little more than a month's time after serving 18 years as president of Berea College in Berea, KY, and I know I speak for many when I say I am very sorry to see him go.  Dr. Shinn has served as president since 1994 and is the eighth president of Berea College, a proud liberal-arts college which is dedicated to serving students of great promise and limited economic means. Its primary focus is on serving students from the Appalachian region. Berea College generously offers a full-tuition scholarship to each of its 1,500 students and requires all of them to work in positions on campus. Berea College is proud of its heritage as the first interracial and coeducational college in the South and proud of its focus on a Christian ethic of service and its historic mission to promote the cause of Christ.  Dr. Shinn is a magna cum laude graduate of Baldwin-Wallace College and a summa cum laude graduate of Drew University Theological School. He received his Ph.D. in history of religions from Princeton University. Before coming aboard as Berea's president, he taught at Oberlin College for 14 years and served as dean and vice president at Bucknell University for 10 years. He has authored several books and numerous articles and book reviews.  Then there is the remarkable progress Berea College has made under Dr. Shinn's leadership. During his presidency, Dr. Shinn has led the school's strategic-planning process and the creation of its strategic plan for Berea College to thrive in the 21st century. He has instituted a decisionmaking process that has enhanced virtually every area of academic life, from student retention and graduation rates to residential life, academic planning, development, and facilities renovation. He has led Berea's sustainability initiative, which is responsible for the creation of the Sustainability and Environmental Studies Program; the ecological renovations of several campus buildings, including the first LEED, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, building in Kentucky; and the establishment of a residential ``eco-village'' for student families.  Dr. Shinn also led the ``Extending Berea's Legacy'' campaign that raised $162 million for endowments to fund student scholarships, undergraduate research, a new technology program for students, a study abroad program, an entrepreneurship program, and other key initiatives.  I know that Larry and his wife Nancy are looking forward to having a little more time to themselves and to spend with their family, but their gain will certainly be Berea College's and Kentucky's loss. In his 18 years at the helm, Dr. Shinn has proven himself to be one of the finest college presidents in Kentucky and the Nation. I salute him for his incredible legacy of service towards improving the lives of the thousands of Kentuckians and other students who have passed through Berea College's doors. He is a great Kentuckian whom I have been honored to represent and to work with over his nearly two decades as Berea College's president. He will be missed.  Mr. President, the Berea Spotlight, a publication of Berea College, published an article highlighting the many accomplishments of Dr. Larry Shinn around the time he announced his retirement. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Berea Spotlight, Apr. 4, 2011]         Larry Shinn, Berea College President, Plans Retirement                            (By Tim Jordan)       Berea College President Dr. Larry D. Shinn announced today      that he will be retiring from the College, effective June 30,      2012. Berea's 8th president, Dr. Shinn has served in this      capacity since 1994. In a letter to trustees, faculty, staff      and students, Shinn stated that, with the College emerging      strongly from the challenges of the Great Recession, it is a      good time for Berea to begin the process of a leadership      transition.       The combined efforts of Berea's faculty, staff,      administrators, trustees, and other stakeholders have, over      the span of the past 17 years, resulted in dramatic progress      at the College. Enrollment of African-American students has      increased from 6 percent to 18 percent, while service to the      Appalachian region has been expanded. Retention and      graduation rates have improved more than 30 percent while new      program initiatives have enhanced educational quality. The      College has successfully completed over $140 million in      sustainable building renovations, and in 2005 a $150-million      sesquicentennial campaign exceeded its goal. In response to      the financial crisis of 2008 09, the College has embraced a      bold and creative vision for carrying out its historic      mission in a rapidly changing world. Dr. Shinn noted that      Berea is a stronger and more resilient institution today that      has greater capacity to address future opportunities and      challenges.       President Shinn indicated that while he and his wife,      Nancy, are looking forward to extended time with their      children and grandchildren during their pending retirement,      he cited a number of challenging initiatives that Berea must      engage over the next 15 months, including the transition from      academic departments to divisions, development of the      College's new Center for Transformative Learning, and ``deep      green'' science and residence hall projects.       Dr. David E. Shelton, chair of the Berea College Board of      Trustees, commented: ``President Shinn's unique blend of      academic and leadership skills passionately applied to      Berea's mission, in partnership with the entire College      community, has produced outstanding results. Berea is well-     positioned for the future, and we look forward to the      unfolding of a number of new developments and opportunities      during Larry's remaining tenure as president. Dr. Shinn's      extraordinary abilities, personal commitment, and strong work      ethic have set the example for the next generation of      presidential leadership at     Berea. The Board of Trustees is grateful to Larry and Nancy      for their extraordinary service to the College.''                          ____________________
