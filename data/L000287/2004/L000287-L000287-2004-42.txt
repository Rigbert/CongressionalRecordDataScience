Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the leader for that information.  Mr. Majority Leader, when the Congress adjourned for the year last year, it failed to extend the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program, leaving 90,000 American workers and their families every week, roughly one-half million workers by the end of this month, in the lurch. We have 200 Democrats who have signed a discharge petition that would bring to the floor legislation to extend this much-needed help to those workers.  Can the majority leader tell the House, tell all of us when he will schedule debate on this important matter?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield.
