 President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the pending compound motion occur at 3 p.m. today; further, that if the motion is agreed to, Senators King and Stabenow each be recognized to offer a motion to instruct conferees, and that the Senate vote on the motions in the order listed with no intervening action or debate; further, that there be 2 minutes of debate between each vote, equally divided in the usual form; finally, I ask that following disposition of the Stabenow motion, the Senate stand in recess until 5:10 p.m. to accommodate an all-Members briefing.
