Speaker, the resolution under consideration poses a clear and concise policy question. Either you support the mission our troops are carrying out in Iraq or you are against it.  I voted to authorize the use of force back on October 10, 2002 and today I want to reaffirm, on the record, my support for this important mission. Furthermore, I want to let all of our troops know, especially those who train and operate at the four military bases in my congressional district, that I will continue to support those strategies that will lead us to victory and stand opposed to any cut-and-run strategy.  In his book, The Hinge of Fate, Winston Churchill said, ``I like commanders on land and sea and in the air to feel that between them and all forms of public criticism the Government stands like a strong bulkhead. They ought to have a fair chance, and more than one chance.''  I think that we ought to let those words sink in. They ought to have a fair chance, and more than one chance.  No one ever said war was easy and any historian can tell you that anything of significant value has never come easy. The brave men and women serving in Iraq are writing the latest chapter in the history of freedom.  We should look forward, continue to support our troops, and provide them with the tools and the strategy to triumph--completing their mission is the most important thing to them. It should be our goal as well.  Mr. Speaker, let's show our support for this mission and embrace a victory strategy, not just an exit strategy.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2453]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]    EXPRESSING SENSE OF HOUSE THAT DEPLOYMENT OF FORCES IN IRAQ BE                          TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY                                 ______                                                                speech of                            HON.
