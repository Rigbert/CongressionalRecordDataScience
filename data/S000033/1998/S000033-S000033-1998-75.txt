 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico (Chairman Skeen) very much for his acceptance of this amendment. It has been a long morning. I grant the gentleman that. But I think it is worth it, and I hope to work with him in conference so that we can stand up for senior citizens.  So many of them are really hurting, and I know that the gentleman agrees that this is an important program. I thank him very much.
