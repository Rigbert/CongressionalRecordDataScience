 On November 1, 2009, our Speaker stood on this floor, outraged about the process. We, too, are outraged about this process, and let me quote the Speaker:       We will not stand for this. And I would ask my House      Republican colleagues and those who believe that we should be      here protecting the American people, protecting our      Constitution, not vote on this bill. Let's just get up and      leave.  My colleagues may well follow that advice.
