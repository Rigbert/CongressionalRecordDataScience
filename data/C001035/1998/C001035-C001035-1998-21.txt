Specifically, the hearing will highlight the scope and nature of cramming, educate consumers about cramming, and determine what is being done to control the practice.  This hearing will take place on Thursday, July 23, 1998, at 9:30 a.m., in Room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For further information, please contact Timothy J.
