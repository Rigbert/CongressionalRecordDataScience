We have stopped 2 so far; we have confirmed 128. I would note that friends on the other side of the aisle, when President Clinton was here, stopped 60, not by votes but by just simply having 1 or 2 Republicans object so they were never even allowed to have a vote. In fact, when the Republicans were in charge in 1995 and 1996 and 1997, when President Clinton was here, Republicans allowed 111 judicial nominees to be confirmed and only 18 circuit court judges. In 2\1/2\ years, we have done 128 judges for President Bush and 25 circuit court judges. So crocodile tears have been shed. Unfortunately, it is embarrassing when you tell the other side the numbers.  Is there any time remaining on both sides?
