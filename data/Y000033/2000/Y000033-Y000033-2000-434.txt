Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and I ask unanimous consent to yield 5 minutes of my 10 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) for the purpose of control.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alaska?  There was no objection.
