 President, grace under pressure; country and institution before self. These are the things that come to mind when I think of John Boehner. He is an ally, he is a friend, and he took over as Republican leader at a very difficult time for his party.  When some said Republicans could never recover, he never gave up. When some gave into defeatism, he kept up the fight. And because he did, Speaker Boehner was able to transform a broken and dispirited Republican minority into the largest Republican majority since the 1920s. That is a legacy few can match.  He flew across the country more times than he can count to support Members of his conference and to recruit new Members to the cause. As the leader of a new majority, he turned the tide in Congress and brought conservative reform in many areas. He worked tirelessly to provide hope to those who dreamed of a better life and to middle-class families who struggled under the weight of this administration.  John knows what it is like to struggle and to dream of something better. He has lived it. That a young man from Reading, OH, wielding a bar towel could one day wield the gavel of the U.S. House of Representatives reminds us of the continuing promise of this country.  We all know yesterday was an incredibly important event for the Speaker. It was his aim to bring the same spirit of grace to others that has always guided his life. One only had to look out onto the Capitol lawn to see what he achieved. And that he chose this moment to make this decision means he is willing to leave us in a similar spirit.  I know we will all have more to say then. But for now, thank you, my friend.                          ____________________
