 Lieberman, and Mrs.         Kassebaum):  S. 454. A bill to reform the health care liability system and improve health care quality through the establishment of quality assurance programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.   the health care liability reform and quality assurance act of 1995 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Health Care Liability Reform and Quality Assurance Act of 1995. Last year, Congress spent many days and weeks considering a dramatic overhaul of the finest health care system in the world. But the vast majority of Americans concluded we didn't need to reinvent our medical system. So, Congress, with good reason, laid aside health care and vowed to come back this year and make some needed incremental changes to the health care system.  Health care liability is one issue on which there was bipartisan consensus about the need to make some significant change. This bill which I am introducing today with the co-sponsorship and assistance of Senators Lieberman and Kassebaum represents this bipartisan effort.  The purpose of our bill is to promote patient safety, compensate those who suffer injuries fully and fairly, without enriching lawyers and bureaucrats, make health care more accessible, gain some cost containment in health care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship and encourage medical innovation. Our present system, unfortunately, does none of the above.  First of all, patients don't get compensated. The Rand Corp. has reported that only 43 cents of every dollar spent in the liability system goes to the injured party. That means lawyers, experts, and court fees eat up 57 percent of all dollars spent in the liability system.  Second, the prohibitive cost of liability insurance means some doctors won't provide care to those in our society who need it most. Half a million rural women can't get an obstetrician to deliver their babies. Because of high malpractice premiums, African-American doctors are avoiding the practice of medicine in high-risk areas--generally urban areas, making it more difficult for minority communities to get necessary care.  Third, companies that invent new products are discouraged under the current system from putting them on the market. Medical device manufacturers are finding it more difficult to get raw materials to produce life saving devices because of the risk of lawsuits.  Fourth, doctors are less likely to explore risky treatment because of the proliferation of lawsuits. A doctor has a better than 1 in 3 chance of being sued during his practice years. And the likelihood of suit has nothing to do with whether the doctor was negligent. GAO reports that almost 60 percent of all suits are dismissed without a verdict or even a settlement.  So, something is very wrong with our liability system and our bill will help solve the problem. It contains many of the provisions that were considered, on a bipartisan basis, in the Finance Committee last year, during the health care debate. I have included a summary of the bill's provisions and I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  Mr. President, I am hopeful that health care liability will get full consideration and action in this Congress. There will be at least two opportunities--when we consider some targeted [[Page S2864]] health care reform and when we consider legal reform. It is very important that we tackle this issue and I look forward to prompt action.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 454       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

TITLE I--HEALTH CARE LIABILITY REFORM                      Subtitle A--Liability Reform     SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--That the civil      justice system of the United States is a costly and      inefficient mechanism for resolving claims of health care      liability and compensating injured patients and that the      problems associated with the current system are having an      adverse impact on the availability of, and access to, health      care services and the cost of health care in this country.       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--That the health care      and insurance industries are industries affecting interstate      commerce and the health care liability litigation systems      existing throughout the United States affect interstate      commerce by contributing to the high cost of health care and      premiums for health care liability insurance purchased by      participants in the health care system.       (3) Effect on federal spending.--That the health care      liability litigation systems existing throughout the United      States have a significant effect on the amount, distribution,      and use of Federal funds because of--       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care      benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal      Government;       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of      the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to      provide them with health insurance benefits; and       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide      items or services for which the Federal Government makes      payments.       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to implement      reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care      liability reform that is designed to--       (1) ensure that individuals with meritorious health care      injury claims receive fair and adequate compensation,      including reasonable non-economic damages;       (2) improve the availability of health care service in      cases in which health care liability actions have been shown      to be a factor in the decreased availability of services; and       (3) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our      current health care liability system to resolve disputes      over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by      reducing uncertainty and unpredictability in the amount of      compensation provided to injured individuals.

(d) Federal Court Jurisdiction Not Established on Federal      Question Grounds.--Nothing in this subtitle shall be      construed to establish any jurisdiction in the district      courts of the United States over health care liability      actions on the basis of sections 1331 or 1337 of title 28,      United States Code.     SEC. 104. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.       A health care liability action that is subject to this Act      may not be initiated unless a complaint with respect to such      action is filed within the 2-year period beginning on the      date on which the claimant discovered or, in the exercise of      reasonable care, should have discovered the harm and its      cause, except that such an action relating to a claimant      under legal disability may be filed within 2 years after the      date on which the disability ceases. If the commencement of a      health care liability action is stayed or enjoined, the      running of the statute of limitations under this section      shall be suspended for the period of the stay or injunction.     SEC. 105. REFORM OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.       (a) Limitation.--With respect to a health care liability      action, an award for punitive damages may only be made, if      otherwise permitted by applicable law, if it is proven by      clear and convincing evidence that the defendant--       (1) intended to injure the claimant for a reason unrelated      to the provision of health care services;       (2) understood the claimant was substantially certain to      suffer unnecessary injury, and in providing or failing to      provide health care services, the defendant deliberately      failed to avoid such injury; or       (3) acted with a conscious disregard of a substantial and      unjustifiable risk of unnecessary injury which the defendant      failed to avoid in a manner which constitutes a gross      deviation from the normal standard of conduct in such      circumstances.       (b) Punitive Damages Not Permitted.--Notwithstanding the      provisions of subsection (a), punitive damages may not be      awarded against a defendant with respect to any health care      liability action if no judgment for compensatory damages,      including nominal damages (under $500), is rendered against      the defendant.       (c) Requirements for Pleading of Punitive Damages.--       (1) In general.--No demand for punitive damages shall be      included in a health care liability action as initially      filed.       (2) Amended pleading.--A court may allow a claimant to file      an amended complaint or pleading for punitive damages in a      health care liability action if--       (A) the claimant submits a motion to amend the complaint or      pleading within the earlier of--       (i) 2 years after the complaint or initial pleading is      filed, or       (ii) 9 months before the date the matter is first set for      trial; and       (B) after a finding by a court upon review of supporting      and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, that after      weighing the evidence the claimant has established by a      substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the      claim for punitive damages.       (d) Separate Proceeding.--       (1) In general.--At the request of any defendant in a      health care liability action, the trier of fact shall      consider in a separate proceeding--       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the      amount of such award, or       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a      determination of punitive liability.       (2) Only relevant evidence admissible.--If a defendant      requests a separate proceeding under paragraph (1), evidence      relevant only to the claim of punitive damages in a health      care liability action, as determined by applicable State law,      shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether      compensatory damages are to be awarded.       (e) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--In determining      the amount of punitive damages in a health care liability      action, the trier of fact shall consider only the following:       (1) The severity of the harm caused by the conduct of the      defendant.       (2) The duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by      the defendant.       (3) The profitability of the conduct of the defendant.       (4) The number of products sold or medical procedures      rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by the      defendant of the kind causing the harm complained of by the      claimant.       (5) Awards of punitive or exemplary damages to persons      similarly situated to the claimant, when offered by the      defendant.       (6) Prospective awards of compensatory damages to persons      similarly situated to the claimant.       (7) Any criminal penalties imposed on the defendant as a      result of the conduct complained of by the claimant, when      offered by the defendant.       (8) The amount of any civil fines assessed against the      defendant as a result of the conduct complained of by the      claimant, when offered by the defendant.       (f) Limitation Amount.--The amount of damages that may be      awarded as punitive damages in any health care liability      action shall not exceed 3 times the amount awarded to the      claimant for the economic injury on which such claim is      based, or $250,000, whichever is greater. This subsection      shall be applied by the court and shall not be disclosed to      the jury.       (g) Restrictions Permitted.--Nothing in this section shall      be construed to imply a right to seek punitive damages where      none exists under Federal or State law.     SEC. 106. PERIODIC PAYMENTS.       With respect to a health care liability action, no person      may be required to pay more than $100,000 for future damages      in a single payment of a damages award, but a person shall be      permitted to make such payments of the award on a periodic      basis. The periods for such payments shall be determined by      the adjudicating body, based upon projections of future      losses and shall be reduced to present value. The      adjudicating body may waive the requirements of this section      if such body determines that such a waiver is in the      interests of justice.     SEC. 107. SCOPE OF LIABILITY.       (a) In General.--With respect to punitive and noneconomic      damages, the liability of each defendant in a health care      liability action shall be several only and may not be joint.      Such a defendant shall be liable only for the amount of      punitive or noneconomic damages allocated to the defendant in      direct proportion to such defendant's percentage of fault or      responsibility for the injury suffered by the claimant.       (b) Determination of Percentage of Liability.--The trier of      fact in a health care liability action shall determine the      extent of each defendant's fault or responsibility for injury      suffered by the claimant, and shall assign a percentage of      responsibility for such injury to each such defendant.       (c) Prohibition on Vicarious Liability.--A defendant in a      health care liability action may not be held vicariously      liable for the direct actions or omissions of other      individuals.     SEC. 108. MANDATORY OFFSETS FOR DAMAGES PAID BY A COLLATERAL                    SOURCE.       (a) In General.--With respect to a health care liability      action, the total amount of damages received by an individual      under such action shall be reduced, in accordance with      subsection (b), by any other payment that has been, or will      be, made to an individual to compensate such individual for      the injury that was the subject of such action.       (b) Amount of Reduction.--The amount by which an award of      damages to an individual for an injury shall be reduced under      subsection (a) shall be--       (1) the total amount of any payments (other than such      award) that have been made or that will be made to such      individual to pay costs of or compensate such individual for      the injury that was the subject of the action; minus       (2) the amount paid by such individual (or by the spouse,      parent, or legal guardian of such individual) to secure the      payments described in paragraph (1).       (c) Pretrial Determination of Amounts from Collateral      Services.--The reductions requires under subsection (b)(2)      shall be determined by the court in a pretrial proceeding. At      such proceeding--       (1) no evidence shall be admitted as to the amount of any      charge, payments, or damage for which a claimant--       (A) has received payment from a collateral source or the      obligation for which has been assured by a third party; or       (B) is, or with reasonable certainty, will be eligible to      receive payment from a collateral source of the obligation      which will, with reasonable certainty be assumed by a third      party; and       (2) the jury, if any, shall be advised that--       (A) except for damages as to which the court permits the      introduction of evidence, the claimant's medical expenses and      lost income have been or will be paid by a collateral source      or third party; and       (B) the claimant shall receive no award for any damages      that have been or will be paid by a collateral source or      third party.     SEC. 109. TREATMENT OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND OTHER COSTS.       (a) Limitation on Amount of Contingency Fees.--       (1) In general.--An attorney who represents, on a      contingency fee basis, a claimant in a health care liability      action may not charge, demand, receive, or collect for      services rendered in connection with such action in excess of      the following amount recovered by judgment or settlement      under such action:       (A) 33\1/3\ percent of the first $150,000 (or portion      thereof) recovered, based on after-tax recovery, plus       (B) 25 percent of any amount in excess of $150,000      recovered, based on after-tax recovery.       (2) Calculation of periodic payments.--In the event that a      judgment or settlement includes periodic or future payments      of damages, the amount recovered for purposes of computing      the limitation on the contingency fee under paragraph (1)      shall be based on the cost of the annuity or trust      established to make the payments. In any case in which an      annuity or trust is not established to make such payments,      such amount shall be based on the present value of the      payments.       (b) Contingency Fee Defined.--As used in this section, the      term ``contingency fee'' means any fee for professional legal      services which is, in whole or in part, contingent upon the      recovery of any amount of damages, whether through judgment      or settlement.     SEC. 110. OBSTETRIC CASES.       With respect to a health care liability action relating to      services provided during      [[Page S2866]] labor or the delivery of a baby, if the health      care professional against whom the action is brought did not      previously treat the pregnant woman for the pregnancy, the      trier of fact may not find that the defendant committed      malpractice and may not assess damages against the health      care professional unless the malpractice is proven by clear      and convincing evidence.     SEC. 111. STATE-BASED ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION                    MECHANISMS.       (a) Application to Health Care Liability Claims under      Health Plans.--Prior to or immediately following the      commencement of any health care liability action, the parties      shall participate in the alternative dispute resolution      system administered by the State under subsection (b). Such      participation shall be in lieu of any other provision of      Federal or State law applicable to the parties prior to the      commencement of the health care liability action.       (b) Adoption of Mechanism by State.--Each State shall--       (1) maintain or adopt at least one of the alternative      dispute resolution methods satisfying the requirements      specified under subsection (c) and (d) for the resolution of      health care liability claims arising from the provision of      (or failure to provide) health care services to individuals      enrolled in a health plans; and       (2) clearly disclose to enrollees in health plans (and      potential enrollees) the availability and procedures for      consumer grievances, including a description of the      alternative dispute resolution method or methods adopted      under this subsection.       (c) Specification of Permissible Alternative Dispute      Resolution Methods.--       (1) In general.--The Attorney General, in consultation with      the Secretary and the Administrative Conference of the United      States, shall, by regulation, develop alternative dispute      resolution methods for the use by States in resolving health      care liability claims under subsection (a). Such methods      shall include at least the following:       (A) Arbitration.--The use of arbitration, a nonjury      adversarial dispute resolution process which may, subject to      subsection (d), result in a final decision as to facts, law,      liability or damages. The parties may elect binding      arbitration.       (B) Mediation.--The use of mediation, a settlement process      coordinated by a neutral third party without the ultimate      rendering of a formal opinion as to factual or legal      findings.       (C) Early neutral evaluation.--The use of early neutral      evaluation, in which the parties make a presentation to a      neutral attorney or other neutral evaluator for an assessment      of the merits, to encourage settlement. If the parties do not      settle as a result of assessment and proceed to trial, the      neutral evaluator's opinion shall be kept confidential.       (D) Early offer and recovery mechanism.--       (i) In general.--The use of early offer and recovery      mechanisms under which a health care provider, health care      organization, or any other alleged responsible defendant may      offer to compensate a claimant for his or her reasonable      economic damages, including future economic damages, less      amounts available from collateral sources.       (ii) Binding arbitration.--If, after an offer is made under      clause (i), the claimant alleges that payment of economic      damages under the offer has not been reasonably made, or the      participants in the offer dispute their relative      contributions to the payments to be made to the claimant,      such disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration      in accordance with applicable rules and procedures      established by the State involved.       (2) Standards for establishing methods.--In developing      alternative dispute resolution methods under paragraph (1),      the Attorney General shall assure that the methods promote      the resolution of health care liability claims in a manner      that--       (A) is affordable for the parties involved;       (B) provides for timely resolution of claims;       (C) provides for the consistent and fair resolution of      claims; and       (D) provides for reasonably convenient access to dispute      resolution for individuals enrolled in plans.       (3) Waiver authority.--Upon application of a State, the      Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary, may      grant the State the authority to fulfill the requirement of      subsection (b) by adopting a mechanism other than a mechanism      established by the Attorney General pursuant to this      subsection, except that such mechanism must meet the      standards set forth in paragraph (2).       (d) Further Redress.--Except with respect to the claimant-     requested binding arbitration method set forth in subsection      (c)(1)(A), a claimant who is dissatisfied with the      determination reached as a result of an alternative dispute      resolution method applied under this section may, after the      final resolution of the claimant's claim under the method,      initiate or resume a cause of action to seek damages or other      redress with respect to the claim to the extent otherwise      permitted under State law. State law shall govern the      admissibility of results of any alternative dispute      resolution procedure and all statements, offers, and other      communications made during such procedures, at any subsequent      trial. An individual who indicates or resumes a health care      liability action shall only prevail if such individual proves      each element of the action beyond a reasonable doubt,      including proving that the defendant was grossly negligent or      intentionally caused injury.     SEC. 112. REQUIREMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF MERIT.       (a) Requiring Submission with Complaint.--Except as      provided in subsection (b) and subject to the penalties of      subsection (d), no health care liability action may be      brought by any individual unless, at the time the individual      commences such action, the individual or the individual's      attorney submits an affidavit declaring that--       (1) the individual (or the individual's attorney) has      consulted and reviewed the facts of the claim with a      qualified specialist (as defined in subsection (c));       (2) the individual or the individual's attorney has      obtained a written report by a qualified specialist that      clearly identifies the individual and that includes the      specialist's determination that, based upon a review of the      available medical record and other relevant material, a      reasonable medical interpretation of the facts supports a      finding that the claim against the defendant is meritorious      and based on good cause; and       (3) on the basis of the qualified specialist's review and      consultation, the individual, and if represented, the      individual's attorney, have concluded that the claim is      meritorious and based on good cause.       (b) Extension in Certain Instances.--       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), subsection (a)      shall not apply with respect to an individual who brings a      health care liability action without submitting an affidavit      described in such subsection if--       (A) despite good faith efforts, the individual is unable to      obtain the written report before the expiration of the      applicable statute of limitations;       (B) despite good faith efforts, at the time the individual      commences the action, the individual has been unable to      obtain medical records or other information necessary,      pursuant to any applicable law, to prepare the written report      requested; or       (C) the court of competent jurisdiction determines that the      affidavit requirement shall be extended upon a showing of      good cause.       (2) Deadline for submission where extension applies.--In      the case of an individual who brings an action to which      paragraph (1) applies, the action shall be dismissed unless      the individual submits the affidavit described in subsection      (a) not later than--       (A) in the case of an action to which subparagraph (A) of      paragraph (1) applies, 90 days after commencing the action;      or       (B) in the case of an action to which subparagraph (B) of      paragraph (1) applies, 90 days after obtaining the      information described in such subparagraph or when good cause      for an extension no longer exists.       (c) Qualified Specialist Defined.--       (1) In general.--As used in subsection (a), the term      ``qualified specialist'' means, with respect to a health care      liability action, a health care professional who has      expertise in the same or substantially similar area of      practice to that involved in the action.       (2) Evidence of expertise.--For purposes of paragraph (1),      evidence of required expertise may include evidence that the      individual--       (A) practices (or has practiced) or teaches (or has taught)      in the same or substantially similar area of health care or      medicine to that involved in the action; or       (B) is otherwise qualified by experience or demonstrated      competence in the relevant practice area.

Subtitle B--Biomaterials Access Assurance     SEC. 121. SHORT TITLE.       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access      Assurance Act of 1995''.     SEC. 122. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States      depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing      medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable      within the human body;       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts      is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and      maintenance of the supply of the devices;       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials      and component parts that--       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use      in medical devices; and       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in      a variety of nonmedical products;       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and      component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw      materials and component parts for medical devices constitute      an extremely small portion of the      [[Page S2867]] overall market for the raw materials and      medical devices;       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21      U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are      required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and      effective, including demonstrating that the products are      properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and      component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a      final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of      actions alleging inadequate--       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with      materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component      parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such      suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and      component parts for use in medical devices because the costs      associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable      judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential      sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical      device industry;       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the      unavailability of raw materials and component parts for      medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and      life-enhancing medical devices;       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and      component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw      materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain      medical devices in the United States, the prospects for      development of new sources of supply for the full range of      threatened raw materials and component parts for medical      devices are remote;       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw      materials and component parts in the United States could      support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers      of such raw materials and component parts;       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the      cost of medical devices;       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the      suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have      generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw      material or component part in a medical device; and       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and      effectiveness of a medical device;       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in      subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of      the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm      than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying      manufacturers of medical devices; and       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide      variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices,      immediate action is needed--       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for      suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical      devices; and       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of      unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to      minimize litigation costs.

(c) Proceeding on Motion To Dismiss.--The following rules      shall apply to any proceeding on a motion to dismiss filed      under this section:       (1) Affidavits relating to listing and declarations.--       (A) In general.--The defendant in the action may submit an      affidavit demonstrating that defendant has not included the      implant on a list, if any, filed with the Secretary pursuant      to section 510(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act      (21 U.S.C. 360(j)).       (B) Response to motion to dismiss.--In response to the      motion to dismiss, the claimant may submit an affidavit      demonstrating that--       (i) the Secretary has, with respect to the defendant and      the implant that allegedly caused harm to the claimant,      issued a declaration pursuant to section 125(b)(2)(B); or       (ii) the defendant who filed the motion to dismiss is a      seller of the implant who is liable under section 125(c).       (2) Effect of motion to dismiss on discovery.--       (A) In general.--If a defendant files a motion to dismiss      under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a), no discovery      shall be permitted in connection to the action that is the      subject of the motion, other than discovery necessary to      determine a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, until      such time as the court rules on the motion to dismiss in      accordance with the affidavits submitted by the parties in      accordance with this section.       (B) Discovery.--If a defendant files a motion to dismiss      under subsection (a)(2) on the grounds that the biomaterials      supplier did not furnish raw materials or component parts in      violation of contractual requirements or specifications, the      court may permit discovery, as ordered by the court. The      discovery conducted pursuant to this subparagraph shall be      limited to issues that are directly relevant to--     [[Page S2869]]   (i) the pending motion to dismiss; or       (ii) the jurisdiction of the court.       (3) Affidavits relating status of defendant.--       (A) In general.--Except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii)      of subparagraph (B), the court shall consider a defendant to      be a biomaterials supplier who is not subject to an action      for harm to a claimant caused by an implant, other than an      action relating to liability for a violation of contractual      requirements or specifications described in subsection (d).       (B) Responses to motion to dismiss.--The court shall grant      a motion to dismiss any action that asserts liability of the      defendant under subsection (b) or (c) of section 125 on the      grounds that the defendant is not a manufacturer subject to      such subsection 125(b) or seller subject to subsection      125(c), unless the claimant submits a valid affidavit that      demonstrates that--       (i) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending the      defendant is not a manufacturer, the defendant meets the      applicable requirements for liability as a manufacturer under      section 125(b); or       (ii) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending that      the defendant is not a seller, the defendant meets the      applicable requirements for liability as a seller under      section 125(c).       (4) Basis of ruling on motion to dismiss.--       (A) In general.--The court shall rule on a motion to      dismiss filed under subsection (a) solely on the basis of the      pleadings of the parties made pursuant to this section and      any affidavits submitted by the parties pursuant to this      section.       (B) Motion for summary judgment.--Notwithstanding any other      provision of law, if the court determines that the pleadings      and affidavits made by parties pursuant to this section raise      genuine issues as concerning material facts with respect to a      motion concerning contractual requirements and      specifications, the court may deem the motion to dismiss to      be a motion for summary judgment made pursuant to subsection      (d).       (d) Summary Judgment.--       (1) In general.--       (A) Basis for entry of judgment.--A biomaterials supplier      shall be entitled to entry of judgment without trial if the      court finds there is no genuine issue as concerning any      material fact for each applicable element set forth in      paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 125(d).       (B) Issues of material fact.--With respect to a finding      made under subparagraph (A), the court shall consider a      genuine issue of material fact to exist only if the evidence      submitted by claimant would be sufficient to allow a      reasonable jury to reach a verdict for the claimant if the      jury found the evidence to be credible.       (2) Discovery made prior to a ruling on a motion for      summary judgment.--If, under applicable rules, the court      permits discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary      judgment made pursuant to this subsection, such discovery      shall be limited solely to establishing whether a genuine      issue of material fact exists.       (3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier.--A      biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in      connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary      judgment on the basis of the inapplicability of section      125(d) or the failure to establish the applicable elements of      section 125(d) solely to the extent permitted by the      applicable Federal or State rules for discovery against      nonparties.       (e) Stay Pending Petition for Declaration.--If a claimant      has filed a petition for a declaration pursuant to section      125(b) with respect to a defendant, and the Secretary has not      issued a final decision on the petition, the court shall stay      all proceedings with respect to that defendant until such      time as the Secretary has issued a final decision on the      petition.       (f) Manufacturer Conduct of Proceeding.--The manufacturer      of an implant that is the subject of an action covered under      this subtitle shall be permitted to file and conduct a      proceeding on any motion for summary judgment or dismissal      filed by a biomaterials supplier who is a defendant under      this section if the manufacturer and any other defendant in      such action enter into a valid and applicable contractual      agreement under which the manufacturer agrees to bear the      cost of such proceeding or to conduct such proceeding.       (g) Attorney Fees.--The court shall require the claimant to      compensate the biomaterials supplier (or a manufacturer      appearing in lieu of a supplier pursuant to subsection (f))      for attorney fees and costs, if--       (1) the claimant named or joined the biomaterials supplier;      and       (2) the court found the claim against the biomaterials      supplier to be without merit and frivolous.                       Subtitle C--Applicability     SEC. 131. APPLICABILITY.       This title shall apply to all civil actions covered under      this title that are commenced on or after the date of      enactment of this Act, including any such action with respect      to which the harm asserted in the action or the conduct that      caused the harm occurred before the date of enactment of this      Act.       TITLE II--PROTECTION OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS     SEC. 201. HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM.       (a) Fund.--Each State shall establish a health care quality      assurance program, to be approved by the Secretary, and a      fund consisting of such amounts as are transferred to the      fund under subsection (b).       (b) Transfer of Amounts.--Each State shall require that 50      percent of all awards of punitive damages resulting from all      health care liability actions in that State be transferred to      the fund established under subsection (a) in the State.       (c) Obligations from Fund.--The chief executive officer of      a State shall obligate such sums as are available in the fund      established in that State under subsection (a) to--       (1) license and certify health care professionals in the      State;       (2) implement health care quality assurance programs; and       (3) carry out programs to reduce malpractice-related costs      for health care providers volunteering to provide health care      services in medically underserved areas.     SEC. 202. RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.       (a) Requirements for Providers.--Each State shall require      each health care professional and health care provider      providing services in the State to participate in a risk      management program to prevent and provide early warning of      practices which may result in injuries to patients or which      otherwise may endanger patient safety.       (b) Requirements for Insurers.--Each State shall require      each entity which provides health care professional or      provider liability insurance to health care professionals and      health care providers in the State to--       (1) establish risk management programs based on data      available to such entity or sanction programs of risk      management for health care professionals and health care      providers provided by other entities; and       (2) require each such professional or provider, as a      condition of maintaining insurance, to participate in one      program described in paragraph (1) at least once in each 3-     year period.     SEC. 203. NATIONAL PRACTITIONER DATA BANK.       Section 427 of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of      1986 (42 U.S.C. 11137) is amended--       (1) by redesignating subsections (b) through (d) as      subsections (c) through (e), respectively;       (2) by inserting after subsection (a), the following new      subsection:       ``(b) Disclosure of Information.--The Secretary shall      promulgate regulations providing for the disclosure of      information reported to the Secretary under sections 422 and      423, upon request, to any individual.''; and       (3) in subsection (c) (as so redesignated)--       (A) in the first sentence of paragraph (1), by striking      ``under this part'' and inserting ``under section 421''; and       (B) in paragraph (3), by striking ``subsection (a)'' and      inserting ``subsections (a) and (b)''.                        TITLE III--SEVERABILITY     SEC. 301. SEVERABILITY.       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this      Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any      person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the      remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and      the application of the provisions of such to any person or      circumstance shall not be affected thereby.                                                                    ____ Summary of McConnell-Lieberman-Kassebaum Health Care Liability Reform                    and Quality Assurance Act of 1995                       title i--liability reform                Subtitle A--Health Care Liability Reform       1. Scope:       a. Applies to any action, filed in federal or state court,      against a health care provider, professional, payor, hmo,      insurance company or any other defendant (except vaccine-     related injuries);       b. Preempts state law to the extent it is inconsistent with      the provisions herein; no preemption for state laws which:       (1) provide additional defenses;       (2) greater limitations on attorneys' fees;       (3) greater restrictions on punitive or non-economic      damages;       (4) permit state officials to institute action;       (5) permit provider-based dispute resolution.       c. Does not create federal jurisdiction for health care      liability actions.       2. Uniform Statute of Limitations:       Two years from the date injury discovered or should have      been discovered, except that any person under a legal      disability may file within two years after the disability      ceases.       3. Limit on Punitive Damages:       a. Awarded if proved by clear and convincing evidence      defendant:       (1) intended to injure;       (2) understood claimant was substantially certain to suffer      unnecessary injury and deliberately failed to avoid injury;      or       (3) acted with conscious disregard of substantial and      unjustifiable risk which defendant failed to avoid in a way      which constitutes a gross deviation from the normal standard      of conduct.       b. No punitive damages where compensatory damages of less      than $500 are awarded.       c. Punitive damages may not be pleaded in original      complaint. A complaint may be amended within, the earlier of,      2 years of original complaint or 9 months before the case is      set for trial, and after court finds substantial probability      that claimant will prevail on the claim for punitive damages.       [[Page S2870]] d. At the defendant's request, punitive      damages must be considered in a separate proceeding and, if      so requested, no evidence relevant to the claim for punitive      damages may be admitted in the proceedings for compensatory      damages.       e. In determining the amount, court must consider only:       (1) severity of harm;       (2) duration of defendant's conduct and any concealment;       (3) profitability of defendant's conduct;       (4) number of products sold/procedures rendered which      caused similar harm;       (5) similar awards of punitive damages in similar      circumstances;       (6) prospective awards of compensatory damages to similarly      situated persons;       (7) criminal penalties imposed on defendant;       (8) civil fines imposed.       f. No award may exceed the greater of 3 times the amount of      economic damages or $250,000.       4. Periodic Payment of Damages:       No more than $100,000 may be required to be paid in one      single payment. The court will determine the schedule for      payments, based on projection of future losses and reduced to      present value. This requirement may be waived, in the      interests of justice.       5. Several, not Joint, Liability:       Defendant liable only for the amount of non-economic and      punitive damages allocated to defendant's direct proportion      of fault or responsibility. The trier of fact determines      percentage of responsibility of each defendant. No vicarious      liability for direct acts or omissions.       6. Collateral Source:       Total damages must be reduced by payments from other      sources made, or to be made, to compensate individual for      injury that is the subject of the health care liability      action. The offset is reduced by any amount paid by the      injured party (or family member) to secure the payment. The      reductions must be determined by the judge in a pretrial      proceeding.       7. Attorneys' Fees:       Limits attorney contingent fees to 33\1/3\% of the first      $150,000 and 25% of any amount in excess of $150,000.       8. Obstetric Cases:       No malpractice award against a health care professional      relating to delivery of a baby, if the health care      professional did not previously treat the woman during the      pregnancy, unless malpractice proved by clear and convincing      evidence.       9. State Based Alternative Dispute Resolution:       a. Prior to the filing, or immediately following the filing      of the action, the parties must participate in a state      administered alternative dispute resolution system.       b. The Attorney General will develop adr methods for use by      the states, including arbitration, mediation, early neutral      evaluation, early offer and recovery. The parties may elect      binding arbitration.       c. Adr must promote resolution of health care liability      claims in an affordable, timely, fair and convenient manner.      States may be granted waivers if they have programs that meet      these standards.       d. Any party dissatisfied (except where binding arbitration      selected) may continue the action in court and may prevail      only if each element of the case is proved beyond a      reasonable doubt,      including that the defendant was grossly negligent or      intentionally caused injury. State law governs the      admission of adr proceedings.       10. Certificate of Merit:       Requires that, prior to bringing a lawsuit, an individual      (or his or her attorney) to submit an affidavit declaring      that the individual reviewed the facts with a qualified      specialist and that the specialist has concluded the claim is      meritorious. A qualified specialist means a health care      professional with expertise (the specialist practices or      teaches or has experience or demonstrated competence) in the      same or substantially similar area of practice as that      involved in the case. A court may impose sanctions for the      submission of a false affidavit.                Subtitle B--Biomaterial Access Assurance       1. Summary:       The Biomaterial Access Assurance Act would allow suppliers      of the raw material (biomaterial) used to make medical      implants, to obtain dismissal, without extensive discovery or      other legal costs, in certain tort suits in which plaintiffs      allege harm from a finished medical implant.       The Act would not affect the ability of plaintiffs to sue      manufacturers or sellers of medical implants. It would allow      raw materials suppliers, however, to be dismissed from      lawsuits if the generic raw material used in the medical      device met contract specifications, and if the biomaterial      supplier cannot be classified as either a manufacturer or      seller of the medical implant.       2. Scope:       a. Establishes that any biomaterial supplier may seek its      dismissal from a civil action within the parameters of the      Subtitle.       b. Applies to any civil action brought by a claimant in      Federal or State court against a manufacturer, seller, or      biomaterial supplier, on the basis of any legal theory, for      harm allegedly caused by an implant.       c. Preempts State law to the extent the bill establishes a      rule of law.       3. Grounds for Dismissal:       a. Requires dismissal of a biomaterial supplier unless the      claimant establishes that the supplier:       (1) was itself the manufacturer of the implant;       (2) was itself the seller of the implant; or       (3) furnished raw materials that failed to met applicable      contractual requirements or specifications.       b. A supplier may be deemed to be a manufacturer only if      the supplier registered as such with the FDA pursuant to      medical device requirements or if the HHS Secretary issues a      declaration that the supplier should have registered as such.      Establishes a procedure for the Secretary to issue such a      declaration.       c. A supplier may be deemed to be a seller if the supplier      itself resold the implant after it had been manufactured and      had entered the stream of commerce.       d. With respect to contractual requirements, a supplier may      be liable for harm only if the claimant shows that the      biomaterial were not the actual product for which the parties      contracted or the biomaterial failed to meet certain      specifications and that failure was the cause of the injury.      The relevant specifications are those:       (1) provided to the supplier by the manufacturer,       (2) provided by the manufacturer (either published, given      to the manufacturer, or included in an FDA master file), or       (3) included in manufacturer submissions that had received      clearance from the FDA.       4. Procedures for Dismissal:       a. A supplier named as a defendant or joined as a co-     defendant may file a motion to dismiss based on the defenses      set forth above.       b. A plaintiff must sue a manufacturer directly whenever      jurisdiction over the manufacturer is available. A plaintiff      must submit an expert's affidavit certifying that the      biomaterial were actually used and were the cause of the      alleged harm and that the case has merit.       c. Specific rules are established for the handling of a      motion to dismiss, including discovery limitations, summary      judgment procedures, and staying the proceedings.       d. The manufacturer, not the supplier, may conduct the      proceeding on the motion if an appropriate contractual      indemnification agreement exists. The possibility of      frivolous claims against a supplier is reduced by permitting      the court to require the plaintiff to pay attorney fees if      the plaintiff succeeds in making the supplier a defendant,      but ultimately is found to have a meritless claim.       5. Effective Date: The bill will apply to civil actions      commenced on or after the date of enactment.           title II--protection of patient health and safety       1. Quality Assurance:       Requires each state to establish a health care quality      assurance program and fund, approved by the Secretary of HHS.      Allocates 50% of all punitive damage awards to be transferred      to the fund for the purpose of licensing and certifying      health care professionals, implementing programs, including      programs to reduce malpractice costs for volunteers serving      underserved areas.       2. Risk Management Programs:       Professionals and providers must participate in risk      management program to prevent and provide early warning of      practices which may result in injuries. Insurers must      establish risk management programs and require participation,      once every 3 years, as a condition of maintaining insurance.       3. National Practitioner Data Bank:       Requires that information on the discipline of health care      practitioners, including suspension or revocation of licenses      or hospital privileges, be accessible to the public.
