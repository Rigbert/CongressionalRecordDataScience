President, I rise in support of Senator Hutchinson's sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I want to make clear that my support of this nonbinding resolution signifies my grave concerns about most-favored-nation status for China rather than a final decision about this important policy question.  Last month, the House of Representatives debated a resolution of disapproval that would have denied most-favored-nation status for China as proposed by President Clinton.
