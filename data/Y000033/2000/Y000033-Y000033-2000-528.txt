Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce legislation which will provide for the recognition of the King Salmon Traditional Village and the Shoonaq' Tribe of Kodiak, Alaska. For the past twenty years these two villages have worked with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the Interior to seek tribal recognition. They have gone through the process at the Department of the Interior and it is now time to grant them recognition.  I have two other villages going through the recognition process at the Department of the Interior, and if at time of mark-up of this bill they have addressed the concerns of the Department, we may include the two other villages from Alaska in this bill.                          ____________________
