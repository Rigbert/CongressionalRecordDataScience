Speaker, the gentleman so effectively raises the issues of sovereignty and of protecting our legal system based on a rule of law with individual rights embedded in those very deeply, and I wanted to thank him for his constant leadership, as well as the gentleman from Ohio's (Mr. Brown) leadership in this whole anti-CAFTA effort, and say that, in addition to the sovereignty issue, following on something the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) said, I think one also has to look at the morality of what is being done here, and his reference to the religious leaders that are coming here from Central America this week, certainly I think of the Roman Catholic Guatemalan cardinal and his tremendous letter that he wrote.  But according to Christian teaching, we remember the words: ``As you do unto them, the least of my brethren, so you do unto me.'' And we, as the most powerful Nation in the world, have to think about the impact of what we are doing as a country on the least among us not just at home but abroad. And without question, as the gentleman from Ohio has stated, the net income and the earning power of those in these Central American countries, in El Salvador, Guatemala, we put them all together, they are so poor. They are so low income. Our predilection should be to have a preference for the poor, that, in fact, we should make it no worse than they already have it.  And we can see the women who are working in those banana packing houses who earn pennies a day, bitten by spiders, and they are told to pack 40 boxes; no, pack 50 boxes an hour; no, pack 100; no, pack 200, until they wear out, and then there is another person lined up. They have no rights.  And how about in the places that sew clothing? Those are largely womenworkers. They have no voice. They earn pennies. It takes them 2 weeks of work to even afford one pair of the trousers they make that are sold in this country for $39. What is right about that?                              {time}  2045  What about those people? Are we not to think about them as well? Yes, those jobs were lost in South Carolina or Mississippi, or they moved somewhere from this country, and we fought that with these unfair trade advantages that some of these multinationals have.  Now, what this is doing is it is putting a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on a system that we know is so exploitative. It is bad for our people and horrendous for those doing the work in these packing sheds and these hot, dusty textile companies that no one will ever see.  I remember hearing a letter written by one woman working in a company that was headed by a South Korean who was making the women work faster and faster and faster and faster with no rights. That is where our country was 70 years ago, and we got rid of that kind of sweatshop condition, or at least we got the laws on the books to allow people to have some dignity in their work.  We should not be giving any Good Housekeeping Stamp of Approval to a system which will approve that kind of sweatshop labor that is going down in Central America, which this will exacerbate.  We should listen to the people, listen to those who are demonstrating, listen to those traveling here, listen to their religious leaders and using our power, which is our marketplace. They all want to take their stuff in here. So let us lift standards elsewhere as a condition of market entry, and let us make sure, by raising living standards, we do not keep washing out jobs in this country more and more.
