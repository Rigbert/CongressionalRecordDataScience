Speaker, the chairman of the committee spoke about their process. Their process has been a fact-finding process. That is our responsibility as a Congress. That is his responsibility and the committee's responsibility as a committee.  The majority party claims that they have an agenda for the people, and the people believe we ought to exercise our responsibility. That is what the committee is doing. I do not want to anticipate what the committee's findings will ultimately be nor what the committee's actions will finally be. We will wait to see. But it is exercising its responsibility as a coequal branch of government as provided in the Constitution.  I am not going to get into an argument, Mr. Speaker, about the premises in the Mueller report, other than to say I disagree with the characterization made by the Republican whip. That will be for another day to argue that.  The committee is doing its duty and it will continue to do so. And if it decides that that requires further action, my presumption is it will pursue that as well.
