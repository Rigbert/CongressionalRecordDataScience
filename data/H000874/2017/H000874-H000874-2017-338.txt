Speaker, Maryland was founded as a haven for freedom of worship, and our state is proud to be home to religious institutions and communities that enrich the life of our state and our country. One of those is the Har Sinai Congregation in Owings Mills. Founded on May 15, 1842, it is the oldest continuously operating Reform Jewish congregation in the United States. This year marks the 175th anniversary of its establishment.  Drawing on practices adopted by some of the first Reform synagogues in Europe, Har Sinai Congregation served a small community of immigrants first in Baltimore and later, as the community grew, in the suburbs. The synagogue's first leader, Rabbi David Einhorn, arrived in 1855 and became one of the central voices of American Reform Judaism in the nineteenth century. The `Olath Tamid' siddur he published in 1856 went on to become a template for the Union Prayer Book later adopted widely by Reform congregations across the country. Rabbi Einhorn also preached against slavery, a courageous act to undertake in a Southern state where that horrific institution was still practiced. His abolitionism eventually led him to flee to Philadelphia in 1861, escaping a violent, pro-Confederacy riot in Baltimore during the Civil War.  Among the clergy who followed in leading Har Sinai Congregation was Rabbi David Philipson, an American-born scholar and theologian who led the community from 1884 to 1888. A member of the first graduating class of the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, he would go on to become one of the most prominent Reform rabbis of his age, authoring books on history, theology, and literature while speaking out against anti-Semitism and, in his later years, the rise of Nazism. Today, the congregation is led by Rabbi Linda Joseph, a native of Australia and the first woman to lead the community, having taken up the pulpit there last year.  Now a congregation of more than 400 families, and with more than 200 students in its religious school, Har Sinai Congregation has become one of Maryland's most active and dynamic synagogues. With the mantra of `worshipping together; caring together; working together,' its members are putting into practice the ancient Jewish precepts that call for social justice, charitable works, education, and community engagement. On Shabbat and holidays, congregants gather in worship and join in liturgical song, led by Cantor Robert Gerber, as they continue the traditions of American Reform Judaism that Har Sinai Congregation helped establish.  I join in congratulating the clergy, lay leadership, and congregants of Har Sinai Congregation on reaching this milestone in the community's history, and I wish all of them a Shana Tovah U'Metuka--a sweet and happy new year for 5778.                          ____________________
