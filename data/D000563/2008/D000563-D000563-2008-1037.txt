President, I rise today to congratulate Bill Gainer for his many professional contributions to my home State and to wish him well as he begins a new chapter in his life. I have known Bill and his wife Gerry for over 20 years. Bill is a proud son of the southside of Chicago. He was born in Roseland to Dorothy Quinn and William Gainer, a second generation Chicago police officer. He and his six brothers and sisters went to St. Wilabroad grammar school and Bill graduated from St. Ignatius in 1958--at 16 years of age. Bill found his calling and started with Illinois Bell in 1960. The next year he joined the Army where he ran phone lines through southern Texas in the 261st Signal Construction Corps.  Starting at the top--of a telephone pole as a lineman--Bill has worked his way through every operation of Illinois Bell--construction/operations, installation/repair, marketing, network coordination-planning, and business relations. He ended up at the crossroads in a job that combined his depth of knowledge and love for the phone company with his devotion to Chicago and the labor and civic organizations that make it the greatest city in the world.  Leveraging his place in the business community with his Irish heritage, Bill became an active member in the city of Chicago and Cook County Irish Trade Missions. Mayor Richard M. Daley appointed Bill as the chairman of the Chicago Sister Cities International Program--Galway Committee in October of 2001. He has hosted mayors, Members of the Irish Parliament and business leaders to promote trade and business development between Chicago and Ireland. Bill is also the chairman of the Business Development Committee for the Cook County Irish Trade Mission to County Down and County Cork. The ever-expanding success of the South Side Irish Parade owes much to Bill. He is the Parade's emeritus chair.  Bill also has been active in many civic and nonprofit organizations. Closest to his heart are his involvement on the advisory board for Misericordia Heart of Mercy and the executive board of the Mercy Home for Boys and Girls. Bill was awarded the Misericordia Heart of Mercy Award in 2001 for his dedication and devotion to the Misericordia Home where his sister Rosemary lived many happy years. He is also the past president of the Illinois Veterans Leadership Program, an executive board member of the Irish Fellowship Club, the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, the Convention and Tourism Bureau, as well as the Irish American Alliance. As a result of his deep respect for law enforcement and the fact that there has been a Gainer serving continuously on the Chicago Police Department for over 100 years, Bill is an active member and strong supporter of the Hundred Club of Cook County.  Bill is the first to admit that behind all these wonderful accomplishments is his great wife Gerry, a registered nurse and his six children, Bill, Bridget, Nora, Maureen, Mary, and Shelia and four grandchildren. Since they met at Duffy's Tavern in 1964, Bill and Gerry have not only been a great team, but also a lot of fun and a wonderful example of marriage and family. I congratulate him and his family and wish them the very best.                          ____________________
