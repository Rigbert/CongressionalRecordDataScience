Speaker, it is with great respect and deep sadness that I wish to commend United States Army Specialist Ricardo Cerros, Jr. for his bravery and willingness to fight for his country. Specialist Cerros was assigned to B Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. While serving in Afghanistan on his first deployment, Specialist Cerros was killed by enemy forces during a firefight while conducting combat operation on October 8, 2011. His sacrifice will forever be remembered by those he fought to protect.  A native of Gary, Indiana, Ricardo spent his early childhood years in Gary, Indiana, before moving to Salinas, California, to live with his father. He graduated from Everett Alvarez High School in Salinas and continued his studies at the University of California in Irvine. He enlisted in the United States Army in July 2010. Family members recall that Ricardo had a strong feeling to join the military, and that he wanted nothing more than to serve his country. Colleagues remember Specialist Cerros as a well-respected leader. Family and friends remember Ricardo for his cheerfulness, positive attitude, and happy-go-lucky manner. For his courage and sacrifice, Ricardo has been honored by the military with awards including: the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the Combat Infantryman Badge, and the Parachutist Badge. Ricardo will be greatly missed by so many people in the communities he was part of and forever cherished by those who loved him.  Specialist Cerros leaves behind a loving family. He is survived by his father, Ricardo Cerros, Sr., and stepmother, Deborah A. Cerros, both of Salinas, and his mother, Marguerite D. Cuevas, of Gary, Indiana. Ricardo also leaves to cherish his memory his siblings; Nicholas, Theresa, and Marco Cerros. He also leaves behind many other dear friends and family members, as well as saddened communities and a grateful nation.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Specialist Ricardo Cerros, Jr. Specialist Cerros sacrificed his life in service to his country, and his passing comes as a great loss to our nation, which has once again been shaken by the realities of war. Specialist Cerros will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his communities, and his country. Thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
