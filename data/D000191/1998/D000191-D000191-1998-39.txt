Chairman, does the gentleman think, and I realize he is on the authorizing committee and we have not authorized this, but does the gentleman think it is reasonable that two adjoining forests should require two different $25 trail head parking fees? I mean, that seems a little bit steep, and then the next forest over is requiring yet a third one. So one can cover an 80-mile stretch and have to pay $75 just to park at trail heads. I think there needs to be a little bit better coordination. Would the gentleman at least agree to that point? It is an actual case example from my home State.
