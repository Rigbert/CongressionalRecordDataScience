 President, remember, before Christmas the Senate voted to make sure that middle-class America didn't pay the alternative minimum tax, and we did it without an offset by a vote of 95 to something. So here we are again with an opportunity to say to middle-class America that we are not going to tax the people who were not supposed to be hit by the AMT, and we are going to do it without an offset.  This amendment gives us an opportunity to get over that hurdle that is in this budget resolution that, under pay-go, you would have to have an offset for the AMT. So even though the resolution sets aside money to deal with this year's patch, unless my amendment is adopted, there is no guarantee the patch will be done.
