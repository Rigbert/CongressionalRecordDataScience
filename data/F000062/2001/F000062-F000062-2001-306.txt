 President, today Senator Craig and I are introducing the ``Building Health Promotion and Disease Prevention into the National Agenda Resolution of 2001.''  This resolution expresses the sense of Congress that the federal government should do two things: (1) Support scientific research on health promotion and (2) explore ways in which the government can develop a national policy to integrate lifestyle improvement programs into our health care, schools, families and communities.  This resolution is supported by a coalition of 47 organizations, including the Wellness Council of America, the American Journal of Health Promotion, the American Preventive Medical Association, the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, the National Center for Health Education, Partnership for Prevention, and the Society for Prevention Research.  According to the American Journal of Health Promotion, health promotionis ``the science and art of helping people change their lifestyle to move toward a state of optimal health.'' Optimal health is defined as ``a balance of physical, emotional, social, spiritual and intellectual health.''  In this day and age of scientific breakthroughs and increased knowledge of medical science and health, American health care tends to emphasize curative treatments, rather than preventive measures and health promotion.  Several compelling statistics make the case for this resolution:  ``Fifty percent of premature deaths in the United States are related to modifiable lifestyle factors,'' according to the Journal of the American Medical Association.  People with good health habits survive longer, and they can postpone disability by five years and compress it into fewer years at the end of life, says the New England Journal of Medicine.  While the exact amount spent on preventive health is disputed, experts estimate that only two to five percent of the annual $1.5 trillion spent on national health care is on health promotion and disease prevention. In an April 1999 speech, Dr. David Satcher, the U.S. Surgeon General, stated that ``only one percent of that amount goes to population-based prevention.'' According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, the government spends $1,390 per person per year to treat disease and only $1.21 per person per year to prevent disease. This is simply not enough.  We must do a better job of supporting health promotion and disease prevention, as well as research to find cures for diseases and helping those who suffer from all illnesses. By doing so, we will see an increase in the number of Americans who are living longer and healthier lives and this could mean a decrease in overall national health costs. Simply put, it is much cheaper to prevent a disease than to treat it.  Diseases that are modifiable, if not checked, can become very expensive in treatment and cures. For instance:  The direct and indirect costs of smoking is $130 billion per year.  Diabetes costs $98 billion per year.  Physical inactivity costs $24 billion per year.  Cardiovascular diseases cost $327 billion per year.  Cancer costs $107 billion per year.  Here is another example. Obesity costs our nation $70 billion per year. In a recent report titled ``Promoting Health for Young People through Physical Activity and Sports,'' the CDC states that it is increasingly important that children from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade receive physical education every day, as well as after-school sports programs. According to Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, the director of the CDC, ``We are facing a serious public health program . . . we have an epidemic of obesity among youth, and we are seeing a troubling rise in cardiovascular risk factors, including type 2 diabetes among young people.''  With increased physical education, our children will be less likely to suffer from obesity, and in turn lower the risk type 2 diabetes.  Increased awareness about disease prevention and health promotion will never totally prevent illness, but it can reduce the cost of treating preventable diseases. It can save millions of dollars.  For instance, sun-block is proven to prevent some skin cancers. If every person who spent prolonged periods of time outside, protected themselves adequately from the sun's harmful rays, many incidents of skin cancer could be prevented. It is that easy.  Early detection helps to lower costs of diseases in the long run. If everyone had regular physicals and screenings, many diseases could be detected early and treated long before they advance to serious, incurable, and terminal stages.  Clearly, we must make health promotion a national priority.  The sad part is, our government invests very little to help educate people and promote healthier living.  As I stated earlier, it is estimated that out of the $1.5 trillion spent annually on health care, only two to five percent goes to health promotion and disease prevention. Government public health activities receive 3.2 percent of national health expenditures, according to the Health Care Financing Administration. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) spent $4.4 billion on prevention research in Fiscal Year 2000.  Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher believes that the government should pursue ``a balanced community health system, a system which balances health promotion, disease prevention, early detection and universal access to care.'' I couldn't agree more. While it is imperative that our nation's research in diseases and medicine continue, we must increase our attention to disease prevention.  Passing this concurrent resolution will make a strong statement that the health of all Americans is a national priority.  As the generation of baby boomers quickly approaches retirement, the education and promotion of health and the lengthening of life-spans becomes even more important.  Keeping people healthy should be our number one goal.  I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.                          ____________________
