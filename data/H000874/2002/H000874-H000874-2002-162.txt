Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3297.  The Public Safety Officers' Benefit program was created in 1976 to assist in the recruitment and retention of law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency medical technicians. But it is much more than a tool for attracting and keeping qualified public safety officers. It is a way of doing what is right by the men and women who selflessly risk their lives every day to protect each and every one of us.  The death benefit provides a one-time, lump sum payment of $259,038 payable to the surviving spouse, children or parents of a public safety officer killed in the line of duty.  H.R. 3297 makes a common sense, and compassionate, change, allowing for an individual named on a life insurance policy to receive the benefit if a deceased officer leaves no surviving child or spouse.  Policy officers, firefighters and EMT's put themselves in harm's way every day without stopping to consider the race, religion or family life of the people they are attempting to save. We owe it to them to do the same as we provide much-needed financial assistance to the loved ones they leave behind.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
