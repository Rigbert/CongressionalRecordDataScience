 President, the vice chairman of the committee opposes this amendment, as does the administration. We have only 4 days to authorize this intelligence tool before it expires. Sending this legislation to the President without amendment is the only sure way to do it.  The Director of National Intelligence is engaged in an ongoing process to declassify significant FISA Court opinions where it is possible to do so. I have agreed to work with Senator Merkley to get summaries of FISA Court decisions that can be made public.  In sum, the intelligence community strives to be as transparent as possible with the public, but legislation that would force its hand and potentially risk the exposure of classified information is both unnecessary and unwise.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
