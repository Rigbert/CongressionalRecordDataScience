President, I come to the floor today to praise an extraordinary man, Paul Peck. I had the honor of meeting Mr. Peck through our mutual interest in the Smithsonian Institution.  Mr. Peck has been an effective proponent of the civic process. In 2002, Mr. Peck generously donated $2 million to enhance the National Portrait Gallery's presidential programs, allowing for educational resources related to the presidency. In the same year, the Portrait Gallery founded The Paul Peck Presidential Awards, the only awards in the United States to honor achievement in presidential service and portrayal. Last year, at the Third Annual Paul Peck Presidential Awards Ceremony, Mr. Peck gave a heartfelt and thought-provoking speech about the need for an increased awareness of American history and an increased level of civil participation in our country. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Peck's remarks be printed in the Congressional Record.  The Smithsonian is truly fortunate to have benefited from the dedication and intelligence of Mr. Peck.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Summary of Paul Peck's Remarks, Third Annual Paul Peck Presidential                                  Awards       Hi folks.       It's great to be here with you to honor two great      Americans: George Elsey and Brian Lamb.       I have been asked many times why I joined with the National      Portrait Gallery to focus attention on the presidency.       My answer is: I believe that ``Freedom is life and freedom      is rooted in democracy.''       I believe that Americans are blessed,       And we owe it to our children and grandchildren to pass on      this love of freedom and the means to preserve it.       The founding fathers believed that freedom requires voters      who are knowledgeable, involved, and vigilant.       Today, however, Fewer people vote, Fewer people seem      concerned about civic issues, and Fewer people are involved      in the civic, governing, and political process.       Furthermore, we've cut back on teaching Civics and      according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress,      fewer than 25 percent of Americans have even a basic      knowledge of American History.       If we allow this trend to continue, what will it mean to be      an American; and what happens to democracy because democracy      can't survive as a spectator sport.       We can't continue this way. It's a roadmap to disaster and      I worry about the direction we're taking.       I believe every citizen has an obligation to make things      better and I believe every citizen can make a difference.       Here's how we're going to fix the problem.       The presidency symbolizes the United States and represents      government to most people. Americans are fascinated with the      presidency and we're going to build on this fixation to      foster civic action, civic understanding, and reasoned      voting.       Our civic action goal is to get everybody involved in      democracy whether through public service, governing,      politics, non- governmental organizations, or civic volunteer      activities. America was built on people coming together to      achieve great and honorable goals and we're going to re-     create this sense of community, caring, and co-operation.       As many of you know, I believe that our children are our      future. If they don't know what it means to be an American,      how do we preserve freedom, democracy, and the American way      of life?       In 1954, Brown vs. The Board of Education made America      better; and voting and the right to vote grabbed children's      attention and led to lifelong civic involvement. What are we      doing today to spark a similar interest in freedom and      democracy in our children?       As a first step in increasing civic action and      understanding, I intend to request that next Tuesday's      presidential election winner set aside one school day every      year to discuss American principles and encourage civic      engagement. It is my hope that government, industry, and      academia will encourage participation and provide time to      their employees to get involved and help us come together as      a nation.       Please help me make this proposal a reality.       In summary, you are our opinion makers. It's vital that      you: Strengthen our society, Promote civility, and Inspire      people to discuss issues and participate in the civic      process;       Thereby promoting Lincoln's ideal of ``government of the      people, by the people, and for the people.''       Thank you for coming.--Paul L. Peck, October 28, 2004                          ____________________[Page S5297]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                               PAUL PECK
