 President, Carol Brown's title is not czar, it is Assistant to the President. The President has chosen to appoint an assistant to assist him in evaluating, I assume, various issues pertaining to climate change. It is a complicated subject. She has experience. She has been in government. She has served as head of a department. But the actual policies come over the signature of the Administrator of the EPA.  What you are saying is, essentially, then, the President cannot have any special assistant for the purpose of coordination, asking questions, informing, helping produce--it does not make sense to me. I think on its face it is not clear.
