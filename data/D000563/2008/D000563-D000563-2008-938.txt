There is an individual who has been nominated by the President to be head of the Office of Legal Counsel, Steven Bradbury. He has been rejected four times by the Senate. The President said last week that he was the most important appointment. A month or two before, he told the majority leader he didn't want to talk about any other appointments until Mr. Bradbury was approved. Bradbury's tenure in the Office of Legal Counsel goes back to the period of time when this administration was rewriting torture policy in America--a policy which they at one point accepted and later rejected. Many of us have said if Mr. Bradbury is coming before us for consideration, we want to see those memos written--memos which James Comey, former Deputy Attorney General, said the United States would be ashamed if they ever became public.  I say to the Senator from North Dakota that not only do we have to do our part, but this administration has to do its part as well. Those who were engaged in this questionable--if not embarrassing, if not shameful--conduct involving torture policy must be held accountable to the administration. They are certainly not deserving of a promotion, which is what they are suggesting for Mr. Bradbury.  I ask the Senator from North Dakota, reflecting on what this administration has been through, the many times they have told us torture was not being used, that waterboarding was not being used, and now with this disclosure of at least three instances admitted under oath, I wonder if even this legislation--including the Feinstein amendment--would restrain this President in the future, in the next few months, as we face challenges that we cannot even imagine at this moment.
