President, earlier we agreed to alternate side to side for the offering of amendments. However, I would say to the Democratic floor manager that there do not appear to be any Democrats right now who are seeking recognition. Therefore, I would ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Arizona be permitted to proceed at this time, given the absence of a Democrat on the floor.
