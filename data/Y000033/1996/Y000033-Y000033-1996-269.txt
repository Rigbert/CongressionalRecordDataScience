Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I hope the people watching and listening to this back in their offices understand that the gentleman from California and myself and the gentleman from Utah have tried to work out a solution to a very serious problem. When we passed this act, the regulatory law had come into effect. It is the regulatory law and the courts by extremist groups that have misinterpreted the law. We are trying to right this law so no longer can that occur, and keep our species and also recognize the importance of man and his right to participate on private property.
