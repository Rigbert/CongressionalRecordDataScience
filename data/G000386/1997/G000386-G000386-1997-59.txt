 President, I would like to speak about the Department of Defense's illegal progress payment policy.  I have spoken on this policy a number of times since the beginning of the year. Well, I thought we had finally laid the issue to rest. But how wrong I was. On July 22, DOD made a commitment to bring that policy into compliance with the law.  The commitment was made by the nominee to be Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. John Hamre. At the time, he was the department's chief financial officer or CFO. He is now the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  Mr. Hamre made the commitment in front of the leaders of the Armed Services Committee: Senator Strom Thurmond, chairman of the Armed Services Committee; Senator Carl Levin, ranking minority member of the committee; and The committee's ranking Republican, my friend from Virginia, Senator Warner; and the Senator from Iowa was also present.  Mr. Hamre promised to put the new policy into effect on October 1, 1997. But October 1 has come and gone. As of this moment, the illegal policy is still in operation. For over 6 years now, the inspector general; the IG, has been telling DOD to fix the policy. And DOD has repeatedly promised to fix it. Unfortunately, Mr. President, these were empty promises. They are broken promises.  Mr. President, John Hamre gave me his word he would fix it this time. A man's word is like gold. You should be able to take it to the bank. He proposed to bring the policy into compliance with the law. And he did it in front of the leadership of the Armed Services Committee. I expect him to keep his word. And the IG is involved, as well. The IG made a commitment to verify compliance. And DOD is not in compliance. This is a bad situation. The basic agreement is outlined in the IG's letter of July 23. I placed a copy of that letter in the Record on July 24. It can be found on page S8110.  The July agreement started to unravel barely 1 month after being put together. It unraveled because of complaints from industry--mainly a group called the Council of Defense and Space Industry Associations--that is CODSIA.  The group sent a letter to DOD on August 27. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Council of Defense and Space                                        Industry Associations,                                  Washington, DC, August 27, 1997.     Hon. Alice C. Maroni,     Acting Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), Pentagon,          Washington, DC.     Mrs. Eleanor R. Spector,     Director of Defense Procurement,     Pentagon, Washington, DC.     Mr. Gary W. Amlin,     Acting Director, Defense Finance and Accounting Service,          Arlington, VA.       Dear Mrs. Maroni, Mrs. Spector, and Mr. Amlin: The      undersigned members of the Council of Defense and Space      Industry Associations (CODSIA) are very concerned with DoD's      decision to implement the requirement to distribute contract      financing payments starting October 1, 1997, without allowing      final action on DFARS Case 97-D011 and without determining      the impact of such a decision on DoD and industry. This      change will increase significantly the administrative      workload and cost for all parties involved in the payment      process.       The cost impact of this decision on industry is extremely      onerous. It will require major changes to accounting and      billing systems and to electronic commerce systems to meet      the new requirements. We estimate that the additional      staffing and administrative effort necessary to ensure      compliance with the required distribution in the billing      process will cost the industry about $1.3 billion in FY98.       The $1.3 billion estimate does not include (1) the impact      on any contracts not paid from DFAS Columbus, (2) actual cost      accumulation by ACRN or CLIN/SLIN, (3) any additional      subcontractor cost, (4) progress payments on basic ordering      agreements, (5) the cost of breaking down contracts below the      ACRN level, (6) new billing system audits, and (7) higher      prices resulting from delayed payments.       The October 1 implementation date does now allow time to      comply with the requirements of both the Regulatory      Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act. The      statement in the proposed rule that it pertains primarily to      internal Government accounting procedures ignores the impact      of the rule on industry. It is our opinion that a regulatory      flexibility analysis is required and that industry should      have an opportunity to participate in that analysis. As to      the paperwork burden, the proposed rule will result in      significant new information collection requirements in order      for contractors to be paid. The statement that the proposed      rule will not impose any information collection requirements      that OMB must approve is inaccurate.       Industry is not prepared to implement progress payments      distributions on October 1, 1997, and we believe that DFAS      will have great difficulty in doing so. Therefore, we urge      you to delay the implementation to allow time for a thorough      analysis of the impact of this decision.       Whatever decision is made on implementation, the new      requirement should not apply to existing contracts.      Furthermore, if this decision is implemented, the progress      payment rate should be increased to eighty-five (85) percent      to compensate for slower payments.       If the implementation date cannot be delayed, we urge the      following steps to reduce the administrative cost and      disruption of the progress payment process.       Do not make progress payment distributions retroactive. The      decision to implement progress payment distributions on      existing contracts with five or less progress payments as of      October 1, 1997, will result in claims for equitable      adjustment. This applies to contracts that have been awarded      as well as to prospective contracts that are currently in a      solicitation or negotiation phase.       Require DoD to simplify contracts to one ACRN by not using      multiple appropriations per contract and not assigning      multiple ACRNs per appropriation. This is the only way DoD      can comply with this requirement without creating a      significant problem for industry and DFAS.       Distribute progress payments by ACRN rather than CLIN/SLIN.       Continue the current DFAS procedure of reallocating payment      by ACRN when there are not enough funds in an ACRN to make      the payment.       Take steps as detailed in Enclosure I to reduce      administrative effort.       Further details of industry's concerns and an analysis of      the cost impact are contained in Enclosures I and II to this      letter.       DFAS has made significant progress in making timely      payments on both progress payment and delivery invoices. The      implementation of progress payment distributions would be a      major setback for DFAS, and a setback for acquisition reform      and payment efficiency. We would be pleased to discuss this      matter with you. For further information, please contact Dave      Koonce of the Lockheed Martin Corporation at (301) 897-6657.
