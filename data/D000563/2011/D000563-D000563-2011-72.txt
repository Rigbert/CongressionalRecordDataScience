We have a lot of important issues left. One of the most important is the payroll tax cut. Here is what it means. If you have a job in Illinois, an average job in Illinois that pays about $50,000 a year, currently you have a break on your payroll taxes that are collected of about 2 percent. So what that means for those families is that they have an additional $100 a month to spend.  For some Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, $100 a month might not make much of a difference, but for a lot of families struggling from paycheck to paycheck, $100 can make a big difference. When gasoline prices go through the roof, you can fill the gas tank in your car or pickup truck and make it to work. You might have a little extra money left for a utility bill when the natural gas prices and oil prices go up during the course of a cold winter. You might be able to afford some Christmas gifts for your kids, maybe even some clothes for them to go to school, a warm jacket for cold weather. So $125 dollars is important.  If we do not act, and act before we leave at Christmas, as of January 1 that payroll tax will go up 2 percent on working Americans, and they will have less money to spend. As they spend less money, our economy struggles. When they buy things, goods and services, it creates more economic activity in businesses small and large and creates profitability and jobs--job opportunities we desperately need with our high unemployment.  Now, we have taken a position with Senator Bob Casey's bill here when it comes to the payroll tax cut that it is not unreasonable to ask that the wealthiest people in America, the top 0.2 percent in America, pay a little bit more in taxes so that we do not add to our deficit with this payroll tax cut.
