 President, let me conclude by saying today's paper carries the news that the quixotic and unreliable and often inscrutable actions of the North Koreans have brought the Supreme Leader of North Korea to the position where he is now saying he will engage in multilateral talks again and resume those talks, and that he is ready to consider what has been rejected before.  That is the sense of the article.  I have no inherent faith that we can rely upon the President of North Korea. But it seems to me we have everything to gain and nothing to lose by continuing to pursue these talks. We give nothing, and at a minimum what we do is put ourselves in the position where the most isolated remaining country in the world at least is exposed to the notions of other major nations in the world, including China, Russia, South Korea, Japan, and the United States as to what we consider to be appropriate behavior. Hopefully, that will have a salutary impact on the willingness to negotiate an end to these programs.  The alternative of not pursuing that is bleak. Therefore, I encourage the President of the United States to continue down this path and to continue down the path more quickly than we have thus far.                                Exhibit 1           Six Party Talks and the North Korean Nuclear Issue                                                 October 14, 2003.     Hon. Richard Lugar,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden,     Ranking Member, Committee on Foreign Relations.       Dear Senators Lugar and Biden: In late August, Keith Luse      and Frank Jannuzi traveled to China and North Korea, and Mr.      Jannuzi traveled to South Korea, to examine the prospects for      a peaceful negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear      issue and to follow-up on an earlier set of visits to North      Korea in an effort to gain greater transparency on food aid      issues. Throughout the course of the visit, the staff      delegation received commendable support from U.S. Diplomatic      personnel. The delegation enjoyed high level access to      Chinese, North Korean, and South Korean government officials,      and also met with numerous academics, think tank specialists,      and employees of non-governmental organizations concerned      with developments on the Korean Peninsula. Our key findings,      including some recommendations for next steps on the Korean      Peninsula, are reported below.           Sincerely,     Keith Luse,       Professional Staff Member, Majority Staff, East Asian and      Pacific Affairs, Senate Foreign Relations Committee.     Frank Jannuzi,       Professional Staff Member, Minority Staff, East Asian and      Pacific Affairs, Senate Foreign Relations Committee.                                summary       Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) staff members      Keith Luse and Frank Jannuzi traveled to Northeast Asia      August 21-September 2 to examine the prospects for a peaceful      negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear issue and to      follow-up on their earlier set of visits to North Korea      designed to push for greater North Korean transparency and      accountability on food aid and humanitarian relief. The      delegation expresses its appreciation to U.S. diplomatic      personnel at Embassies Beijing and Seoul who helped set up      productive meetings and coped with the vagaries of arranging      travel to and from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea      (DPRK).       Over the course of three days in Pyongyang, the delegation      held a variety of meetings with officials representing the      DPRK, the United Nations, and non-governmental organizations      (see list of interlocutors, attached). The delegation told      senior DPRK officials that the United States views North      Korea's nuclear ambitions as a grave threat to international      peace and stability and urged the DPRK to seek a peaceful,      negotiated solution to the crisis through multilateral      dialogue. The delegation visited select humanitarian relief      operations, making     the point that such efforts are tangible proof that the      United States has no hostile intent toward North Korea. SFRC      staff strongly advised DPRK officials that they should permit      greater transparency for food aid deliveries under the      auspices of the World Food Program and various non-     governmental organizations. The delegation pressed DPRK      officials to adhere to international standards of human      rights, including respect for religious freedom, and      emphasized that the United States' concern for the human      rights situation in North Korea reflects the deeply held      convictions of the American people.                              key findings       Six party talks in Beijing helped improve coordination      among the five nations trying to reign in North Korea's      nuclear ambitions, but DPRK officials left the talks      unconvinced that the United States genuinely seeks a      peaceful, negotiated solution to the crisis. DPRK officials      told the staff delegation that they believe the true aim of      the United States is ``regime change,'' and that de-     nuclearization is just the first step toward that objective.       Under pressure from China, the DPRK probably will come to      another round of multilateral talks. However, China's      encouragement for DPRK's participation will be contingent on      the United States outlining specific steps it will take once      the DPRK pledges to dismantle/eliminate its nuclear program.      Talks could easily be derailed should North Korea decide to      launch a ballistic missile or even test a nuclear weapon.      Moreover, North Korea might scuttle the talks in response to      the appropriate and necessary U.S. efforts to enforce the      Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and the      Illicit Activities Initiative, both of which the North      interprets as attempts to ``strangle'' the regime.       Some North Korean officials believe that the United States      continues to station nuclear weapons in South Korea.       Decision-making in the DPRK is centralized and ultimate      authority rests with Kim Jong-il.       Top officials in North Korea are carefully monitoring      polling data reflecting opinion on domestic politics in the      United States, Japan and South Korea.       The World Food Program has taken some small, but      significant steps in recent months to enhance its operations      in the DPRK and reduce the likelihood of diversion of food      aid. The significant reduction in U.S. food aid to North      Korea (from a high of more than 300,000 tons/year to this      year's 40,000 tons) may have undercut United States leverage      in pressing for greater transparency on food aid. North      Korean officials are convinced the United States is using      food as a weapon.       Humanitarian operations run by non-governmental      organizations--such as the Nautilus Institute's Village Wind      Power Pilot Project and the Eugene Bell Foundation's      tuberculosis treatment programs--are making important      contributions to the welfare of the North Korean people and      help allay DPRK suspicions about the intentions of the United      States, thereby contributing to an overall political      environment conducive to resolution of sensitive security      issues.       After extensive discussion with the delegation, Vice      Minister Kim Gye Gwan advised the DPRK would allow NGO access      to some prison camps on a ``case by case'' basis.       There were two key differences to our earlier trips. While      we were not allowed to make purchases, street vendors were      present throughout Pyongyang and in Nampo, selling food and      other small items. Additionally, the DPRK military appeared      to be at a higher state of alert. More soldiers were armed      than during our previous visits.                               discussion     North Korea isolated . . .        Over the course of three days in North Korea, the staff      delegation found DPRK officials to be disappointed by the six      party Beijing talks, which they described as ``five against      one.'' In both formal meetings and informal settings, DPRK      officials described the Beijing talks as ``pointless'' and      cast doubt upon whether the North would be willing to engage      in future rounds of multiparty dialogue. DPRK officials were      critical of the fact that they had only 40 minutes of      ``direct'' dialogue with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State      James Kelly over the course of three days of talks in      Beijing, and said they had been misled into believing the      multilateral talks would provide a venue for substantive      one-one-one discussions with the U.S. envoy.       In one particularly blunt exchange, DPRK Vice Foreign      Minister Kim Gye Gwan told the staff delegation that the      Beijing talks had ``confirmed'' the North's assessment that      the United States has no intention of changing its ``hostile      policy.'' Kim said the DPRK, ``had no choice but to maintain      and reinforce its nuclear deterrent.''       The SFRC delegation conveyed their personal views that a      North Korean decision to enhance its nuclear weapons      capabilities would be viewed by the United States as a grave      threat to international peace and security and would be      interpreted by Americans as a hostile act. The delegation      urged the DPRK to proceed with multiparty dialogue and to      refrain from any provocative actions.       DPRK officials were non-committal with respect to any      future dialogue, but after the staff delegation's departure,      the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement claiming that      the North remains ``equally prepared for dialogue and for a      war.'' This statement represented a slight softening of the      stance articulated immediately after the Beijing talks, and      certainly leaves the door open to another round of multi-     party talks in Beijing or some other venue.       With strong encouragement from China (a senior delegation      from China visited the DPRK in late September), the DPRK may      agree to another round of six-party talks, if only to avoid      being held directly responsible for a breakdown of the      diplomatic process. It remains unclear what stance the DPRK      will take at any future talks, and at what level they will be      represented. Decision-making in the DPRK is highly      centralized, with Kim Jong-il wielding the ultimate      authority. Junior level DPRK officials such as Kim Yong-il,      who represented the DPRK in Beijing in August, often are      unable to engage in substantive dialogue, a fact which argues      for the United States to try to elevate the talks to engage      officials with real authority and the ear of Kin Jong-il.     . . . and wary of U.S. intentions       The difficult of communicating with the North Koreans was      evident throughout the staff delegation's visit to Pyongyang,      highlighting the risk that conflict could arise from      miscalculation or mis-communication. North Korean officials      with whom we met had an imperfect understanding of United      States security policy, especially the recently issued      National Security Strategy and Nuclear Force Posture Review.      They repeatedly expressed their belief that both documents      called for pre-emptive nuclear strikes against North Korea,      and said the North's own nuclear program was necessary to      counter this United States ``nuclear threat.''       Sometimes, confusion arose out of the imprecision of      different English terms. DPRK officials asked the staff      delegation to clarify the different meanings      ``simultaneous,'' ``synchronous,'' ``phased,'' and      ``reciprocal.'' Attention to such detail suggests the DPRK is      actively studying how the nuclear issue might be resolved      given what they characterized as the ``zero trust'' which      exists between the two parties.       DPRK officials took note of recent U.S. efforts to curtail      North Korean involvement in narcotics trafficking,      counterfeiting, and other illicit activities. DPRK officials      flatly denied North Korean involvement in such illicit      activities, and alleged that the United States had trumped up      the charges as part of a more general campaign to ``stifle''      the DPRK.     Food aid: slow progress on transparency and accountability       The staff delegation met with the Flood Damage      Rehabilitation Committee (FDRC) director Jong Yun-hyong, who      oversees agricultural reconstruction as well as foreign food      aid programs. The delegation explained to Yum that it as      essential for the DPRK to enhance transparency for food aid,      to open up counties currently off-limits, and to provide      random access to WFP monitors seeking to verify food aid      deliveries. The delegation told Yum that the level of      monitoring requested by WFP was consistent with international      norms, and that the DPRK could not expect donors and      potential donors to contribute food aid if they did not have      high confidence that the aid was reaching its intended      recipients.       Yun said that security issues are paramount for the DPRK,      and that the military would not permit international access      to certain sensitive regions of the country. He also said      that monitoring had greatly improved since food aid began to      flow during the North Korean famine of the mid-1990's. Yun      specifically cited the recent U.N. nutritional survey, and      reported that ``security officials'' had initially objected      to the survey, but that FDRC officials had prevailed in an      inter-agency battle in order to permit the survey to be      conducted. Yun argued that recent significant reductions in      WFP food aid--just 300,000 metric tons in 2002, down from      811,000 tons in 2001--had made it more difficult for him to      push for greater numbers of monitors and greater access for      international observers. Nonetheless, Yun promised progress      on monitoring in the future, and invited the international      community to shift its humanitarian aid strategy away from      food donations and toward ``sustainable development,''      including agricultural reforms, new seek varieties and      planting techniques, and ``food for work.''       The delegation met with World Food Program country director      Rick Corsino, who reported slow, but significant progress      toward enhanced monitoring of food aid and ensuring that aid      reaches those most in need. These are the highlights:       First, WFP has terminated food aid to 17 of 21 districts of      the capital city of Pyonghang after concluding that residents      of the capital are on average better fed than those of      outlying areas. This is an important step, both symbolically,      and substantively.       Second, with the full knowledge and support of DPRK      authorities, WFP is conducting Korean language training for      food aid personnel stationed inside the DPRK. The DPRK      continues to object to WFP bringing in Korean-speaking      experts from overseas, but the growing language facility of      WFP's foreign staff allows for smoother interaction with DPRK      officials and higher quality monitoring in the field.       Third, WFP has increased the number of monthly inspection      visits and now has approximately 50 international staff in      residence in Pyongyang and at five sub-offices located in      Sinuiju, Wonson, Hamhung, Chongjin, and Hyesan. WFP is the      only     international agency working in the country with      international staff permanently placed outside the capital.       Fourth, WFP has sustained its access to 162 of 206 total      counties in North Korea. WFP does not deliver food aid to      those counties that remain off limits, most of which are      concentrated along the sparsely populated mountainous      ``spine'' of the country and along the DMZ (see attached      map).       Finally, through its inspection visits, WFP is gradually      building a detailed database of schools, hospitals,      orphanages, and other institutions receiving WFP assistance.      Although the DPRK still has not provided a comprehensive list      of aid recipients--a list long requested by WFP officials--     the WFP is essentially building its own list with each      inspection visit.     NGO's making contribution to welfare of average North Koreans       Although WFP is the largest humanitarian organization      working in North Korea, they are not the only international      organization operating in North Korea. The staff delegation      made a point of visiting two humanitarian operations      supported by U.S. non-governmental organizations; the Village      Wind Power Pilot Project run by the Nautilus Institute (with      significant financial support provided by the W. Alton Jones      Foundation) and a tuberculosis treatment hospital and mobile      van sponsored by the Eugene Bell Foundation. These      initiatives have fostered good will on a ``people-to-people''      basis, and have measurably improved the quality of life for      the North Korean beneficiaries.     Wind power       The US-DPRK Village Wind Power Pilot Project was the first      attempt by a United States NGO to work side-by-side with      North Koreans in cooperative development. Previously, non-     governmental organizations had been limited by both      Washington and Pyongyang to delivering food aid to North      Korea. The project installed seven technologically advanced      wind turbine towers in a rural village on the west coast of      North Korea near the port of Nampo. This region is known as a      bread basket for North Korea, rich in arable land and other      natural resources, including steady breezes off of the Korea      Bay. The turbines provide clean, renewable energy to the      village's medical clinic, kindergarten, and 67 households.      In addition, a wind-powered water pump irrigates the      village's fields, and has significantly boosted yields,      according to villagers. The combined generating capacity      of the turbines is 11.5kW.       Since the wind power project was completed in 1999, it has      had its share of ups and downs. At present, the delegation      found that the facility was not operating at full capacity      due to maintenance problems with two inverters and damaged      batteries. North Korea lacks adequately trained technicians      to service the equipment, and the nuclear stand-off has      disrupted visits by foreign experts needed to assess the      maintenance requirements and make needed repairs.       Despite these difficulties, the DPRK participants in the      project remain enthusiastic about it as a model for rural      electrification, and hope to press ahead with a major      windpower survey project along the west coast in coming      months. DPRK authorities told the visiting Senate staff      delegation that deciding to proceed with the wind power      survey requires approval from military officials worried      about the collection of militarily sensitive meteorological      information. Notwithstanding the sensitive nature of the data      to be collected, DPRK officials believe the project will move      ahead. Wind power projects could alleviate severe shortages      of power in rural areas, and have the advantage of not      requiring major upgrades in North Korea's electric power      grid--a grid that experts have found to be in need of major      overhaul before it could accommodate the introduction of      large new power plants such as the light water nuclear      reactors contemplated under the Agreed Framework.     Tuberculosis treatment       Since 1995, the Eugene Bell Foundation has been working      inside North Korea to fight deadly diseases like tuberculosis      (TP). Eugene Bell foundation currently coordinates the      delivery of TB medication, diagnostic equipment, and supplies      to 1/3 of the North Korean population and approximately 50      North Korean treatment facilities (hospitals and care      centers). The staff delegation visited one such hospital in      Pyongyang, and also inspected one of the 17 mobile x-ray      vehicles designed to navigate the North's antiquated road      network.       The delegation found the Eugene Bell project to be      characterized by high standards of transparency and      efficiency. The foundation conducts regular site visits (more      than 60 since 1995) and is able to donate goods directly to      recipients rather than through third parties or government      intermediaries. Staff at the hospital we visited appeared      well trained and highly motivated. They were deeply      appreciative of the support they receive from the United      States and recognized that this humanitarian outreach occurs      even at a time when the two nations do not maintain normal      diplomatic relations. The Eugene Bell foundation supports 16      TB hospitals and 64 TB care centers in the DPRK. More than      200,000 patients have been treated. Moreover, serving as a      conduit, the Eugene Bell foundation is currently responsible      for sending tuberculosis medicine, medical aid, and equipment      for approximately 1/3 of the North Korean population.     Joint recovery operations       The staff delegation met with Sr. Col. Kwak Chol-hui of the      Korean People's Army, the director of the Joint Recovery      Operation searching for the remains of U.S. servicemen left      behind after the Korean War. The United States estimates that      as many as 8,000 remains of U.S. servicemen are on DPRK soil.      So far, only 378 of these remains have been recovered. More      than 200 remains were found as the result of unilateral DPRK      searches and returned to the United States. Just over 170      sets of remains have been recovered through the joint      recovery operation.       The recovery operations are laborious. Historical records      can indicate likely search areas, but only eye witnesses can      pinpoint the possible locations for remains. As the      population ages and the terrain of North Korea is shaped by      construction, erosion, flooding, and other forces, it is      becoming increasingly difficult to locate remains. Even after      likely sites are identified, time-consuming excavations and      careful forensic work are necessary to find and identify      remains. U.S. and North Korean military personnel work side      by side in the field during the recovery operations.      According to U.S. participants in the operation, this      interaction in the field has been constructive, deepening our      understanding of the Korean People's Army.       Colonel Kwak told the delegation that the DPRK would like      to expand the joint recovery operation, employing as many as      2,700 investigators to scour the country to conduct      interviews with those elderly North Korean who might have      knowledge of the location of U.S. remains. He indicated that      the DPRK's commitment to the recovery operations is      independent of the nuclear issue, and, in his opinion, should      remain so. It is unclear, however, what role the DPRK      envisions for U.S. forces in such an expanded operation. The      staff delegation believes that any expansion should be made      contingent on greater U.S. access to those North Korean      citizens claiming to have first-hand knowledge of the      whereabouts of remains.                           staff conclusions       So as to reduce what we believe is a significant risk of      conflict arising out of miscalculation or mis-communication,      the United States should greatly expand dialogue with North      Korea, both within the framework of multi-party talks, as      well as through informal or ``Track II'' bilateral      negotiations.       The United States should appoint a senior official to      represent the United States solely on issues related to the      Korean Peninsula. Alternatively, the Administration should      endow the current negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State      James Kelly, with greater authority to direct and coordinate      the President's North Korea policy and gain access to more      senior North Korean officials.       The United States should acknowledge recent improvements in      WFP operations and continue food aid to the DPRK under UN      auspices. The United States should also consider funneling a      portion of future U.S. food aid through non-governmental      organizations, some of which have been able to achieve      strong monitoring capability for their humanitarian      relief.       The U.S. should search for ways to expand outreach efforts      by NGOs in the fields of rural energy development,      agriculture, and public health.       The Joint Recovery Operation to identify the remains of      U.S. servicemen from the Korean War affords the United States      valuable contact inside North Korea. Any expansion of the      operation, however, should be made contingent upon greater      U.S. access to those North Korean citizens claiming to have      first-hand knowledge of the whereabouts of remains.                         list of interlocutors     In Beijing, China     Michael Green, Director Asian Affairs, National Security          Council     David Straub, Korea Desk, U.S. Department of State     Wang Yi, Vice Foreign Minister, Chinese Ministry of Foreign          Affairs     Fu Ying, Director General, Asian Department, Chinese Ministry          of Foreign Affairs     He Yafei, Director General, North American Department,          Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs     Liu Jinsong, First Secretary, Asian Department, Chinese          Ministry of Foreign Affairs     Piao Jianyi, Executive Director, Center for Korean Peninsula          Issues, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences     Gu Guoliang, Director, Center for Arms Control and          Nonproliferation Studies, Deputy Director, Institute of          American Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences     Wang Jisi, Director, Institute of International Strategic          Studies, Central Party School     Wu Baiyi, Deputy Director, Research Division, China Institute          of Contemporary International Relations     Yang Mingjie, Director, Division of Arms Control and Security          Studies, China Institute of Contemporary International          Relations     Wei Zonglei, Deputy Director, Center of U.S.-European          Studies, China Institute of Contemporary International          Relations     Shi Yinhong, Director, Center for American Studies, People's          University     Ruan Zongze, Vice President, China Institute of International          Studies     Liu Xuecheng, Director of American Studies, China Institute          of International Studies     Shen Dingli, Deputy Director, Center for American Studies,          Fudan University     Zhu Feng, Director of International Security Program, Beijing          University     In North Korea     Kim Gye Gwan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs     Jong Dong-hok, First Secretary, United States Department,          Ministry of Foreign Affairs     Lee Yong Chol and Kim Yong Nam, United States Department,          Ministry of Foreign Affairs     Jong Yun-hyong, Director Flood Damage, Reconstruction          Committee     Sr. Col.
