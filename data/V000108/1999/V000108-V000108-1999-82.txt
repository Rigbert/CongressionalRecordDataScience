Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  The issue are the people we are sworn to represent. We cannot move them somewhere else on the globe. They are in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania and Arkansas. That is the President's responsibility, that is our responsibility. He has not met it. We today, in a broad-based bipartisan fashion, want to make him recognize his obligation so that when Keven Tasey's daughter or son is born, the gentleman mentioned by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior), her or his father will have their job back.  I ask all of my colleagues to please support this legislation, the bipartisan Steel Recovery Act.
