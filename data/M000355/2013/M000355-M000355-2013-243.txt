  Founded on March 13, 1888, the Somerset Police Department has admirably served the city and surrounding area and to this day represents the best of our State's citizens. One example of their thorough care for and involvement in the community is their annual charity basketball game. Typically, the officers challenge a local high-school team to an exhibition match--this year they took on the local fire department, with the proceeds from the event going to support a local girl who suffers from Type I diabetes. Their reputation for ``coming to the rescue'' was displayed in a different way than their daily work, but displayed nonetheless, and their efforts certainly are appreciated by those in need who benefit from the support raised by their charity.  I rise not only to celebrate those who serve, but also those we have lost in service. We are grateful for dedicated officers of the Somerset Police Department who risk their very lives to protect and bring order to their city.  At this time, I would like to applaud the Somerset Police Department on the 125th anniversary of its founding, and I request that an article recognizing this occasion from a Pulaski County, KY, newspaper be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be appear in the Record as follows:       [From the Commonwealth Journal, March 16, 2013]  125 Years of Service: Somerset Police Department founded March 13,                 1888--Staff Report, Commonwealth Journal       Somerset.--The Somerset Police Department recently      celebrated 125 years of service in the community.       The history of SPD dates all the way back to March 13,      1888, when Mayor A. Wolf appointed John B. Ingram as the      first chief of police for the newly formed City of Somerset.       The police department would grow along with the city's      population and physical boundaries over the next 125 years.       Still, some have lost their lives in the line of duty.       ``As the department gets a year older, it is important to      remember those officers who lost their lives serving the      citizens of our city,'' stated Lt. Shannon Smith, with SPD.       Somerset Chief of Police Silas West was shot and killed in      1928 while attempting to arrest a drunk person on the square.      Patrolman Walter McKinley Massingale was shot and killed on      Halloween night in 1929 while investigating a bootlegger on      South Maple Street. And in 1957, Police Chief Harold Catron      was shot on his porch on Jasper Street, and he would later      die from those wounds in 1964.       ``Our 125th anniversary is a milestone to our department,''      said SPD Acting Police Chief Major Doug Nelson. ``Through      hard work, rigorous training, and an established level of      professionalism, the men and women of the Somerset Police      Department will continue to serve our community to make it a      safe place to live and work.''                          ____________________
