 I thank him for his kind remarks and his backing of that bill--a very overwhelmingly bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be the first major change in criminal justice legislation since the Clinton era of the early 1990s.                         Tribute to Jill Kozeny  Madam President, throughout my 38 years in the U.S. Senate, I have come to the floor tens of thousands of times. I have come to vote, to give speeches, to manage bills, and to debate issues that impact Iowans and the American people. As all of us do, I also vote from the Senate floor. Since 1981, I have cast 12,800 votes on behalf of Iowans. I take pride that I haven't missed a single vote since 1993. In fact, I hold the longest consecutive voting streak in Senate history. Since my reelection to a seventh term, I am now the longest serving U.S. Senator from Iowa.  It is the privilege of my life to represent my home State. I wake up every day being grateful to work another day for my fellow Iowans. I am also grateful for the service, dedication, and loyalty of my Senate staff, who work every day to help me to serve Iowans. The work of my staff is what brings me to the Senate floor today. I am here to pay tribute to an extraordinary staffer who is also an extraordinary individual.  Jill Kozeny has served on my staff for the last 30 years. To put that in perspective, she has worked on behalf of Iowans and the American people for more than half of her life and has done that right here in the Senate. Jill is a patriot and a public servant and has a servant's heart through and through.  They say all good things come to an end, and at the end of the 115th Congress, Jill Kozeny, my chief of staff, will close this incredible chapter in her life.  After graduating from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, the Omaha native worked for Nebraska Senator David Karnes. Then she applied to be my assistant press secretary. I offered her the job. At first, she turned it down. She said she had decided she wanted to attend law school. Yet 24 hours later, she called back. She had changed her mind and wanted to come to work for me. She never looked back. Nebraska's loss was Iowa's gain.  Jill first joined my Senate staff in 1989. She arrived to Hart 135 under the name of Jill Hegstrom. After having worked for 30 years for the people of Iowa, I would say Jill more than qualifies as an honorary Iowan. In fact, she was married in Des Moines to Tom Kozeny, her husband. As many of my colleagues know, for the last 38 years, I have held a meeting in each of Iowa's 99 counties--at least 1 every year--and for the last 30 of those years, Jill has staffed hundreds of those county meetings and Q and A's along the way. This is where the rubber meets the road--in sitting down and talking to Iowans and in meeting Iowans in their hometown communities to hear their concerns and doing it face-to-face.  Day after day, Jill Kozeny has worked her tail off to make sure that our office and my staff have addressed the concerns of Iowans. Whatever uncertainty Jill had before joining my staff has evaporated completely through these years. Her confidence and her competence have grown as she has risen through the ranks. As press secretary and director of communications, she worked for years in leading my communications staff. She developed respect, trust, and credibility with reporters, and that is hard to do in this town. A request for information from even a weekly newspaper in Iowa was treated as importantly as one from a national correspondent or a television news anchor.  Jill has been a loyal and trusted adviser to me and a trusted leader and mentor to my entire staff. In 2013, when the job opened up, I didn't hesitate to hire her to lead my office as chief of staff. Jill's tenure as a trusted and loyal adviser truly understates the depth of her contribution and service over these many years. At every turn, she has gone the extra mile--above and beyond the call of duty--to make sure my office has operated effectively and efficiently for Iowans. With Jill at thehelm, I have never once had to worry if the office has been working the way ``Grassley works.'' Those two words, ``Grassley works,'' are famous in Iowa because they have been my campaign slogan since 1978.  Jill has set a tone of professionalism, courtesy, fairness, and integrity. As chief of staff for 15 staffers in Iowa and 25 here in Washington, Jill has set a tone of camaraderie, collegiality, respect, and confidence. Just ask members of my current staff or even people who had left my staff, maybe, 10 years ago about Jill Kozeny or ask her work colleagues in the press corps. They describe Jill's reputation and work ethic as dependable, substantive, thorough, and exemplary. Reporters say she is fair, patient, professional, and has ``set no better standard.''  She has known how to build policy coalitions and how to navigate high-stakes political dramas that require a thick skin and a shrewd intelligence. It is a pressure cooker here in Washington, DC, on any day, and Jill has never rattled. Throughout her service, Jill's leadership has been instrumental in advancing the important legislative achievements and oversight work, including the historic tax cuts and the judicial confirmations achieved just this Congress. She has served as a pivotal political adviser to me in my last four political campaigns as well.  Without a shadow of a doubt, I will miss having her by my side. I have total confidence in her ability and complete trust in her advice. As Jill has shared with staff through the years, I quote her: ``I grew up in the Grassley `cut-your-teeth school of work ethic,' where anonymity and hard work are the most effective way to serve and be effective.''  For over 30 years, she has mentored scores of employees, from interns to entry-level staffers, to the most senior investigators and attorneys in my office. Both current and former staff have counted on her counsel and leadership. They say she has offered uncommon grace, goodness, and guidance. Jill has brought joy to the job, and it has shown in her work product and our workplace. She has been a highly skilled communicator, well organized, very articulate, and gracious. There is no other way to say it. For 30 years, Jill has brought 100-percent devotion to this job and 100-percent devotion to the people of Iowa, and I would have to say, without equivocation, that she has made me a better Senator.  As a chief of staff in the U.S. Senate, Jill has reached the highest rungs of the congressional staff ladder on Capitol Hill. She has made her mark in these marbled hallways and has done so with an unassuming anonymity, with competence, and with a confidence that has been hard earned but has been very well deserved.  My staff has become like family to one another. After so many years of working together at all hours of the day--you might say 365 days a year for the last 30 years--the professional relationship that I have grown to value tremendously has evolved into a warm friendship that Barbara, my wife, and I have valued even more. Capitol Hill staffers know that this workplace and its work pace are all-consuming. Yet life marches on. It is a true joy to share in the joys of life that my staff share with one another and with Barbara and me.  Without a doubt, Jill takes pride in her work. After a long day's work, Jill goes home to her most cherished pride and joy. Jill and Tom, her husband, are proud parents to three beautiful children. Mary is a sophomore in high school, and their twin boys, Andrew and Teddy, are in the seventh grade. As Jill once said, ``a full nest is best.''  Barbara and I have had opportunities to attend a couple of the boys' baseball games. They are very good athletes. They bring this same determined mindset to the game as their mom does to her job. As one of the boys approached the batter's box, he purposely tapped his bat to the underside of his cleats. Clear-eyed and laser-focused, it was obvious the steely, competitive spirit was inherited from Mom.  The sense of family and friendship was manifested, more than ever, on that famous day we refer to as 9/11. Shortly after 11 a.m. that morning, Barbara and I, along with dozens of staff members from the office, took refuge in Jill's home near Capitol Hill. It is a day we will never forget for so many reasons, one of which is how Jill opened up her home because everybody needed a place to go because you couldn't go anyplace else.  When terrorism struck the Nation's Capital, Jill Kozeny showed grace under fire. As usual, she set the tone: Keep calm and carry on.  Earlier this year, Jill woke up very early to catch an international flight to China. She and another staffer were joining me on a congressional trade trip. As she prepared to leave for the airport, she smelled smoke. It turned out that the neighbor's house next door was on fire, but it affected her home as well. After putting out fires for 30 years in the Grassley office, Jill, also known as, as we call her in our office, not CEO, but COE--chief of everything--she jumped into the crisis mode and got her family safely outside. But she also had that flight to catch, so she left the substantial mess--tremendous smoke damage and inconvenience--in the capable hands of her husband.  I would like to express my gratitude to Jill's family because they also participate in this thing we call public service, which is a noble calling. It often requires unsung sacrifice from family members, as happened on that day last April.  Although Jill wasn't on my staff when I was elected to the House of Representatives, she knows I admired my predecessor. He represented Iowa's Third District--Congressman H.R. Gross--for 26 years. His approach to constituent service was legendary. He once advised me in the first days of my membership in the House of Representatives that if a little old lady called and wanted her toenails trimmed, well, clip her toenails. Throughout my public service, I have used that as a benchmark.  I have worked to uphold the highest standard of constituent service in representative government, and it takes a person's staff--people like Jill--to help get that job done. Throughout her service to me and to the people of Iowa, Jill Kozeny has fulfilled and exceeded this expectation that Congressman H.R. Gross set for me, including my priority to respond to every Iowan who writes or calls into my office. Some days, constituent correspondence may seem like the movie ``Groundhog Day,'' but it is the way ``Grassley Works.'' And Jill has ingrained and managed this philosophy with my staff throughout her years of service.  In closing, I have a message for my chief of staff. Honestly, I am sad to see her go. At the same time, I am happy for her. Considering all that she has done and sacrificed for the people of Iowa and, more importantly, for me, I wish her the very best.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your loyalty and service. Barbara and I extend our warmest wishes to you and your family. It is hard to think about the passing of the baton. You have had a remarkable run in the Senate. May God bless you as you blaze a new trail. I have no doubt it will be extraordinary.  Being extraordinary runs in Jill's veins.  I yield the floor.
