 President, we all despise those who desecrate the flag. The issue before the Senate today is how we should deal with that problem.  In the late 1980s, the Congress passed a statute designed to prohibit this vile practice. It was struck down by the Supreme Court on First Amendment grounds. For the last several years we have had proposals in the Senate to amend the Bill of Rights in order to prohibit flag desecration despite the First Amendment. However, I think we should be very reluctant about amending the Bill of Rights.  Therefore, I have offered the amendment which we will be voting on shortly. It takes a new a statutory approach that I am confident would be upheld by the Supreme Court. Simply put, my alternative approach protects the flag by prohibiting three kinds of desecration. First, desecration of the flag that incites violence or breach the peace. Second, desecration of a flag belonging to the United States government. Third, desecration of a flag stolen from someone else and destroyed on government land. Anyone who engages in any of this kind of reprehensible behavior would be subject to fines of up to $250,000 and/or imprisoned for up to 2 years. I think this is a better approach than tinkering with the Bill of Rights for the first time in 200 years.
