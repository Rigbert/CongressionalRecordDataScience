Speaker, today I rise in remembrance and to honor our dear friend and former colleague, Congressman Charlie Wilson of Ohio.  On Sunday, we learned that Congressman Charlie Wilson passed away from complications from an operation following a serious stroke he endured in February, living each moment thereafter with great courage. Today, the Ohio delegation honors his life and his achievements for the State of Ohio, his Sixth District that he represented with such dignity, and his impact on our Nation.  Surely, his work on jobs, health care, veterans benefits were truly a benefit to not just his district, but to the Nation. He was such a relentless advocate.  Charlie Wilson embodied the ethic of public service. His political demeanor, his civility, his gracious manner characterized his exemplary service. Throughout his 16 years in public service, 12 in the Ohio House and 4 here in the United States House of Representatives, he served as a true advocate for his constituents in the hard-scrabble economy of eastern and southeastern Ohio.  He embodied the aspirations of our middle class. He dedicated his life to public service with unwavering energy, selfless dedication, and a kindness that should be emulated by all Members. I never heard him raise his voice in anger.  How proud he was of his family, his son, Jason, who succeeded him in the Ohio Legislature, all of his children, his family. And may Angela and his family be comforted during these difficult times.  Congressman Wilson had an uncanny ability to make people laugh and make everyone around him feel at ease. He genuinely cared about improving the lives, not only of his constituents, but of all people around him.  His last political race in 2012 showed the measure of the man, as millions and millions of dollars poured in from out of State against him, and he kept going, no matter what.  Our delegation's thoughts and prayers are with Charlie, with his entire family, his four children, his nine grandchildren and, of course, his beloved Angela.  We are all saddened by his death but encouraged by his legacy, his achievements, and the memories that he leaves with all of us.  I know that each Member of the Ohio delegation shares in my desire to honor Congressman Charlie Wilson's memory.                          ____________________
