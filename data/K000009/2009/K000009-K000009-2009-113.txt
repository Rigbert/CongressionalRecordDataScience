I rise to recognize The Arms Forces, a nonprofit organization recently created in our region of Northwest Ohio. The Arms Forces develops and maintains a network of volunteers who provide assistance to service men and women who have returned from combat with a traumatic brain injury or PTSD. Life Navigation Coaches are trained to help veterans define, access, and navigate existing supportive services and benefits. Through the group's ``Inspirational Listening Tour,'' wounded warriors are met in their home communities and share their challenges. Volunteers of The Arms Forces are personally attuned to the suffering of TBI and PTSD and understand the impact of these injuries on our veterans. Through the volunteers' efforts, the enable wounded warriors to reach their highest potential and improve the quality of their lives.  The Arms Forces members are passionate and committed in their service. I am proud to share their story.                          ____________________
