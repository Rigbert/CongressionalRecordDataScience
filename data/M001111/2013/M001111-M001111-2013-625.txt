 President, we do have some serious differences of opinions between the two parties when it comes to our values and our priorities. We believe our budget should reflect this, and we are having a good debate. Those differences will be difficult enough to bridge, and we should be able to at least agree on what the facts are.  I wish to take a moment tonight to correct an inaccuracy I have heard a lot in the last few days, including on the floor tonight. We are hearing some Republicans say that the Senate budget includes a $1.5 trillion tax hike. This simply is not true. Here are the facts.  Of the $975 billion in new revenue, which comes from those who can afford it the most, $480 billion is matched with responsible spending cuts to fully replace the sequestration, $100 billion goes toward targeted high-priority infrastructure repair and job training to help restore the recovery, put Americans back to work, and the rest goes to help reduce the deficit.  Unfortunately, rather than seriously considering the credible path we have presented in our budget plan, some Republicans have decided to play games with the numbers, and they are not telling the truth. Instead of subtracting the sequestration replacement portion and the investment package from the $975 billion in total revenue, they are trying to say you should somehow add them all together. They are taking one side of the ledger, combining it with the other side of the ledger, and coming to some conclusion that makes absolutely no sense to us. It would be like handing over $2 to buy a cup of coffee and having someone say: Well, the price was actually $2 plus the value of that coffee. It doesn't make any sense.  You don't have to take my word for it. Fact checkers and reporters have called this claim false and a step too far. The Washington Post Fact Checker even gave it two Pinocchios.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a story from the Washington Post on this inaccurate claim.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Mitch McConnell's Claim That the Democrats Plan a $1.5 Trillion Tax                                   Hike                           (By Glenn Kessler)       ``Their budget will do more to harm the economy than to      help it, and it will let Medicare and Social Security drift      closer to bankruptcy. And then there's the Democrats' $1.5      trillion tax hike. Trillion with a T. Let me just repeat      that: Any senator who votes for that budget is voting for a      $1.5 trillion tax hike, the largest in the history of our      country.''       --Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, speech on the      Senate floor, March 14, 2013       Shortly after McConnell (R-Ky.) made these comments,      Democrats cried foul. The budget plan, they said, has $975      billion in higher taxes, not $1.5 trillion. They point to the      summary tables of the budget resolution unveiled by Sen.      Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who chairs the Budget Committee. Sure      enough, there's a line showing $975 billion in new revenue.       But nothing's ever easy with the budget process in      Washington. In fact, it's a morass, with many things open to      interpretation, as we discovered as we went back and forth      between the Democrats and Republicans--and then consulted      with various budget experts.       Let's take a tour through the numbers.                               The Facts       There are two key parts to this discussion--the actual text      of the legislation and what in effect is a glossy marketing      document (``Restoring the Promise of American Opportunity'').      The legislation does not have many numbers, whereas the      marketing document does.       In the marketing document, Murray describes how she will      use $480 billion of the tax revenues to reverse part of the      automatic spending cuts in the sequester, and another $100      billion for new spending on infrastructure.       The text of the legislation, meanwhile, establishes a bunch      of ``deficit neutral reserve funds,'' including one labeled      as ``to replace sequestration'' and the other ``to promote      employment and job growth.'' But there are no numbers      attached to those funds. Meanwhile, the legislation also      includes instructions (known as ``reconciliation'') to the      Finance Committee to boost revenues by $975 billion.       Deficit neutral means you need a mix of taxes and spending      cuts to fulfill your goals.     Republicans assumed that since Murray in her marketing      document had said she would boost revenues by $480 billion to      pay for the sequester and $100 billion to spend on      infrastructure, the language meant that those funds would      come from additional taxes. (Depending how you read the      document, the $975 billion in new revenues is also slated for      ``deficit reduction,'' and the same money in theory can't be      used twice.)       Thus $975 billion plus $580 billion equals more than $1.5      trillion.       Democrats say this is ridiculous. They argue that they will      apply the $975 billion in new tax revenue to the goals      outlined in the document, including applying $480 billion to      replace the sequestration cuts. (Another $480 billion to      alter the sequester would come from spending cuts.) They cast      the reserve funds more as a device to avoid legislative      points of order, which would require a 60-vote threshold to      overcome, rather than just the 50 votes generally required      for a budget resolution.       The whole discussion reminded The Fact Checker of the      budget headaches frequently experienced when he covered the      budget process many years ago. Fierce battles are often waged      over highly arcane matters.       We consulted with a variety of budget experts, and things      became even more murky. The consensus was that Republicans      have a point--that this was a theoretical possibility--but it      was not likely.       G. William Hoagland, senior vice president of the      Bipartisan Policy Center and long-time budget sage for Senate      Republicans, said the GOP scenario was possible but      ``unlikely,'' as the Democrats have ``a clear intention to      raise $975 billion in revenues.'' He said that such reserve      funds are more to send messages to fellow party members--in      other words, to garner votes--as opposed to being substantive      items. ``It's grease to make the wheels go around,'' he said.       In sum, he said, he viewed the legislation's reserve-fund      language as ``a clumsy way to avoid directly addressing      offsetting the sequester.''       Jason Delisle, another former GOP staff member on the      Budget Committee now at the New America Foundation, said that      ``Republicans are right to say that the wiggle room means the      official number is not the official number--that it could be      higher if the reserve funds are used. Fair point.''       But Delisle added: ``The Republican argument rests on the      assumption that the Democrats bring up a tax-and-spend bill      in addition to a reconciliation bill for each and every      reserve fund in the budget resolution; thus there are more      tax increases in the budget resolution than what they say. I      think the Republicans are overstating the likelihood of that      scenario.''       Ed Lorenzen, who was a budget policy adviser for House      Democrats and is now at the Committee for a Responsible      Federal Budget, agreed with Delisle and added that he viewed      the reserve funds as ``primarily for procedural accounting      purposes to adjust internal budget allocations for points of      order.'' He said that ``the reserve fund doesn't require an      additional $100 billion in revenues to pay for the $100      billion in stimulus spending; rather it allows the budget      committee chairman to adjust the allocations to accommodate      $100 billion for stimulus spending in the resolution if the      revenues already assumed in the resolution to offset it have      been adopted.''       Keith Hennessey, another former GOP budget expert who now      teaches at Stanford University, took a darker view.       Democrats, he said, ``want to say the budget [plan]      includes $100 billion in new spending for jobs and      infrastructure by pointing to the assumption in the non-     legislative document, but then say that nothing in the      legislative text of the budget resolution requires $100      billion in extra taxes.'' He was especially suspicious of the      fact that reserve funds do not have limits--as is sometimes      the case in budget resolutions--and said it was perfectly      acceptable to argue that the budget ``also allows for another      $580 billion in tax increases to offset additional spending      increases she [Murray] assumes and promotes aggressively.''       He added: ``If anything I'd argue that even the $1.5      trillion number understates the tax increases allowed by the      Murray budget resolution. She's requiring $975 billion in tax      increases to reduce future deficits, and allowing for      unlimited amounts more to pay for new spending. I find that      terrifying.''                           The Pinocchio Test       Clearly, we're in a bit of an expert muddle here, with even      Republican-leaning budget wonks lacking a consensus. But      let's step back a moment and look at the big picture.       Democrats have repeatedly said they plan to seek $975      billion in additional revenue and would task the Finance      Committee to come up with the precise closing of loopholes      and such. There may be something vague and suspicious about      the reserve funds, but under the GOP scenario, Democrats      would also have to vote for even more taxes--which isn't very      likely.       Budget resolutions, after all, are basically like a      blueprint for a house, with the details filled in later. Both      sides try to score political points with the votes that are      cast on such documents, but in sum, many of these votes are      relatively meaningless.       McConnell could have raised serious questions about what      Democrats intended to do with these reserve funds and how      they intended to fund them. But instead he has taken a      theoretical possibility and turned it into a hard fact: ``Any      senator who votes for that budget is voting for a $1.5      trillion tax hike, the largest in the history of our      country.''       That's going a step too far.
