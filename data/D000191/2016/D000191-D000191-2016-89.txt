This is being pushed by the Farm Bureau.  There is joint jurisdiction between the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Agriculture. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, despite this bill being on the floor five times, has held zero--zero; count them, zero--hearings on this issue. We wouldn't want to hear from experts.  There was a joint hearing with the Committee on Agriculture. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to have a witness. Only the pro-reform, so-called repeal pesticide-herbicide, witnesses were allowed to testify. There has been no deliberation on this issue. There is a great mythology around it.  It is a very sad day to use a potential national health crisis to put through a lame bill that has gone through five times, which isn't going to pass the Senate. If it did, it will be vetoed.
