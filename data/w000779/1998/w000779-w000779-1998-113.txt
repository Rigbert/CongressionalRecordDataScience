President, in response to the majority leader's request for unanimous consent to proceed to the conference report on ISTEA without having all of the conference report papers in hand, I must withhold my consent until I have had the opportunity to review the sections of the report relating to important funding and project matters for Oregon. It is not my intent to delay final action on this major piece of legislation; however, I want to be assured that commitments that have been made are reflected in fact in the conference documents.
