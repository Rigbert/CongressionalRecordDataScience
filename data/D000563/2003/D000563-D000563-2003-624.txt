President, Chicago can handle itself, whether we are playing Iowa in sports or in politics, but I ask my friend from Iowa, if you believe the deficits don't count, stand tall, stand proud, and admit that to the American people. Just go ahead and tell them once a year whether you have added to the national debt by the actions in Congress. It is that simple. It is a report card on what we do. I am sure the Senator from Iowa is in favor and doesn't want to leave any taxpayer behind.
