 I would just observe that the Senate bill that I was referring to doesn't raise taxes on anybody. In fact, what it does is ensures that no taxes will be raised on 98 percent of Americans. It doesn't refer to the other 2 percent, as I understand the bill. It simply precludes taxes from being increased pursuant to the Republican-passed bills which sunsetted the tax rates that currently exist for those 98 percent of the people. From that standpoint, I think the bill that I have been referring to, Madam Speaker, and I think the majority leader probably knows this, does not refer to those over $250,000, which is what I presume he's referring to.  I might also observe, as it relates to his response, Madam Speaker, a quote of Bill Kristol's, who I think the majority leader probably knows pretty well and who obviously is a very strong proponent of policies put forward by the majority leader's party, said:  ``It won't kill the country if we raise taxes a little bit on millionaires,'' he said on Fox News Sunday. ``It really won't, I don't think. I don't really understand why Republicans don't take Obama's offer.''  Now, we know the President of the United States, I want to tell my friend, the majority leader, has said he is not going to sign a bill. He disagrees with your conclusion, I disagree with your conclusion, and that's what democracy is about.                              {time}  1200  The President of the United States has been reelected. The President of the United States has made it very clear he will not sign a bill that reduces the tax obligations of those over $250,000 in the coming year. He's not going to sign that bill so that we can hold hostage the 98 percent. He believes, like you, that 98 percent of Americans ought not to receive a tax increase because it would, from his perspective, dampen economic growth in this country.  Now, we have disagreement on the $250,000 and above, which is a legitimate disagreement. We can debate it on the floor, we can vote on it on the floor, and every American can see where everybody stands. We believe that 60 percent of Americans or more agree with the President and with our proposition. But to say that we're not going to do something for the 98 percent because we don't want something to happen to the 2 percent--which, by the way, is not in that bill. But the gentleman's correct, nor are they included in that bill, the 2 percent.  But I would urge my friend, we're having trouble getting to an agreement. I think that's unfortunate. I think the gentleman, the majority leader, and I both want to get to an agreement. We don't want to go over that fiscal cliff; that will be bad for the economy. We both, I think, believe--I hope--that we need to have a balanced agreement so that we will not go over that cliff. That would be bad for the country, bad for the American people, bad for the growth of our economy. We don't want to do that. The gentleman, in my view, does not want to do that.  One way we can give some confidence, which is very important to the growth of the economy, is to assure, as Tom Cole, your former chairman of the Republican Campaign Committee, said just the other day in, I believe, your whip meeting, that he believes that this ought to be done; we ought to give those 98 percent assurances.  So I tell my friend that we can debate the other part of it, we can vote on the other part of it and the prevailing side will obviously win, but I don't think there's disagreement on the 98 percent. I think we agree on that. As I said before the election and I say after the election, we ought to move forward on that because that is something on which I think you and I can agree, on which Republicans and Democrats in this House can agree, something which the Senate has already agreed to. And while there was not a bipartisan vote on passage, there was a bipartisan vote to let that bill come to the floor. It's the only way it moved ahead, on a bipartisan vote. I would hope that we can at least do that so that we can give at least that on which we agree the opportunity to move forward.  I yield to my friend.
