 President, I just wanted to come to the floor for a few minutes today and talk about the budget that is before us now. It reflects a lot of work. It reflects the priorities of families across this country. Importantly, it returns fiscal responsibility to Washington, DC. It invests in critical needs of all Americans.  I am very proud to be able to say I support it. It is tough and it is strong, which is exactly what we need to be doing today in the United States.  First and foremost, I do want to thank our chairman, Senator Conrad, on his work on this most difficult task. I have served with him through this process time and time again. I am always amazed and impressed by his thoughtfulness, his attention to detail, and, of course, his amazing charts. He always works well, along with his partner from the House, Congressman Spratt, to help us establish priorities of which all Americans can be proud.  Writing a budget of this size and scope is not easy, but Senator Conrad has again proven this year he is up to the task. I am proud to call him a colleague and a friend.  Mr. President, Senator Conrad and all of us as Democrats want a budget that reflects the priorities of American families. We do that in this budget by investing here at home--in our schools, in our infrastructure, and in our communities. We still provide every dollar the President asks for defense spending over the next 5 years.  At the same time, Americans want us to return to fiscal responsibility in Washington, DC. Every family knows the importance of balancing their own checkbooks and paying their own bills.
