President, I had the honor of introducing my distinguished colleague from the Land of Lincoln, Donald Rumsfeld, to the Armed Services Committee for his confirmation hearing just a little over a week ago.  I know that Presidents have often complained about the Senate confirmation process. Herbert Hoover, upon the birth of his granddaughter, said ``Thank God she doesn't have to be confirmed by the Senate.'' Donald Rumsfeld has so much experience, I am sure he will secure even more votes for his confirmation today than President Hoover's granddaughter would have if she had required the Senate's blessing.  Don Rumsfeld's resume is impressive: 4-term Congressman from Illinois, Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, US Ambassador to NATO, White House Chief of Staff, the youngest-ever Secretary of Defense, CEO of several major companies, and a Special Envoy for President Reagan.  We've heard a lot about bipartisanship lately. When Donald Rumsfeld represented Illinois in the House of Representatives, it was before Supreme Court cases that applied the one-person one-vote standard to the drawing of congressional districts. His district was enormous; he represented 1.1 million people, whereas Sam Rayburn only represented 89,000. In the Congress that followed his departure to serve in the Nixon administration, his district was split into two, with one district represented by a conservative Republican and one by a liberal Democrat. His ability to serve such a diverse district speaks well of his ability to bridge a Congress and a country almost equally divided.  While all Senators may not agree with Mr. Rumsfeld on every issue, he has earned our respect. I may disagree with him on the deployment of a national missile defense system, depending on the plan he supports. I certainly disagree with him about the importance of continuing to adhere to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. I believe the treaty remains the cornerstone of strategic stability, where he dismisses it as ``ancient history.'' However, I am certain that he will conduct a thorough and fair review of these issues as Secretary of Defense. It is my hope that we can keep the lines of communication open on these and other important defense issues as we address them in the Senate.  In fact, Senators may be reluctant to ``go to the mat'' with Mr. Rumsfeld. Not only was he captain of Princeton University's wrestling team and All Navy Wrestling Champion, he was also inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum. He joins Speaker Hastert as another famous wrestler who hails from Illinois. I, for one, plan to keep in mind that wrestling depends on strategy and making the right move at the right time as much as it does on strength and power.  Some of his critics have complained that Mr. Rumsfeld's experience with defense issues is from the bygone cold war era. Those critics ignore Mr. Rumsfeld's valuable contributions chairing several commissions, including the Ballistic Missile Threat Commission, and underestimate the value of his experience managing major corporations in this new economy. Mr. Rumsfeld has kept up and I would challenge his critics to try to keep up with him.  In 1775, in our revolutionary era, Patrick Henry said: ``I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know no way of judging of the future but by the past.''  It is only because the United States was so steadfast in fighting for freedom and democracy that the world enjoys an unprecedented era of freedom and prosperity today.  Mr. President, Mr. Rumsfeld carries the lamp of experience. I wish him, for our country's sake, every success as he travels by its light. It is with pride that I cast my vote to support the nomination of one of Illinois' favorite and most distinguished sons.                      NOMINATION OF RODERICK PAIGE
