 President, I want to commend Subcommittee Chairman Cochran for his work on the Agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. This bill provides funding for all the activities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, except for the U.S. Forest Service. It also funds the activities of the Food and Drug Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Farm Credit System.  This has been one of the most difficult years to date and I congratulate Senator Cochran and his staff in working through the difficult decisions in crafting this bill.                         Privilege of the Floor
