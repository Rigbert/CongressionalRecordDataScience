President, I was unavoidably absent for vote No. 98, a motion to instruct the Sergeant At Arms to request the attendance of absent Senators. Had I been present, I would have voted in favor of the motion. It is important for the Senate to respect bipartisan agreements and work towards completion of its legislative business.                          ____________________
