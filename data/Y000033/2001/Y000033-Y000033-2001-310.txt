Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against all of section 323 beginning on page 50, line 22, and ending on page 51, line 15.  This language authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to reserve up to $18 million of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, RABA, for four States, Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas, for the purpose of hiring State motor carrier safety inspectors at the U.S.-Mexican border. This explicitly waives existing law in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
