Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), my friend, the majority leader.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business.  On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.  On Friday, no votes are expected in the House.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow.  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 427, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015, sponsored by Representative Todd Young.  Last year Federal regulations burdened job creators with trillions of dollars in costs. This bill, commonly referred to as the REINS Act, will ensure that Congress has a say in whethermajor rules should be imposed on the American people.  The House will also consider H.R. 1994, the VA Accountability Act, sponsored by Chairman Jeff Miller.  Getting the best possible service to our Nation's veterans starts with having the best possible personnel in charge VA programs.  This critical bill will give the administration additional tools to turn things around at the VA and ensure veterans have the kind of care they deserve.  I thank the gentleman.
