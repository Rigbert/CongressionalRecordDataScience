Chairman, again, I rise in opposition to this amendment. We have made significant cuts in our national defense and continue to do so. We are at lowest levels as a percentage of GDP expenditures for our national security in a long time.  I would rise in opposition to this amendment, would urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
