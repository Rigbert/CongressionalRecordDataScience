President, today, I join the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, in introducing an amended version of S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2006, the FAIR Act. This legislation enhances our previous trust fund bill by adopting many of the amendments filed in February by Senators on both sides of the aisle. We have incorporated amendments that further protect against fraud and make sure the sickest victims are paid as soon as possible. We added crucial provisions that make the trust fund accessible to victims who were exposed to asbestos during the attacks on the World Trade Center and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We clarified the bill language to ensure that inactive dormant claims cannot be revived to overwhelm the trust fund.  This legislation also contains a few additional changes that we believe respond directly to concerns raised by our colleagues during floor debate. The floor amendments incorporated in this bill include, among others, the Kyl funding amendment that will protect small and medium sized businesses. We also addressed the concerns of businesses that currently pay nothing or very little because they are well-insured. None of these changes undermine the existing guarantee on overall private funding at $140 billion.  Also importantly, we preserved the ability of the existing bankruptcy trusts to continue paying impaired victims while the trust fund becomes operational. This will smooth the transition for victims who were exposed by companies that are currently protected from suit by bankruptcy. And finally, we clarified the statute of limitations for our Nation's war veterans so they will have better access to the trust fund.  None of the additional provisions contained in this substitute diminish the bill's key principle: That the asbestos trust fund will be comprised solely of private money. Nothing in this bill will reduce the protection of victims against insurance subrogation. I am proud to report that we have also maintained our core medical criteria so that those who have been impaired by asbestos exposure will receive compensation appropriate to their injuries.  Earlier this week, we were all saddened to learn of the passing of Judge Edward R. Becker. As many of my colleagues are keenly aware, Judge Becker worked patiently with Senators and all of the stakeholders on this legislation for almost 3 years. We engaged in an exhaustive process of committee hearings, deliberations and negotiations. Judge Becker was crucial to each step in the process. We would not have made the bipartisan progress that this legislation reflects without his tireless efforts.  Unfortunately, time is running out for this session of Congress. I know that some partisans will claim that we should refrain from reaching across the aisle during an election year but this persistent problem compels us to move forward to try and help the thousands of victims of asbestos exposure. I urge the Senate majority leader to give us sufficient floor time to debate and vote on this important legislation on its merits.                                 ______                                       By
