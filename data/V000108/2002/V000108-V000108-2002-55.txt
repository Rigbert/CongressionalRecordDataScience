Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to congratulate Saint Patrick Roman Catholic Church in East Chicago, Indiana, as it celebrates its 100th anniversary as a congregation, on March 17, 2002, the Feast Day of St. Patrick. The anniversary celebration will begin with an afternoon Mass celebrated by Bishop Dale J. Melczek. Following the Mass, the parishioners will enjoy an evening filled with entertainment and dancing as they observe this milestone in the church's history.  Nestled among the smokestacks of the steel mills in the Indiana Harbor, St. Patrick Church has risen from its humble beginnings to serve as a cornerstone of the East Chicago community. Founded in 1902, the parish of St. Patrick was the first Roman Catholic Church established in the Indiana Harbor. Under the guidance of Father Thomas Mungoven, eight families met for Sunday Mass in Klein Hall on Michigan Avenue. With the strength of their faith to bolster their spirits, this small congregation constructed a church of their own. On January 25, 1903, the parish of St. Patrick celebrated its first Mass in its new home. By 1909, the parish grew to include 87 families from mostly Irish and Slavic backgrounds.  Over the years, as other ethnic groups were drawn to the area by the opportunities offered in the steel mills, the composition of East Chicago grew more diverse. Irish and Slavic families now welcomed Hispanic and African-American Catholics into the congregation. In 1986, in an effort to involve new parishioners in Sunday services, Father John Ambre instituted Masses in Spanish.  As the parish mission statement attests, the members ``strive to be a welcoming community celebrating our cultural diversity; foster harmony and reconciliation among parishioners and the community . . . .'' Embracing the Christian ideals of loving thy brothers and sisters and honoring they neighbors, the parishioners have opened the doors of St. Patrick to those in need of a spiritual home. When other ethnic parishes in East Chicago closed, St. Patrick welcomed these Catholics with open arms. In 1987, when St. Francis of Assisi Parish closed, St. Patrick installed the cornerstone of this church in its vestibule walls, a symbolic gesture affirming the acceptance of these new members into the church community. Again, when Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish closed in 1998, rather than allowing the church to fade from the memories of its former parishioners, St. Patrick added the altar to its own sanctuary. St. Patrick represents more than a building where worshippers meet once a week for a service; it truly embodies the tenets of the faith it espouses.  Since 1997, the current pastor, Father Fernando de Cristobal, has used his position as a spiritual leader to promote various cultural activities in order to better educate the entire congregation. For the Feast of Our Lady of Guadelupe, a holy day revered in Mexico, the celebration includes Las Mananitas, or morning songs, offered to the Virgin Mary and mariachi music, followed by a midnight Mass. On June 24th, the parish honors Saint John the Baptist, the patron saint of Puerto Rico, with a bilingual mass and a banquet. Keeping with this spirit of diversity, the centennial celebration will feature Irish dancers and bagpipes in an effort to pay tribute to the parish's Irish heritage.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me today in commending the parish family of St. Patrick Church, under the guidance of Father Fernando de Cristobal, as they prepare to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of their founding. All past and present parishioners and pastors should be proud of the numerous contributions they have made out of the love and the devotion they have displayed for their church.                          ____________________
