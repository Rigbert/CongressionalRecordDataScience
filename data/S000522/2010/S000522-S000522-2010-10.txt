Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  First of all, I want to thank our distinguished Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, for her very eloquent defense of the human rights defenders in China, especially for Liu Xiaobo. I also wish to thank her for these many decades, in which we have worked side by side, along with Frank Wolf and others, and I thank her for that and for scheduling this resolution to come to the floor today.  I yield 2 minutes to my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).
