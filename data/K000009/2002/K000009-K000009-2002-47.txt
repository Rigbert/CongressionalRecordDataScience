Speaker, I rise to discuss this administration's and this Republican leadership's warped and dangerous legislative priorities. Let us start with Social Security, which is dead last on their priority list. This House leadership has simply refused to bring up Social Security. Not only are they refusing to debate. They are completely dodging the issue.  The situation is so bad that this week, Democrats were forced to launch a discharge petition wherein we have to get 218 signatures in order to try to bring a bill to the floor to provide the American public with the debate on Social Security that our people deserve. All the while, the Republicans are on a course to raid and are raiding the Social Security trust fund to the tune of $1.8 trillion.  This debt clock tells the story of this week. Every week since they have started to do this, because we were in surplus a year and a half ago, finally, after years of budget regimen during the Clinton years and this Congress, we were able to bring revenues and expenditures into balance, even though we have an accumulated debt we are paying off. Nonetheless, they have begun to try to raid the Social Security trust fund to pay for ongoing expenses; and every week while they are doing this, I am going to come down here and let the American people know how much they borrowed this week.  So as of today, they have now taken $218,095,890,410, which amounts to, for each citizen in our country, they dipped into your pocket $775. You could say it is akin to a tax imposed on each senior and their family in this country.  Now, what do Republicans propose to do about it? Nothing. In fact, if they had their way, they would sneak through a debt ceiling increase and go on about the business of pushing their number one priority, one which lies at the very heart of the Republican Party, and that is cashing out the revenues of the people of the United States to the wealthiest people and corporations in this country, even those that locate their headquarters offshore, as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), the Republican leader, endorsed yesterday.                              {time}  1545  Members know the companies I am talking about, the energy giants like Enron Corporation, which is going to take 350 million more dollars of our seniors' money for tax breaks that are given to them, and the pharmaceutical companies that lined up for the big dinner that the Republicans held last night over here at the convention center, where they raised over $30 million for this fall's election.  Let us look at veterans. That is another low priority on the Republican list. This administration has proposed a 250 percent increase on copay for pharmaceuticals that our veterans must buy when they go into the veterans' clinics or veterans' hospitals.  If one is a heart patient or somebody that needs 10 prescriptions a month, figure out, if one is charged an additional $7 per prescription, that is over $70 to $100 additional per month. That is a tax on our veterans.  Republicans who profess to be the party of tax cuts would impose newtaxes on our veterans in the form of higher pharmaceutical costs, while pushing for more tax breaks for the superwealthy and our Nation's most profitable corporations.  What about a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, an issue they are finally getting around to after ramming through over $2 trillion in tax breaks over the next 10 years for their campaign sugar daddies? Their plan would put Medicare on the road to privatization, and leaves a $3,600 gaping hole in coverage between the initial benefit limits that people would qualify for and the kick-in of a stop-loss protection at $4,500 in out-of-pocket spending.  Their plan is so defective it is no surprise that even some leading Republican experts are skeptical that it would work. Is it any surprise that the pharmaceutical industry, whose inflated prices are the root cause of the problem, has endorsed the bill and actually is hugging it, as I watched them walk across the streets of Washington?  Republicans are fond of the phrase ``Leave no child behind,'' even though the education bill they sent to this floor through the budget is $2 billion under last year's spending. Then how are we going to leave no child behind?  But what about America's seniors? How many of them are going to be left behind? Every day how many of our veterans are being left behind? That is what Republican policies do, they will leave the American people behind the eight ball for generations to come.  America needs to put Social Security first. Our mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers who built this great country and put their lives on the line for it, they should not have to worry. We ought to take care of the problem here. We owe it to them.  We need to repair the broken lock on the Social Security lockbox that was not supposed to be invaded, but it has been invaded seven times now. We need to provide prescription drug coverage for our seniors. We need to create good jobs for our people here at home, and not give tax breaks for them to invest offshore. We need to start creating wealth and good-paying jobs in this country again.  We need the Republican Party to get its priorities straight for a change.                          ____________________
