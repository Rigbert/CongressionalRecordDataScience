 President, I rise today to pay tribute to John Frazer, a resident of Frankfort, KY, who is being recognized as a man who has contributed more than two decades of his life to the lobbying and leadership of Kentucky's coalition of private colleges.  At 66 years of age, this man retired in July after serving 21 years as the president of what is now referred to as the Association of Independent Kentucky Colleges and Universities. Mr. Frazer served as lobbyist and leader of the coalition which comprises 20 Kentucky schools, including Alice Lloyd, Bellarmine, Centre, Thomas More, Transylvania, and Union. Together, these colleges represent about 20,000 students, which is about 12 percent of Kentucky's college students and about 20 percent of its annual graduates.  Mr. President, this man's dedication to the liberal arts education and the institution of the private college is admirable. Mr. Frazer used funds from the Kentucky General Assembly to provide a private school education to students who were unable to afford otherwise. In addition, he coordinated libraries and created a central information system for the 20 colleges. A future problem solver, he started a joint insurance program that saves the colleges more than $300,000 each year.  In an age where educational reform has become one of the leading concerns among Kentuckians, Mr. Frazer's dedication to ensuring the tradition of excellence of the liberal arts education and the accessibility of such an education lives on. This lobbyist, leader, and good friend is being recognized today not only for this earnest dedication, but for the admirable way he represented these colleges.  Gary Cox, executive director of the Kentucky Council on Higher Education, recently described Mr. Frazer's honorable character this way in a recent Louisville Courier-Journal article: ``He's a gentleman, a fella above reproach. That has added to his credibility, and to the stature of the schools he represents.''  It is my honor to pay tribute today to this representative of Kentucky--this fine example for the future educators of our Nation.                          ____________________
