President, I see the junior Senator from Connecticut in the Chamber. If he wishes to speak, it is my understanding this is Democratic time now. If he wishes to go before me, that is perfectly all right. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of his remarks I be recognized in morning business because I do want to talk about the transportation bill that is coming up.
