Mr. Speaker, it is a shame and a disgrace that we did not extend unemployment insurance. Every single Member who voted ``no'' yesterday should be ashamed of themselves.  People are suffering. They are hurting. They are in pain. They cannot make ends meet. And too many, just too many on the other side of the aisle turned a deaf ear.  I ask my Republican colleagues: Can't you hear? Can't you feel? Can't you see? Where is your heart? Where is your compassion? Where is your concern?  Extend unemployment benefits, and extend it now.                          ____________________
