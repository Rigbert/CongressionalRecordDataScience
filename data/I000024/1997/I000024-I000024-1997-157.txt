 Let me just say that if it is the intent of anyone to vote for this in hopes it would achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002, and then coming back and starting into deficits again, of course you want to oppose it.  This is your last opportunity to say that we want to reach that balanced budget by 2002, and then keep it in balance thereafter.
