President, I can clarify this. I had sent my amendment to the desk, which we don't plan to take up, but I wanted it filed because we have a number of cosponsors who, I am sure, will want to join me in cosponsoring the Inouye amendment, since it is the same amendment.                           Amendment No. 1133
