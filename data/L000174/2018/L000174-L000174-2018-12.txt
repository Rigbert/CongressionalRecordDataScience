President, on November 6, millions of Americans, including thousands of Vermonters, headed to the polls to cast their votes in these midterm elections. Back home, Vermonters reelected our governor, Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, to another term in office. They also returned Democratic majorities to the State house and senate.  I was moved by the remarks delivered by Governor Scott on election night. Of the elections, he said, ``Vermonters are saying they want us to work for them, not against each other. They are saying we need to listen to one another and prove to the rest of the nation that in Vermont we can and will rise above partisan politics.''  I have spoken in Vermont about Governor Scott's speech. I believe his remarks show how we work together in Vermont and how we should work together in Washington. I am proud of the challenge put forth by Governor Scott. I know that, in Vermont, it is a challenge we can meet.  The book will soon close on the 115th Congress, one in which one party controlled majorities in both the House and Senate and the White House. The book will open on the 116th Congress, where I hope we can move forward with the bipartisan spirit that Governor Scott challenged us all to adopt in his remarks on election night. As it has throughout our Nation's history, Vermont is leading by example. It is an example I implore every Senator to follow. Let's focus on what unites us, rather than promote greater division between us.  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Vermont Governor Phil Scott be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Vermont Governor Phil Scott's Election Night Speech--Tuesday, November                                 6, 2018       Thank you all very much for being here tonight.       First, I want to thank my family--especially my wife Diana      and my daughters Erica and Rachael, my mom and many other      family members for their love and support. I wouldn't be      standing here today without you.       Throughout my life--whether it be in business, racing or      politics--I've been able to bring people together who have      the right attitude and chemistry.       I'd like to first thank my team. Both my campaign team who      worked long days that became longer nights; as well I want to      thank my cabinet and my staff who stuck with me through thick      and thin. I'm blessed with an incredibly talented team, so      loyal and bright, who have spent the last two years working      to make the vision we share for Vermont a reality.       Now I know we've taken tonight off, but I look forward to      continuing our work, with all of you, first thing tomorrow      morning.       Tonight, 180 Vermonters were elected to serve as our      Legislature for the next two years.       I want to personally congratulate each of them--some here      this evening. I look forward to working with you in the      coming months. And ``work'' being the key word because      there's so much to do.       There are few higher honors than being elected by your      neighbors, for them to have enough faith and trust in you to      represent them and their interests and be the person they are      counting on to work on the issues that are most important to      them and your community.       And there's no greater responsibility than working every      day to understand and solve the problems facing our state.       For those newly elected, like I was 18 years ago, you may      still think everything is black or white, yes or no, but I      would warn you, there's a lot of gray in between.       Typically, there are no easy answers, no corners to cut--     only hard work ahead, to do all we can to create a stronger,      more vibrant future for all of us.       In electing a Governor of one party and a legislature led      by another the message Vermonters have sent us tonight is      clear: work together.       Vermonters are saying they want us to work for them, not      against each other.       They are saying we need to listen to one another and prove      to the rest of the nation that in Vermont we can and will      rise above partisan politics.       We must come together for the future of our state in order      to strengthen our economy, make Vermont affordable and      protect the vulnerable in all 251 communities in Vermont.       Whether you're from Brighton or Brandon, Alburgh or      Albany--we all want the same thing.       We want the kids in every community to get a great      education, learn a trade, pursue the career of their dreams,      buy a home, start a family and retire right here in the state      we love.       This is the challenge we face together. And tonight, I      humbly accept that challenge once again.       I'd also like to thank my opponent, Christine Hallquist,      for stepping up and running an energized and historic      campaign.       While we may not have agreed on many issues, we did agree      from the start that this race would be about the things we      felt mattered most to the people of Vermont.       While across the nation other races in other states turned      negative and uncivil, in Vermont, we rose above it.       The news out of Vermont this election was clear: we can      disagree, we can debate--and we can do it with passion--but      in this state, we can do it respectfully.       It wasn't perfect. And at times we were reminded that we're      not immune to the hate and bigotry that is all too present      around the country, but by and large, this campaign was      marked by the type of civility Vermonters, and Americans for      that matter, deserve in our public process.       There was probably no better example of that than Zac Mayo      and Lucy Rodgers of Cambridge, two candidates, ending a      debate last month by sitting together to perform a musical      duet.       For this, and for stepping up, and putting yourself out      there, I'd like to thank all candidates tonight.       From the top of the ticket all the way down, it's not easy      to put yourself out there--win or lose. So, I thank you for      your contribution to the conversation and commitment to      making Vermont a better place.       I'd also like to note that the issues that have been raised      in this campaign due to Christine's historic candidacy are      front and center.       I want you to know that as long as I'm Governor, I'll      continue to make sure our state lives up to our motto of      freedom and unity as well as our reputation of tolerance and      compassion by being the most welcoming in the nation, while      defending all Vermonters from hate and bigotry.       This will remain one of my administration's top      priorities--no exceptions.       Today, Vermonters spoke loud and clear.       So, tonight, I'll reaffirm my commitment to the three      principles on which my administration bases every decision we      make:       First, we're going to continue to make Vermont more      affordable.       I travel the state every day, I see the struggles our      neighbors face and I know that the high cost of living, doing      business, energy, healthcare, education and taxes are forcing      too many to look elsewhere for opportunity.       We should all find that unacceptable. So, as I've done for      the past 18 years, I'll spend the next two, working to      reverse that trend.       Second, if we're going to grow our economy, we must bring      more into the workforce and attract more people to our state.       We need more kids in our schools, more workers for our      businesses, more proud, first time homeowners right here in      Vermont.       We need a bigger labor force to support the public      investments we care about because if we don't--if we can't      grow our economy--then we're faced with two options: raise      taxes or make cuts to programs which could harm the most      vulnerable, neither of which is acceptable.       That's why I ask legislators, in fact, all elected      officials to work with me on a plan to grow our workforce to      increase our working age population because our future      literally depends on it.       Third, we're going to protect our neighbors. We'll continue      to address the opioid crisis, those suffering from mental      health issues and find ways to make sure all Vermonters have      access to affordable healthcare.       We'll take care of our elderly and our veterans--who have      given so much to us--our children, and those who need us      most, when they need us most because it's what we do in      Vermont.       And finally, if we're going to accomplish any of this, we      must continue to rise above partisanship and politics of hate      and division.       Our time to make a difference for those who have elected      us, is far too short. We can't allow ourselves to fall victim      to pettiness, political games and angry rhetoric.       Now more than ever, we must be better role models because      our children are watching, and they want to be just like us.       We must be better, kinder and more respectful to each other      and take the time to listen.       This is the challenge ahead. This is my vision for our      future.       It is the greatest honor of my life to have the trust of      Vermonters to carry out this work on their behalf.       Thank you again from the bottom of my heart and as I've      done throughout my entire life, I will do my very best not to      let you down.                          ____________________
