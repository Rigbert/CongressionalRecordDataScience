Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary service of Mother Pearlie Mae Brown, a woman of strong devotion and commitment to her community and our Nation. Pearlie Mae Brown is currently the First Lady of the Greater Bible Way Church in Prince Frederick, Maryland, where she is the most active and most cherished member of its congregation. Her talents have her serving as President of the Field Missionary Board, the New Members Club, as advisor to the all Women's Auxiliaries and President of the newly formed Evangelistic Board.  Her tireless energy and determination in bringing the word of God to all have also taken beyond the boundaries of her own community to the National level where she was the President of the Clergy Wives and Widows for 19 years and currently the President of the International Women's Council. She is also the First Lady of the Maryland-Washington Metropolitan Diocese, the Vice Chair of the Board of the Interdenominational Council of Ministers' Wives and Ministers' Widows of Washington, D.C. and Vicinity and is also involved in the numerous other comprehensive programs throughout the region.  While Pearlie Mae Brown takes part in all of these wonderful service organizations, she takes the most pride in being the First Lady of the Greater Bible Way Church in Prince Frederick and the proud wife of First Vice President Bishop Joseph N. Brown, D.D. Together they have four children and five grandchildren who are all an integral part of their life. It is through the strength of her family that she gains the true inspiration to carry on her mission to serve God and her community.  We recognize all of these many achievements on the eve of the 40th Annual Women's Convention being hosted by the Greater Bible Way Church under the direction of Pearlie Mae from November 10th through November 12th in Prince Frederick, Maryland. This convention, which is held in Prince Frederick every ten years, celebrates women's participation in religious affairs and explores the ``total man and women--body, spirit, and soul. This year's convention is expected to include around 800 participants from throughout the Nation in addition to people from Trinidad, England, Africa, and Jamaica.  Pearlie Mae's life has been punctuated with zeal and enthusiasm, commitment and servitude, honor and distinction. She is an example for all to follow and the people of communities far and wide have benefitted from her determination, tremendous dedication and hard work. As she embarks on the 40th annual Women's Convention may she have strength in accomplishing her mission and satisfaction in knowing she has touched the lives of thousands.                          ____________________
