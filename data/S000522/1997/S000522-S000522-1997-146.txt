Mr. Chairman, I just want to echo my statement earlier during general debate that I do think that Division A is a very responsible attempt to try to reform our State Department. As a matter of fact, I chair the subcommittee that oversees this. We have held hearings. We have looked at it very closely. My concern is that, if we wait for the President to come up with something and we basically surrender all of our prerogatives to the executive branch, then they come back and then--like the base closings legislation, the BRACC--we have an ability to overturn it; but the chances are slim to none that that will happen, for a variety of reasons.  Here we have a responsible piece of legislation that tries. Glitches, if there are any, can be worked out in conference. It is a work in progress. But, for example, it protects the freedom broadcasting capabilities of USIA at the same time that it introduces economies of scale which will eliminate some duplication.  I come to this somewhat reluctantly. Last Congress I felt that--especially concerning USIA, but with ACDA as well--perhaps consolidation was not the right course to take. But now, upon reflection and looking at an ever-shrinking pie in terms of the amount of money that is available, this seems to be a very responsible move. I hope, with all due respect to my good friend from Indiana, that Members will vote down his amendment and go with the underlying bill.
