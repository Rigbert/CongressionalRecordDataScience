 I spoke earlier today. This is the seventh attempt by this House to expedite, or now in this case, we are not expediting permitting, we are mandating permitting.  The gentleman just said that there's some disagreement here. The bill clearly states that it's the 2011 DEIS which is deemed to be sufficient which does not contain the current routing for the line.  We could create somewhat of an extraordinary precedent here. We could just have one generic national pipeline EIS that was done somewhere for something and went through the process and was approved and then deemed that any other pipeline that wants to be built can use that generic pipeline permit. That would certainly expedite things.
