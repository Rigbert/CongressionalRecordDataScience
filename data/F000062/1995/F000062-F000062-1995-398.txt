 Not 1 pound.  One local official reportedly said:       Obviously, we're in an area of international trade. We're      not in a situation where we can just stop traffic for the      sake of narcotics risk. . . We examined three percent of all      the laden trucks that crossed. That is a lot of trucks.  Right? Wrong.  My view is quite different. Increased commerce does not justify increased drug smuggling. It is time to close down our border to illegal immigrants and to illegal drug smuggling. It is unacceptable to have a Federal program in place that comprehensively checks just 3 percent of the trucks coming across the border where we know the highest level of drug smuggling occurs.  Let me give you an idea of one incident in California. This past November, 5 tons of cocaine was headed to a home in Rialto in San Bernardino County. I am not talking about bags of cocaine. I am not talking about pounds of cocaine. I am not talking about kilograms of cocaine. I am talking about tons--5 tons in 1 shipment going to one house in Rialto, California. That is the level on which drug smuggling is now taking place.
