 I want to congratulate my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Wayne Gilchrest) on his support of this provision and his discussions just earlier about some of the studies he has undertaken and his support of making sure the Chesapeake Bay is what we want it to be.  Toxic microorganisms, Madam Chairman, are a serious threat. The summer before last, Maryland was struck by the toxic microorganism pfiesteria. Linked to the flow of excess nutrients and the loss of aquatic habitat in our waterways, toxic blooms like pfiesteria seriously impact regional economies and threaten sensitive aquatic resources.  Several Federal agencies, including the EPA, NOAA, and the Centers for Disease Control presently are assisting States impacted by these toxic algae blooms. I have worked diligently in the past, through the appropriations process, to ensure that these agencies have the proper resources to undertake this effort. Although they have responded quickly and made substantial progress, no single agency is tasked with taking a comprehensive look at the problem and developing a master plan.  Given its expertise in water resources modeling, water quality monitoring, watershed management and restoration, and environmental planning, the Corps of Engineers has a vital role to play in this process. Section 573 simply authorizes $7 million for the Corps' participation in these efforts, and I urge my colleagues to support this important initiative and the bill itself.
