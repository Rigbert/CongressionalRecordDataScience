He refers to one or two of the issues in the bill. Obviously, one of the issues is the so-called Hoyer amendment, the Miller bill, which raises the minimum wage. We would hope that that would be brought to the floor. As you well know, we considered it with another bill. A number of items included in it. It went to the Senate. It didn't pass. We believe that the 6.6 million people on the minimum wage are hopeful that we will act before we leave here for the election.  I am very hopeful and I know our side is very hopeful that we could bring that bill to the floor with that amendment protected, voted up or down. If the Members think that we ought not to do it, fine. If the Members think we ought to do it, fine. And pass that bill to the Senate so we can complete the appropriations process.
