President.  I was speaking before the call of the quorum about the economic report card that we can point to with pride that we have 2.8 percent annual average inflation, the best since President Kennedy; 12.1 million new jobs in this period of time, the best ever; 1.1 million new construction jobs, the best since President Harry Truman; a 14-percent increase in consumer confidence, the best since President Eisenhower. The list goes on and on.  This budget agreement that we consider today continues the fiscal responsibility that we have shown since 1993. It includes the spending cuts we need to balance the budget by 2002 and sets the stage for continued balanced budgets beyond 2002.  What this budget package shows is that the two parties can work together to make the necessary choices to balance the budget and address the needs of the American people.  Is this the budget that I would have written? No, I would have changed a lot of the provisions. This is probably not the budget that any single Member of this body would have written, but it is a credible effort, a reasonable compromise. It is worthy of our support. No compromise is perfect, but this package will give many Illinois working families much-needed help in paying for the cost of raising kids and sending them to college. It addresses today's economic needs and realities, whether it is paying for day care, braces, health insurance, for kids or college tuition.  In addition to providing fairness for working families, it provides fairness for seniors, extending the Medicare Program with reforms that protect the most vulnerable. It eliminates some provisions adopted on the Senate floor which would have raised, for example, the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 over a 20-year period of time, and it addresses the concern that farmers and small businessowners should be able to pass on their business and their farm to their children without a great estate tax responsibility.  The spending bill that we consider preserves the budget and strengthens the Medicare Program. The Republican Contract With America, which was considered several years ago by Speaker Gingrich and many Republicans Senators supported, would have cut $270 billion out of Medicare over 7 years, a massive cutback in Medicare that would have imposed excessive new burdens on our Nation's seniors. This budget package cuts $115 billion over 5 years, without excessive new burdens on seniors.  It extends the solvency of Medicare for 10 years, keeping our word to seniors to keep this program strong. It limits the increased burdens on our elderly seniors who live on limited incomes and are already paying a large portion of their incomes in medical costs.  It allows for increased numbers of Medicare health plan choices for our seniors, especially in rural areas. It includes a new package of preventive benefits, including annual mammograms, diabetes self-management, and prostate colorectal cancer screening.  It also includes nearly $1 billion in new spending for rural health initiatives.  When it comes to Medicaid, this is also a good agreement. The Republican proposal in 1995 would have cut $163 billion from the Medicaid Program over 7 years. That would have risked the health of seniors, children, and pregnant women who count on Medicaid for basic health care and for many seniors' long-term care. This budget cuts only $13 billion from Medicaid over 5 years. We have balanced the budget without jeopardizing the safety net for Americans who lack health insurance.  This agreement marks a historic commitment to our Nation's children. The package sets aside $24 billion for children's health insurance. Over 10 million of our children are currently uninsured. This bill could help up to 7 million of these children become insured. I am certain that in so doing, it will take a great burden off the minds of many working families who don't earn enough money to be able to pay for health insurance today or don't have a benefits package at work that provides health insurance for their families.  The one thing this budget package does, which I think is long overdue, is it provides funding to restore the unfair welfare reform provisions that would otherwise cut off SSI legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and paying their taxes but have become disabled or may become disabled in the future. Without this budget agreement, over 22,000 elderly or disabled legal immigrants in my State of Illinois would face the loss of their SSI in October. For many of them, this is their only form of support. I supported the welfare reform bill, but I agreed with President Clinton that this was one provision that needed to be corrected. This agreement, this bill, will correct it.  This agreement also commits $3 billion to assist welfare recipients to move into work slots. The basic principle of welfare reform was that able-bodied adults should be put back to work. This assistance helps the States accomplish that goal. The Republican budget in 1995 would have imposed devastating spending cuts in education, environmental protection and crime prevention, but this budget protects the President's priorities in those areas, and the agreement on which this is based calls for a substantial increase in education funding.  The tax-cut bill offers valuable tax relief to millions of working families, with a net tax cut of around $95 billion over the next 5 years, tax cuts that are direct dividends of the 1993 budget bill.  This package includes a $500-per-child tax credit for children under the age of 17, beginning in 1999, with a $400 credit in 1998. The credit will be calculated before the earned-income tax credit to maintain the valuable work incentives associated with that credit, and it would be refundable against the payroll tax for larger families that face the great expense of raising the next generation.  This credit, which costs $85 billion over 5 years, is the largest tax cut in this package and one of its most important investments. An estimated 13 million children in families earning less than $30,000 will receive this valuable assistance which they can use to pay for day care, braces, or any other expenses the family faces, or to save for the future. This child credit begins to phase out for individuals earning $75,000 and couples making $110,000, higher than the President sought. More importantly, some families earning as little as $18,000 who pay payroll taxes but little or no taxes would also qualify, which Republicans have resisted.  Education tax credits: This tax cut package also includes the President's education tax credit proposal, which I strongly supported. With a value of $40 billion over 5 years, it constitutes the largest increase in Federal education assistance since the GI bill after World War II.  This package contains everything President Clinton asked for in educational tax benefits. If we as a society want to show our youth the value we place on education, we need to invest in education. This package does that, with tax relief for college tuition costs and increases in spending for scholarship grants, literacy programs, and student loans.  This measure includes $31 billion over 5 years that will allow middle-income families to receive up to $1,500 in tax credits to offset the cost of the first 2 years of college. Families will be able to take the credit against the first $1,000 of costs, plus half of the next $1,000 of costs. Juniors, seniors, and part-time students can take a credit of 20 percent of the first $5,000 of costs, to help families afford the continuing costs of higher education.  In addition, there are $9 billion of other education tax incentives, including an extension of the exemption for employer-paid undergraduate tuition, which allows companies to help their employees improve their skills and knowledge.  Estate tax: The estate tax exemption for farmers and small businesses will be increased to $1.3 billion next year. This would allow family farmers and family-owned businesses to pass down the fruits of their hard work to their children and grandchildren. The estate tax will also be raised gradually for all other Americans, to $1 million over the next 10 years, which recognizes the effects of inflation on the existing exemption.  Capital gains from home sales: For many families without children or whose children have grown, the most important tax break in this bill may be the capital gains exclusion for up to $500,000 in profits on the sale of a home. This will help retirees who want to move to a smaller home without adverse tax consequences.  Improvements: There are a number of improvements in this bill over the original Republican plans: The extension of the airline ticket tax has been improved. Capital gains will not be indexed for inflation, a GOP proposal that would have mainly benefited the most wealthy of Americans and would have created enormous pressure on the budget in future years. Also gone is a GOP demand to pay less than the minimum wage to people who move from welfare to subsidized public and nonprofit jobs, and to deny coverage under worker-protection laws.  Flaws: Unfortunately, the tax cut bill has a number of flaws.  The bill waits far too long to increase the tax deduction for health insurance for self-employed people to 100 percent. I have worked to give farmers and small businessowners parity with the corporations they compete with. Corporations can take a 100-percent deduction for health insurance premiums. The self-employed should be able to do the same. This bill does not move the deduction to 50 percent until the year 2000 and waits until 2007 to provide a 100-percent deduction. We can do better than that.  The conferees also dropped the extension of the ethanol excise tax incentive. I will continue to work for this important measure as part of the highway reauthorization bill.  The cigarette tax increase--which would discourage our young people from beginning a lifelong tobacco addiction--was reduced and delayed to the year 2000.  And we must be vigilant in monitoring the impact of some of the tax cuts in future years beyond 2002, because some of the provisions that primarily benefit investors and the wealthy could explode in costs in the coming decade. We could have better used that money for provisions like the self-employed health insurance deduction and the ethanol incentive.                               Conclusion  On balance, both the spending cut package and the tax cut package are worthy of support. They will balance the budget without putting an undue burden on our most vulnerable people, take some important steps to address problems such as the lack of health insurance among our children, and give tax relief to working families who need it most. I am pleased to support this package.                             POINT OF ORDER  Mr. President, at this point, I raise a point of order that section 1604(f)(3) of the bill, H.R. 2014, contains provisions that produce no change in outlays or revenues during the required period of time and, therefore, violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.  The provision which I make reference to would automatically assume that the tobacco tax increase, which is part of this bill, would be credited on behalf of the tobacco companies as part of any settlement that might be reached by Congress at a later date. This is a $50 billion windfall for the tobacco companies, which would absolve them from responsibilities which they have publicly said that they will assume.  This $50 billion would be taken out of programs that we think are necessary for public health, including enforcement of the agreement, public information campaign, smoking cessation clinics and the like.  So, Mr. President, I raise my point of order at this time.
