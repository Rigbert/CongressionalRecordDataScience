 President, it was a year ago this month that my alma mater, the University of Louisville, hired Scott Satterfield as its new football coach. The Cardinals convinced Scott to leave his head coaching job at Appalachian State University and take over Louisville's program. Today, it is a real pleasure for me to celebrate the good decision he made and to congratulate Coach Scott Satterfield for earning the title of ``2019 Atlantic Coast Conference Football Coach of the Year.''  When he first walked into Louisville's locker room as head coach, Scott faced a daunting task. The Cardinals ended their previous season with only two wins, leaving the team disappointed and the fans less than enthusiastic. Critics predicted another lackluster year for the Cardinals, and a preseason poll anticipated a repeat last-place finish in the division.  Well, anyone who made those predictions clearly didn't know Scott. They didn't understand the effect he could have on UofL's program and its student-athletes in hardly any time at all. Now, 1 year into the Satterfield-era, the University of Louisville Cardinals have won seven games, placed second in their division, and the team is on the way to the Music City Bowl. And when they take the field in Nashville, the Cardinals will be led by their award-winning and expectations-beating head coach.  It is a great privilege for a longtime Cards fan like myself to pay tribute to Coach Satterfield and his many accomplishments. He set out to change the program's culture, to restore the team's confidence, and to unite the players, coaches, and fans together around a shared purpose. Overcoming a challenging schedule took vision and grit, which are qualities Scott possesses in great measure.  Coach Satterfield has made fall Saturdays--or should I say ``Satterdays''--in Louisville a whole lot of fun. Igniting an explosive offense, including 2019 All-ACC first team honorees Tutu Atwell and Mekhi Becton, the Cardinals averaged more than 440 yards per game. The defense stepped up too--often when it mattered most--and helped add a couple of quality wins to the Cardinals' resume.  Scott began this season determined to prove that this team could live up to its greatest potential. Along with Louisville's other top-notch coaches, he is helping to restore UofL's pride. And after only a single season, he is already making history. As the first UofL coach to ever be named ``ACC Coach of the Year,'' Scott has shown that he not only has what it takes to compete at the highest levels of college football but that he is also ready to lead his team, our university, and the city to victory.  So I would like to congratulate Coach Scott Satterfield for receiving this well-deserved honor and to thank him for providing some extraordinary football to watch this season. I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in paying tribute to Scott as he prepares to finish strong in Nashville at the end of the month. I for one, look forward to cheering on my Cards.                          ____________________
