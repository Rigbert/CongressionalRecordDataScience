Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 123, which declares English to be the official language of the Government of the United States.                              {time}  1315  The Government of the United States. And simply stated, that means when one does business with the Government of the United States, one does it in the English language.  We have heard a lot about the fact that English is a unifying force which has brought millions of immigrants over the years together in this country, and I think that is a true statement, but I also think it is important for us to look to the north and to Belgium to see how bilingualism and multilingualism has been a dividing force in those countries. And it has. Neither in Canada nor in Belgium over literally centuries has there been a formula devised to bring unity to those countries that have been divided, not along religious or ethnic lines but along language lines.  But irrespective of whether this bill is adopted, English is the language of commerce. If someone comes from a non-English speaking country to the United States, in order for them to achieve the American dream they have to be functional in English, and there is no better way to help them become functional in English than to say that when doing business with the Government of the United States, it be done in the English language.  So what we are doing here I think is helping people who come from other countries where English is not the language to become part of America. To achieve the American dream. To achieve their own individual human potential. And this is one small step in allowing them to do so.  Mr. Chairman, I submit the following for the Record.  I rise in strong of H.R. 123, the English Language Empowerment Act of 1996. I believe it is essential to have English as the official language of our National Government, for the English language is the tie that binds the millions of immigrants who come to America from divergent backgrounds. We should, and do, encourage immigrants to maintain and share their traditions, customs, and religions, but the use of English is essential for immigrants and their children to participate fully in American society and achieve the American dream.  Importantly, title II of this bill repeals the Federal mandate requiring certain communities to provide bilingual ballots. This directive of the Voting Rights Act is unnecessary and costly. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was originally intended to put a stop to racial barriers to voting in the South, such as literacy tests. English-only ballots are simply not the equivalent, or even comparable, to the racially abused literacy tests of the South.  Applicants for American citizenship, with some limited exceptions, have been required to demonstrate proficiency in English since 1906. Since only citizens may vote, the rationale for mandatory multilingual voting services is perplexing. One of the reasons we require immigrants to learn English before they naturalize is that a person who cannot understand English will not be able to participate in the political community in any but the most limited capacity. Bilingual ballots are not an effective means of increasing full political participation, for they are used by citizens who are obviously not proficient in English, and those who are not proficient in English, in most cases, cannot follow a political campaign, talk with candidates, or petition their representatives.  I believe it is necessary to clarify what repealing the bilingual ballot requirement does not do. This bill does not affect laws outlawing voter discrimination. It does not propose a literacy test. It does not preclude anyone from voting, even if they do not know English.  There are effective alternatives to federally mandated bilingual ballots, especially where complicated ballot initiatives are involved. Foreign language newspapers have the free speech right to publish sample ballots translated from English, and voters can take these sample ballots into the voting booth. Under this bill, a political party or interest group is perfectly free to issue multilingual voting materials. States can choose to allow voters to bring a friend or relative in the booth with them, absentee ballots can be filled out at home with assistance, and ethnic organizations can provide bilingual sample ballots andvoter information pamphlets. Furthermore, although this bill eliminates the unfunded mandate on the States, States are still free to supply ballots in foreign languages, if that is what the voters demand.  According to a recent survey, more than 80 percent of Americans, including immigrants, support making English the official language of the United States. I urge my colleagues to heed the call of the American people and vote in favor of this bill.
