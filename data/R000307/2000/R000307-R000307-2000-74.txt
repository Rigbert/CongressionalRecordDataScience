Any Medicare-approved home health agency must comply with all Medicare conditions of participation, including the collection ofOASIS. This means that patients who do not participate in Medicare are still subject to the Medicare assessment. That is exactly correct.  Last year, HCFA amended this regulation to say that these agencies don't have to transmit the data on non-Medicare patients for the time being. However, the agency still must spend the time making the assessment. So it is sort of a Catch-22. I am certainly sympathetic to the concerns raised by my constituents that these new regulations and spending cuts will harm, again, the senior. But aren't these policy changes necessary to achieve the Medicare saving goals established by the Balanced Budget Act, I ask my colleague?
