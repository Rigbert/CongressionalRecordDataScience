Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1154) to provide for administrative procedures to extend Federal recognition to certain Indian groups, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1154       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Federal Recognition      Administrative Procedures Act of 1998''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to establish an administrative procedure to extend      Federal recognition to certain Indian groups;       (2) to extend to Indian groups which are determined to be      Indian tribes the protection, services, and benefits      available from the Federal Government pursuant to the Federal      trust responsibility;       (3) to extend to Indian groups which are determined to be      Indian tribes the immunities and privileges available to      other acknowledged Indian tribes by virtue of their status as      Indian tribes with a government-to-government relationship      with the United States;       (4) to ensure that when the Federal Government extends      acknowledgment to an Indian tribe, it does so with a      consistent legal, factual, and historical basis;       (5) to establish a commission which will act in a      supporting role to petitioning groups applying for      recognition;       (6) to provide clear and consistent standards of      administrative review of documented petitions for      acknowledgment;       (7) to clarify evidentiary standards and expedite the      administrative review process by providing adequate resources      to process petitions; and       (8) to remove the acknowledgment process from the Bureau of      Indian Affairs and invest it in the Commission on Indian      Recognition.

For purposes of the adjudicatory hearing, the      Assistant Secretary's final determination shall be considered      a preliminary determination under section 8(b)(1)(B) of this      Act.       (3) Groups and entities excluded.--The provisions of this      Act do not apply to the following groups or entities, which      shall not be eligible for recognition under this Act--       (A) Indian tribes, organized bands, pueblos, communities,      and Alaska Native entities which are recognized by the      Secretary as of the date of enactment of this Act as eligible      to receive services from the Bureau;       (B) splinter groups, political factions, communities, or      groups of any character which separate from the main body of      an Indian tribe that, at the time of such separation, was      recognized as being an Indian tribe by the Secretary, unless      it can be clearly established that the group, faction, or      community has functioned throughout history until the date of      such petition as an autonomous Indian group; and       (C) any Indian group whose relationship with the Federal      Government was expressly terminated by an Act of Congress.       (4) Transfer of petitions.--(A) No later than 30 days after      the date on which all of the initial members of the      Commission have been appointed, the Secretary shall transfer      to the Commission all petitions pending before the      Department. The Secretary shall also transfer all letters of      intent previously received by the Department that request the      Secretary, or the Federal Government, to recognize or      acknowledge an Indian group as an Indian tribe.       (B) On the date of such transfer, the Secretary and the      Department shall cease to have any authority to recognize or      acknowledge, on behalf of the Federal Government, any Indian      group as an Indian tribe.       (C) Petitions and letters of intent transferred to the      Commission under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall,      for purposes of this Act, be considered as having been      submitted to the Commission in the same order as they were      submitted to the Department.       (b) Petition Form and Content.--Except as otherwise      provided in this section, any petition submitted under      subsection (a) by an Indian group shall be in any readable      form that clearly indicates that the petition is requesting      the Commission to recognize the petitioning Indian group as      an Indian tribe. Each petition shall contain specific      evidence establishing the following mandatory criteria:       (1) The petitioner has been identified as an American      Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since 1934.       (A) Evidence to be relied upon in determining a group's      Indian identity may include 1 or a combination of the      following, as well as other evidence of identification by      other than the petitioner itself or its members. Proof of any      1 of the following for a given time is conclusive evidence of      Indian identity for that time.       (i) Identification as an Indian entity by Federal      authorities.       (ii) Relationships with State governments based on      identification of the group as Indian.       (iii) Dealings with a county, parish, or other local      government in a relationship based on the group's Indian      identity.       (iv) Identification as an Indian entity by anthropologists,      historians, or other scholars.       (v) Identification as an Indian entity in newspapers and      books.       (vi) Identification as an Indian entity in relationships      with Indian tribes or with national, regional, or State      Indian organizations.       (B) A petitioner may establish that, for any given period      of time for which evidence of identification as Indian is      lacking, such absence of evidence corresponds in time with      official acts of the Federal or relevant State government      which prohibited or penalized the expression of Indian      identity. For such periods of time, the absence of evidence      identifying the petitioner as an Indian entity shall not be      the basis for declining to acknowledge the petitioner.       (2) A predominant portion of the petitioning groups      comprises a distinct community and has existed as a community      on a substantially continuous basis since 1934.       (A) The criterion that the petitioner meets the definition      of community set forth in section 3 may be demonstrated by 1      or more of the following:       (i) Significant rates of marriage within the group or, as      may be culturally required, patterned out-marriages with      other Indian populations.       (ii) Significant social relationships connecting individual      members.       (iii) Significant rates of informal social interaction      which exist broadly among the members of a group.       (iv) A significant degree of shared or cooperative labor or      other economic activity among the membership.       (v) Evidence of strong patterns of discrimination or other      social distinctions by nonmembers.       (vi) Shared sacred or secular ritual activity encompassing      most of the group.       (vii) Cultural patterns shared among a significant portion      of the group that are different from those of the non-Indian      populations with whom it interacts. These patterns must      function as more than a symbolic identification of the group      as Indian. They may include, but are not limited to,      language, kinship organization, or religious beliefs and      practices.       (viii) The persistence of a named, collective Indian      identity continuously over a period of more than 50 years,      notwithstanding changes in name.       (ix) A demonstration of political influence under the      criterion in paragraph (3)(B) shall be conclusive evidence      for demonstrating community for that period of time.       (x) Other evidence as considered appropriate by the      Secretary.       (B) A petitioner shall be considered to have provided      sufficient evidence of community at a given point in time if      evidence is provided to demonstrate any 1 of the following:       (i) More than 50 percent of the members reside in a      geographical area or areas no more than 50 miles from a      historic land base(s) or site(s) of the petitioner.       (ii) At least 50 percent of the marriages in the group are      between members of the group.       (iii) At least 50 percent of the group members maintain      distinct cultural patterns such as, but not limited to,      language, kinship organization, or religious beliefs and      practices.       (iv) There are distinct social institutions encompassing      more than 50 percent of the members, such as kinship      organizations, formal or informal economic cooperation, or      religious organizations.       (v) The group has met the criterion in paragraph (3) using      evidence described in paragraph (3)(B).       (3) The petitioner has maintained political influence or      authority over its members as an autonomous entity from 1934      until the present.       (A) This criterion may be demonstrated by 1 or more of the      evidence listed below or by other evidence of political      influence or authority:       (i) The group is able to mobilize significant numbers of      members and significant resources from its members for group      purposes.       (ii) Most of the membership considers issues acted upon or      actions taken by group leaders or governing bodies to be of      importance.       (iii) There is widespread knowledge, communication, and      involvement in political processes by most of the group's      members.       (iv) There are internal conflicts which show controversy      over valued group goals, properties, policies, processes, or      decisions.       (B) A petitioning group shall be considered to have      provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate the exercise of      political influence or authority at a given point in time by      demonstrating any 1 of the following:       (i) A continuous line of group leaders, acknowledged and      accepted as such by State or local governments or nonmembers      in general, with a description of the means of selection.       (ii) Group leaders or other mechanisms exist or existed      which allocate group resources such as land, residence      rights, and the like on a consistent basis.       (iii) Group leaders or other mechanisms exist or existed      which settle disputes between members or subgroups by some      means.       (iv) Group leaders or other mechanisms exist or existed      which exert strong influence on the behavior of individual      members, such as the establishment or maintenance of norms      and the enforcement of sanctions to influence behavior.       (v) Group leaders or other mechanisms exist or existed      which organize or influence economic subsistence activities      among the members, including shared or cooperative labor.       (C) A group that has met the requirements in paragraph (3)      at a given point in time shall be considered to have provided      sufficient evidence to meet this criterion at that point in      time.       (4) A copy of the group's present governing document,      including its membership criteria. In the absence of a      written document, the petitioner must provide a statement      describing in full its membership criteria.       (5) The petitioner's membership consists of individuals who      descend from a historical Indian tribe or from historical      Indian tribes which combined and functioned as a single      autonomous political entity.       (A) A petitioner shall be presumed to descend from a      historical Indian tribe or combined tribes upon proof by the      petitioner that its member descend from an Indian entity in      existence in 1934. This presumption may be rebutted by      affirmative evidence offered by any interested party that the      Indian entity in existence in 1934 does not descend from a      historical Indian tribe or combined tribes.       (B) The following evidence shall be deemed by the      Commission to prove descent from a historical Indian entity      for the time for which such evidence is available:       (i) Rolls prepared by the Secretary on a descendancy basis      for purposes of distributing claims money, providing      allotments, or other purposes.       (ii) State, Federal, or other official records or evidence      identifying present members or ancestors of present members      as being descendants of a historical tribe or combined      tribes.       (iii) Church, school, and other similar enrollment records      identifying present members or ancestors of present members      as being descendants of a historical tribe or combined      tribes.       (iv) Affidavits of recognition by tribal elders, leaders,      or the tribal governing body identifying present members or      ancestors of present members as being descendants of a      historical tribe or combined tribes.       (v) Reports, research, or other like statements based upon      firsthand experience of historians, anthropologists, and      genealogists with established expertise on the petitioner or      Indian entities in general identifying present members or      ancestors of present members as being descendants of a      historical tribe or combined tribes.       (C) A petitioner may also demonstrate this criterion by      other records of evidence identifying present members or      ancestors of present members as being descendants of a      historical tribe or combined tribes.       (D) The petitioner must provide an official membership      list, separately certified by the group's governing body of      all known current members of the group. This list must      include each member's full name (including maiden name),      date of birth, and current residential address. The      petitioner must also provide a copy of each available      former list of members based on the group's own defined      criteria, as well as a statement describing the      circumstances surrounding the preparation of the current      list and, insofar as possible, the circumstances      surrounding the preparation of former lists.       (6) The membership of the petitioning group is composed      principally of persons who are not members of any      acknowledged North American Indian tribe. However, under      certain conditions a petitioning group may be acknowledged      even if its membership is composed principally of persons      whose names have appeared on rolls of, or who have been      otherwise associated with, an acknowledged Indian tribe. The      conditions are that the group must establish that it has      functioned since 1934 until the present as a separate and      autonomous Indian tribal entity, that its members do not      maintain a bilateral political relationship with the      acknowledged tribe, and that its members have provided      written confirmation of their membership in the petitioning      group.       (c) Previous Acknowledgment.--       (1) In general.--Evidence which demonstrates previous      Federal acknowledgment includes, but is not limited to--       (A) evidence that the group has had or is the successor in      interest to a tribe that has had treaty relations with the      United States;       (B) evidence that the group has been or is the successor in      interest to a tribe that has been denominated a tribe by Act      of Congress or Executive order;       (C) evidence that the group has been or is the successor in      interest to a tribe that has been treated by the Federal      Government as having collective rights in tribal lands or      funds.       (2) Presumption of continuousness.--A petitioner that can      demonstrate previous Federal acknowledgment by a      preponderance of the evidence shall be required to      demonstrate the existence of current political authority as      defined by subsection (b)(3), with a time depth limited to 10      years preceding the date of the petition. Upon such      demonstration, a presumption of continuous existence since      previous Federal acknowledgment shall arise. Unless such      presumption is rebutted by evidence offered by an interested      party proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the      previously recognized group has abandoned tribal relations,      such group shall be recognized.       (d) Recognition of Groups Meeting Criteria.--The Commission      shall recognize as an Indian tribe a petitioning group that      demonstrates the criteria set out in this section by a      preponderance of the evidence. Such recognized tribes shall      be entitled to the same privileges, immunities, rights, and      benefits of other federally recognized tribes. Neither shall      the Department of the Interior nor any other Federal agency      purport to diminish, condition, or revoke the privileges,      immunities, rights, and benefits of Indian tribes recognized      by any means before the effective date of this Act or under      the provisions of this Act.     SEC. 6. NOTICE OF RECEIPT OF PETITION AND LETTERS OF INTENT.       (a) Petitioner.--Not later than 30 days after a petition is      submitted or transferred to the Commission under section      5(a), the Commission shall send an acknowledgement of receipt      in writing to the petitioner and shall have published in the      Federal Register a notice of such receipt, including the      name, location, and mailing address of the petitioner and      such other information that will identify the entity who      submitted the petition and the date the petition was received      by the Commission. The notice shall also indicate where a      copy of the petition may be examined.       (b) Letters of Intent.--As to letters of intent, publish in      the Federal Register a notice of such receipt, including the      name, location, and mailing address of petitioner. A      petitioner who has submitted a letter of intent or had a      letter of intent transferred to the Commission under section      5(a) shall not be required to submit a documented petition      within any time period.       (c) Others.--The Commission shall also notify, in writing,      the Governor and attorney general of, and each recognized      Indian tribe within, any State in which a petitioner resides.       (d) Publication; Opportunity for Supporting or Opposing      Submissions.--The Commission shall publish the notice of      receipt of the petition in a major newspaper of general      circulation in the town or city nearest the location of the      petitioner. The notice shall include, in addition to the      information described in subsection (a), notice of      opportunity for other parties to submit factual or legal      arguments in support of or in opposition to, the petition.      Such submissions shall be provided to the petitioner upon      receipt by the Commission. The petitioner shall be provided      an opportunity to respond to such submissions prior to a      determination on the petition by the Commission.     SEC. 7. PROCESSING THE PETITION.       (a) Review.--       (1) In general.--Upon receipt of a documented petition, the      Commission shall conduct a review to determine whether the      petitioner is entitled to be recognized as an Indian tribe.       (2) Consideration.--The review conducted under paragraph      (1) shall include consideration of the petition, supporting      evidence, and the factual statements contained in the      petition.       (3) Research.--The Commission may also initiate other      research for any purpose relative to analyzing the petition      and obtaining additional information about the petitioner's      status and may consider any evidence which may be submitted      by other parties.       (4) Access to other federal resources.--Upon request by the      petitioner, the Library of Congress and the National Archives      shall each allow access to the petitioner to its resources,      records, and documents, for the purpose of conducting      research and preparing evidence concerning the status of the      petitioner.       (b) Consideration.--       (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided in this      subsection, petitions shall be considered on a first come,      first served basis, determined by the date of the original      filing of the petition with the Commission, or the Department      if the petition is transferred to the Commission pursuant to      section 5(a). The Commission shall establish a priority      register including those petitions pending before the      Department on the date of enactment of this Act.       (2) Priority.--Petitions that are submitted to the      Commission by Indian groups that meet 1 or more of the      requirements set forth in section 5(c) shall receive priority      consideration over petitions submitted by any other Indian      group.

(2) Published in federal register.--The Commission shall      publish the determination in the Federal Register.       (c) Information To Be Provided Preparatory to an      Adjudicatory Hearing.--       (1) In general.--If the Commission determines under      subsection (b) that the petitioner proceed to an adjudicatory      hearing, the Commission shall--       (A) immediately make available to the petitioner all      records relied upon by the Commission and its staff in making      the preliminary determination to assist the petitioner in      preparing for the adjudicatory hearing, and shall also      include such guidance as the Commission considers necessary      or appropriate to assist the petitioner in preparing for the      hearing including references to prior decisions of the      Commission or to recognition decisions made under regulations      prescribed by the Secretary that will provide direction in      preparing for the adjudicatory hearing; and if prior      recognition decisions are referred to, the Commission will      make all records relating to such decisions available to the      petitioner in a timely manner; and       (B) within 30 days after the conclusion of the preliminary      hearing under subsection (a), notify the petitioner in      writing, which notice shall include a list of any      deficiencies or omissions on which the Commission relied in      making its determination.       (2) List of deficiencies.--The list of deficiencies and      omissions provided under paragraph (1)(B) shall be the      subject of the adjudicatory hearing.

(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the      conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the Commission shall      afford the petitioner described in section 8(b)(1)(B) an      adjudicatory hearing. The hearing shall be on the list of      deficiencies and omissions provided under section 8(c)(1)(B)      and shall be conducted on the record pursuant to sections      554, 556, and 557 of title 5, United States Code.       (b) Testimony From Staff of Commission.--The Commission      shall require testimony from its acknowledgement and research      staff that worked on the preliminary determination and that      are assisting the Commission in the final determination under      subsection (d) and may require the testimony of other      witnesses. Any such testimony shall be subject to cross-     examination by the petitioner.

Such      recognition shall subject the Indian tribes to the same      authority of Congress and the United States to which other      federally recognized tribes are subject.       (2) Availability.--Recognition of the Indian tribe under      this Act does not create an immediate entitlement to existing      programs of the Bureau.

(b) Research Advice.--The Commission, upon request, is      authorized to provide suggestions and advise to any      petitioner for his research into the petitioner's historical      background and Indian identity.

If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to      any petitioner is held invalid, the invalidity shall not      affect other provisions or applications of the Act which can      be given effect without regard to the invalid provision or      application, and to this end the provisions of this Act shall      be severable.
