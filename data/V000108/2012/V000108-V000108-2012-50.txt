 The title 17 loan program has had its share of publicized problems, but I do believe that the Department of Energy has implemented changes to the program that will strengthen the management of it going forward. And while it is impossible to ensure the success of a loan guarantee, these reforms, I believe, will significantly reduce the risk borne by the Department.  This amendment is specifically targeted at renewable energy projects pending approval under the 1705 Innovative Loan Guarantee program. Some of these projects are eligible to have their credit subsidy costs covered by the Department. Generally, given the current capital markets and project structure, it is difficult for renewable projects to raise sufficient revenue to use loan authority. Because we have several promising projects that remain in the pipeline and the companies behind these applications have invested a significant amount of time and financial resources to advance them, I do not believe that this amendment is fruitful.                              {time}  2200  The amendment would make these efforts multiyear for naught and further exacerbate the uncertain business environment facing innovative energy companies at this time. Therefore, I would be opposed to the gentleman's amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
