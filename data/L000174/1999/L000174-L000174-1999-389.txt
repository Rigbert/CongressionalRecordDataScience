President, the purpose of this amendment is to reaffirm that protecting biodiversity is a key goal of our foreign policy. It is also to clarify language on page 23 of the Appropriations Committee report--Report 106-81, which incorrectly refers to fiscal year 1994. The year should have been 1995.  The United States, the birthplace of the global environmental movement, has led the way in supporting efforts to protect the incredible variety of plants and animals around the world. Yet because of shrinking budgets and changing priorities in Congress and at AID, our efforts to preserve the Earth's biodiversity have diminished. The consequences of this are profound, for ourselves and even more so for future generations. We cannot afford to neglect an area of environmental protection that so directly affects the lives ofAmerican families and American industries.  AID's biodiversity activities include efforts to save species and ecosystems from extinction or degredation. Only 1.5 million of the estimated 10-50 million species have even been named and classified. Far fewer have been studied for their potential uses to humanity. Yet the destruction of natural habitats is leading to 100 extinctions every single day. AID also promotes genetic diversity. Genes that could have been lost to environmental destruction now improve and protect crops all over the world, and especially here in the United States.  In the United States, we reap the benefits of the world's biological diversity every day. Atmospheric pollution is reduced by tropical rainforests. Our cattle and crops are crossbred to improve their genetic traits. The pharmaceutical benefits alone are amazing. Diseases common in this country are cured with medicines that come from plants from around the world. The worldwide market for drugs derived from plants is $40 billion. Who knows what new species will be discovered, leading to medicines that will benefit tomorrow's sick? No one does, which is why we cannot let a newly discovered species containing a possible cure for cancer, or AIDS, or even the common cold, go the way of the dinosaurs.  AID has led the way worldwide in supporting biodiversity, by working effectively with U.S. and foreign nongovernmental organizations, and foreign governments. For example, the Philippines, with its coral reefs and tropical forests, is one of the most biodiverse places in the world. It is also one of the most threatened. But through effective management, AID has helped place over 1.2 million acres of forest land under community stewardship and away from harm. AID has implemented similar projects elsewhere, working with governments to protect their own valuable resources.  Despite successes such as these, our biodiversity efforts are threatened. Since 1995, AID expenditures for biodiversity have decreased by nearly $50 million, a nearly 50 percent reduction in just four years. Much of this decline is due to the steady reduction in our foreign aid budget. But even from this shrinking pie, biodiversity gets a thinner and thinner slice every year. In 1995, biodiversity spending was 5.1% of development assistance expenditures. By 1996 it was down to 4%. Then in 1998, expenditures were reduced to only 3.3%.  These disproportionate cuts have devastating consequences. The Philippines project I just mentioned will completely run out of funding next year. In Madagascar, a country that AID made one of its top biodiversity priorities over a decade ago, AID cut its biodiversity funding by $900,000. In some ways Madagascar was lucky, because AID had originally planned to cut $1.5 million dollars. And this is a country that AID says is ``Africa's most important biodiversity priority.''  Obviously, we have many other development assistance priorities--in public health, in education, in family planning, in justice reform, to name a few. But we need a more balanced approach. I have spoken out more times than I can count in support of more funding for foreign aid. Foreign aid not only helps promote American interests abroad, but also provides direct benefits here at home. But even given the shrinking funds we devote to foreign aid, we must ensure that funding to protect biodiversity does not continue to suffer disproportionate cuts. We should resume the proportion of development assistance funding for biodiversity to the proportion it received in 1995. That is what my amendment would do.  I also want to be very clear about what we mean by ``biodiversity.'' We mean ``activities designed to support the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity--biomasses, ecosystems, species, or genetic diverity--by identifying needs, by designing, implementing and monitoring conservation and management actions; through research and training; or through institutional strengthening, policy interventions and program development.'' This is consistent with AID's definition of these activities.  Finally, we need to ensure that AID's Office of Environment and Natural Resources receives strong support. This office performs a vital function in the design, implementation and evaluation of conservation activities. Yet funding for it has been cut steadily since 1995, from $25.6 million to $6.9 million in 1999. That it totally unacceptable, and it seriously undercuts AID's capacity to exert leadership in this area.  Mr. President, I want to commend AID for its leadership in this area. I also want to ensure that it continue's to exert that leadership. That requires adequate resources, and I intend to work with AID to balance the many competing development assistance programs to achieve that goal.                           amendment no. 1134       On page 32, line 12, delete everything beginning with      ``For'' through ``expended'' on page 33, line 7, and insert      in lieu thereof the following:       ``For the cost, as defined in section 502 of the      Congressional Budget Act of 1974, of modifying direct or      indirect loans and loan guarantees, as the President may      determine, for which funds have been appropriated or      otherwise made available for programs within the      International Affairs Budget Function 150, including the cost      of selling, reducing, or canceling amounts owed to the United      States as a result of concessional loans made to eligible      countries, pursuant to parts IV and V of the Foreign      Assistance Act of 1961 (including necessary expenses for the      administration of activities carried out under these parts),      and of modifying concessional credit agreements with least      developed countries, as authorized under section 411 of the      Agriculture Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 as      amended; and concessional loans, guarantees and credit      agreements with any country in sub-Saharan Africa, as      authorized under section 572 of the Foreign Operations,      Export Financing and Related Programs Act, 1989 (Public Law      100-461); $43,000,000, to remain available until expended;      provided that any limitation of subsection (e) of Section 411      of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of      1954 to the extent that limitation applies to sub-Saharan      African countries shall not apply to funds appropriated      hereunder or previously appropriated''.                                  ____                           AMENDMENT NO. 1135 (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding which office in    the Department of State is appropriate for managing United States                          interests in Ukraine)       On page 128, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following      new section: sense of congress on management of united states interests in ukraine       Sec. 580. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following      findings:       (1) Ukraine is a major European nation as it has the second      largest territory and sixth largest population of all the      States of Europe.       (2) Ukraine has important geopolitical and economic roles      to play within Central and Eastern Europe.       (3) A strong, stable, and secure Ukraine serves the      interests of peace and stability in all of Europe, which are      important national security interests of the United States.       (4) Ukraine is a member State of the Council of Europe, the      Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the      Central European Initiative, and the Euro-Atlantic      Partnership Conference, is a participant in the Partnership      for Peace program of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,      and has entered into a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement      with the European Union.       (5) The Government of Ukraine has clearly articulated its      country's aspirations to become fully integrated into      European and transatlantic institutions, and, in pursuit of      the attainment of that aspiration, the government of Ukraine      has requested associate membership in the European Union with      the intent of eventually becoming a full member of the      European Union.       (6) It is the policy of the United States to support the      aspiration of Ukraine to assume its rightful place among the      European and transatlantic community of democratic States and      in European and transatlantic institutions.       (7) In the United States Government, the responsibility for      management of United States interests in Ukraine would be      most effectively performed by the officials who perform the      responsibility for management of United States interests in      Europe, and a designation of those officials to do so would      strongly underscore and most effectively support attainment      of the United States objective to build a Europe whole and      free.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that      the Secretary of State should designate the Assistant      Secretary of State for European Affairs to perform, through      the Bureau of European Affairs of the Department of State,      the responsibilities of the Department of State for the      management of United States interests in Ukraine.                                  ____                           amendment no. 1136  (Purpose: To reduce the amount appropriated for contribution to the                  International Development Association)       On page 38, line 10, strike ``$785,000,000'' and insert      ``$776,600,000''.
