 President, today, Senate Democrats offered the Bush administration the tools needed to fight international terrorism while upholding the very liberties that our enemies seek to destroy. That is why I support S. 2011, the Rockefeller-Levin Protect America Act.  The Rockefeller-Levin bill strengthens our ability to protect Americans, while ensuring this authority doesn't undermine our freedoms. Rockefeller-Levin gives the Director of National Intelligence the authority to obtain all essential intelligence information while preserving a role for the independent FISA Court to oversee his methods and protect our constitutional liberties.  To simply legitimize the Bush administration's warrantless wiretap program and provide unchecked authority to invade the personal privacy of all Americans is the wrong message to send to our citizens and the world.  Our Constitution provides for a separation of powers to protect our Nation and our way of life, and I, for one, do not believe we can undermine the liberty our troops have fought for generations to ensure.
