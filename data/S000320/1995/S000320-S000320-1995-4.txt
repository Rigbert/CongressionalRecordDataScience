 President, I strongly support Senate Joint Resolution 31, which amends the Constitution to protect the flag of the United States from those who would desecrate it.  The American flag is a national symbol of the values this country was founded on. Many Americans have fought and died to defend these values and this country. It is an insult to these patriots, their relatives, and all other citizens who hold this country dear, to burn or desecrate the symbol of our nation and our freedom.  I certainly support the right of all citizens to freedom of speech, but that right has never been absolute in our country. That's why there are laws against libel, slander, perjury, and obscenity. Similarly, our freedom of political expression is also limited. No one can legally deface the Supreme Court building or the Washington Monument, no matter how much he or she might wish to protest a particular government policy or law. The American flag, as the symbol of all the great values this country stands for, deserves special protection under the Constitution. It simply is not necessary to commit an act of violence against this flag to register protest against the government. Passage of Senate Joint Resolution 31 will help ensure our national symbol receives the respect and protection it deserves.   Again, Mr. President, I offer my strong support for Senate Joint Resolution 31 and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.
