Speaker, I recognize the importance of the issues that the House of Representatives is addressing today as it considers H.R. 3121.  However, I must object to certain provisions of H.R. 3121 and the manner in which it has been brought before the House. This measure authorizes enhanced International Military and Education Training [IMET] for Indonesia, which is committing flagrant human rights abuses against the people of East Timor.  More than 20 years ago, Indonesian troops invaded the small country of East Timor, beginning a storm of violent occupation and repression that continues today. I believe that we must stand with the East Timorese against these unconscionable acts, and I am concerned that by providing enhanced IMET to Indonesia, we may send a dangerous message to the leaders of that nation.  In addition, by bringing H.R. 3121 to the floor under suspension of the rules, we will not have a full and open debate on IMET and Indonesia's aggression against the East Timorese. The suspension calendar should be reserved for non-controversial legislation. In my opinion, H.R. 3121 does not meet this test.  I regret that this afternoon, the House is not giving these issues the attention they deserve. In the months to come, I will continue to work to assist the long-suffering people of East Timor, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.
