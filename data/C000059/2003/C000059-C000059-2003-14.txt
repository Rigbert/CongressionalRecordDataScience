Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, I want to point out that this bill eliminated the Office of Highlands Stewardship and the accompanied regulatory process. It reduced the authorization level from $25 million annually to $10 million annually over 10 years. It focused conservation efforts only on those resources most important. This bill clarified that the bill would not establish a wholly new programmatic category of land use, and, finally, it assured landowners in the Highlands region that private property rights will be protected by including safeguards for those landowners potentially at risk.  So, Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation. It has been developed over a long period of time.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
