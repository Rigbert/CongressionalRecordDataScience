 To that end, I have filed an amendment, No. 1438, that would provide nonsensitive Nepali exports duty-free treatment in the U.S. market. Doing so would be consistent with our response to Haiti's devastating earthquake in 2010 and would attract much needed international investment in Nepal during this time of need.  While I understand that we will not have an opportunity to further amend H.R. 1314, I ask you to provide your commitment to work include my legislation in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015--also known as the Customs enforcement bill--or a similar bill as reported by a conference committee to reauthorize trade facilitation and trade enforcement functions and activities.
