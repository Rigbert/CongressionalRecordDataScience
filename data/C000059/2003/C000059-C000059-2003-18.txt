. 2359, the Basic Pilot Extension Act of 2003. The basic pilot employment verification system is the only system offered to employers to verify employment eligibility for new employees.  In 1994, I spoke with a Border Patrol agent who identified a key need in the enforcement of immigration laws: Employers need a simple and reliable tool to verify the worker status of new employees.                              {time}  1815  In response, I introduced a bill to create the basic pilot program to do just that, operate in six of the most problematic States on a voluntary basis. The basic pilot program has proven to be an overwhelming success.  The basic pilot program is the best tool available for employers to comply with immigration laws which prohibit hiring undocumented immigrants. Recently, a contract cleaning service for Wal-Mart was raided by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and over 250 employees were arrested. If Wal-Mart's cleaning service contractors had used the basic pilot program and verified the I-9 documents provided by their workers, this could have been avoided. We must provide companies the option of using this employment verification program and assist them in complying with Federal immigration law. Without this system, employers have no means of verifying legal work status for immigrants, causing many employers to discriminate against legal workers. This program gives employers the confidence to hire legal immigrants, reducing discrimination in the workplace.  Additionally, H.R. 2359 allows employers from any State to voluntarily use this program. Many of my colleagues expressed concerns that this will expand the program too far, too fast. The reality is that the current program States are home to 80 percent of illegal immigrants, which means the impact on the system will be relatively small. After 7 successful years, it is time to give all employers the option of verifying their workforce and avoiding entanglements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  As a former restaurant owner, I tried to do the right thing. When I filed those forms, that I-9, and put two identifications in the back of that form, I hoped that they were legal. But many times you cannot tell the difference. The only chance that an employer has today to try to do the right thing is verifying the legitimacy of that Social Security number against the name of the potential employee that is coming in for employment. This is the only way they can do it, Madam Speaker. If we take this away, there will be no other options for employers.  I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hostettler) for their work on this important bill. I hope that we keep this program intact in this country. We need it desperately as employers.
