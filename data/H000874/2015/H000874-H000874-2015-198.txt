Chairman, make no mistake. These budget alternatives are political documents that are unworkable and unserious when it comes to governing.  Like previous Republican budgets that rely on sequestration, I have no doubt that the majority will not be able to enact appropriation bills that adhere to whichever version that you will pass. You have not done so in the past, and you will not do so this year.  They will continue to be, as the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Rogers, said, ``unrealistic and ill-conceived.''  Budget Committee Democrats, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and the Congressional Black Caucus have all put forward alternatives that are far better than these dueling Republican budget resolutions.  Democrats prioritize replacing the sequester, which Mr. Rogers believes should be done, on both the defense and domestic sides, so that we can make investments in America's future that are fiscally sustainable.  I urge my colleagues to reject the two Republican budget alternatives and their strategy of selective sequester.  The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to direct all their remarks to the Chair.
