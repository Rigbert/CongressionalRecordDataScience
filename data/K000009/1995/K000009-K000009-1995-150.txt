Speaker, last week a full-page advertisement appeared in the Washington Post that stated: ``Leading Newspapers Agree: U.S. Trade Sanctions On Japan Are Not The Answer.'' The Washington Post raked in over $25,000 on this one ad. The Wall Street Journal, another opponent of the sanctions, printed a similar ad, but the charges there were over $123,000 for a page. Here on Capitol Hill, Roll Call, a newspaper that goes to every congressional office, printed an ad opposing the sanctions that cost $6,200.  There is big money to be made by newspapers in opposing United States trade sanctions on Japan and in opposing the American people in the process, but is it not revealing who has their hands in the honey pot.  I would like to say who is going to stand up for the 700,000 United States workers employed in the auto industry, the 4 million workers who work in the textile, semiconductor, paint, and plaster industry and millions of Americans who would have jobs in the industry if Japan would open its markets?                          ____________________
