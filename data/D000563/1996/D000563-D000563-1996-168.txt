Speaker, I rise to recognize the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, and to urge support for closing the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant.  It was 10 years ago, April 26, 1986 that reactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant exploded. And the effects of that explosion are still with us today. Millions of people, including more than a million children, were exposed to the high levels of radiation that escaped from the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant. Many have suffered the consequences of that exposure, which has led to thyroid cancer, birth defects, diseases of the immune system and more.  The world has responded to the suffering of the people affected by the Chernobyl disaster. The Ukrainian-American community, the Belarusian-American community, the Moldovan-American community, the Russian-American community and other Eastern and Central European-American communities have led the way, sending millions of dollars and teams of doctors and nurses to help the relief efforts. But even 10 years after this disaster, the effects of Chernobyl are still with us. There is much work left to do.  I have introduced, with other Members of Congress, a resolution to help ensure that the world and the people most directly affected by Chernobyl will one day be able to put this tragedy behind them. The resolution urges the Government of Ukraine to continue its efforts to close all the nuclear reactors at Chernobyl in a safe and expeditious manner. It calls upon the President of the United States to continue to support the process of closing the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant. It calls upon the President to continue and enhance humanitarian, medical, social impact planning, and hospital development assistance for Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and other nations most directly affected by the Chernobyl disaster. It calls upon the President to encourage national and international health organizations to expand the scope of research into the public health effects of Chernobyl. And it recognizes April 26, 1996, as the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.  The people of the United States have a deep interest in freedom and democracy in Eastern and Central Europe, which will contribute to peace and prosperity around the world. Our efforts to assist the nations affected by the Chernobyl disaster will benefit all nations, including our own. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________
