 As you have said, this bill authorizes the President to conclude high-standard free-trade agreements, which are expected to tremendously benefit California and the Nation. It also reauthorizes the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program to provide retraining and income support for workers displaced by international trade. In 2013, more than 7,000 Californians received assistance from this program.  While I support H.R. 1314, I remain concerned that the United States must do more to help the people of Nepal recover from the earthquake and aftershocks that have devastated the country. As you know, the earthquakes have killed nearly 10,000 people, displaced more than 2.8 million others, and damaged or destroyed more than 500,000 homes. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates losses could exceed Nepal's $20 billion annual gross domestic product, which is a truly staggering figure for such a poor nation.  While the international community has rushed to provide humanitarian aid, the United States can do more to assist Nepal's long-term economic recovery.  Senator Hatch, do you agree that the United States should consider providing preferential treatment to Nepali exports to help the country recover?
