The passing from this life of legendary Pennsylvania Congressman and Defense Appropriation Chairman and Marine Colonel John P. ``Jack'' Murtha truly represents a seismic shift in this Congress and in our Nation's history. His acumen, brass-tacks style, and man-of-his-word reputation are so rare.  As the longest-serving woman in the current U.S. House, I came to know Jack Murtha well, serving with him for 28 years. In early February, he became the longest-serving member of the Pennsylvania delegation in U.S. history.  No one had his grasp of our Nation's defense or his dexterity at ushering the complicated Defense Appropriation bill, the largest in Congress, with nearly unanimous bipartisan support.  Jack put the soldier first. Each branch of the service, plus the Guard and Reserve, owe Jack great gratitude. He was indefatigable in their cause. Jack Murtha respected the awesome power of the U.S. military, but he also knew its limits.  I have never served in this Congress when Jack Murtha wasn't here. Properly, a U.S. flag flown over this Capitol has been placed on his chair in the Pennsylvania corner where he anchored his work on the floor of this House that he loved. His knowledge, leadership, measure, and tutelage remain timeless gifts to those who shared his path.  As the first Democratic woman to serve on the Defense Subcommittee of Appropriations, I can attest, it never would have happened but for his support and encouragement. For his faith in me, I shall always be in his debt as I try to emulate his acuity, his range, and his concern.  We, his subcommittee colleagues, who had the privilege of serving most closely with this giant of a man shall miss him greatly.  When my constituents ask me to describe him, here's what I try to say in his cadence: Man of the House. Marine. Chairman. Colonel. Dean. Authentic. Patriotic. Semper fi. Fearless. Keen. Optimistic. Jovial. With an unforgettable glint in his eyes. Alive. Devoted husband to Joyce, and proud and caring father and grandfather.  To his family, we send our deepest sympathy and our abiding prayers and friendship.  Son of Johnstown. Rough hewn. Battle tested. Two Purple Hearts. A Bronze Star. Not blow dried nor cosmetic. Fiercely loyal to his district and Pennsylvania. In command. Extraordinarily hard working. Kept Marine hours, rising early, arriving early. Always building others. Trusted. Never gave a word he would break. If he said, I'll talk to you about it later, the subject was closed before you knew it. Acute judge of character. Revered counselor to dozens and dozens and dozens of Members and friends. In few golden but choice words, he advised, critiqued, led.  Don't mess with him. Absolutely loved politics. A ticket maker and analyzer. Lots of real friends. Some really cruel enemies. Always had a good word. An author. Well-traveled, too, often to war zones. Visited the wounded and bore that pain close to his heart.  New ideas and insights captivated him. Razor sharp mind. Don't tangle with him unless you know your subject. Memory that could recall votes 10 years ago, and who voted which way. Master of the rules. Wielded the gavel with authority and certitude. Attentive to the floor at all times, even when you thought he wasn't paying attention. Possessed all the attributes to be Speaker, except he came from the working class of people and didn't hail from a financial or government enclave.  Madam Speaker, he instinctively knew how to build a majority. He had lived war, and his heart was always with the soldier.  A giant tree has fallen in the forest. A lion is now at rest. How fortunate we are to cherish his friendship and service. America's defense is the best in the world because Chairman Jack Murtha lived to leave that legacy.  The passing from this life of legendary Pennsylvania Congressman and Defense Appropriations Chairman and Marine Colonel John P. ``Jack'' Murtha truly represents a seismic shift in our Nation's history. His acumen, brass-tacks style and man-of-his-word reputation are so rare.  As the longest-serving woman in the current U.S. House of Representatives, I came to know Jack Murtha well, serving with him 28 years. In early February he became the longest-serving Congressman in Pennsylvania history. He took it upon himself to guide young Members of Congress, particularly if their districts mimicked the hardscrabble nature of his own.  As representative of the Ninth Congressional District of Ohio, which extends along the Lake Erie shoreline from Toledo almost toCleveland, I had invited Jack to our job-challenged region many times. In fact, he was scheduled to open the national rifle matches at Camp Perry this spring.  Jack Murtha was legendary. He never forgot where he came from. He tirelessly served his district and his constituents. He grew to serve our Nation and his reach was global. No one had his grasp of our Nation's defense or his dexterity at ushering the complicated defense appropriations bill, the largest in Congress, with nearly unanimous bipartisan support.  Jack put the soldier first. His unheralded visits to military hospitals to visit the sick and wounded were not designed as photo ops but as heartfelt expressions of appreciation for those who served on the front lines and sacrificed for us. Every soldier knew he understood.  Each branch of the service, plus the Reserve and National Guard, owes Jack Murtha a debt of gratitude. He was indefatigable in their cause. In Toledo, our 180th F-16 Fighter Wing is genuinely the best in the world. Why? Because Jack Murtha helped to build its capability. I daresay he attended to all 435 congressional districts with the same diligence.  Our Guard and Reserve units were modernized with improved pay and benefits because he knew their importance: he advised America cannot conduct successful operations without them. America's blood supply is more robust and deliverable because he fought for it. New weapons, materiel, and technologies are underway in every service branch because Jack knew that some generals tend to fight the last war, so he purposely worked in the future.  Jack Murtha respected the awesome power of the U.S. military, but he also knew its limits.  I have never served in Congress when Jack Murtha wasn't here. Properly, a U.S. flag has been placed on his chair in the ``Pennsylvania Corner,'' where he anchored his work on the floor of the House of Representatives and will remain unoccupied by those who held him in esteem. His knowledge, leadership, measure, and tutelage remain timeless gifts to those who shared his path.  As the first Democratic woman to serve on the defense subcommittee of Appropriations, I can attest it would never have happened but for his support and encouragement.

A Bronze Star. Not blow dried nor cosmetic. Fiercely loyal to his district and Pennsylvania. In command. Extraordinarily hard working. Kept Marine hours, rising early, arriving early. Always building others. Trusted. Never gave a word he would break. If he said, I'll talk to you about it later, the subject was closed before you knew it. Acute judge of character. Revered counselor to dozens and dozens of Members and friends. In few golden but choice words, he advised, critiqued, led. Defended his subcommittee's prerogatives.  Don't mess with him. Absolutely loved politics. A ticket maker and analyzer. Lots of real friends. Some really cruel enemies. Always had a good word. Liked bright colors on others. Extraordinarily gifted. Well read. An author. Well traveled too, often to war zones. Visited the wounded and bore that pain close to his heart.  Quite curious. New ideas and insights captivated him. Capable of independent views. Razor sharp mind. Don't tangle with him unless you know your subject. Memory that could recall votes from 10 years ago, and who voted which way. Master of the Rules. Wielded the gavel with authority and certitude. Attentive to the Floor at all times even when you thought he wasn't paying attention. A coach. Possessed all the attributes to be Speaker, except he came from the working class of people and didn't hail from a financial or government enclave.  Not a trust fund baby nor into the cocktail circuit. Self made. Fair. Precise. Garrulous. Politically savvy. Strong, Unflinching. Always humorous, throwing his head back with a sincere laugh, and ``is that so?'' A brusque manner that didn't suffer fools gladly. Regularly reached across the aisle. Consistently passed his bills with nearly unanimous support. He instinctively knew how to build a majority.  Lived war. Heart always with the soldier. Loyal disciple of Speaker Tip O'Neill and the common man. Soul buddies with twinkles in their eyes. Cussing occasionally. But a good word always. A giant tree has fallen in the forest. A lion is now at rest. How fortunate are we who cherish his friendship and service. We loved him and will deeply miss him. America's defense is the best in the world because Chairman Jack Murtha lived to leave that legacy.                          ____________________
