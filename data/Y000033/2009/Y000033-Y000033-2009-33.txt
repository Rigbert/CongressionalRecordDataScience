Today, it is my great privilege to welcome Rev. Mark Campbell to the House of Representatives. Rev. Campbell and his wife, Shelley, are active duty in the United States Air Force, ministering to our brave men and women in uniform.  Rev. Campbell is currently the chaplain for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Office of Military Community and Family Policy. He works as a consultant on religious affairs, reviews policy guidance, and facilitates support for chaplain and family support assistance programs at the State level.  Prior to serving as a chaplain in the Air Force, Rev. Campbell pastored the College Gate Baptist Church in Anchorage, Alaska. Since entering the active duty Air Force, Rev. Campbell has served at bases around the world. He is a shining example for those of us instructed to ``go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.''  I thank Rev. Campbell for his prayers today and being here today to lead the invocation.                          ____________________
