I am glad he made reference to the memorial service yesterday for Officers Gibson and Chestnut, because it is a sad reminder of the important responsibility that the Capitol Police have undertaken on behalf not only those of us who are privileged to work in this building but the thousands and thousands of visitors who come here for the thrill of a lifetime to see this seat of democracy. Those two men gave their lives in service to our country. We should be reminded at all times that all the members of the Capitol Police Force are prepared to do the same.  There is no stronger advocate for the Capitol Police than Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. He speaks to me annually when this issue comes up to make certain we have not overlooked any element in terms of modernizing and professionalizing the Capitol Police. He is simply their strongest voice on the Senate floor.  I might also add that a close second is Senator Wellstone of Minnesota, who has a close, personal friendship with so many of the members of the Capitol Police. He comes to me regularly with observations that really come from the heart. I thank him for his inspiration as well.  I think this bill meets the needs of the Capitol Police. And as long as I am in this position or in any capacity, I will continue to strive for that goal.  I believe pending before us now is the amendment relative to the account for mailing of town meeting notices, which Senator Specter of Pennsylvania has asked us to include.  I yield the floor.
