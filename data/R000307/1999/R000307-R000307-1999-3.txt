What an acronym. We have all heard of Peter and the dike. This is Susan at the dam, the HCFA dam. In fact, we could probably turn that around in regard to what is happening.  I want to ask a question. Do you mean this new interim payment system--and we will go through this in some detail. I want folks to remember interim payment system, IPS. That is the acronym. Everything has to be an acronym in Washington. I don't call it IPS. I call it the ``IPS mess''. It not only rewards but actually penalizes the home health care agencies for their past, not bad behavior but good behavior; is that right?
