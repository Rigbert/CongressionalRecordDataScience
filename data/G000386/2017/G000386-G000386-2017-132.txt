 President, we are now well on our way to confirming Judge Gorsuch as the next Justice of the Supreme Court. I have a few things to say about the way we have gotten here.  Earlier today, the other side--meaning the Democrats--made a very unprecedented break with Senate history and with Senate tradition. They launched the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in our Nation's history. For our part, we Republicans insisted that we follow the practice of the Senate. We don't engage in partisan filibusters of Supreme Court nominees.  Yesterday, I came to the floor to speak about the path that brought us to this point. As I discussed, way back in 2001, the current minority leader and some of his allies on the far left hatched a plan to, in their words, ``change the ground rules'' with regard to lower court nominees. I noted a New York Times article describing the Democratic senatorial caucus retreat, where the new approach to nominees was discussed; in other words, where they discussed the strategy for changing the ground rules of how judges are considered by the United States Senate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the May 1, 2001, New York Times article entitled ``Washington talk; Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight,'' and the April 5, 2017, story from the Washington Examiner entitled ``The Gorsuch Plagiarism Story is Bogus.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 2001]         Washington Talk; Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight                           (By Neil A. Lewis)       President Bush has yet to make his first nominee to a      federal court and no one knows whether anyone will retire      from the Supreme Court this summer, an event that would lead      to a high-stakes confirmation battle.       Nonetheless, the Senate's Democrats and Republicans are      already engaged in close-quarters combat over how to deal      with the eventual nominees from the Bush White House.      Democrats in particular are trying to show some muscle as      they insist that they will not simply stand aside and confirm      any nominees they deem right-wing ideologues.       ``What we're trying to do is set the stage and make sure      that both the White House and the Senate Republicans know      that we expect to have significant input in the process,''      Senator Charles E. Schumer, New York's senior Democrat, said      in an interview. ``We're simply not going to roll over.''       Forty-two of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private      retreat this weekend in Farmington, Pa., where a principal      topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the      White House on judicial nominees.       The senators listened to a panel composed of Prof. Laurence      H. Tribe of Harvard Law School, Prof. Cass M. Sunstein of the      University of Chicago Law School and Marcia R. Greenberger,      the co-director of the National Women's Law Center, on the      need to scrutinize judicial nominees more closely than ever.      The panelists argued, said some people who were present, that      the nation's courts were at a historic juncture because, they      said, a band of conservative lawyers around Mr. Bush was      planning to pack the courts with staunch conservatives.       ``They said it was important for the Senate to change the      ground rules and there was no obligation to confirm someone      just because they are scholarly or erudite,'' a person who      attended said.       Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,      then exhorted his colleagues behind closed doors on Saturday      morning to refrain from providing snap endorsements of any      Bush nominee. One senior Democratic Senate staff aide who      spoke on the condition of anonymity said that was because      some people still remembered with annoyance the fact that two      Democratic senators offered early words of praise for the      nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be attorney general.       Senators Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey and Joseph R.      Biden Jr. of Delaware initially praised the Ashcroft      selection, impeding the early campaign against the      nomination. Both eventually acceded to pressure and voted      against the nomination.       The current partisan battle is over a parliamentary custom      that Republicans are considering changing, which governs      whether a senator may block or delay a nominee from his home      state. Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee      have not resolved their dispute over the ``blue-slip policy''      that allows senators to block a nominee by filing a blue slip      with the committee.       On Friday, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking      Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and Mr. Schumer sent a      letter to the White House signed by all committee Democrats      insisting on a greater role in selecting judges, especially      given that the Senate is divided 50-50 and that the      Republicans are the majority only because Vice President Dick      Cheney is able to break any tie.       Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader,      told reporters today that he believed ``some consideration      will be given to Democratic input, but I don't think they      should expect to name judges from their state.''       Mr. Lott said he expected that Democrats might slow the      process but, in the end, would not block any significant      number of nominees.       Behind all the small-bore politics is the sweeping issue of      the direction of the federal courts, especially the 13      circuit courts that increasingly have the final word on some      of the most contentious social issues. How the federal bench      is shaped in the next four or eight years, scholars say,      could have a profound effect on issues like affirmative      action, abortion rights and the lengths to which the      government may go in aiding parochial schools.       Mr. Bush is expected to announce his first batch of      judicial nominees in the next several days, and it is likely      to include several staunch conservatives as well as some      women and members of minorities, administration officials      have said. Among those Mr. Bush may put forward to important      federal appeals court positions are such conservatives as      Jeffrey S. Sutton, Peter D. Keisler, Representative      Christopher Cox of California and Miguel Estrada.       The first group of nominees, which may number more than two      dozen, is part of an effort to fill the 94 vacancies on the      federal bench while the Republicans still control the Senate.       But it remains unclear if there will be a Supreme Court      vacancy at the end of the court's term in July. Speculation      on possible retirements has focused on Chief Justice William      H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul      Stevens. But in recent days, associates of Justice O'Connor      have signaled that she wants it known that she will not      retire after this term.                                  ____              [From the Washington Examiner, Apr. 5, 2017]                 That Gorsuch Plagiarism Story Is Bogus                          (By T. Becket Adams)       Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch is not a plagiarist,      according to the woman from whom he has been accused of      lifting materials.       ``I have reviewed both passages and do not see an issue      here; even though the language is similar. These passages are      factual, not analytical in nature, ``Abigail Lawlis Kuzma,      who serves as chief counsel to the Consumer Protection      Division of the Indiana Attorney General's office, said in a      statement made available to the Washington Examiner.       Her remarks came soon after two reports alleged Tuesday      evening that President Trump's Supreme Court nominee had      ``copied' passages in his 2006 book, ``The Future of Assisted      Suicide and Euthanasia.'' The reports alleged he also lifted      material for an academic article published in 2000.       The charge, which involves Gorsuch repeating medical terms      and not original concepts or ideas, is weak, at best.       ``[The similar] passage are factual, not analytical in      nature, framing both the technical legal and medical      circumstances of the `Baby/Infant Doe' case that occurred in      1982,'' Kuzma explained. ``Given that these passages both      describe the basic facts of the case, it would have been      awkward and difficult for Judge Gorsuch to have used      different language.''       BuzzFeed was first to report on the similarities between      Gorsuch and Kuzma. It published a story Tuesday headlined,      ``A Short Section in Neil Gorsuch's 2006 Book Appears To Be      Copied From A Law Review Article.       Politico followed suit publishing a story titled,      ``Gorsuch's writings borrow from other authors.''       Other newsrooms, including the Huffington Post, Business      Insider and New York magazine, moved quickly to repeat the      charges against Gorsuch.       Politico bolstered its charge with quotes from multiple      academic experts, including Syracuse University's Rebecca      Moore Howard, who, interestingly enough, is quite open about      supporting former President Barack Obama.       However, several professors who worked closely with Gorsuch      during the period in which he produced much of the work in      question said the hints and allegations against the judge are      nonsense.       ``[I]n my opinion, none of the allegations has any      substance or justification,'' Oxford University's John Finnis      said in a statement made available to the Examiner. ``In all      four cases, Neil Gorsuch's writing and citing was easily and      well within the proper and accepted standards of scholarly      research and writing in the field of study in which he was      working.''       Georgetown University's John Keown, who reviewed Gorsuch's      dissertation, said elsewhere in a statement: ``The allegation      is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its      citation of primary sources. The allegation that the book is      guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary      sources which draw on those same primary sources is, frankly,      absurd.       Indeed, the book's reliance on primary rather than      secondary sources is one of its many strengths.''       Further, actual attorneys disagree that Gorsuch plagiarized      anything.       ``People unfamiliar with legal writing, or even writing,      may be unfamiliar with how citations work,'' Attorney Thomas      Crown explained Wednesday.'' When I cite to a case or      statute, if I am quoting verbatim, I give a direct quotation,      with apostrophes and everything, and then the source. If I am      summarizing, sometimes even using the same words, I follow      with the direct citation. The Bluebook, which is the legal      style Bible, is for law reviews and some appellate and trial      courts, and has more specific rules.       ``I mention this because this is standard across numerous      fields, not just law, and only illiterates . . . are      shocked,'' he added. ``Different field with different      standards and forms; but even most academics believe that a      good synopsis with citation isn't plagiarism.''       In conclusion, he wrote, ``I don't want to ruin a perfectly      good five-minute hate, but this isn't even close to      plagiarism.''
