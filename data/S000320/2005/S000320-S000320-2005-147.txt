 President, I take a minute and commend the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, for his leadership and for reaching out to the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Domenici, and Senator Mikulski and Senator Talent, and so many others. This is a bipartisan approach. Senator Pryor is the leader.  Nobody likes gouging. Gasoline is too high. We want the markets to work. If market forces work, there won't be gouging. It will be an orderly movement of supply and demand--if the demand is too high, the prices will go up, but not like that, not like I have seen it at the pump, as we have seen coast to coast.  The American people fear there is gouging going on. Senator Pryor should be commended for pursuing this issue. We hope the Federal Trade Commission will do its work. I support the amendment.
