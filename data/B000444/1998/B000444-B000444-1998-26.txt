 President, I rise today to express my deep concern about our country's ability to lead at this crucial moment for the international economy.  Yesterday, the House of Representatives refused to provide the resources that the International Monetary Fund needs to deal with the most serious international financial crisis in years. What makes this failure even more inexcusable is that our participation in a stronger IMF would not cost American taxpayers a dime.  As the President reminded us earlier this week, this is a time when we alone--with the most important economy in the world--are in a position to lead. And two days ago, Treasury Secretary Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told us just how dangerous the current situation really is.  At this critical juncture, those who weaken our standing in key international financial institutions are playing a reckless game. By failing to provide the $14.5 billion U.S. ``quota'' increase--our share in an expanded capital reserve for the IMF--the House has increased the threat to our economy from the current international financial turmoil.  This is just the kind of situation that can get out of control if no one steps in to steer a course through these troubled times. Right now, the Europeans are turned inward, concerned with the next stage in their economic integration--the introduction of a common currency that puts strict limits on its members' budget and interest rate policies.  Japan remains in the grip of a political paralysis that has allowed its financial problems--centered in a banking system that is crumbling from the weight of bad loans--to fester for almost a decade.  The Tigers of the Asian financial miracle have been declawed, and with their collapse the world has lost a major engine for growth.  And our increasingly important trading partners in Latin America are catching their own version of the Asian flu. They face the threat of a chain of devaluations, budget crunches, and slower growth.  Quite literally, Mr. President, we are in a world of hurt.  The robust American economy of recent years--with strong job growth, rising incomes, healthy profits, high levels of investment in new technologies--has been the wonder and the envy of the rest of the world. And the fundamentals here, as Treasury Secretary Rubin and Fed Chairman Greenspan have stressed, remain strong.  But in recent weeks, we have watched as wild swings in our stock market reveal profound anxiety and uncertainty about the effects of international events on our own country.  Those international events have their ultimate origins in the particular circumstances of many different nations as they have entered today's global economy. But they have common threads--chief among them, a trend in those emerging economies toward excessive borrowing from other countries, debt denominated in dollars and other strong currencies. A lot of this international cash flowed into economies whose banking systems lacked fundamental rules for safety, soundness, and just plain honest bookkeeping.  As those debt burdens reached unsustainable levels for many important emerging economies, investors were convinced that assets they held in the currencies of those countries were no longer as valuable, and that those countries were no longer in a position to prop up their currencies with shrinking reserves of hard currencies. Once that idea took hold, the flight from those currencies was as swift as it was inevitable.  As the agonizing reappraisal of international lending grew to encompass other emerging economies, the currencies of countries as widely dispersed--and as different--as Russia, Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina have come under increasing pressure. In the case of Russia, that pressure has resulted in the virtual collapse of the ruble and the evaporation of the nascent Russian stock market.  What does this all have to do with us, Mr. President? A lot.  First, as these emerging markets lose steam, they buy fewer finished goods from us and from other advanced economies, taking a bite out of our export sector, a major component of our recent growth. Facing shrinking markets and low-cost competition from the weakened emerging economies, American firms will no longer enjoy the kind of corporate earnings--or the kind of stock prices--that until just recently lifted Wall Street indexes into the stratosphere.  Without those profits and those stock values, our companies will not be able to sustain the level of investment that has been a cornerstone of our recent booming economy. Ultimately, this must lead to lower job growth and thinner pay checks. And the decline in our stock market will affect many individual investors' willingness to continue the level of spending that has been the real backbone of our economy.  Another key feature of this global slump is depressed prices for basic commodities like grain and oil. There is no need for me to remind my colleagues here that our farmers now face a serious crisis because of the loss of important export markets. I know I hear from my poultry farmers in Delaware, for whom Russia is a key export market, about their concerns.  The latest numbers show that our trade deficit soared by more than 20 percent in the second quarter of this year, and its gives every sign of getting worse before it gets better. Some projections show our exports declining in ways we haven't seen in more than a decade, while we continue to pull in cheap imports from the weakened economies around the world.  We are in the middle of a major global economic transformation, Mr. President, and there is much we don't know about the workings of the evolving system of increased trade and increased international investment. But we can see from here that international financial problems--particularly foreign exchange crises--have a strong potential to spread, and that our economy, for all its fundamental strengths, will be hurt more the longer those problems persist.  As we survey the wreckage from this global crisis, and consider the very real potential for deeper trouble, we cannot hesitate to use every tool at our disposal to restore confidence to financial markets. The International Monetary Fund is the institution that we created, along with the other major economies, at the end of World War II to inject a measure of stability into the management of international currency markets.  Time and events have overtaken the problems for which the IMF was originally created. And while there are important and useful reforms of the IMF included in both House and Senate legislation this session, I am concerned that we are demanding too much of the IMF--expanding its responsibilities instead of focusing its energies where they can do the most good--and too little from such forums as the G-7 and others where the major economies of the world should be seeking a sense of common concern and a coordinated response.  But that is a topic for another day, Mr. President.  Today, we need look no farther than today's front page to see that the need for an international lender of last resort is essential to the stability of today's financial markets. Only such a lender can step in to keep a country from complete financial and political meltdown when private investment retreats. Only such a lender can work to limit the contagion of a currency collapse to more and more countries.  But the vastly increased size of international financial markets now dwarfs the resources of the IMF relative to the problems it confronts.  Last year, even before the meltdown in Asia, the IMF--with our agreement--concluded that the size and repercussions of foreign exchange crises in today's world justify an increase in the basic reserves of the IMF, the ``quota'' paid in by each of its 182 members. And we have also agreed, with the other senior members of the IMF, to make available a larger emergency fund, the New Arrangements to Borrow, for use when the quota funds get too low.  Today, with the funds already committed to Asia and Russia, the IMF's resources are now dangerously low--so low that they call into question its ability to meet the next major run on an emerging economy's currency. So the rest of the world is looking to us to take the lead in providing those resources to the IMF. Our share of the quota increase would be $14.5 billion;our share of the New Arrangements to Borrow would be $3.5 billion.  But while we must go through the appropriations process to make those funds available to the IMF, we get in return an interest bearing asset, so the overall budget effect is a wash. Let me repeat that--there is no budget outlay involved when we meet our commitment to increase the capacity of the IMF to meet international financial crises.  And yet, Mr. President, we face the very real threat that the United States will simply flub this chance to maintain its leadership. With the failure of the House to act on the quota, providing only the $3.5 billion for the New Arrangements to borrow, we leave the rest of the world to wonder about our commitment to deal with the very serious problems that afflict our global economy.  Here in the Senate, we have been fortunate to have the benefit of real leadership on the issue of IMF funding. Senator Stevens has made use of two opportunities to put the Senate on record in support of full funding for our participation in the IMF. My colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Hagel and Senator Sarbanes, have lent their considerable energies and reputations to this effort.  There are few opportunities left in this session for us to put this right, Mr. President. The Congress is already seen by the rest of the world as reluctant to take an easy--and, I repeat, costless--step to increase the resources of the one institution we have that is in a position to intervene in this crisis. This can only add to the uncertainty that is at the bottom of the current market unrest.  Mr. President, there is every indication that we have a long, hard road between us and the end of the current financial turmoil. I hope that in the few weeks remaining to us this session we will take this one small step to start that journey.                          ____________________
