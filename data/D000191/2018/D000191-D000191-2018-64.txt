Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, there is a problem here, and the problem actually is the Department of Transportation. They launched a new carrier monitoring system known as CSA to make data available, but they have yet to establish a test and apply that data.  So even though the data is available, the Republicans have adopted amendments--other Republicans who are here today--that prohibit DOT from finalizing a safety fitness determination rule. So there is data out there, but there is no bright line test.  The best relief that we could provide would be to force DOT, in the very near future, to issue a safety fitness ruling as soon as possible and also raise the minimum insurance requirement--$750,000, it has been that since 1980. It doesn't cover much in a truck accident.  We want to have people be able to get legal recourse and compensation, but we also don't want to give the brokers an impossible task, which is what they have now: How do they choose someone who meets the safety fitness requirements that the administration has yet to promulgate and Congress is preventing them from promulgating?  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).
