 Brownback, Mr. Obama, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relation:                              S. Res. 383       Whereas, the April 8, 2004, N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement,      calling for an end to hostilities in Darfur, Sudan, has been      flagrantly violated by all parties to the agreement;       Whereas the Government of Sudan continues to commit crimes      against humanity and engage in genocidal acts in Darfur;       Whereas the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement      between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's      Liberation Movement/Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLM/     SPLA) on January 9, 2005, has not resulted in an improvement      of the security situation in Darfur;       Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has      indicated that, ``People in many parts of Darfur continue to      be killed, raped, and driven from their homes by the      thousands.'';       Whereas United Nations officials have stated that at least      70,000 people have died due to violence and insecurity in      Darfur, but that the total may be as high as 400,000 people;       Whereas nearly 2,000,000 people have been internally      displaced, 3,000,000 people are dependant on international      assistance to survive, and over 200,000 people are refugees      in neighboring Chad due to the conflict in Darfur;       Whereas escalating tensions along the border between Chad      and Sudan have increased instability in Darfur;       Whereas neither the mandate nor the troop strength of the      African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) is adequate to protect      civilians in Darfur;       Whereas the United States has demonstrated leadership on      the Sudan issue by having United States Permanent      Representative to the United Nations John Bolton, in his      first action as President of the United Nations Security      Council, request in February 2006 that Secretary-General      Annan initiate contingency planning for a transition from      AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping operation;       Whereas, although the United Nations Security Council has      concurred with this recommendation and taken steps toward      establishing a United Nations peacekeeping mission for      Darfur, it could take up to a year for such a mission to      deploy fully;       Whereas, as the deteriorating security situation in Darfur      indicates, the people of Darfur cannot wait that long for      security to be reestablished;       Whereas the international community currently has no plan      to address the immediate security needs of the people of      Darfur; and       Whereas all members of the international community must      participate in efforts to stop genocide, war crimes, and      crimes against humanity in Darfur:       Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) strongly condemns--       (A) the continued attacks on civilians in Darfur by the      Government of Sudan and Government-sponsored militias; and       (B) the continued violations of the N'Djamena Ceasefire      Agreement by the Government of Sudan and rebels in Darfur,      particularly the Sudan Liberation Army;       (2) commends the Africa Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) for      its actions in monitoring the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement      in Darfur and its role in diminishing some acts of violence;       (3) calls upon all parties to the N'Djamena Ceasefire      Agreement--       (A) to abide by the terms of the N'Djamena Ceasefire      Agreement; and       (B) to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the      conflict in Darfur;       (4) calls upon the Government of Sudan immediately--       (A) to withdraw all military aircraft from the region;       (B) to cease all support for the Janjaweed militia and      rebels from Chad; and       (C) to disarm the Janjaweed;       (5) calls on the African Union to request assistance from      the United Nations and NATO to strengthen its capacity to      deter violence and instability until a United Nations      peacekeeping force is fully deployed in Darfur;       (6) calls upon the United Nations Security Council to      approve as soon as possible, pursuant to Chapter VII of the      Charter of the United Nations, a peacekeeping force for      Darfur that is well trained and equipped and has an adequate      troop strength;       (7) urges the President to take steps immediately to help      improve the security situation in Darfur, including by--       (A) proposing that NATO--       (i) consider how to implement and enforce a declared no-fly      zone in Darfur; and       (ii) deploy troops to Darfur to support the African Union      Mission in Sudan (AMIS) until a United Nations peacekeeping      mission is fully deployed in the region; and       (B) requesting supplemental funding to support a NATO      mission in Darfur and the African Union Mission in Sudan      (AMIS);       (8) calls upon NATO allies, led by the United States, to      support such a mission; and       (9) calls upon NATO headquarters staff to begin prudent      planning in advance of such a mission.
