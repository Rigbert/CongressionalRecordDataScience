Mr. Speaker, today, the introduction of the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act will, for the first time in nearly a century of U.S. administration, provide a congressionally recognized framework for the inhabitants of Puerto Rico to freely express their wishes regarding the options for full self-government. I want to acknowledge the insightful leadership of Speaker Newt Gingrich in working with the committee to formulate a process to advance the United States-Puerto Rico relationship toward a conclusive one of full self-government. A number of Members have been supportive and instrumental in the development of the legislation, including Elton Gallegly, chairman of the Subcommittee on Native American and Insular Affairs of the Committee on Resources, Ben Gilman, chairman of the Committee on International Relations, and Dan Burton, chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere who cochaired with Mr. Gallegly the October 17, 1995, joint hearing on the 1993 Puerto Rico status plebiscite. There also has been substantial input from Members on the other side of the aisle.  This matter of tremendous importance to the United States and the nearly 4 million United States citizens in Puerto Rico can only be resolved by adhering to constitutionally and internationally based principles and standards for full self-government. While many may misconstrue this legislation to be designed to benefit one local Puerto Rico political party over another, it is, in fact, a serious bipartisan effort to enact into law a pragmatic process with the long-term objective of resolving the Puerto Rico status dilemma. The legislation divides the process into three manageable stages which follow historical precedent set by the Congress in providing for final political statuses of territories and trust territories during this century.  The first step in the process is the initial decision stage in which voters are asked which fundamental relationship they prefer with the United States--one of separate sovereignty leading to independence or free association or under United States sovereignty leading to statehood.  The second and final steps are the transition and implementation stages which follow the historical patterns of enabling and admission acts for territories becoming States and similar measures for insular areas becoming separate sovereigns.  If this self-determination process does not result in voter approval of one of the rcognized options for full self-government, then by democratic choice of the voters--instead of by Federal mandate--the status quo will continue and Puerto Rico will remain a locally self-governing unincorporated territory under congressional administration.  Under the U.S. Constitution and applicable principles of international law, the three recognized options for full self-government are independence, separate sovereignty in free association with the United States, and full integration into the United States leading to statehood. In order for Congress to determine how to respond to the aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico regarding a permanent, future political status in a manner which promotes and preserves the U.S. long-term national interest, we need to address the status question based on clearly defined principles and standards. This is precisely what the bill does.  Locally conducted plebiscites have been inconclusive, and were unduly influenced by vested interests exploiting the status quo. It is time for the U.S. Congress to meet its responsibility under the Constitution to provide for a self-determination procedure in which the U.S. national interest in resolving the status issue is taken into account, rather than allowing the issue to be dominated by local political rivalries and interference from those who thrive opportunistically on the present territorial status. The United States also has a right of self-determination and this process requires action by both the United States and Puerto Rico in order to advance toward a full self-government relationship.  After 400 years of colonial rule by Spain ended in 1898, it should not have taken another 100 years of American administration for the U.S. Congress to define the options for full and permanent self-government. The United States-Puerto Rico Status Act permits full self-government to be realized in Puerto Rico in definitive steps, with a smooth transition to whatever form of full self-government the people choose: independence, separate sovereignty in free association with the United States, or statehood.  There is an important event which took place recently which is relevant to the introduction of this legislation. On February 29, 1996, I joined three other House committee and subcommittee chairmen from the Committees on Resources and International Relations in responding to Concurrent Resolution 62 of the Puerto Rico Legislature.  In the Concurrent Resolution the legislature asks the 104th Congress to respond to the results of the November 14, 1993, status plebiscite in Puerto Rico, wherein the Commonwealth ballot proposition received a plurality of 48.6 percent votes cast, and to indicate the next steps in resolving Puerto Rico's political status. After extensive research, oversight, and a joint hearing, a substantial record was developed enabling a concise response to Concurrent Resolution 62.  Following is the text of the response to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of the Puerto Rico Legislature:                                         House of Representatives,                                       Committee on Resources,                                Washington, DC, February 29, 1996.     Hon. Roberto Rexach-Benitez,     President of the Senate.     Hon. Zaida Hernandez-Torres,     Speaker of the House of Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, San          Juan, Puerto Rico.       Dear Mr. Rexach-Benitez and Ms. Hernandez-Torres: The      Committee on Resources and the Committee on International      Relations are working cooperatively to establish an official      record which we believe will enable to House to address the      subject-matter of Concurrent Resolution 62, adopted by the      Legislature of Puerto Rico on December 14, 1994. While the      specific measures addressing Puerto Rico's status which the      104th Congress will consider are still being developed, we      believe the history of the self-determination process in      Puerto Rico, as well as the record of the Joint Hearing      conducted on October 17, 1995 by the Subcommittee on Native      American and Insular Affairs and the Subcommittee on Western      Hemisphere, lead to the following conclusions with respect to      the plebiscite conducted in Pertro Rico on November 14, 1993:       1. The plebiscite was conducted under local law by local      authorities, and the voting process appears to have been      orderly and consistent with recognized standards for lawful      and democratic elections. This locally organized self-     determination process was undertaken within the authority of      the constitutional government of Puerto Rico, and is      consistent with the right of the people of Puerto Rico freely      to express their wishes regarding their political status and      the form of government under which they live. The United      States recognizes the right of the people of Puerto Rico to      self-determination, including the right to approve any      permanent political status which will be established upon      termination of the current unincorporated territory status.      Congress will take cognizance of the 1993 plebiscite results      in determining future Federal policy toward Puerto Rico.       2. The content of each of the three status options on the      ballot was determined by the three major political parties in      Puerto Rico identified with those options, respectively. The      U.S. Congress did not adopt a formal position as to the      feasibility of any of the options prior to presentation to      the voters. Consequently, the results of the vote      necessarily must be viewed as a an expression of the      preferences of those who voted as between the proposals      and advocacy of the three major political parties for the      status option espoused by each such party.       3. None of the status options presented on the ballot      received a majority of the votes cast. While the commonwealth      option on the ballot received a plurality of votes, this      result is difficult to interpret because that option      contained proposals to profoundly change rather than continue      the current Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government structure.      Certain elements of the commonwealth option, including      permanent union with the United States and guaranteed U.S.      citizenship, can only be achieved through full integration      into the U.S. leading to statehood. Other elements of the      commonwealth option on the ballot, including a government-to-     government bilateral pact which cannot be altered, either are      not possible or could only be partially accomplished through      treaty arrangements based on separate sovereignty. While the      statehood and independence options are more clearly defined,      neither of these options can be fully understood on the      merits, unless viewed in the context of clear Congressional      policy regarding the terms under which either option could be      implemented if approved in a future plebiscite recognized by      the federal government. Thus, there is a need for Congress to      define the real options for change and the true legal and      political nature of the status quo, so that the people can      know what the actual choices will be in the future.       4. Although there is a history of confusion and ambiguity      on the part of some in the U.S. and Puerto Rico regarding the      legal and political nature of the current ``commonwealth''      local government structure and territorial status, it is      incontrovertible that     Puerto Rico's present status is that of an unincorporated      territory subject in all respects to the authority of the      United States Congress under the Territorial Clause of the      U.S. Constitution. As such, the current status does not      provide guaranteed permanent union or guaranteed citizenship      to the inhabitants of the territory of Puerto Rico, nor does      the current status provide the basis for recognition of a      separate Puerto Rican sovereignty or a binding government-to-     government status pact.       5. In light of the foregoing, the results the November 14,      1993 vote indicates that it is the preference of those who      cast ballots to change the present impermanent status in      favor of a permanent political status based on full self-     government. The only options for a permanent and fully self-     governing status are: (1) separate sovereignty and full      national independence, (2) separate sovereignty in free      association with the United States; (3) full integration into      the United States political system ending unincorporated      territory status and leading to statehood.       6. Because each ballot option in the 1993 plebiscite      addressed citizenship, we want to clarify this issue. First,      under separate sovereignty Puerto Ricans will have their own      nationality and citizenship. The U.S. political status,      nationality, and citizenship provided by Congress under      statutes implementing the Treaty of Paris during the      unincorporated territory period will be replaced by the new      Puerto Rican nationhood and citizenship status that comes      with separate sovereignty. To prevent hardship or unfairness      in individual cases, the U.S. Congress may determine the      requirements for eligible persons to continue U.S.      nationality and citizenship, or be naturalized, and this will      be governed by U.S. law, not Puerto Rican law. If the voters      freely choose separate sovereignty, only those born in Puerto      Rico who have acquired U.S. citizenship on some other legal      basis outside the scope of the Treaty of Paris citizenship      statutes enacted by Congress during the territorial period      will not be affected. Thus, the automatic combined Puerto      Rican and U.S. citizenship described under the definition of      independence on the 1993 plebiscite ballot was a proposal      which is misleading and inconsistent with the fundamental      principles of separate nationality and non-interference by      two sovereign countries in each other's internal affairs,      which includes regulation of citizenship. Under statehood,      guaranteed equal U.S. citizenship status will become a      permanent right. Under the present Commonwealth of Puerto      Rico government structure, the current limited U.S.      citizenship status and rights will be continued under Federal      law enacted under the Territorial Clause and the Treaty of      Paris, protected to the extent of partial application of the      U.S. Constitution during the period in which Puerto Rico      remains an unincorporated territory.       7. The alternative to full integration into the United      States or a status based on separate sovereignty is      continuation of the current unincorporated territory status.      In that event, the present status quo, including the      Commonwealth of Puerto Rico structure for local self-     government, presumably could continue for some period of      time, until Congress in its discretion otherwise determines      the permanent disposition of the territory of Puerto Rico and      the status of its inhabitants through the exercise of its      authority under the Territorial Clause and the provisions of      the Treaty of Paris. Congress may consider proposals      regarding changes in the current local government structure,      including those set forth in the ``Definition of      Commonwealth'' on the 1993 plebiscite ballot. However, in our      view serious consideration of proposals for equal treatment      for residents of Puerto Rico under Federal programs will not      be provided unless there is an end to certain exemptions from      federal tax laws and other non-taxation in Puerto Rico, so      that individuals and corporations in Puerto Rico have the      same responsibilities and obligations in this regard as the      states. Since the ``commonwealth'' option on the 1993      plebiscite ballot called for ``fiscal autonomy,'' which is      understood to mean, among other things, continuation of the      current exemptions from federal taxation for the territory,      this constitutes another major political, legal and economic      obstacle to implementing the changes in Federal law and      policy required to fulfill the terms of the ``Definition      of Commonwealth.''       8. In addition, it is important to recognize that the      existing Commonwealth of Puerto Rico structure for local      self-government, and any other measures which Congress may      approve while Puerto Rico remains an unincorporated      territory, are not unalterable in a sense that is      constitutionally binding upon a future Congress. Any      provision, agreement or pact to the contrary is legally      unenforceable. Thus, the current Federal laws and policies      applicable to Puerto Rico are not unalterable, nor can they      be made unalterable, and the current status of the      inhabitants is not irrevocable, as proposed under the      ``commonwealth'' option on the 1993 plebiscite ballot.      Congress will continue to respect the principle of self-     determination in its exercise of Territorial Clause powers,      but that authority must be exercised within the framework of      the U.S. Constitution and in a manner deemed by Congress to      best serve the U.S. national interest. In our view, promoting      the goal of full self-government for the people of Puerto      Rico, rather than remaining in a separate and unequal status,      is in the best interests of the United States. This is      particularly true due to the large population of Puerto Rico,      the approach of a new century in which a protracted status      debate will interfere with Puerto Rico's economic and social      development, and the domestic and international interest in      determining a path to full self-government for all      territories with a colonial history before the end of this      century.       9. The record of the October 17, 1995 hearing referred to      above makes it clear that the realities regarding      constitutional, legal and political obstacles to implementing      the changes required to fulfill the core elements of the      ``commonwealth'' option on the ballot were not made clear and      understandable in the public discussion and political debate      leading up to the vote. Consequently, Congress must determine      what steps the Federal government should take in order to      help move the self-determination process to the next stage,      so that the political status aspirations of the people can be      ascertained through a truly informed vote in which the wishes      of the people are freely expressed within a framework      approved by Congress. Only through such a process will      Congress then have a clear basis for determining and      resolving the question of Puerto Rico's future political      status in a manner consistent with the national interest.       Ultimately, Congress alone can determine Federal policy      with respect to self-government and self-determination for      the residents of Puerto Rico. It will not be possible for the      local government or the people to advance further in the      self-determination process until the U.S. Congress meets its      moral and governmental responsibility to clarify Federal      requirements regarding termination of the present      unincorporated territory status of Puerto Rico in favor of      one of the options for full self-government.       The results of the locally administered 1993 vote are      useful in this regard, but in our view are not definitive      beyond what has been stated above. The question of Puerto      Rico's political status remains open and unresolved.           Sincerely,     Don Young,       Chairman, Committee on Resources.
