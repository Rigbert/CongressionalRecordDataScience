It is entirely in the hands of the majority.  By the way, on that previous CR, 90 of your Members voted against it. Did they vote against the military? Did they vote against the first responders? Did they vote against education funding?  And we wring our hands about the military funding. Do you think it is any easier to run a nondefense agency with a CR? You are wrong if you think that. They undermine our domestic agencies as well, and I hope that they are equally worried about the impact that doing one short-term funding bill after another has on the domestic side.  Americans are frustrated that their Congress can't agree on what we agree on.  Republicans have previously supported the principles of parity when raising spending caps. That was the Paul Ryan deal. He is the Speaker. He said, yes, we will increase military and domestic the same. That was his deal, Paul Ryan, the Speaker.  That is all we are asking for, ``Paul Ryan, make your deal again,'' and he won't do it. Instead, he just wants to keep kicking the can down the road once, twice, thrice, now four times.  Yes, we want, as the previous speaker said, all DREAMers to stay in this country. We all want to reauthorize the CHIP program to prevent 9 million children from losing their health insurance. I dare you to put it on the floor. It will pass with every vote in this House. No, you want to blackmail us into passing something that we don't like and we don't think is good for the country.
