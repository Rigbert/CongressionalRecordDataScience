Speaker, it is my distinct privilege and honor to congratulate the Pearl Buck Center in Eugene, Oregon on 50 years of supporting families with special needs in Lane County.  When the Pearl Buck Center opened in 1953, it was one of the only educational programs in Oregon providing educational services to children with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. The Pearl Buck Center has continued this tradition of leadership in the community, the state, and the nation, providing vocational training, employment, education, and case management services to people with developmental disabilities.  Annually, the Pearl Buck Center provides services to over 400 individuals with developmental disabilities and their children. Since it was founded, the Pearl Buck Center has helped thousands of adults and children meet the challenges of their disabilities and find opportunities to succeed in school and on the job; to succeed as parents and as self-sufficient individuals; and to contribute to the community and society.  I would like to acknowledge the vision and dedication that characterizes this organization. I hope that all Americans will reflect on the commitment of the staff and volunteers of the Pearl Buck Center and on the struggles and successes of the individuals they serve.  October 2003 has been designated as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. In this special month, I extend my deepest appreciation and thanks to the Pearl Buck Center for their efforts, past and present, to help individuals with disabilities more fully realize their abilities, potential, and independence. We are all richer for your half-century of service.                          ____________________
