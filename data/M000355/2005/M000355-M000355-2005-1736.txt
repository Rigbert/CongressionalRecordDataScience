 President, I congratulate the new Senator from South Dakota on his initial speech in the Senate. I say to him that he could not have picked a more important topic than saving Social Security for our children. I had the pleasure to be here and listen to his speech. I have had an opportunity to get to know the Senator from South Dakota over the last few years.  I want to say again on behalf of all of our colleagues, welcome to the Senate, and congratulations on an outstanding speech.
