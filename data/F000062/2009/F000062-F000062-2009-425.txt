 President, I rise today in support of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009.  I commend my colleagues who support this comprehensive public lands bill, and I thank Chairman Bingaman for his leadership. He and his staff should be congratulated for their perseverance and patience in shepherding this important bill through the legislative process.  I would like to speak first about one of the bill's provisions, which has major implications for California; and that is, the legislation to implement the historic San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement, which I have sponsored with my colleague from California, Senator Boxer.  This measure would restore California's second longest river, while maintaining a stable water supply for the farmers who have made the San Joaquin Valley the richest agricultural area in the world.  Once enacted, this bill would bring to a close 19 years of litigation between the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Friant Water Users Authority, and the U.S. Department of the Interior. And it does so within a framework that the affected interests can accept--and have all agreed to.  The Settlement has two goals: to restore and maintain fish populations in the San Joaquin River in good condition, including a self-sustaining salmon fishery; and to avoid or reduce adverse water supply impacts to long-term Friant water contractors.  Consistent with the terms of the settlement, I expect that both of these goals will be pursued with equal diligence by the Federal agencies.  This historic agreement would not have been possible without the participation of a remarkably broad group of agencies, stakeholders, and legislators, including: the Department of the Interior; the State of California; the Friant Water Users Authority; the Natural Resources Defense Council on behalf of 13 other environmental organizations; and countless other stakeholders who came together and spent countless hours with legislators in Washington to ensure that we found a solution that the large majority of those affected could support. Without this consensus, the parties would no doubt continue the fight, resulting in a court-imposed judgment--one which would likely be worse for all parties.  I spoke at greater length about the purposes and benefits of this legislation during my statements upon introduction of the omnibus lands bill and when introducing the San Joaquin River Settlement legislation in December 2006 and January 2007 in previous Congresses.  I would like to take a moment to highlight several important changes that were made to this version of the legislation--which improved upon the initial bill, first introduced in December 2006.  First, the legislation reflects an agreement reached in November 2008 to ensure that the implementing legislation is pay-go neutral, which means that the restoration program allocates no more in direct spending than it brings in.  The agreement also protects the rights of third parties. These protections are accomplished while ensuring a timely and robust restoration of the river and without creating any new precedents for implementing the Endangered Species Act.  Similarly, there is no preemption of State law and nothing in the bill changes any existing obligations of the United States to operate the Central Valley Project in conformity with State law.  Second, the bill incorporates amendments made by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in May 2008 to enhance implementation of the settlement's ``Water Management Goal'' to reduce or avoid adverse water supply impacts to Friant Division long-term water contractors.  It also includes provisions approved by the committee that will increase the amount of upfront funding available for the settlement by allowing most Friant Division contractors to accelerate repayment of their construction cost obligation to the Treasury. In exchange for early repayment, Friant water agencies will be able to convert their 25-year water service contracts to permanent repayment contracts.  Now, I would like to speak at greater length about the legislation's substantial protections for other water districts and private landowners in California that were not party to the original settlement negotiations.  I think it is important to note that these protections have been agreed to by all of the settling parties as well as the third-party water agencies in the San Joaquin Valley who requested them, and that they will be accomplished while ensuring a timely and robust restoration of the river.  Section 10004(d) requires that the Secretary of the Interior identify; first, the impacts associated with the proposed action or actions; and sSecond, the measures that will be implemented to mitigate those impacts.  Sections 10004(f), 10004(g) and 10004(j) protect third party water users by clarifying that implementation of the settlement will cause no involuntary reductions in contract water allocations to long-term CVP contractors--other than Friant contractors--by making it clear that the bill does not, except as actually provided in the settlement and this bill, modify the rights and obligations of parties to existing water service, repayment, purchase, or exchange contracts, and by specifying that the rights and obligations under what is known as the Exchange Contract--with downstream districts--are not modified.  Further, section 10006(b) makes it clear that the bill does not preempt State law or modify any existing obligation of the United States under Federal reclamation law to operate the Central Valley Project in conformity with State law.  Some third parties had expressed concerns about potential conflicts between the provision of flows under the restoration program, and the rights of the exchange contractors to water from the San Joaquin River.  The Bureau of Reclamation has provided a letter that complements the language in the legislation and explains that such a conflict is extremely unlikely, but should such a conflictarise the Bureau will continue to make water available to the San Joaquin River exchange contractors consistent with its contractual requirements.  I will ask to have the letter, dated November 6, 2008, from Mr. Donald Glaser, regional Director of the Bureau of Reclamation for the Mid-Pacific Region of California, to Mr. Steve Chedester, executive director of the San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors Water Authority, be printed in the Record.  Concerns about potential damage to downstream farmers and landowners from water seepage resulting from interim restoration flows under the settlement are addressed by section 10004(h).  That section directs the Secretary, before releasing interim flows, to prepare an analysis of channel conveyance capacities and the potential for seepage, describe an associated seepage monitoring program, and evaluate possible seepage impacts and mitigation measures for impacts that are significant.  The section also directs that interim flows may only be released to the extent they will not impede completion of the channel restoration work or exceed downstream channel capacities.  And finally the section directs the Secretary to reduce interim flows if necessary to address material adverse impacts from groundwater seepage that the Secretary identifies through the Secretary's monitoring program.  Some of the third-party agencies have expressed concerns about the effectiveness of a fish barrier in the San Joaquin River near the confluence of the Merced River in preventing the upstream migration of anadromous fish prior to reintroduction of salmon and implementation of the restoration flow program.  This concern has been addressed in part with the addition of section 10004(i)(4), which calls for an evaluation of the temporary fish barrier, and the funding of fish screens and facilities under certain circumstances.  To further address the concerns regarding the effectiveness of the fish barrier, the Bureau of Reclamation and the California Department of Fish and Game have exchanged letters confirming their willingness to cooperate in the operation and evaluation of the Hills Ferry Fish Barrier during the interim flows period.  More specifically, these letters discuss future efforts by these agencies to achieve a barrier program that effectively prevents unintended upstream passage of salmonids during the interim flow period.  I applaud these efforts and look forward to their successful implementation.  I will ask to have the agencies' letters, dated December 22, 2008, from Mr. Jason Phillips, Program Manager, Bureau of Reclamation; and January 5, 2009, from Jeffery Single, Ph.D., Regional Manager, California Department of Fish and Game, printed in the Record.  Third parties had also requested that actions to increase the channel capacity in Reach 2B of the river be prioritized. The legislation directs the Secretary to implement the channel improvements that are listed in paragraph 11 of the settlement necessary to achieve the restoration goal.  Among the highest priority restoration improvements identified in the settlement are modifications to increase the channel capacity of Reach 2B of the river. I am pleased that work in that reach will be a priority for the restoration program and as a result will also address the third party concerns.  Finally, Section 10011 of the bill provides that the Central Valley Spring Run Chinook Salmon reintroduced into the San Joaquin River will be classified as an ``experimental population'' under the Endangered Species Act.  This section also makes clear that it establishes no precedent with respect to any other application of the Endangered Species Act, ESA.  It also provides that the Secretary of Commerce shall issue a rule under section 4(d) of the ESA which shall provide that the reintroduction of the spring run salmon under this section shall not impose more than de minimis water supply reductions, additional storage releases or bypass flows on unwilling third parties.  In closing, in addition to the protections listed above, I wish to highlight one further provision of the settlement that reflects some of the significant themes of this historic agreement.  In paragraph 13(h) of the settlement agreement, the settling parties agreed that the Secretary of the Interior should apply to the State of California to protect the restoration flows from Friant Dam to the Delta, subject to existing downstream diversion rights.  In my view, this underscores that this settlement is intended to conform to State law and that the Interior Department will seek appropriate actions by the State Water Resources Control Board to ensure that the water released for the settlement is controlled and managed from Friant Dam to the Delta to accomplish the restoration goal and water management goal purposes.  The Bureau of Reclamation has made significant progress on environmental and engineering studies necessary to implement the settlement.  Passage of the legislation will allow the agency to undertake specific programs and projects to implement the settlement's restoration and water management goals.  For example, with approval of the legislation, interim flows can begin this fall as scheduled, once a required environmental study is completed.  These limited water releases will provide essential information on channel capacity, fishery needs and water recovery opportunities as well as potential third-party impacts, such as seepage, and measures that may be needed to mitigate them.  The information will be used to shape other important aspects of the restoration goal program, such as the release of full restoration flows, scheduled to begin in 2014.  Passage of the legislation also will allow the Bureau to take immediate steps toward achieving the water management goal, including undertaking a project to restore the water-carry capacity of the Friant-Kern and Madera Canals and the installation of pump-back systems on the canals to help recapture water losses resulting from the settlement.  In addition, the agency is charged with implementing a cost-sharing program for local groundwater recharge and recovery projects that will help mitigate water losses.  Before I conclude, I would like to also briefly discuss the other 19 California bills in the omnibus legislation approved today.  First, wilderness provisions: The three wilderness bills in this package would together protect a wilderness about 735,000 acres of land in Mono, Riverside, Inyo, and Los Angeles Counties, and within Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park.  The bills include three additions to National Wilderness Preservation System: Eastern Sierra and Northern San Gabriel Wilderness, Riverside County Wilderness, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Wilderness.  This package of wilderness bills would help expand lasting Federal protection for some of California's important natural resources.  Second: water project authorizations.  In the West, drought, population growth, increasing climate variability, and ecosystem needs make managing water supplies especially challenging.  The nine California water recycling projects included in the omnibus bill offer a proven means to develop cost effective alternative water supply projects.  The water projects in the bill would fall under the auspices of the Bureau of Reclamation, and include San Diego Intertie feasibility study, Madera Water Supply Enhancement Project authorization, Rancho California Water District project authorization Santa Margarita River project authorization, Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District project authorization, North Bay Water Reuse Authority project authorization, Prado Basin Natural Treatment System Project authorization, Bunker Hill Groundwater Basin project authorization GREAT Project authorization, Yucaipa Valley Water District project authorization, Goleta Water District Water Distribution System title transfer, San Gabriel Basin Restoration Fund, and Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program.  Together they will help our State reduce its dependence on imported water from both the Lower Colorado River and Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta.  Third: other public lands bills to help preserve California's historic legacy.These include: Bureau of Land Management: Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria land exchange; Forest Service: Mammoth Community Water District land conveyance; National Park Service: Tule Lake Segregation Center Resource Study  There is an old saying when it comes to water: Whiskey's for drinking, water's for fighting over.'' There is no area where this has been more the case than the future of the San Joaquin River.  The passage of this omnibus legislation means we are one step closer toward resolving the longstanding conflict over the future of the San Joaquin River.  This is a bill whose time is long overdue, and I strongly urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to promptly join us in approving this critical piece of legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       Department of the Interior,                                        Bureau of Reclamation,                                 Sacramento, CA, November 6, 2008.     Subject: San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement          Legislation--Exchange Contractors Water Deliveries.     Mr. Steve Chedester,     Executive Director. San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors          Water Authority, Los Banos, CA       Dear Mr. Chedester: This is in response to concerns that      you raised during our meeting in Los Banos on October 21,      2008. At that meeting, you expressed concern that the      Settlement in NRDC v. Rodgers. which was approved by the      Court on October 23, 2006, and the San Joaquin River      Restoration Act that is currently pending in Congress could      be interpreted as modifying the contract between the Exchange      Contractors and the United States (Contract # Ilr-1144. as      amended February 14, 1968).       As I said at the meeting in Los Banos, and I reiterate      again. Reclamation does not interpret the Settlement or the      proposed legislation as modifying the obligations of the      United States under the Exchange Contract. Instead,      Reclamation's obligations under the Contract remain      unchanged. As a result, if a situation were to occur where      Settlement flows conflicted with Reclamation making necessary      deliveries under the Contract with the Exchange Contractors,      which as we discuss below is highly unlikely, Reclamation      would make water available to meet the contractual      requirements, consistent with the Contract.       My understanding is that the reason you are elevating this      issue now is because of a recent Federal District Court      decision affecting the operations of the Central Valley      Project (CVP) operations in the Delta. At the meeting in Los      Banos, a chart was handed out that was said to represent the      likely future CVP water supply south of the Delta given      pumping restrictions that result from the Federal District      Court's decision. The Exchange Contractors interpreted this      chart to show that in two out of every ten years. Reclamation      would not be able to fully meet the Exchange Contractor      demands from the Delta, thus requiring Reclamation to make      deliveries to Mendota Pool via the San Joaquin River from      Friant Dam. You expressed a specific concern that the flows      required by the Settlement for restoration could cause      interference with your water deliveries, in that available      channel capacity will be used to deliver the flows required      by the Settlement at times when the Exchange Contractors need      to receive water from Friant Dam.       After further review of the chart that was distributed in      Los Banos, Reclamation does not concur with the findings      presented on the chart. Since receiving your chart.      Reclamation completed some preliminary analysis based on      information developed for our on-going consultation on the      continued long-term operations of the CVP and State Water      Project. Our assessment is that, even with the current      Interim Federal District Court order in place, we are able to      fully meet the Exchange Contractor demands from the Delta in      all years. I would also point out that you provided no credit      at the meeting as to who completed the analysis, nor could      anyone describe the assumptions that were used to generate      the chart.       As a way to move forward with addressing your concerns. I      suggest representatives of the Exchange Contractors meet with      Reclamation to discuss the long-term CVP delivery      projections, as well as various operational scenarios for the      Settlement flows. Such discussions should alleviate your      concerns with regard to the risk to your water deliveries.       I look forward to working with you as we implement the      restoration program. Please contact Jason Phillips if you      have any questions.           Sincerely,                                                 Donald R. Glaser,     Regional Director.                                  ____                                       Department of the Interior,                                        Bureau of Reclamation,                                Sacramento, CA, December 22, 2008.     Subject: San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act (S 27/         H.R. 4074; H.R. 151)--Hills Ferry Barrier Effectiveness          Evaluation.     Mr. Jeffrey R. Single,     Regional Manager, California Department of Fish and Game,          Fresno, CA.       Dear Mr. Single: Third Parties have expressed new concerns      related to the operation of the Hills Ferry Barrier (Barrier)      in response to recent amendments to the proposed San Joaquin      River Restoration Settlement Act. In addition, during      discussions among the Settling Parties and Third Parties,      Reclamation agreed to exchange letters with the California      Department of Fish and Game (DFG) regarding the evaluation of      the effectiveness of thc Barrier in preventing the upstream      migration of anadromous fish, such as adult Chinook salmon,      steelhead, and sturgeon. This letter explains Reclamation's      commitment to assist DFG in its operation of the Barrier      program as needed during the Interim Flows program.       As you are aware, the relationship of the Barrier operation      and the San Joaquin River Restoration Program (Program) have      already been discussed by the Program's Fisheries Management      Work Group (FMWG). I propose that the issue regarding      evaluation of the effectiveness of the Barrier, as well as      all other actions associated with the relationship of the      Barrier operations to the Program, continue to be addressed      by the FMWG. The FMWG, in cooperation with DFG, will assess      whether alternative designs to maximize the Barrier      effectiveness are needed in an effort to reduce unintended      anadromous fish migrations upstream of the Barrier on the San      Joaquin River. If it is determined that any such migration      past the Barrier is caused by the introduction of Interim      Flows, and that the presence of such fish will result in the      imposition of additional regulatory actions against Third      Parties, the Secretary would be authorized under the proposed      legislation to assist DFG in making improvements to the      Barrier as necessary, or to take other equivalent actions,      such as assisting with the salvage of fish that get past the      Barrier, if DFG requests such assistance.       I look forward to working with you as we implement the      restoration program. Please contact me if you have any      questions.           Sincerely,                                                   Jason Phillips,     Program Manager.                                  ____                                  Department of Fish and Game,                                      Fresno, CA, January 5, 2009.     Subject: San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act (S 27/         H.R. 4074; H.R. 151)--Hills Ferry Barrier Effectiveness          Evaluation.     Mr. Jason Phillips,     Program Manager, San Joaquin River Restoration Program, U.S.          Bureau of Reclamation, Sacramento, CA.       Dear Mr. Phillips: Per your recent letter dated December      22, 2008, the California Department of Fish and Game      (Department) thanks you for communicating the U.S. Bureau of      Reclamation's (Reclamation) commitment to assist the      Department with the operation of the Hills Ferry Barrier      (Barrier) during implementation of the San Joaquin River      Restoration Program's (SJRRP) Interim Flows.       We concur with your proposal that issue regarding      evaluation of the effectiveness of the Barrier, as well as      all other actions associated with the relationship of the      Barrier operations to the Program, continue to be addressed      by the Fisheries Management Working Group (FMWG). Such      actions could include assessing more effective designs for      the barrier, assisting the Department in making improvements      to the Barrier as necessary, or taking other equivalent      actions, such as assisting with the salvage of fish that get      past the Barrier, if the Department requests such assistance.       The Department looks forward to the continued cooperation      and assistance provided by Reclamation and the SJRRP's      Program Fisheries Management Work Group to preclude and/or      resolve issues.           Sincerely,                                         Jeffrey R. Single, Ph.D.,                                                 Regional Manager.
