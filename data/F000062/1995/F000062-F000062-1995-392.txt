 I think the time has come for fiscal discipline. As I said, I sincerely believe the line-item veto can help us achieve that goal.  Let me give an example. When I was mayor of San Francisco, the budget did not correspond with the size of the Federal budget, but there were 52 departments, and the budget was over $1 billion. Yet, it was very difficult to get down to the actual line items. There was one line for salaries. As a chief executive, I really had no opportunity to go through every salary to make judgments about how many people should be continued and how many people should not.  A line-item veto gives the chief executive this opportunity, and I think the blue pencil is a necessary tool of government for a Chief Executive in a modern day.  I also believe that tax breaks and appropriations should be treated similarly. They may be two different items, but the results are very much the same: they benefit a small segment of the population at the expense of the greater good of all the people. Regardless of the item, they both reduce the amount of money in the U.S. Treasury.  Currently, debates are raging at every level of government about the institution of a line-item veto. Maryland, as I said, is now debating it. Fresno, CA, has just granted it. I believe that the people of this country understand the benefits of a line-item veto and are expanding the use of it. I believe we ought to give this power to our President.  So I am very pleased to be able to support the legislation before this body.  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.
