Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Curious Kids' Museum of St. Joseph, Michigan, which will celebrate its 1,000,000th visitor this year, as well as its 15th anniversary. This great educational museum is a treasure for the children of southwest Michigan, and I am very proud of the wonderful work it has accomplished over the years.  The Curious Kids' Museum began in 1987 as an idea shared by several local residents interested in alternative approaches to science education. Today it has over 100 hands-on educational exhibits and programs dedicated to stimulating the curiosity of children. The great many visitors of all ages that have had the fortunate opportunity to visit this museum have explored and gained awareness in the areas of science and technology, history, culture, and human perception.  The goal of the Museum's founders' was to establish a place where ``children and families pursue their natural curiosity about the world through exploration and hands-on interactive exhibits, making learning fun and increasing self-esteem.'' I for one would like to say, and I know I am not alone, mission accomplished and surpassed. It pleases me to honor this great museum, and I know the next million visitors will be just as moved and inspired as the first.                          ____________________
