President, I want to take a few minutes to recognize an outstanding Vermont public servant who goes above and beyond to advocate for better laws and protection to keep children safe from lead poisoning--the No. 1 environmental health threat affecting young children in the United States.  Ron Rupp serves as the current director of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, VHCB, Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Program and has played a major role in securing more than $10 million in HUD funds for the State of Vermont for lead hazard control efforts. Having been with this program since its inception in 1994, Ron has worked to expand the availability and quality of training and assistance for landlords and homeowners in order to reduce the hazards of lead poisoning caused by lead-based paint. Under his leadership, the program has provided comprehensive technical and financial assistance to make Vermont properties lead-safe. In addition to direct intervention, Ron has worked to expand education outreach efforts for the public on lead paint hazards, including training of construction and service workers, as well as property owners, and on the importance of testing young children for lead poisoning.  Ron's fight against childhood exposure to lead hazards is not limited to the State level. He has worked closely with the National Center for Healthy Housing to increase the overall body of knowledge on effective control of lead hazards and coauthored two papers on research into lead hazard control methods. Considered an expert on lead and environmental health, he has served as a reviewer for HUD's Lead Paint Safety Guide and other HUD documents.  The most common cause of lead poisoning is exposure to dust from deteriorated lead-based paint, the foremost cause of childhood lead poisoning, in old homes and buildings. Children are most frequently exposed to miniscule lead dust particles from chipping, peeling or flaking paint that cling to toys, fingers and other objects, leading young children to ingest the particles. Poisoning can also come from sources such as soil containing lead from car exhaust, water pipes, lead-glazed ceramic dishware, and plastic mini-blinds.  Too much lead in the body can cause damage to the brain, kidneys, nervous system and red blood cells. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 1 million children living in the United States between the ages of 1 and 5 years have unacceptably high levels of lead in their blood, which may result in learning disabilities, reduced intellectual ability, behavioral problems, or other health problems. Poor children are at special risk because inadequate nutrition increases lead absorption by the body.  Ron's job is by no means an easy one, but he has done exceptional work advocating for better policies and practices so that Vermont's children can grow up in lead-free homes. My home State has the seventh oldest housing stock in the Nation--a real ``Lead Leader.'' In the city of Burlington alone, housing units occupied by low-income residents constitute the highest concentration of older homes in Vermont. Significant lead paint hazards are characteristic of the deteriorated condition of many of these buildings. The result is that Burlington has a childhood lead poisoning rate that is more than double the national average.  Through the hard work of Ron and the VHCB Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Program, Vermont is becoming a place where our children can grow up safe from lead poisoning. Theremoval of lead hazards from our old homes and buildings is a slow process and success can be long in coming, but with dedicated public servants like Ron I have no doubt that success will indeed be met. Thank you, Ron, and congratulations to you for making Vermont's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Program the continuing success it is today.                          ____________________
