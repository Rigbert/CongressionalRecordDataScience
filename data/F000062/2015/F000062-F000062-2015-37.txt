 This amendment would replace a key feature of the underlying bill. Right now, under section 104(d) of the managers' amendment, a company is required to conduct a review of any information before it is shared and remove any personal information that is not ``directly related to a cybersecurity threat.''  Senator Wyden's amendment, while well-intentioned, would replace that review with a requirement that a company must remove personal information ``to the extent feasible''--and there is the rub. This is a very unclear requirement. In this bill, we are trying to provide clarity on what a company has to do so that it is understandable. Companies understand what it means to conduct a review to see whether there is personal information and then strip it out. They don't know what may or may not be feasible, and they worry that this lack of clarity could create the risk of a lawsuit where the current language does not.
