 The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know Senator Leahy shares my view that we are going to finish this bill tomorrow. Last year, we were fortunate to finish it in half a day. Obviously, that will not be the case this year because we started it on Friday and clearly will not be able to finish it tonight. We do intend to finish it tomorrow. The Senate will be interrupted in the morning by a speech to a joint meeting by the Prime Minister of India, which many Members will want to attend. But we intend to press on as rapidly as possible. If any Members on this side of the aisle have any amendments they have not discussed yet with either myself or staff, we would appreciate them coming over now and discussing it with us because we intend to move rapidly tomorrow and hopefully clear this bill out of the Senate by sometime in the afternoon.
