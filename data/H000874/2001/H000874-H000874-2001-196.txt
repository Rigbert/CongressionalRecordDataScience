Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I was not to my feet quickly enough to enter directly in the discussion about Michigan State and Arizona and some team from North Carolina that is playing.  But one ought to fear the turtle. I want everybody to understand that the Terrapins are coming to play, Gary Williams and his 10 starters.  This is on scheduling for Saturday night, Mr. Speaker, so I presume it is, therefore, relevant that everybody be aware that, at 8:20 p.m. on Saturday evening, they certainly ought to be watching when Maryland, who of course beat Duke worse than any other team this year at their place, will again have the opportunity of doing that.
