President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Criminal Justice Association, in support of the formulas in the underlying bill, be printed in the Record.       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be      printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 National Criminal                                          Justice Association,                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 2007.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Lieberman and Collins: On behalf of the      National Criminal Justice Association (NCJA), I write to      express our support for a number of important provisions in      the Improving America's Security by Implementing Unfinished      Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, or S. 4.      NCJA members administer justice assistance grant funding in      the states and tribal nations, and state and local criminal      justice practitioners from all parts of the criminal and      juvenile justice systems. In addition, NCJA provides direct      technical assistance     and training to state and local homeland security grant      administrators for all U.S. states and territories.       First, thank you for maintaining the Law Enforcement      Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP) in your bill. The LETPP      provides needed support to public safety agencies across the      country for terrorism prevention, training and information      sharing. As a direct result of the LETPP funding over the      past several years, state and local law enforcement agencies      have become stronger partners with other homeland security      disciplines in the effort to prevent, not just respond to, a      terror attack. In addition, the LETPP provides invaluable      financial assistance to our state and local law enforcement      partners as they address the country's homeland security      priorities outlined in the National Preparedness Goal. One of      the most successful initiatives undertaken by state and local      first responders has been the all-source, Intelligence Fusion      Centers, funded primarily through the LETPP program. Clearly      the LETPP has been a tremendous mechanism by which state and      local public safety programs have been built to address the      new requirements for all-hazards and terrorism prevention and      response.       Second, we commend the Committee's creation of an Office      for the Prevention of Terrorism. As described in the bill,      this new office would be a useful point of coordination and      support for law enforcement within the Department of Homeland      Security. Coordination and information sharing among the      federal, state and local law enforcement and public safety      agencies is critically important. This new office would serve      as a point of liaison and as an advocate for prevention and      law enforcement activities, thereby increasing coordination,      focusing funding and, ultimately, increasing the safety of      our citizens.       Third, we ask for your continued support for a minimum      guarantee for State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP)      funds. The primary goals of any national homeland security      strategy should be to: increase preparedness in our largest      urban areas; protect our targets of international      significance; and, to increase overall national preparedness.      An attack or disruption of our power or water or food supply      could occur anywhere. Core foundations of our economy could      be crippled from outside one of our major urban areas. States      are working hard to protect assets of national importance      within their borders and the safety of all our citizens. Only      by continuing a fair, balanced and substantial state minimum      guarantee can we be assured that all states reach a threshold      of preparedness under a national preparedness plan.       We thank you for your work on this important piece of      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                   Cabell Cropper,                                               Executive Director.
