Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a friend and a true military giant, an American hero--U.S. Navy Captain Leroy Farr.  Captain Farr is retiring from the Navy after 30 years of service to our country. As a test pilot, landing signal officer, operations and maintenance officer, squadron commanding officer, air boss, program manager, and inspector general, Captain Farr has a record in naval aviation that is second to none.  In 30 years Captain Farr has racked up numerous accomplishments but one of the greatest achievements in his distinguished record is the quiet but critical role he played in helping to save a strategic military asset--the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division in Lakehurst, NJ.  Lakehurst, Mr. Speaker, is the heart of naval aviation. It is a unique, one-of-its-kind, world-class facility whose primary function is to ensure that aircraft safely launch and recover from the deck of a carrier or other platform, and that support equipment assist in the service of planes, parts, and ordinance at sea. The safety and success of every single naval aircraft depends on the work and skill housed at Navy Lakehurst.  Despite its military value, the Department of Defense erroneously targeted Navy Lakehurst for closure--and then for a radical realignment. As part of the realignment scenario, the critical manufacturing, design, and research that goes on at Lakehurst was to be split apart and relocated at other bases.  Knowing that we had to act quickly to respond to this disaster, I immediately called together business and community leaders to discuss a plan to defend our base. We formed the Save Lakehurst Committee and organized a massive effort to save Navy Lakehurst. Butwithout reliable facts and figures, our effort would have been for naught.  As commanding officer of Lakehurst, Captain Farr was undoubtedly between a rock and a hard place. He knew the facts; he knew the figures. But as a Navy officer, Captain Farr could not and would not violate his chain of command. At the same time, as a Captain, a pilot, a former air boss, and the current commanding officer of Navy Lakehurst, Captain Farr knew better than anyone just how devastating the close Lakehurst scenario would be for national security and pilot safety.  It was an unusual situation where one's own military command was supporting a plan not in the best interest of the military. A predicament in which a man of less character, less courage, less fortitude and less grit might decide to look the other way--and let the chips fall where they may. But not Leroy Farr.  Captain Farr drew strength from his own personal skills and attributes enabling him to strike a balance between the plans of his Pentagon and the needs of his Nation. I remember his wife, Barbara, telling me just how much he grieved for the future of Navy Lakehurst and the future of any pilot who might fly off an aircraft carrier without the support of the skilled workers and artisans at Navy Lakehurst.  I had the good fortune of sitting in on Captain Farr's many briefings when BRAC officials would come to the base to see for themselves what went on at Navy Lakehurst. It was in these skillful presentations that Captain Farr laid the groundwork for the ultimate reversal of the close Lakehurst scenario. Captain Farr was informed, clear, concise, fair, direct, honest, sincere, and always careful to never publicly repudiate the Pentagon's plans.  Yet, on those critical points and questions when the facts simply did not fit the Pentagon's proposal, Captain Farr was sure to let the facts speak for themselves.  And the facts spoke volumes. Each fact introduced or underscored in a Captain Farr briefing became amplified by our community effort. We catapulted--to coin a phrase--the information to the BRAC Commission who in turn were persuaded not by rhetoric but by data--real hard evidence. They reversed the Pentagon proposal and secured the future of Navy Lakehurst and naval aviation and the safety of every Navy pilot.  Captain Farr's love of his country and love of his military--and his ability to withstand the heat--enabled him to educate and guide all of us who could openly and publicly challenge the Pentagon on the basis of military value and pilot safety. He did it not in a brash, self-promoting, self-serving or destructive manner but with class, dignity, firmness, integrity, valor, and resolve. And in this effort Captain Farr demonstrated that he is the personification of what our future military leaders should always strive to be: brave, decent, honorable leaders who put the safety of the Nation at the forefront of every decision.  It has been my distinct honor and privilege to have worked with Captain Farr and I know I speak not only for myself but for all who support Navy Lakehurst and are dedicated to a strong, capable military defense when I say that we will sincerely miss you and your brand of military leadership. Our gratitude for your dedication, contribution, and success is immeasurable.  We wish you the absolute best in your future endeavors with your wife Barbara and your children, Patty, Sherry, and Andrew--you, Captain, have earned it.                          ____________________
