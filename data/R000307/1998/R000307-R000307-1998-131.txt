 In particular, I am pleased that this agreement insists that efforts to remove illegal trade barriers to American products be a required item in any IMF program. It is entirely appropriate that we are doing that.  I am especially pleased that this body has rejected efforts to include requirements and conditions that would have gone too far. While the recipient countries should be required to comply with tough, fundamental changes in their economies in order to receive the assistance, the bar must not be raised so high that any hope for reaching the conditions is lost. If excessive conditions had been included--and some Members in this body had been promoting those conditions--why, the United States would have no leverage to insist on reforms that would lower trade barriers to American goods and end unfair subsidies for foreign businesses. That would hurt both the country in trouble and the United States as well.  In this regard, Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, for his outstanding leadership in assuring a common-sense and bipartisan approach to this challenge.  I also wish to pay special thanks to Senator Hagel and to Senator Grams for their efforts in helping to craft language that I believe will certainly enable us to achieve both funding and the needed reforms. In particular, I wish to thank my good friend from Nebraska, who has worked tirelessly on this issue and deserves much, if not most, of the credit for enabling us to achieve real progress on this bill. Our neighboring States are particularly dependent on this country's implementing a consistent export policy and for the United States to provide continued leadership in stabilizing the world economy. In this regard, our farmers and ranchers and the many segments of our economy who depend on exports owe Senator Hagel a debt of gratitude.
