President, September 17 was Constitution Day--a day when folks are encouraged to teach and learn about the Constitution. I would like to recognize the middle and high school students from across the Nation who traveled to the U.S. Capitol yesterday in honor of Constitution and Citizenship Day.  I would also like to recognize the students unable to travel to Washington, DC, who are no less engaged in their studies of the Constitution and citizenship, specifically the many students in my home State of Oregon who have shown a strong commitment to civic engagement. These young Oregonians have demonstrated a willingness to get involved in their communities and work for positive change and are an example of the important role community involvement plays in developing a strong society.  Of the students able to be in Washington, DC, on Constitution Day, I would particularly like to recognize several middle school students from Oregon who visited my office yesterday.  Alyssa Etheridge and several of her classmates from South Middle School located in Grants Pass, OR, dedicated every day of the last school year to honor the 142 Oregon soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan. These young women created the Bayard Wilkeson Project--named for a Civil War officer killed at the battle of Gettysburg--a Web site designed to educate Oregonians about the lives of those servicemembers from our State who have given their lives for our country.  Coming from Portland, OR, William Britton and his seventh grade class from Southwest Charter School studied and considered the problem of outdoor secondhand smoke, and its impact on the health of their community. They conducted surveys, interviews, and lobbied some of their local elected officials to control secondhand smoke exposure.  It is wonderful to see these students participate so actively in the democratic process, and it is truly heartening to see so many young people taking the time to get involved and express their opinions. I am pleased to be able to recognize the commitment and dedication these young Oregonians have shown to better their communities and urge them to keep up their good works.                          ____________________
