It has been a joy to work with him over the last year and a half in preparing this important legislation. It is complex. It is difficult. He has shown both legislative and intellectual stamina throughout. He has been fair in his dealings with me, and to the moment where we were successful in passing this bill on the floor of the Senate by an overwhelming vote of 97-1, a strong bipartisan vote, I think we both took pride in the fact that we had given it virtually everything that we could to make the best possible legislation for a very difficult challenge.  Having said that, I will knowledge, as the Senator from Iowa has, that once that bill left the Senate floor, once the conferees were appointed, a totally different process took place, which was very disappointing to me. It was totally different in that it was not bipartisan. In fact, as I stand here today and look up at the clerk's desk and see the conference report from this committee, this is the first time I have ever laid eyes on it. I wasn't there. I wasn't invited to the conference committee meetings. I wasn't asked to sign the conference committee report. In fact, virtually no Democrats--at least on the Senate side--were involved in any of that negotiation. That is truly unfortunate.  There is no reason why this had to be a partisan endeavor. Senator Grassley and I proved that in working together on a bipartisan basis we could come up with a good and balanced bill. In fact, when this issue first came to me and people representing banks and the credit industry came to my office, I said to them: I agree with you, there are abuses in the bankruptcy system that need to be cleaned up. I will help you clean them up if, and only if, you will concede that there are also abuses when it comes to credit cards in America that need to be cleaned up as well.  Each bank, each merchant, each credit card company said, without fail: We agree. We are in for both sides to be repaired, both sides to be changed, and reform to come that will really affect bankruptcy in the future.  The Senate bill did that. The Senate bill said: Yes, we will clean up the bankruptcy court, but we will also say to the credit card companies, you have a responsibility to clean up your act. It also said to creditors that when it comes to the whole question of your efforts, if there are predatory credit practices that are, in fact, unfair, those credit practices will not allow you a ticket into the bankruptcy court.                       Unanimous Consent Request  Mr. President, before proceeding, I ask unanimous consent that the previously scheduled vote now occur at 5:50 p.m. this evening.
