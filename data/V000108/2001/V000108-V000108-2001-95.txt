Speaker, it is with great pleasure and esteem that I congratulateMr. Rudy Nichols and Mr. Lupe Valadez on their retirement from the United Steelworkers of America. Rudy has been a member of the USWA for over 45 years, while Lupe has served for over 50 years. These two men, along with their colleagues, help form the economic backbone for Northwest Indiana. Without their hard work and dedication, the communities of Northwest Indiana would indeed suffer. A retirement celebration will be held in their honor on April 21, 2001 at the Dynasty Banquet Center in Hammond, Indiana.  Rudy Nichols began his distinguished career at the age of 18 as an armature winder and motor inspector for Youngstown Sheet and Tube in East Chicago, Indiana in February, 1956. During that time, he became a member of USWA Local 1011 and served as an apprentice representative and shop steward. He later moved on to the Midwest Steel Division of National Steel in Portage, Indiana, where he became a member of Local 6103. Through his perseverance and undying loyalty he eventually became the president of the local, and served on several committees that were devoted to improving the quality of the workplace for its members. After 13 impressive years at National Steel, Rudy moved on to become the Safety and Health Coordinator for District 31 in August, 1978. He quickly moved up within the union and became the Sub District 4 Director, the position he currently holds. With Mary, his wife of 45 years, by his side, Rudy has watched as their two children, Walter and Rhonda, have grown to be outstanding citizens and parents of their own.  Lupe Valadez was the fourth of six sons born to Gerardo and Ventura Valadez on the south side of Chicago. After serving with the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea, Lupe came home to follow in his father's footsteps and begin working at U.S. Steel South Works, where he immediately became heavily involved in USWA Local 65. He eventually went on to serve the local in many capacities, including Public Relations Director, Assistant Grievanceman, and three terms as Financial Secretary. After more than 20 years of devoted and outstanding service, District 31 Director Jack Parton recognized the important qualities that Lupe could bring to the District office and hired him as an organizer. Within ten short years Lupe became the Organizing Coordinator for District 31. When the union consolidated in 1995, he became the first Organizing Coordinator for District 7, which encompasses the states of Indiana and Illinois. Lupe's first concern, however, has always been his family. His loving wife Olivia, and sons Dino, Nick, Michael, and John Paul can usually be seen helping with the numerous activities he is coordinating.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Rudy Nichols and Lupe Valadez on their retirement from the United Steelworkers of America. Unions are a vital aspect of the communities of Northwest Indiana, and these two men have shown the loyalty, perseverance, and work ethic that allow the unions to thrive. Their efforts will surely be missed by their co-workers and the citizens of Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
