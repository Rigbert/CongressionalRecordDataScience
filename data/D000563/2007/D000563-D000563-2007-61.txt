President, I will insist on regular order for only one point. I would ask unanimous consent that if the Senator from Oklahoma or the Senator from Texas wants to express his objection to a unanimous consent request, that the time he uses in expressing his objection be taken from the leader's time or from the time remaining for the Republicans in morning business.
