 President, this letter raised several very serious questions about Captain Cook's fitness for promotion to the rank of admiral.  Specifically, my questions about Captain Cook pertained to his service as chief engineer on the A-12 stealth bomber project that was terminated for default in January 1991.  The A-12 project collapsed because of an unresolved engineering problem--uncontrolled increases in the weight of the airplane.  It was a ``show stopper,'' and Captain Cook was up to his ears in the whole mess.  As the weight of the airplane grew, the schedule kept sliding, and the price kept going up.  Eventually, this top priority Navy program was buried in a massive cost overrun.  This kind of mismanagement was bad enough by itself.  But A-12 mismanagement became a criminal enterprise when senior Navy officials attempted to conceal and cover up the cost overrun with lies.  They attempted to hide the problem from the Secretary of Defense and the Congress.  This behavior triggered a criminal investigation by the Inspector General [IG] of the Department of Defense.  The IG concluded that Federal criminal laws were violated, and the case was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution.  The investigation found several specific instances in which the Secretary of the Navy at the time, H. Lawrence Garrett, and A-12 program officials``withheld, concealed, and/or suppressed adverse A-12 program information'' from the Secretary of Defense and the Congress.  That is a quote from the IG's criminal report.  I also believe the IG report shows that Captain Cook may have participated in the scheme to conceal and suppress adverse information about the program.  These are very serious allegations.  They need to be addressed and resolved.  Maybe the Committee conducted an investigation and cleared him, but I do not know that. The Committee has never bothered to tell me about it.  So I was very surprised and very disappointed to find Captain Cook's name on a July 1996 list of ``United States Navy Flag Officers.''  He has been confirmed and ``frocked.''  That means he wears an admiral's insignia but is still paid as a captain.  Once an admiral's billet opens up, he will assume the full duties and responsibilities of an admiral.  Mr. President, I think the Committee owes me an explanation.  Mr. President, on September 27, I wrote a second time--1\1/2\ years later--to Senator Thurmond, asking for a response.  I ask unanimous consent to have this second letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         United States Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1996.     Hon. Strom Thurmond,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Strom, I am writing to follow up on my letter of May      15, 1995, regarding the nomination for promotion of Navy      Captain Jeffrey A. Cook.       In my letter to you of May 15, 1995, I raised several very      serious questions bearing on Captain Cook's fitness for      promotion to the rank of admiral. My questions were based on      a criminal investigation conducted by the Inspector General      of the Department of Defense. These questions pertained to      his service as chief engineer on the A-12 stealth bomber      project that was terminated for default in January 1991.      These questions suggest that Captain Cook may have      participated in a scheme to conceal adverse information on      the A-12 from both the Secretary of Defense and Congress.       In view of these allegations and since I never received a      response from you, I was very surprised and disappointed to      find Captain Cook's name on July 1996 list of ``United States      Navy Flag Officers.'' This list indicates that he has been      confirmed and ``frocked.'' Once an admiral's billet becomes      available, he will assume the full duties and      responsibilities of the rank.       Would you be kind enough to explain how your Committee      resolved the questions raised in my letter of May 15, 1995.      Had I known that your Committee was prepared to proceed with      this nomination, I would have liked to have had an      opportunity to raise my objections on the floor. Strom, we in      the Senate have a Constitutional responsibility to nurture      topnotch leadership in the Armed Forces. Officers who meet      those high standards should be praised and promoted. Those      who fail to meet the high standards should be weeded out.  I would appreciate a response to my letter.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                      U.S. Senate.
