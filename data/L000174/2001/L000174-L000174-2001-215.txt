 I cannot help but think in looking at our distinguished Presiding Officer, the senior Senator from New York, how much his State has suffered. Both he and his distinguished colleague, Senator Clinton, have spoken so eloquently, both on the floor and elsewhere, about that. I know in my own private conversations with the distinguished Presiding Officer I felt the depth of his grief and emotion for a city that he obviously and unabashedly loves. His references to New York City over the years are almost similar to the kind of comments I make about Vermont. But I do note the accent is somewhat different. I assume it is because of the Vermont accent.  But I think the Senators from New York, and the Senators from New Jersey and Connecticut have especially spoken of the effect on families and loved ones in the New York City area. People who work there are from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. I know how sad they feel.  I think of the people who died in Pennsylvania in an airplane that was probably planning to strike the very building we are in--this symbol of democracy. Only with a great loss of life did it not happen. But there would be an enormous disruption in our Government.
