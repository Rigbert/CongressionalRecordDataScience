Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 440) to provide for the establishment of the Special Envoy to Promote Religious Freedom of Religious Minorities in the Near East and South Central Asia, as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                                H.R. 440       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Seven Baha'i leaders in Iran have been wrongfully      imprisoned since 2008.       (2) In May 2010, suspected terrorists attacked two mosques      in Pakistan belonging to the Ahmaddiya minority Muslim sect,      killing at least 80 people. Ahmadis consider themselves      Muslim, but Pakistani law does not recognize them as such.       (3) Said Musa, an Afghan Christian convert, was arrested in      May 2010 on charges of apostasy, a crime which can carry the      death sentence, and was released in February 2011 only after      sustained international pressure.       (4) On October 31, 2010, gunmen laid siege on Our Lady of      Salvation Church in Baghdad, Iraq killing at least 52 police      and worshipers, including two priests, making it the worst      massacre of Iraqi Christians since 2003.       (5) Iraq's ancient and once vibrant Christian population      that numbered an estimated 1,500,000 out of a total      population in Iraq of 30,000,000 in 2003 has been reduced by      at least one half, due in significant part to Christians      fleeing the violence.       (6) In November 2010, a Pakistani court sentenced Aasia      Bibi, a Christian mother of five, to death under the      country's blashphemy law for insulting the Prophet Muhammad.       (7) On New Year's Eve 2010, 23 people were killed when a      suicide bomber attacked a Coptic Christian church in      Alexandria, Egypt.       (8) On March 2, 2011, Pakistani Federal Minorities Minister      Shahbaz Bhatti, the only Christian member of the Cabinet, who      was outspoken in his opposition to Pakistan's blasphemy laws      was assassinated by extremists.       (9) The Department of State's 2010 International Religious      Freedom Report stated that many religious minority groups in      Uzbekistan ``faced heavy fines and/or short jail terms for      violations of restrictive religion laws''.       (10) The Special Envoy for Anti-Semitism, Hannah Rosenthal,      has noted that Holocaust glorification ``is especially      virulent in the Middle East media''.       (11) A number of countries in the Middle East have recently      undergone popular revolutions which in some countries have      left security vacuums making religious minorities especially      vulnerable to violent attacks, such as--       (A) in March 2011, the Shahedin Church in Helwan province,      Egypt, was torched, leading to protests which spurred      sectarian clashes in the streets of Cairo;       (B) on March 20, 2011, a group of Salafists in Upper Egypt      cut off a Christian man's ear and burned his home and car;      and       (C) news reports from April 2011 indicate that Salafi      organizations in Egypt have been implicated in the      destruction of Sufi shrines across the country fueling      violent conflict.       (12) Many of these ancient faith communities are being      forced to flee the lands which they have inhabited for      centuries.       (13) The United States Commission on International      Religious Freedom has recommended that Iran, Iraq, Pakistan,      Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan be designated by      the Department of State as Countries of Particular Concern in      accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of      1998.       (14) The situation on the ground in the region continues to      develop rapidly and the United States Government needs an      individual who can respond in kind and focus on the critical      situation of religious minorities in these countries.     SEC. 2. SPECIAL ENVOY TO PROMOTE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OF                    RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN THE NEAR EAST AND SOUTH                    CENTRAL ASIA.
