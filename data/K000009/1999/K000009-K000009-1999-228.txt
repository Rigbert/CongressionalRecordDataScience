Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Etheridge) for joining us and for being a vigilant voice not just for farmers in North Carolina but across this country and in trying to get the majority here to do what is right for our country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Berry), one of the most knowledgeable Members of the entire Congress on the subject of rural America and agriculture.
