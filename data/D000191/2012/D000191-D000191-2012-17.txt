It won't kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will be immediately amended and will proceed to final passage.  It's a pretty simple amendment. It would create a tax break for the real job creators in America, which are small businesses and middle-income families. A middle-income person with a job or a small business and enough money to go out and invest and buy products made in America for his business--that's a key component of this--would be allowed an expensing.  The Republican version of the bill would limit the expensing to small businesses to $100,000 a year for the purchases of new equipment made in America. If this amendment is adopted, those same small businesses would be allowed to expense up to $1 million to purchase products made in America, which would put people back to work.  Now, I know we're going to hear of the millionaires and billionaires because this tax increase, or restoration of the Clinton era rates, would only apply to incomes over $1 million. So a millionaire still gets the break on the first $1 million. It's only on income over $1 million that would go to the Clinton era rates.  They'll say they're the job creators and that it would depress job creation. Let's think back to the Clinton administration. We had a 39.6 percent top bracket on the millionaires and billionaires. We had 3.8 percent unemployment in the United States of America,and we paid down debt for the first time since the Eisenhower administration. I'd like to go back to those bad old days.  Now, we've been doing the Bush tax cuts for 12 years. Where are the jobs? Where are the jobs from cutting taxes on people's incomes of over $1 million? They aren't creating those jobs. Let me give you two quick examples from my district, and they're typical.                              {time}  1750  I have Palo Alto Software, a small business. They make software for business start-ups. We contacted them, and they said, Yes, we could invest way more both in new hardware, new software, and other things that would enhance our business than $100,000 if we were given this expensing privilege, and we would put more people back to work.  Bulk Handling Systems, they make recycling systems in my district. They had the same answer: If you gave us a million dollars of expensing, we would spend every penny of that on products made in America and put people back to work.  The bottom line is the Republicans want to limit these small businesses, these real job creators, to a $100,000 deduction when they could use a million dollars in expensing and put more people back to work, because their premise is that the millionaire, the person who got hundreds of millions or more in income, that having them not pay more taxes on their income over $1 million will create more jobs than the small business. I don't buy that. I don't think the American people buy that.  There's no limit on what they can do with their huge tax breaks, their very expensive tax breaks. They can buy another vacation home in the Caribbean. They can buy a Lamborghini. Paris Hilton can go on a shopping spree in London or Paris.  This bill limits the expensing and the purchase of equipment to products made in the United States of America. I want to see things made in this country again. I want to put Americans back to work, not people overseas.  It's time that we admitted that we can't afford to continue the tax cuts over $1 million of income.  It would also reduce the deficit over 10 years by $29 billion after we create jobs, after we give this expensing privilege to small businesses.  The choice is yours. You can stick with those who have income over $1 million or you can side with small businesses and American workers. You decide.  I yield back the balance of my time.
