President, I rise today along with my colleague, Senator Torricelli of New Jersey, to introduce two pieces of legislation we believe are absolutely critical to our ongoing effort to combat childhood lead poisoning. These two bills, the Early Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act and the Children's Lead SAFE Act, are intended to improve our ability to detect and treat children at high risk of lead poisoning, as well as expand our network of Federal program sites where children at increased risk of lead poisoning can be screened.  The Early Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act requires WIC and Head Start/Early Head Start programs with children under age 3 to assess whether a child participant has been screened for lead, and provide and track referrals for any child who has not been appropriately screened. The bill also calls upon WIC and Head Start/Early Head Start grantees to ensure that all enrolled children are screened for lead poisoning and grants these entities the authority to perform or arrange blood lead screening for program participants. Lastly, the bill allows WIC clinics and Head Start/Early Head Start grantees to seek reimbursement through Medicaid or the State Children's Heath Insurance Program, CHIP, for eligible children who have received a lead screening test in accordance with CDC recommendations or Medicaid policy.  The Children's Lead Screening Accountability for Early Intervention Act, or the Children's Lead SAFE Act, would require Medicaid contractors to comply with existing requirements to provide screening, treatment and any necessary follow-up services for Medicaid-eligible children who test positive for lead poisoning. To be clear, this is not imposing any new mandate on State Medicaid contractors. It is simply trying to make current law more effective by explicitly requiring health care providers to comply with Federal lead screening requirements that have been in existence since 1992.  This new, stronger mandate has become necessary because 82 percent of children ages one through five have never been screened for lead poisoning, even though they were receiving health care benefits or services through Medicaid, WIC, or the Health Centers program, according to a recent report from the General Accounting Office, GAO, despite long standing Federal requirements. This means that of the estimated 890,000 children in the U.S. with elevated blood lead levels, over 400,000 have never been identified or treated. Even more disconcerting is that 50 percent of our States do not have screening policies that are consistent with Federal requirements.  The reason why our two bills specifically focus on specific Federal programs stems from the GAO report, which indicated that 77 percent of U.S. children with high levels of lead in their blood are enrolled in Federal programs, highlighting the viral role of these programs in helping to eliminate the preventable tragedy of childhood lead poisoning. Better involvement by Federal programs in promoting screening and treatment is also critical to reducing the significant health care and special education costs associated with the irreversible effects of lead poisoning, which include the impairment of mental and physical development.  We need to find the will and the resources to eradicate lead hazards for millions of at-risk children. We also need to make more Americans aware of the dangers of lead poisoning. I am committed to addressing this crisis, and I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting these bills and other lead poisoning prevention efforts.  I ask consent that the text of the Early Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1469       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
