 I just wanted to speak to the fact that there might be some reason that I cannot think of right now to offer another amendment. I do not really anticipate doing it. So I yield the floor. I would be happy to respond to questions or engage in debate. I should give my opponents the courtesy of listening to their objections to my amendments. Whatever the floor managers at this point want to do, I yield the floor.
