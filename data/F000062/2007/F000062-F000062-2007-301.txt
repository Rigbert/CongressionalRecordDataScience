 This debate should be about providing Federal funding, and a consistent policy, for embryonic stem cell research. It is not the place of the U.S. Senate to rely on concepts and definitions that are ``scientifically meaningless.''  The truly important vote will occur on the passage of S. 5, the only legislation that will reverse what the majority of Americans, and the majority of the medical and scientific community believe to be a flawed policy.  S. 30 will very clearly leave in place President Bush's August 9, 2001 Executive Order, which limits Federal funding to stem lines derived before that date. We need to overturn this policy, not affirm it.  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing S. 30.                               Exhibit 1                                          The American Society for                                                 Cell Biology,                                     Bethesda, MD, April 10, 2007.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear Senator Reid: We would like to express our views about      the upcoming Senate debate on stem cell research, as the      President and Public Policy Committee Chair respectively for      the American Society for Cell Biology. Our nonprofit,      professional society of more than 11,000 members includes      many of the leading scientists working in this area.       As you know, it is critically important that science policy      be carefully crafted to allow ethically sound scientific      research to proceed. This is particularly difficult to do      when the science behind the policy is as complicated as in      the current policy debate on stem cell research.       We are particularly concerned about a major provision of      S.30, the ``Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem      Cell Research Act.'' The expressed purpose of S.30 is to      ``promote the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines      without the creation of human embryos for research purposes      and without the destruction, discarding of, or risk of injury      to a human embryo or embryos other than those that are      naturally dead.''       S.30 relies on the false premise that scientists can      determine whether a human embryo is ``naturally dead.''      However, naturally dead is a scientifically meaningless idea.      To our knowledge, there is no scientifically credible way to      determine this. In fact, we think that to establish      sufficiently precise scientific or clinical standards about      the quality of embryos at the very early stages of      development would require experiments that the bill itself      would not permit.       It is critically important that the Senate proceed with      caution as it continues its work in the area of science      policy. Legislation based on inaccurate science could have a      detrimental impact on the course of the American biomedical      research enterprise. Not only do we risk driving research and      researchers to other countries more interested in cutting      edge research but we also delay the day when our fellow      Americans who suffer from some of the most debilitating      diseases finally realize the benefits of scientific      research.           Sincerely,     Bruce Alberts,                                                        President.     Larry Goldstein,                                   Chair, Public Policy Committee.
