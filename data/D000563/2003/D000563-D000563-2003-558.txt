President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.  I say to the Senator, again, I am prepared, at any point, if the Senator would like to ask a question and debate, let's try it. Let's see how the Senate works in real debate. But I really appreciate the Senator from Pennsylvania coming to the floor.  I say to the Senator, you were the first voice in opposition to this amendment. I have been coming here day after day after day. I suspected there was some opposition here--don't get me wrong--but I am glad the Senator came forward to speak his mind about this amendment.  And I congratulate you on your choice of words. Those who oppose an amendment involving Medicare use words such as ``top-down,'' ``command-and-control,'' conjuring images of commissars, Bolshevik 7-year, 10-year plans--this kind of mighty hand of government pressing down on the poor, thepoor peasant, the poor American citizen.  The sad reality is, the seniors of America don't agree with you. They like Medicare. They even like it in Pennsylvania. Do you know what we find when we say to seniors: ``We give you a choice. You don't have to stay in Medicare. You can go to a private HMO''? Eighty-nine percent of them stay in Medicare--the ``top-down, command-and-control'' system.  Now, why do they stay there?
