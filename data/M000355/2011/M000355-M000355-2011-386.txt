 President, I rise to recognize the remarkable accomplishments of one of Kentucky's most impressive athletic teams, the Rockcastle High School Lady Rockets basketball team. This March 12, the Lady Rockets triumphed over the DuPont Manual Lady Crimsons in overtime, 62 to 60, to win the school's first Kentucky High School Athletic Association Sweet 16 girls basketball championship.  It has been an unforgettable season for the Lady Rockets, who finished the year 36-1, on a 27-game winning streak, and undefeated by any fellow Kentucky team. They entered the final tournament game knowing they faced an experienced and competitive opponent, but that their raw talent and determination would show the people of the Bluegrass State that they had something to prove. Well, prove something they did: After clawing their way back from a nine-point deficit to tie it and send the game into overtime, the Lady Rockets never trailed during the extra minutes.  Senior Sara Hammond, named the tournament's Most Valuable Player, the State's first McDonald's All American, and Kentucky's Miss Basketball 2011, posted 26 points and 11 rebounds during the game. It all came down to the final seconds of overtime when Lady Rockets head coach Chrysti Noble decided not to call a time out and trusted her players to finish the game with the right shot. Senior Angie Lawrence took a buzzer-beating jumper to give the Lady Rockets the title.Streamers and confetti hailed from the rafters, blanketing the team and the record number of 5,122 screaming spectators at E.A. Diddle Arena in Bowling Green, KY.  Their victory was the first championship title for coach Chrysti Noble in her 21 seasons at Rockcastle High School. It also made the Lady Rockets the first team not from Lexington or Louisville to win the girls' basketball State championship in more than a decade.  The students and faculty of Rockcastle High School, the community of Mount Vernon and the entire Commonwealth couldn't be more proud of this talented, winning team. The Sunday after winning the championship, the equivalent of one-fifth of the population of Mount Vernon turned out to wish the Lady Rockets well as the team members rode through town atop three fire engines, a convoy of honking vehicles and jubilant fans following behind. Their hard work, dedication and respect for one another undoubtedly makes them a team that will be remembered for years to come.  Mr. President, the Louisville Courier-Journal recently published an article about the Rockcastle High School Lady Rockets' history-making season and what the championship meant to the team, the school and the Commonwealth. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Courier-Journal, Mar. 13, 2011]Girls' Sweet 16 Rockcastle County Beats Manual 62-60 for Title on Last-                              Second Shot                           (By Jason Frakes)       Bowling Green, KY--The knock all season on the Rockcastle      County High School girls' basketball team was that it's a      one-woman squad, led by McDonald's All American Sara Hammond.       The Lady Rockets now have a state championship trophy to      prove that never was the case.       Angie Lawrence nailed a jumper in the lane with 1 second      left in overtime to give Rockcastle County a 62-60 victory      over Manual in the final of the Houchens/KHSAA Sweet 16.       A state final-record crowd of 5,122 at E.A. Diddle Arena      saw Rockcastle County capture its first state championship      and end a 10-year reign of title winners from either      Louisville or Lexington. West Carter (2000) was the last      school not from either of Kentucky's largest cities to win      the crown.       ``This is the best feeling ever,'' said Hammond, a      University of Louisville signee who was named the Sweet 16      MVP. ``I knew we were going to get it done tonight.''       The 6-foot-2 Hammond posted 26 points and 11 rebounds to      lead the Lady Rockets (36-1), who finished the season with a      27-game winning streak and lost only to Mount Juliet (Tenn.)      60-47 on Dec. 30.       Lawrence, a 5-5 senior who has signed with Georgetown      College, added 18 points.       LeAsia Wright had 19 points and Kara Wright 12 for Manual      (33-5), which was No. 1 in the state in The Courier-Journal's      Litkenhous Ratings all season.       ``Our best wasn't good enough to win the game, but it's      good enough for me,'' Lady Crimsons coach Stacy Pendleton      said. ``They just beat us. We played as hard as we could.''       Manual led 37-28 early in the third quarter, but Rockcastle      County charged back and eventually tied it at 47 on a      Lawrence three-pointer with 5:07 left in the fourth.       Hammond scored 19 points in the first half, but it was      Lawrence who carried the Lady Rockets late with 15 points      after the break.       ``Their other kids really stepped up in the second half,''      Pendleton said. ``But if it wasn't for (Hammond) in the first      half, I think we could have blown them out.''       Lawrence sank two free throws with 27.5 seconds left for a      55-53 lead, but Kayla Styles' basket with 2 seconds left tied      it and forced overtime.       The Lady Rockets never trailed in the extra period and led      60-58 after Michaela Hunter's free throw with 1:22 left. Kara      Wright tied it at 60 on a jumper with 56 seconds left, and      Rockcastle County held for the final shot.       Lady Rockets coach Chrysti Noble chose not to call a      timeout.       ``They're experienced, and they've been here,'' she said.      ``I was like, `No, let them go. Let them determine the      outcome of the ballgame.' They did.''       Lawrence drove to the lane and nailed her jumper from the      right elbow.       ``I was feeling it,'' Lawrence said. ``It was a terrible-     looking shot, but I had faith in myself. I knew I would hit      it.''       Hammond said there was a bit of confusion in the final      minute.       ``I kept asking, `What offense are you running? What      offense are you running?' '' Hammond said. ``(Lawrence) had      that look in her eye that she was taking it to the hole.      She's done that over and over again. We knew it was in her      heart, and we trusted her for that shot.''       Manual called a timeout with 0.5 second left but couldn't      get a final shot.       Pendleton was left to wonder what might have been with      junior guard April Wilson out since the regional final with a      broken hand. He also had two seniors foul out in the final--     Raven Hester with 1:29 left in regulation and Mechael Guess      at the 2:49 mark of overtime.       ``To do all of this without April is amazing,'' Pendleton      said. ``That shows you how great this team is. . . . Mechael      fouling out was a huge problem, huge. You take away our No. 1      scoring punch and rebounding. That was a huge blow.''       For Rockcastle County it was a huge win and gave the 12th      Region its first state champion since Laurel County in 1991.       Noble, in her 21st season at Rockcastle County, said the      victory was important for the school of 910 students and the      community of Mount Vernon.       ``It's so good to know there's something good from      Rockcastle County instead of hearing all the bad stuff,'' she      said. ``There are a lot of good things that happen in our      community. . . .       ``When you come through Rockcastle you'll get to see a sign      up, I hope, that says, `Welcome to Rockcastle County, 2011      state champions of girls' basketball.' ''                          ____________________
