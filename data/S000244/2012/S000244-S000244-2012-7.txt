Chair, I rise today in strong support of the Sensenbrenner-Kind Amendment to the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act. This amendment waives the time restrictions to award the Medal of Honor to Lieutenant Alonzo Cushing.  This award is long overdue as Lt. Cushing heroically served his country during the Civil War. Lt. Cushing was born in Delafield, WI, which is located within my district, and raised in New York. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, and after graduating, was put in command of Battery A, 4th United States Artillery, Army of the Potomac for the Union Army. Lt. Cushing was praised for his valor and heroics throughout the Civil War, but it was his actions at the Battle of Gettysburg which have led to his consideration for our nation's highest award.  Cushing's battery was at the focal point of the Confederate attack on July 3rd at the Battle of Gettysburg. The intense bombardment preceding the charge by General George Pickett's troops left Cushing wounded by shell fragments, many of his men also wounded, and with only two working guns. Rather than withdraw, Lt. Cushing continued to lead his unit before succumbing to a fatal gunshot wound.  The Medal of Honor was not awarded posthumously during the Civil War, so Lt. Cushing was not considered. Years later, after the policy was changed to award the medal to the dead, Lt. Cushing's name simply did not come up. My office became aware of Lt. Cushing's heroic feat almost ten years ago, and I am pleased that while it has taken almost 150 years for Lt. Cushing to be honored for his actions, we are one step closer to making this happen. I urge my colleagues to support the Sensenbrenner-Kind Amendment.
