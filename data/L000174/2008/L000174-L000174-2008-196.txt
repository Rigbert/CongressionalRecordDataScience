President, I rise today to congratulate Carris Reels of Rutland, VT, for receiving the 2008 ESOP Association's ``Company of the Year'' award.  Founded in 1951 by Henry Carris, and bought by his son, Bill Carris, in 1980, Carris Reels sells a full line of manufactured reel products for a wide variety of industries. Today, Carris Reels has about 550 employee owners andeight locations nationwide. The company became 100-percent employee owned in January 2008.  One of the unique characteristics of Carris Reels is the company's steering committee, which goes beyond the basic functions of most ESOP committees and takes responsibility for allocations of benefits, quality of work-life issues, communications, training, and governance. Made up of both management and corporate employees, the Committee keeps alive the vision of former owner Bill Carris who moved the company toward employee ownership in 1995. Bill has said that organizations consist of three dimensions: spiritual, emotional, and physical. The strong business his family built and the employees now own is proof positive that these dimensions will remain a legacy at Carris Reels.  Carris Reels also is a strong supporter of the Vermont Employee Ownership Center, VEOC, a statewide nonprofit organization founded in 2001 to provide information and resources to owners interested in selling their business to their employees, employee groups interested in purchasing a business, and entrepreneurs who wish to start up a company with broadly shared ownership. To date, the VEOC has given direct assistance to over 60 Vermont businesses, employing over 1,700 Vermonters. I applaud the VEOC for holding its Sixth Annual Employee Ownership Conference in Burlington later this week.  Once again, I congratulate all of the employees at Carris Reels for this well-deserved recognition. They make great reels; they do business well; and they treat their employees right--all of these accomplishments, I believe, are related.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an article about the award from the June 2, 2008, Rutland Herald be printed in the Record so that all Senators can read about the success and admirable business practices of this visionary Vermont company.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, June 2, 2008]               Carris Reels Wins `Company of Year' Award                           (By Bruce Edwards)       Carris Reels will occupy a special place at this week's      sixth annual Vermont Employee Ownership Conference in      Burlington.       The Rutland-based company was recently presented with the      national 2008 ESOP Company of the Year award by the ESOP      Association--the national trade association for companies      with employee stock ownership plans.       ``Carris Reels is an example of the value and potential      that employee ownership can bring to (a) company,'' J.      Michael Keeling, president of The ESOP Association, said in a      statement. ``The employee owners of Carris Reels strive to      make their company stronger each day and it shows in the work      they do and in the value they place on the individuals who      make up their company.''       Founded in 1951 by Henry Carris, the company manufactures a      line of reels for the wire, cable and rope industries. The      100-percent employee-owned company has 550 workers at eight      locations around the country.       According to Don Jamison of the Vermont Employee Ownership      Center, the state has the highest number of employee-owned      companies per capita in the country. Jamison said there are      approximately 10,000 ESOPs in the country, with 30 such      companies in Vermont and another 10 companies that are      workers co-operatives.       Jamison said one important benefit of an employee-owned      company is that it ensures the company stays local. ``If an      owner is exiting (selling) and is concerned about his or her      employees, it can ensure that the company will continue as it      has been, provided there is a new group of managers to take      over responsibilities.''       He said employee-owned companies also give a direct stake      to employees who reap the profits when the company performs      well. ``With a combination of participation and ownership,      you see a pretty significant boost in productivity gains,''      Jamison said.       He also said there are tax advantages for an owner who      sells their company to employees with the potential of      getting a rollover in the capital gains tax.       As an example of the productivity gains that are realized      with an ESOP, Jamison said two recent winners of the Deane C.      Davis Outstanding Vermont Business Award, Resource Systems      Group and King Arthur Flour Co., are both majority-owned by      their employees.       Jamison said while setting up an ESOP is a complex process,      it can be well worth the effort in the long run for the      company, its employees and the owner,       One of the conference's workshops this week is based on a      Carris Reels initiative called ``Inclusive Decision-Making.''       ``They're really trying very hard to make their company 100      percent employee governed,'' Jamison said.       According to the national ESOP Association, a unique      component of Carris Reels is its steering committee which      goes beyond most ESOP committees and assumes decision-making      for a number of functions including: allocation of benefits,      quality of work-life issues, communications, training and      governance. The committee meets twice a year to review      financial information and receives operational updates from      the various departments.       The Carris committee is made up of management and employees      who serve three-year terms. In addition, the ESOP Association      points out that the committee keeps alive the vision of Bill      Carris, the son of founder Henry Carris, who moved the      company toward employee ownership in 1995. Bill Carris' long-     term plan is that ``organizations consist of three      dimensions: spiritual, emotional, and physical.''       The keynote speaker at the Vermont conference at Champlain      College is Veda Clark, CEO of Lite Control, an ESOP-owned      company in Massachusetts that is known for its employee      participation programs.       The conference agenda also includes the following      workshops:       Social responsibility and the employee-ownership movement,      How to successfully lead an employee-owned company, Balancing      short- and long-term rewards in companies with an ESOP, How      to leverage employee ownership as a marketing tool,      Structuring an employee-owned company for inclusive decision-     making, The differences between ESOPs and worker co-     operatives and which is best suited for their company, The      basics of financing an ESOP; and the keys to business      valuation, How to manage an established ESOP, Coping with      growth in worker cooperatives, Long-term ESOP sustainability;      and renewing the spirit of employee ownership.
