Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, before I yield to the gentleman from Arizona, to say that we have just heard one of the most partisan presentations for a subject the gentleman knows nothing about.  It is very, very disturbing to me that before this, this was a debate about refuges and parks and the ability to keep them open to the taxpayer. And it disturbs me, as I have said before, that I have been here long enough to remember before we had these television cameras. If Members want to play the television, that is fine, but we are trying to solve a problem.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Shadegg].
