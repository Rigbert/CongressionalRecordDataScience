President, I ask the Senator from Florida--to make sure I understand exactly what he is saying--here is a person in service to our country who was killed in combat. If that soldier had basically bought an insurance policy on his life, then the amount of money his family would receive from our Government is going to be reduced by the amount he would have received from that insurance policy? Is that, in shorthand, the way to describe the current law?
