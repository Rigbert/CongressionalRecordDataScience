Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I am not in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, again, I want to congratulate the gentleman on his amendment. I can confirm that the Corps of Engineers has said they have no objection to this. I guess just somehow, they couldn't get through the bureaucracy to release the land until the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela) brought this amendment to the floor. So the gentleman is doing a public service for his constituents and I believe the Nation, holding onto property unnecessarily. I recommend our colleagues support this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
