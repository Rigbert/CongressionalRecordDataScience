Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, and every penny of those billions will be borrowed, not only hitting hard at the needs today and causing cuts in the budget today and giving the President an excuse to say we do not have the money to rebuild our bridges and highways and waste water systems or do adequate homeland security and port security and we do not have enough money for education and we do not even have enough money for flak jackets for the young men and women over there, but every penny of those billions will be borrowed, indebting future generations of working Americans to pay for this misadventure, with no consequences.  The people who were so wrong. Mr. Wolfowitz, who I quoted earlier, who said Iraq would pay for itself, they are still making policy and spinning out fantasies at the White House. There are no consequences for making mistakes that cost the American people $20 billion in this White House.
