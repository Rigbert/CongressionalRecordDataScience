 President, I rise today to honor the remarkable life and career of one of baseball's greatest legends, and a native of the Commonwealth, the late Mr. Earle B. Combs. Known far and wide to fans as the Kentucky Greyhound, the Silver Fox and the Kentucky Colonel, Earle was a prime example of a gentleman who knew the value of hard work and determination.  Earle began his journey to greatness as a child on his father's farm in Pebworth, Owsley County, KY, where he and his siblings would play pickup games with homemade baseballs constructed out of leather and rubber trimmings from old, worn-out shoes and tightly wound string, and bats made with tree limbs found around the yard. Each spring, when warmer weather came, the rolling hills of farmland and hollows provided Earle with the perfect setting to develop a love for America's pastime.  But, as he grew older, he decided his calling in life was to teach. In 1917, Earle left his hometown of Pebworth to attend Eastern Kentucky State Normal School, now Eastern Kentucky University, and received his teaching certificate in 1919. To help pay for his education, Earle returned to eastern Kentucky to teach in one-room schools in Kentucky towns like Ida May and Levi. That was until destiny had other plans.  In 1918 after a faculty-student baseball game, Earle's abilities caught the eye of Dr. Charles Keith, an Eastern Kentucky State Normal School dean and former pro player, who recommended he try out for Eastern's team. After successfully landing a spot on the team, Earle's talent on the field started to gain him some much-deserved attention. In the summer of 1921, after his last season on Eastern's team, Earle played semiprofessional baseball in several Kentucky towns until he was offered a contract with the Louisville Colonels.  During his 2 years with the Colonels, Earle's miraculous talent earned him his career-long reputation as a line-drive hitter with reckless base-stealing ability. In 1924, this reputation traveled north all the way to New York, where the New York Yankees bought the young and talented Earle for $50,000.  In the years that followed, Earle became a leadoff hitter for the famed Yankees ``Murderers Row,'' a lineup of the late 1920s and early 1930s, and a member of the 1927 World Championship Yankees team where he played alongside other greats by the names of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. He was errorless in the 16 World Series games in which he played throughout his career, and ended with a career batting average of .325.  Earle retired in 1935 after sustaining a brutal outfield injury the year before, but remained a coach for the Yankees until 1944, during which he trained other baseball greats such as Joe DiMaggio. He was named to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY, in 1970.  Earle coached for several other teams before returning to Madison County where he served as a banking commissioner during Governor A.B. Chandler's second administration and on Eastern Kentucky University's board of regents for 19 years, serving as chairman for 2 of those years. Earle was a leader both on and off the diamond. He was known as a loving family man, a successful businessman, and above all, a true gentleman. He was a devoted father and grandfather and a loyal husband to his childhood sweetheart, the late Ruth Combs.  He valued hard-work and knew the importance of higher education. There is no question that Earle was someone who forever changed the game of baseball, who left an impression on those he taught, and who left a lasting legacy in both his community and throughout the Commonwealth.  The Booneville Sentinel recently published an article introducing a newportrait of the late Earle B. Combs that was hung on the outside of the courthouse in Owsley County, KY, on December 30, 2010. What an honor for this athlete and legend from his hometown and home county. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Booneville Sentinel, Jan. 12, 2011]               Earle B. Combs Portrait Hung at Courthouse                          (By Rosalind Turner)       Boonesville and Owsley County officials honored one of the      community's most famous sons Thursday, December 30 when a      portrait of the late Earle B. Combs was hung on the outside      of the Owsley County Courthouse.       Earle B. Combs, a native of Pebworth and the son of James      Jesse and Nannie (Brandenburg) Combs, was a major league      baseball player, a member of the 1929 New York Yankees and      was named to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, In 1917,      Combs left Owsley at age 17 to pursue a degree in education      at Eastern Kentucky Normal School (Eastern Kentucky      University). Though he earned his degree in 1919 and taught      at one-room schools in Ida May and Levi, he eventually      changed his career path to play baseball.       In 1924, he earned a position as the centerfielder and      leadoff hitter for the famed New York Yankees ``Murderers      Row'' lineup of the late 1920s and early 1930s, according to      the Earle Bryan Combs official website. He was a member of      the 1927 World Champion Yankees team, which also featured      baseball greats Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, and is considered      by many to be the greatest team in baseball history.       As the portrait was installed on the side of the      courthouse, the outgoing Owsley County Judge-Executive Cale      Turner and Booneville Mayor Charles Long were joined by one      of Combs' grandsons and two great-grandsons.       ``We are so honored,'' said Craig Combs of Richmond, a      grandson with very fond memories of his grandfather. ``Thank      you so much.''       Craig Combs praised Turner, Long and others who were      instrumental in seeing the project to fruition. In March,      Craig Combs came to Owsley to speak to Holly Shouse's class      at Owsley County Elementary School about his grandfather. He      said that he was later contacted about the courthouse project      and gave his permission for the officials to proceed.       ``I was very honored,'' he said. ``I was thrilled that you      (the project planners) were going to include grandfather.''       Turner said that it has been a long time goal of Mayor      Long's to have a portrait in the city honoring the famed      baseball player.       ``We're tickled to be here and we're tickled that (the      community) thought enough of him to put his picture on the      side of the courthouse. (It shows) obviously, how proud they      are of grandfather,'' said Craig Combs, who was accompanied      by his sons, John. 17, who plans to study vocal music at the      University of Louisville, and Christopher, 22, who played      baseball at Madison Central, graduated from the University of      Evansville and is currently working on his Ph.D. at the      University of Texas in aerospace engineering.       Earle B. Combs has had many honors bestowed upon him, but      for his grandson, this one is especially meaningful. ``Coming      from his hometown and his home county, this is something very      special,'' said Craig Combs. ``I appreciate Judge Turner and      Mayor Long for being so kind to us when we came down.''       Long said he is very pleased to see the community finally      honor its famous son with the portrait at the courthouse.       ``This has been a dream of Mayor Long's,'' said Turner.      ``He has brought it up at numerous meetings.''       The portrait by Robert Johnson of Madison Avenue Designs in      Georgetown joins other murals at the courthouse depicting      important Owsley County scenes.       Turner acknowledged the assistance of Jo'e Short, Kacey      Smith and Cassie Hudson, members of the Action Team. These      ladies wrote the application to the Flex-E ARC grant program      after attending the Brushy Fork Institute at Berea College      that got the ball rolling. ``This would not have happened      without the grant,'' he said. Additional matching funds for      the project came from the Owsley County Fiscal Court, the      Owsley County Action Team and Farmer's State Bank.       As a legendary baseball player, businessman and member of      the Eastern Kentucky University board of regents, Craig Combs      said his grandfather was much respected. However, his      grandson remembers more than baseball and business.       ``He was just Pop to me,'' he explained, recalling nights      spent With his grandfather and grandmother (Mimi), Ruth      McCollum, also a native of Owsley County, on their farm in      rural Madison County.       ``It was a magical time to grow up and be around them      because they cared so much for us. He was just a regular,      loving grandfather.''       Craig Combs recalls the stories about his grandfather's      baseball career and said he became the family's baseball      historian.       ``It was a wonderful upbringing to be around them. To be      their grandson was so special.''       Craig Combs said he remembers his grandfather very well. He      was 18 when Earle B. Combs passed away. Earle and Ruth Combs      had three children. Earle Jr., Charles and Donald Combs. Mrs.      Combs died in 1989.       Still a student, Earle Combs started playing baseball at      Eastern. That led to playing semi-professional ball in such      Kentucky towns as Winchester, High Splint and Lexington.      While playing for the Lexington Reos of the Bluegrass League,      he drew the attention of the Louisville Cardinals (American      Association), where he honed his skill in 1922 and 1923. In      1924, he was a rookie for the New York Yankees, patrolling      center field between Babe Ruth and Rob Meusel. The following      season, he was installed as the leadoff hitter in the famed      ``Murderers Row'' Yankee lineup. He kept that position for      the remaining 11 years of his career. During his career, he      batted over .300 nine times, had 200 or more hits three      times, paced the American League in triples three times and      twice led all AL outfielders in putouts, He had a career      batting average of .325. In the outfield, he was known as      ``swift and sure-handed,'' according to the Earle B. Combs      official website.       A favorite of Yankee fans, nicknames bestowed upon him      included ``Kentucky Greyhound,'' ``Silver Fox'' and      ``Kentucky Colonel.'' After an injury, he retired in 1935 and      coached for the team until 1944. The first year he coached,      he trained his replacement, Joe DiMaggio. He coached for      several other teams before retiring in the mid-1950s and      returning to his Madison County farm. He served as Kentucky      banking commissioner during Gov. A.B. Chandler's second      administration (1955-59). He served on Eastern Kentucky      University's board of regents from 1956-1975 and was chairman      from 1972-74. A dormitory at EKU (Earle Combs Hall) bears his      name and the school gives an athletic scholarship in his      honor. He also is a charter member of EKU's Athletics Hall of      Fame.       Earle B. Combs was named to the National Baseball Ball of      Fame in Cooperstown, NY in 1970. His baseball career included      being part of nine World Championships as a player and coach      in New York.       Many from Owsley County, including Mayor Long and Judge      Turner who watched the portrait go on the courthouse wall,      are proud of the numerous honors and accolades bestowed upon      this Hall of Fame baseball player. They are also gratified      that he found fame for himself while practicing the values he      learned growing up in Pebworth in Owsley County, Ky.                          ____________________
