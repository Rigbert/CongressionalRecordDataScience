 President, I want to visit with my colleagues and our constituents about the issues of the tax relief that was recently passedby the Congress of the United States and signed by the President on June 7 and will be the reason that tax rebate checks will go out, distributing $65 billion of overtaxation to the American people--back to the American people so they can spend it, so it will do more economic good than if it is politically distributed here in Washington, DC.  That bill not only has the $65 billion of tax refunds that will start going out next week and be out by September 30, but it already has reductions for other rates.
