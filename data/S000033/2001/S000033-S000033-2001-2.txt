 Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and I rise in very strong support of the Obey amendment.  I must say that I find the arguments being made against the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) to be very, very curious indeed. Frankly, I think the American people will find it very difficult to understand how we as a Nation cannot afford another $6.5 billion to protect ourselves against bioterrorism, to make sure that our airlines are safe, to make sure that the people of this country have adequate health care in, God forbid, the event of a terrible attack against us. We cannot afford that $6.5 billion, but somehow or another we can afford hundreds of billions of dollars in the last year for tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population and for the largest corporations in America.                              {time}  1630  Tell that sense of logic to the American people.  When our people get on airplanes, they want to know that the baggage on that plane is safely inspected. When people walk into airports, they want to know that the people who are doing security are properly trained. My State borders the Canadian border. The people in Vermont and throughout this country want to know that our border security is strong.  So I would strongly urge the Members to get their priorities right. If we can afford hundreds of billions in tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent, we can provide strong security for the American people against bioterrorism.
