Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I suggest respectfully that this amendment is, frankly, unnecessary. As I mentioned before, I not only oppose it, but under the bill all areas that have been designated have a 3-year grandfather clause. And if everybody loves these areas, the people that represent these areas can come back, bring them before the committee and they become a reality.  All we are asking, to get back to the original intent of the bill, 901, is put this back in the hands of the people of America, the United States Congress, that makes these designations. But under my bill, in the sense of fairness, I did give them a 3-year grandfather clause.  So I do not believe this amendment is necessary. We can do it through the proper process. So I strongly oppose the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California, [Mr. Riggs].
