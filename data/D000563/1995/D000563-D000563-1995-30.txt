Speaker, this is day two of the Gingrich-Dole Government shutdown. The next time Speaker Gingrich stands in front of the TV cameras, I hope the press will ask him a few questions.  Speaker Gingrich, if your Government shutdown sent 800,000 Federal employees home without pay, why do you keep drawing your congressional paycheck?  Speaker Gingrich, if your Government shutdown stops checks for the widows of American veterans, why should your congressional paycheck keep coming?  If we turned off the TV cameras and the machine printing congressional paychecks, this Gingrich gridlock would end in 5 minutes.  Tomorrow, in the Subcommittee on District of Columbia of the Committee on Appropriations, my congressional colleagues will have an opportunity to vote on my proposal: No budget, no pay. It stops congressional paychecks when there is a Government shutdown or a default on the national debt. Mr. Gingrich should put his paycheck on the line, not everybody else's.                          ____________________
