Speaker. I will certainly notify the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), one of the sponsors; the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), another one of the sponsors; and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee), another one of the sponsors. I regret that we need to go ahead with the issue of the privileges of the House. I will tell the gentleman I do not know that I have seen an amendment as mischaracterized as this amendment was, and I was hopeful that we could simply resolve it. But if that cannot be done, then we will have to have it subject to debate.  I thank the gentleman for his information.
