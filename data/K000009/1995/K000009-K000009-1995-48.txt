Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Conyers amendment to referee the gigantic money interests who have their hands in the pockets of the American people.  There has been enough money spent on lobbying this bill to sink a battleship.  I wish to insert in the Record a partial list of what over $40 million in lobbying contributions has bought. I leave it to the American people to make their own judgments. This bill is living proof of what unlimited money can do to buy influence and the Congress of the United States.POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS BY REGIONAL BELL OPERATING COMPANIES [RBOC] HARD  MONEY PAC CONTRIBUTIONS TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS YEAR TO DATE 1995 \1\  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  Democrats  Republicans------------------------------------------------------------------------Ameritech.......................................     38,950     113,588 Bell Atlantic...................................      2,100      12,466 Pacific Telesis.................................     10,500      27,949 Southwestern Bell...............................     29,600      48,200                                                  -----------------------      Partial total YTD.........................     78,150     202,203 ------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Several of the RBOC's have chosen to report their contributions less  frequently than once a month, as the law allows.

The four major telecommunications industries involved in      this legislative battle--local telephone services, long      distance service providers, broadcasters and cable      interests--contributed $30.9 million in political action      committee (PAC) funds to congressional candidates, and $8.6      million in soft money to Democratic and Republican national      party committees, during the period January 1985 through      December 1994, the Common Cause study found.

Long distance providers      gave $9.5 million in political contributions; cable      television interests gave $8 million; and broadcasters gave      $4.7 million.       The biggest single telecommunications industry donation      came from Tele-Communications Inc, the country's biggest      cable company. The company gave a $200,000 soft money      contribution to the Republican National Committee five days      before the last November's elections.       Telecommunication PACs were especially generous to members      of two key committees that recently passed bills to rewrite      telecommunication regulations. House Commerce Committee      members received, on average, more than $65,000 each from      telecommunications PACs; Senate Commerce Committee members      received, on average, more than $107,000 each.       Two-thirds of House freshmen received PAC contributions      from telecommunications interests immediately following their      November election wins. Between November 9 and December 31,      1994, telecommunications PACs gave new Representatives-elect      a total $115,500.       In January, top executives of telecommunications companies      that gave a total $23.5 million in political contributions      during the past decade were invited to closed-door meetings      with Republican members of the House Commerce Committee.      Consumer and rate-payer groups--who were not major political      donors--were not invited to the special meetings.       Lobbyists for the telecommunications industry represent a      wide array of Washington insiders. For example, former Reagan      and Bush Administration officials represent long distance      providers, while a former Clinton official represents local      telephone interests. Lobbying on behalf of broadcast      interests are former aids to both Republican and Democratic      Members of Congress.       In addition to their political contributions during the      past decade, telecommunications interests contributed      $221,000 in soft money to the Republican National Committee      during the first three months of 1995. (Democratic National      Committee soft money information for the first six months of      1995 will be available in July.) House Commerce Committee Members Receive On Average $65,000 Each From                  telecom Pacs--Double The House Average       Telecommunications industry lobbyists ``have seldom met      more receptive lawmakers,'' than the members of the House      Commerce Committee.--The New York Times       Telecommunications industry Pacs gave a total $6,676,147 in      contributions to current Senators during the past decade, an      average $66,761 per Senator, according to the Common Cause      study.Senate Commerce Committee Members Receive On Average $107,000 Each from                               Telecom Pacs       The Common Cause study found that members of the Senate      Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee received      nearly twice as much PAC money on average from      telecommunications interests during the past decade as other      Senators--an average of $107,730 compared to $57,152 received      by Senators not on the committee.                     ``Robber Barons of the '90s''       ``By and large, the public is not represented by the      lawyers and the lobbyists in Washington. The few public      advocates are overwhelmed financially. It's all very fine to      say that you are in favor of competition. I am. The      Administration is. Congress is. But competition won't give      you everything the country needs from communications      companies. We've got to be able to stand up to      business on certain occasions and say, `It's not just about      competition, it's about the public interest.' ''--Reed Hundt,      Federal Communications Commission Chair as quoted in The New      Yorker
