President, if you are a student of history, the speech you just heard is not a new speech. It is a speech that has been given repeatedly in the Senate Chamber. It was back in the 1930s, when a President named Franklin Delano Roosevelt had an idea, and the idea was radical at the time. Here was the radical idea: Shouldn't we allow people, during the course of their work-life, to put a little money away and to invest for their retirement so that when they reach the age of 65, they will have a program called Social Security?  That was considered a radical socialist idea, taking money from everyone to create a positive program to help retirees across America when they reach retirement age. It takes away our freedom, they said. We ought to be able to make our own choices in life. They resisted it, but, fortunately, they failed and in their failure allowed the creation of the Social Security Program, which is the single most popular government program in America today. Over 95 percent of Americans count on Social Security to make sure that when they reach retirement, there is something there to take care of them, but that wasn't the end of the speech you just heard. It was repeated again in the 1960s because another Democratic President by the name of Lyndon Baines Johnson came up with a notion that, perhaps, if people are going to live a little longer and have Social Security, they should also be able to have affordable healthcare. So Lyndon Baines Johnson suggested the creation of Medicare.  What did the critics say about Medicare? Socialism; that you would collect money from people all across America just to provide for the benefits to those who are retired; that you would take away our freedom to make our own savings plans for our future by saying we have to pay into Medicare. It is an attack on our freedom, they said. It is a socialist idea, they said. Thank goodness they lost in that debate as well.  What happened, of course, was a creation of a Medicare Program, and we can see what came about as a result of it, a dramatic increase in the number of hospitals in America and doctors in America. We started taking healthcare seriously when it came to senior citizens. What is the proof in the pudding? Senior citizens started living longer and longer lives. They were healthier, they were independent, they were strong because of this so-called socialist program of Medicare.  So if you listened this morning as Republican leaders came to the floor and decried socialism again, what is their point now? Their point now is, they believe that if we make a national effort toward dealing with climate change and global warming, it is socialism. It takes away our freedom.  I would agree with them in this respect. If we do something as a nation, a sensible approach that is moderate, constructive, and positive, it is going to change the future. It is going to take away the opportunity that some of us will have to leave a planet for our children that is uninhabitable.  Does anyone doubt--does anyone doubt--that we are dealing with some change in the climate that we face around this world? Does anyone doubt that the scientific evidence, year after year after year, about the increased temperature of this planet has had a negative impact on the world we live in--more extreme weather events than we have ever seen, tornadoes in Taylorville, IL, in December?  Listen, I grew up in Illinois. I was awakened many times in the summer to get down in the basement because there was a tornado warning. My parents were worried about it. It was part of growing up in the Midwest, part of growing up in Illinois. I don't recall ever going down to the basement around Christmas. It turns out that tornado season in Illinois, and many other places, is now becoming a year-round event and flooding and fires and flooding in the city of Miami. All of these things are evidence to me that something is going on, and we have the scientific explanation. Greenhouse gas emissions are creating a different environment, warming our planet, changing our weather patterns.  I have come to the floor repeatedly over the last several years and asked one basic question, can anyone name any major political party in the world today--any major political party in the world today--that, like the Republican Party of the United States, denies climate change?  I make that open challenge over and over again on the floor and have never had a Republican come to me and say: No, there is another party somewhere that takes our position on the issue that climate change is a fallacy and a fiction. I will tell you, though--maybe I am not supposed to repeat this--but one Republican Senator, after I made that challenge over and over again, drew me aside in the elevator, looked in both directions, and said: I think there is a political party in Australia that also denies climate change. That is as good as it gets--one more party somewhere halfway around the world.  When Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, comes to the floor and challenges the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, with the basic questions, I believe we have the right to ask for an answer.  To the Republicans, to my friend from South Dakota who just spoke, to Senator McConnell of Kentucky, the first question is this: Do you believe that there is such a thing as climate change and global warming? That is a pretty easy question. The scientists overwhelmingly believe it. I do too.  The second question that Senator Schumer has posed to them is this: Do you believe that our human activity has something to do with it? Well, the scientific evidence is overwhelming again. Once we got into the industrial age and starting spewing all of the smoke and chemicals into the air, things started warming up on this planet Earth.  The third question that Senator Schumer has posed to the Republicans is basically fundamental, as well: Whatare you going to do about it? The answer is obvious. For the 4 years the Republicans have been in control in the Senate, they have done nothing--nothing. Now they have a President who has the United States as the only country in the world--the only Nation on Earth--that has withdrawn from the Paris accord, which tried to create a global strategy to deal with climate change.  The President is enthralled by the notion that climate change is a fallacy, a fiction, and so are the Senate Republicans. So any effort to address this is socialism. Any idea that we should come together as a nation and work toward a planet that our kids can live on is taking away our freedom. Well, we know better.  Under President Obama, we started moving toward more fuel-efficient cars and trucks. A gallon of gas is giving us more mileage because of government policy. Well, I guess it took away the freedom of gas guzzlers, but we can at least say we made a positive step forward, and this administration is stepping backward, and they are doing it for the fossil fuel industry--for oil and gas and coal interests. They are coming to the floor and trying to get us into a fight, once again, over socialism when we talk about government policies that would guide us in the right direction for the future.                        Prescription Drug Costs  Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to give the first of what may turn out to be many speeches on a subject that affects every single American. The question is the rising cost of prescription drugs in this country.  The first drug that I wanted to address, I wanted to choose carefully because I wanted to choose a drug that really is important to the largest number of Americans. So I thought to myself, what is the most commonly used life-or-death drug in America today? There is some debate about it, but I am going to suggest that it is insulin.  In 1923--almost 100 years ago--researchers were awarded the Nobel Prize for the groundbreaking discovery of insulin to treat diabetes--1923.  The chief scientist in the discovery was Dr. Frederick Banting. He believed that insulin should be accessible to everyone. His team sold the patent to the University of Toronto for $1 so that ``no one could secure a profitable monopoly'' on the production of insulin. That might seem hard to believe today, with the price of insulin having increased more than 600 percent over the past two decades.  Take a look at the chart, which maps the increases in price. Eli Lilly's blockbuster insulin drug, Humalog, was introduced in 1996 at a cost of $21. By 2019, the cost went up to $329.  Sanofi's Lantus was $35 when it came to the market in 2001. It now costs $270. The insulin drug, NovoLog, cost $40 in 2001. By 2018, it went up to $289--for insulin.  How many Americans are affected by this? There are 30 million Americans who live with type 1 or type 2 diabetes--almost 10 percent of our population. Approximately 7.5 million of them rely on insulin to manage their blood sugar levels. It is a matter of life and death. Yet patients are suffering because of these dramatic price spikes.  A recent study found that one-quarter of patients who rely on insulin have been forced to ration their doses due to cost, basically in contravention of the advice of their doctors.  This is a story that many of us have heard here. Last year, we heard from the mother of Alec Raeshawn Smith. He went off his mom's health insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, he could remain covered until he reached the age of 26. He had diabetes. He had coverage for his insulin until he reached the age of 26. Then he couldn't afford to buy health insurance. So when he went off of that insurance, he was faced with the monthly cost of his insulin out of pocket. That monthly cost was $1,000.  He managed a little restaurant, and he couldn't come up with $1,000. So he decided that he would ration his insulin and not take as much as was required by his doctor, trying to make it last between paychecks. Alec died as a result of that decision.  How is it that in the richest country on Earth, patients are having to ration their insulin or start GoFundMe websites just to survive?  Insulin was a cure found in the 20th century that patients now cannot afford in the 21st century. Pharma's war on patients with diabetes must come to an end.  Yesterday, there was a hearing, widely televised, where seven or eight of the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies faced the music before the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Grassley, Senator Wyden, and many others asked questions about the issue I am raising today: What is going on? Why are you raising prices so high? There were no good answers coming from these executives.  Today, I am going to start highlighting on the floor of the Senate the egregious cases of pharmaceutical greed in the United States.  Years ago, there was a Senator from Wisconsin named William Proxmire. He was an unusual man. He was far different than most Senators today. He was the type of fellow who would show up at the University of Wisconsin games, passing out cards. That was his style of campaigning. He didn't spend a lot of money on television and radio.  He really was a grassroots politician, and he was a tenacious fellow. He started something called the Golden Fleece Award--Proxmire of Wisconsin's Golden Fleece Award. Once a month or more, he would come to the floor and talk about waste--taxpayer waste--in our Federal Government. It developed a national reputation.  In deference to Senator Proxmire, whom I had a chance to meet when I was a college student, I am going to try to follow in his tradition by pointing out egregious examples of greed by the pharmaceutical industry in the United States on a regular basis with the Pharma Fleece Award.  My first Pharma Fleece Award is for the pharmaceutical industry's extortion of 7.5 million diabetic patients in America who depend on insulin. This is a lifesaving product that has been around for almost a century.  How can the most common life-and-death drug be so expensive? First, the United States is an outlier. The same companies I am talking about sell exactly the same drug in other countries around the world for a fraction of the cost.  The United States represents only 15 percent of all of the global insulin market; yet we generate more than half--more than 50 percent--of Pharma's revenue for this drug.  How can Lantus cost $372 in the United States? The exact same drug made by the same company costs $46 in France and $67 in Canada. Why? Why are we paying five, six, and seven times more in the United States for exactly the same drug? It is because the governments of France and Canada care about the cost, and they say to the company Sanofi, in this case, that makes Lantus: If you want to sell Lantus in Canada, we are not going to let you hike the prices and raise them to the high heavens. We are going to keep the prices reasonable so that the people of Canada can afford this lifesaving drug. What do we do in the United States? Nothing. We let them charge whatever they wish.  How can Lantus cost $372 for Americans, while the same, exact drug for the French is $46, and just across the border, in Canada, it is $67?  Our problem is that our system doesn't function as a free market. There is virtually no competition. Three companies control the insulin supply in America: Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk.  Typically, in a free market, three competitors would lower the prices, wouldn't they? But in America, these three charge as much as they can and get away with it because they are protected by government-granted monopolies.  We should reward innovation, we should promote research, and we should ensure that companies do make a profit for their good work, but abusive manufacturers should not be protected from competition by our government.  Lantus has been on the market since the year 2000. Sanofi has received 49 secondary patents on insulin. What does that mean? They have created a fortress around this lucrative drug for a 37-year monopoly in offering this drug for sale in America.  Unfortunately, there is no effective deterrent today against Big Pharma's greed and price gouging on these and so many other drugs. That is why, earlier this month, I introduced a bill calledthe Forcing Limits on Abusive and Tumultuous Prices Act, or FLAT Prices Act. This legislation will discourage and deter the pharmaceutical industry from raising prices by reducing the government monopoly periods when they do.  You see, companies are awarded monopoly periods from 5 to 12 years by the Food and Drug Administration for drug approval beyond the patent protection. My FLAT Prices Act would reduce this FDA-granted exclusivity period for a drug whose price increases more than 10 percent a year, bringing generic competitors into the marketplace, creating real competition, and trying to lower prices for Americans.  That brings us to another issue. Today, there remains no generic, no biosimilar insulin that can be substituted in a pharmacy. Think about it. Almost a century after the discovery of human insulin and even half a century after the discovery of synthetic and analog insulin, we still don't have a generic insulin for sale in America that is affordable.  I will acknowledge that these changes in insulin have improved the quality of life for patients. They have made them safer, more effective, and more convenient, but these changes have delayed the development of generic substitutes.  There are other reasons the FDA has regulated insulin as a drug rather than as a biologic, placing insulin under a framework with a much higher bar than generics to prove they are substitutes. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--the Food and Drug Administration is supposed to be shifting its regulatory process for insulin to enable copycat versions, known as biosimilars, to be approved quickly. Unfortunately, FDA's plan to implement this law will not bring relief to patients any time soon.  I do believe that the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb, truly wants to lower costs and spur competition. I wasn't convinced when his nomination came up for a vote, but I have had subsequent conversations with him, and I think he is genuine. I think he wants to see the prices come down.  However, the Food and Drug Administration's current plan will effectively freeze the approval process for lower cost insulin and force generic insulin makers who are under review to resubmit their new applications each year.  This creates a 2-year lockup where it is unlikely that any new insulin competitors will come to market. America's diabetic patients cannot wait.  That is why Senator Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, and I are sending a letter urging the Food and Drug Administration to revise and bring flexibility to this process so we can get the lower cost insulin on the market approved sooner.  Two weeks ago, I received a little note from a constituent in Mount Vernon, IL. That is downstate, near where my father was born. He wrote that both he and his daughter had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1997. At that time, their Humalog insulin cost $10. Today, he writes that the cost is $300 a bottle, and he needs six bottles a month.  His monthly costs have risen from $600 to $1,800. Here is what he said in this letter:       At some point, drug companies must be held to account for      the actions they are taking. These cost increases are costing      American citizens to choose between insulin and eating in      many cases. I'm tired of listening to all the excuses. . . .      what is it going to take for Congress to do its job?  I agree with my constituent. Congress needs to step up and demand real change. The sky-high cost of life-or-death insulin is literally killing Americans.  My work with Senator Cramer to speed FDA approval of lower cost insulin and my bill to shorten monopolies for abusive pharma companies are a start. This pharma fleecing of insulin patients across America must end.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Iowa.                         Proposed Rules Change
