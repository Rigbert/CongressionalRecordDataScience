Chairman, the bill includes section 122 because the Bureau of Land Management does not have the authority to regulate methane emissions. Congress has given that authority to the Environmental Protection Agency. BLM's proposed regulation is just another part of the administration's overly aggressive regulatory agenda and overly broad interpretation of current law.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
