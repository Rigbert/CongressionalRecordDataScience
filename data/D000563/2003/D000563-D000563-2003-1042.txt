William Manchester's famous biography of that period of Winston Churchill's life is entitled ``Alone'' because he stood alone warning the people of England of the crisis that was to come.  I say to my colleague from the State of West Virginia, his role in this crisis facing America has been Churchillian in that he has taken the leadership in the Senate time and again to warn us of a looming crisis. I ask him if he agrees with most people that to have an orange alert and to tell mothers and fathers across America to put aside some bottles of water, buy some duct tape and plastic sheeting, and prepare for the crisis of terrorism is not enough; that we as a nation should have taken this looming crisis seriously long ago?  I believe I know the answer to this question, but, Madam President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia for his leadership. I thank him for standing on this floor and reminding us that there is still an unfulfilled agenda, and that if we face terrorism, we have to be honest with the American people. We have tried in the Senate, but we have failed. We are not as prepared as we should be to face this threat.  I ask the Senator from West Virginia--I am not going to take any more time from his great comments--if he would comment on the Churchill analogy.
