Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5086 directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study on the feasibility of designating the Chief Standing Bear National Historic Trail in Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Kansas. The trail extends 550 miles following the same route taken by Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca people during Federal Indian removal in 1877 and their subsequent return to Nebraska.  Chief Standing Bear played an important role in American history. He was the first Native American recognized by the United States Government as a person under law, following his arrestand ensuing trial for leaving his reservation in Oklahoma without permission.  Chief Standing Bear was honoring his son's dying wish to be buried in the land of his birth and traveled with his son's remains, along with 20 other members of his tribe, through harsh conditions from Oklahoma back to their ancestral lands in Nebraska.                              {time}  1245  Unfortunately, at that time, leaving the reservation was a violation of law.  At the very least, 135 years later, it is only right that we look into the feasibility of including this trail as part of the National Historic Trails system, to reflect on a not-so-proud period of American history in our country when Native Americans were treated as second-class citizens and honor the courage of Chief Standing Bear in living up to the promise he had made to his son.  I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for advancing this legislation, and Representative Fortenberry for his leadership on this bill.  I support passage, and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
