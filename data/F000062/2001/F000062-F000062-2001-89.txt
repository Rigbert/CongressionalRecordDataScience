 President, on behalf of Senator Hutchison and myself and 71 other Senate cosponsors, I rise today to offer legislation to extend the life of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp for an additional six years.  I was surprised by the U.S. Postal Service's recent rule-making which could possibly terminate the Breast Cancer Research Stamp program by next July. The Postal Service effectively decided to permit only one stamp to be issued at a time to raise funds for a specific cause.  This rule would therefore force competition for survival among a number of other potential and worthy fund-raising stamps. This action would be a terrible mistake.  The Breast Cancer Research Stamp has demonstrated itself to be a highly effective and self-supporting fund-raiser.  To date, the stamp has raised $21.1 million for research in addition to the $60,000 the Postal Service has recovered for administrative costs.  Every year the stamp has existed, it has generated strong consumer sales. In two months of operation in fiscal year 1998, consumers bought 9.2 million stamps, generating $700,000 for research on net sales of $3.68 million.  In fiscal year 1999, consumers bought 101.2 million stamps, yielding 7.5 million for research on net sales of $40.48 million.  In fiscal year 2000, consumers purchased 119.9 million stamps, garnering $8 million for research on net sales of $47.96 million.  In fiscal year 2001, the program continues to be vital. With two months remaining, consumers have already bought 75.2 million stamps, raising $4.8 million for research on sales of $30.08 million.  In total, the American people have purchased 305 million Breast Cancer Research stamps. This means that, on average, more than one stamp has been purchased for every citizen in our Nation and 100 million stamps were sold per year since the stamp was first introduced in August 1998.  Clearly, the program continues to have a strong and committed customer base.  We should also recognize that the National Cancer Institute and the Department of Defense have put these research dollars to good use by funding novel and innovative research in the area of breast cancer.  According to Dr. Richard Klausner, National Cancer Institute director, these awards benefit ``over a dozen critical areas of breast cancer research.''  Millions of Americans have bought the stamps to honor loved ones with the disease, to highlight their own personal battle with breast cancer, or to promote general public awareness. Virtually everywhere I travel, people tell me they buy the stamps in the hopes of helping to find a cure.  Moreover, one cannot calculate in dollars or cents the value the stamp has played in increasing the visibility of the disease and the need for additional research funding.  The life of such an extraordinary program should not prematurely end because of an administrative decision.  There is still so much more to do because this disease has far reaching effects on our nation: breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer among women. In 2001, approximately 192,200 women will get breast cancer. This year 40,200 women will die from breast cancer. Breast cancer represents 31 percent of all new cancers faced by women. Approximately 3 million women in the United States are living with breast cancer. Of these individuals, 2 million know they have the disease, and 1 million remain unaware of their condition.  We have learned over the past few years how effective the Breast Cancer Research Stamp is at promoting public awareness of the disease. Yet, we still must reach out to the one million American women who do not know of their cancer.  Some may argue that the Breast Cancer Stamp should end so that other semi-postal stamps can have their turn at raising funds for a cause.  But it is a faulty premise that only one semi-postal stamp can succeed at a time. I believe there is room for multiple fund-raising stamps at the same time.  Every year, the Postal Service issues dozens of commemorative steps. In 2001, for example, the Postal Service sold stamps commemorating topics as various as diabetes awareness, Black Heritage, and military veterans. Many of these stamps have sold extraordinarily well.  The viability of a postage stamp depends on its appeal to postal customers. Over a three year period, the Breast Cancer Research has demonstrated a sustained and committed customer base.  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation to grant the Breast Cancer Stamp another six years. Every dollar raised to fight the disease can help save lives.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1256       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
