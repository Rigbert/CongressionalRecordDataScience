I am glad he said what he did. It is very significant. People don't look at Iran as seriously as they should. It is not even classified that Iran is going to have the capability of a weapon of mass destruction and a nuclear warhead and a delivery system by 2015. That was the very reason they were going to have a ground-based interceptor in Poland, so we can defend against something coming from that direction, since all our ground-based interceptors are on the west coast in Alaska and southern California.  When we see things such as this, and the fact that they are coming out and doing things they haven't done before, that just tells me our expectations of their nuclear capability are very true and it is very serious                               Jobs Bill  That is not what I want to talk about. In the wake of the defeat of President Obama's jobs bill, I wished to give a couple thoughts here and then talk about something we better look out for in the future. That jobs bill failed by a large margin, and we heard the President say: Pass the bill, pass the bill, pass the bill. We didn't pass the bill. I can see why the President wants to consider passing some kind of jobs bill right away, when we stop and remember what he did with the last one. The last stimulus bill was $825 billion. This package was rammed through the Congress shortly after he entered office. The Recovery Act, as it was called, had only $27 billion out of $825 billion for roads and highways. The occupier of the chair is very well aware of my concern over infrastructure in America.  I remember when that bill was on the floor and Senator Boxer, from California, and I had an amendment to increase that amount. It was only 3 percent of the total of $825 billion that would go to roads, highways, maintenance, bridges, and this type of thing--only 3 percent. We were trying to raise that to 30 percent. If that had happened, then look where we would be today. We would have the jobs, we would have all the shovel-ready jobs throughout America.  In my State of Oklahoma, our portion of that would have been well spent just distributed in the way that we had the formula after the 2005 highway reauthorization bill. Anyway, that actually was only 3 percent. It was only $27 billion out of $825 billion. The one we just defeated was a $447 billion stimulus bill. It only had $27 billion in roads, highways, construction, maintenance--the things that provide jobs and the things this country needs.  I have been ranked as the most conservative Member of the Senate seven different times in the past. Yet I readily say I am a big spender in two areas: One is national defense and the other is infrastructure. I think that is what we are supposed to be doing here. We are in a desperate situation with our infrastructure around the country.  So one might say, well, the President had the $825 billion stimulus package and only $27.5 billion went to roads and highways. What happened to the rest of it? Well, the rest of it, in spite of what he said--I am going to read what he said--right after the passage of the bill, when he was signing the bill, the $825 billion stimulus bill, he said:       What I'm signing, then, is a balanced plan with a mix of      tax cuts and investments. It's a plan that has been put      together without earmarks or the usual pork barrel spending.      It's a plan that will be implemented with an unprecedented      level of transparency and accountability.  Well, stop and remember as I tell my colleagues what this actually went for. It is clear the most recent example was this loan guarantee with Solyndra. Everyone here is aware of what happened with Solyndra. We know it was a firm that was producing supposedly green energy. We know the people who were behind this loan guarantee of $535 million were big contributors to the administration, and they went ahead and were able to get bailed out--not bailed out, but get their loan guarantee--costing the taxpayers $\1/2\ billion, and that is part of what was in this bill. That is where the money was. The genesis of that was the $825 billion stimulus bill.  I am reminiscing a little bit about what happened back in the middle 1990s, back when Bill Clinton was President of the United States, when we had a very similar thing happen at that time. There is a company called the Loral Corporation. The Loral Corporation is headed up by Bernard Schwartz. Bernard Schwartz was one of the biggest contributors to the Democratic national party and to Bill Clinton. Bernard Schwartz, the company, the Loral Corporation, built a guidance system for a missile so that missile could be more accurate. Even though China wanted to have that system so they would be able to guide their missiles more accurately, for obvious reasons we didn't want them to have it. So it took a waiver signed by the President of the United States. President Bill Clinton did it. He signed the waiver and they got the money. I see similarities in here. I think, again, everyone is familiar with that.  How did they get the money? Where did it come from? The $825 billion in the stimulus bill.  Let's look. Since the President gave that statement, which I will read again--he said:       What I'm signing, then, is a balanced plan with a mix of      tax cuts and investments. It's a plan that has been put      together without earmarks or the usual pork barrel spending.  What do we call the Solyndra thing? It is porkbarrel spending.  What about the earmarks? This is a confusing thing for most people because my well-meaning conservative friends in the House of Representatives a couple of years ago put a 1-year moratorium on earmarks, and earmarks would be defined, of course, as appropriations or authorizations. By doing that, it totally contradicts what the Constitution, article I, section 9, says we are supposed to be doing here. It says we are supposed to be doing the appropriations and the authorizations. That is specifically precluded from the President in the article of the Constitution. So it is one that was very obvious. We find out later that the person who was behind that was none other than President Obama.  There is a reason for this. Because most people don't understand there are two different kinds of earmarks. One is congressional earmarks. That is whena Congressman, a lot of times in the dark of night, will try to put something down that maybe is not in the best interests of the United States but helps his district. That occasionally happens. It shouldn't happen. Under our system, it won't happen if we require all appropriations to be authorized. But the other kind, in addition to the congressional earmarks, are bureaucratic earmarks. That is what the President can do.  I will give an example. I am on the Armed Services Committee. The President's budget comes out. He says what we should spend money on to defend America. A couple of years ago, before this moratorium the Republicans put on in the House, one of the lines he had in his budget was $330 million for a launch system called a bucket of rockets. It was a good system, and I would like to have that system for defending America. But we thought in our committee that the same $330 million would be better spent on buying six new FA-18E/F model strike fighters for our Air Force. Well, we could do that, except that would be called an earmark. When we destroy an earmark, we don't save any money, we just say, Mr. President, we are not going to do it, so you go ahead and you do it. Consequently, we were able to take the $330 million and put it in the FA-18s, but after that would pass, that would be called an earmark, and so the President would have all the power.  If we look back at the $825 billion stimulus bill, we can look at some of the things that were in there. He said he wasn't going to have any earmarks. These are Presidential earmarks: $219,000 to study the hookup behavior of female college co-eds in New York; $1.1 million to pay for the beautification of Los Angeles' Sunset Boulevard; $10,000 to study whether mice become disoriented when they consume alcohol in Florida; $712,000 to develop machine-generated humor in Illinois; $259,000 for foreign bus wheel polishers in California. It goes on and on.  There is $150,000 for a Massachusetts middle school to build a solar array system on its roof; $1 million to do research on fossils in Argentina. Here is a good one. I will not attribute this to my two good friends who are Senators from Wyoming, but $1.2 million to build an underpass for deer in Wyoming.  That is what the President put in. Those are all earmarks. Consequently, I think what we are trying to get to here is if he had been successful in the $447 billion stimulus bill earlier this week, then we could anticipate the same type of thing happening.  I want the conservatives of America to wake up to the fact that the problems we have, when they talk about earmarks, are not congressional earmarks, they are bureaucratic earmarks.  It wasn't long ago that Sean Hannity on his show had a feature, I think it took him several nights to do it. It was the 102 most egregious earmarks. He named all of these earmarks, one after another, and went on and on and on. I came down to the Senate floor the morning after that and I read that same list. There were 102 earmarks, very similar to what I read. The interesting thing about it--and I said this on the Senate floor at that time--what did these 102 earmarks have in common? Not one was a congressional earmark. They were all bureaucratic earmarks.  We are going to be attempting to do something about this, because it is something that almost everyone would agree needs to be done. What we are going to introduce and the bill I am working on now, and I am gathering some cosponsors, is legislation that will bring real transparency and accountability to this process. It would do this by involving Congress in the grant-making process.  Right now, agencies are required to disclose a lot of information about grant awards, but not until after they are already awarded. We don't know about them. Even we here in this Chamber don't know about them until some unelected bureaucrat actually makes these what I would refer to as bureaucratic earmarks. So it is setting up a system very similar to the Congressional Review Act.  The Congressional Review Act lets us look at the regulations and have a process by which we can stop the bureaucrats from passing regulations that we may think as elected Members, elected by the people, are not good. This will do essentially the same thing the CRA does for regulations, it would do for these earmarks. So it is something we will be active in. I think back now, if we had not defeated that $447 billion stimulus bill the first part of this week, we would be looking at right now, and I am sure they would be putting together, their list of earmarks.  I think we have an opportunity now to do two things. No. 1, when the President--and I say when, and not if--when the President comes up with another jobs bill, let's look at it very carefully to make sure we have everything specifically in there if it is going to be deserving of our votes. I say that to each individual, Democrat and Republican, in this Chamber.  The second thing is make sure we don't open the door for him to be able to come up with another several hundred billion dollars of earmarks as we did in the $825 billion stimulus bill 2 years ago.  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
