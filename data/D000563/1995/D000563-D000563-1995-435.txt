Speaker, last week the University of Illinois announced that James J. Stukel had been selected to become the 15th president of the University of Illinois. I would like to congratulate Mr. Stukel and wish him the best.  It will not be an easy job, though. You see, Mr. Stukel has a hard act to follow--my friend, Stanley O. Ikenberry. Stan announced his retirement last year and we have not been able to convince him to stay.  Stan Ikenberry has served as president of the University of Illinois for 16 years. He spearheaded the transformation of the University of Illinois at Chicago and helped it become the largest research university campus in the Chicago area. He has helped to lead Illinois into the 21st century with his dedication to the Beckman Institute and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Most importantly, he has dedicated his time to ensuring [[Page E520]]  that the University of Illinois is a top notch educational institution.  Mr. Speaker, Stan Ikenberry celebrated his 60th birthday on March 3, 1995. The University could not have given him a present better than the selection of Jim Stukel to succeed him. With the selection of such a high caliber candidate, Stan now knows that his work will be carried on into the next millennium.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Stanley O. Ikenberry for everything he has done for Illinois. Stan, I hope you have a happy and productive retirement. You will be missed.                          ____________________
