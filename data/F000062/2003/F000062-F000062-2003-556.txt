 President, I rise today with Senator Voinovich to introduce legislation to expand the Federal loan forgiveness program to include Head Start teachers and administrators.  Nationwide, only 22 percent of Head Start teachers have completed a baccalaureate or advanced degree program. In California, that number is even smaller: about 16 percent of Head Start teachers have completed a bachelor's degree.  A survey completed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in June 2000 called the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey, FACES, found a strong relationship between the education of the Head Start teacher and classroom quality. ``Teachers with higher education levels were found to be more sensitive and responsive to their children, to have more high quality language activities, and more creative activities in their classrooms.''  Teachers with higher levels of education also had classes with more high quality language activities such as reading books to the children and provided more opportunities for children to develop skills in expressing thoughts.  Equally important, teachers with higher levels of education were found to be more responsive and sensitive to the children in their classes.  Head Start is one of the most important Federal programs because it has the potential to reach children early in their formative years when their cognitive skills are just developing.  We know that poor children disproportionately start school behind their peers, they are less likely to count to 10 or to recite the alphabet.  Providing low-income children with access to programs that encourage cognitive learning and prepare them to enter school ready to learn is important.  Head Start is one example of a Federal program that has the potential to reach every low-income child; to help every eligible child learn to count to ten and begin to recite the alphabet.  Many of our Nation's youngsters, however, enter elementary school without the basic skills necessary to succeed. Often these children lag behind their peers throughout their academic career.  As taxpayers, we will spend millions on efforts to help these children catch up. Many of these children will never catch up.  Several studies confirm the importance of providing low-income children with the opportunity early on to gain basic cognitive skills: a study conducted on a preschool program in Chicago showed that for every dollar invested, $8 was saved by society in projected costs. Additionally, 26 percent more children were likely to finish high school and 40 percent were less likely to repeat a grade.  The National Head Start Association found that for every dollar invested in Head Start, at least $2.50 is saved because these children need less remedial education and are less likely to be on welfare programs or involved with the juvenile justice system that non-Head Start peers.  The Rand Corporation found that for every dollar invested in early childhood learning programs, taxpayers save between $4 and $7 later by reducing the need for alcohol and drug treatment programs, special education programs, mental health services, and the likelihood of incarceration.  We can save millions by providing low-income children with access to quality preschool where they will gain the necessary skills to succeed in school and life.  In order to give every child a head start in life, we must continue to recruit qualified teachers to the Head Start field who have demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, early childhood development, and other areas of the preschool curriculum with a particular focus on cognition learning.  Obtaining and maintaining teachers with such qualifications is the only way to jump-start cognition learning and to ensure that our youngsters start elementary school ready to learn.  In 2000, the Head Start 2010 National Advisory Panel presided over fifteen national hearings and open forums. The panel found: ``There was a tremendous amount of testimony about the fact that, despite increases resulting from Federal quality set-aside funding, relatively low salaries and poor or non-existent benefits make it difficult to attract and retain qualified staff over the long term.  Witnesses stated that many staff positions remain vacant and turnover is likely to worsen if compensation does not improve significantly . . . comments included passionate exhortations for greater investment in staff, observing that, in Head Start . . . the quality of the program is tied directly to the quality of the staff.''  Many Head Start programs in California are losing qualified teachers to local school districts in part because the pay is better, nationally, the average Head Start teacher made $20,700 in 2000 compared to $40,575 for an elementary and secondary school teacher.  Head Start teachers are making half of that elementary and secondary teachers are paid on average.  Low pay, combined with mounting student loan debt, is a real deterrent to getting college graduates to become Head Start teachers.  And every teacher Head Start loses impacts access to services for our Nation's youngsters.  Today, there are no educational requirements for a Head Start teacher other than a child development associate CDA, credential, requiring 24 early child education credits and 16 general education credits.  By 2003, 50 percent of Head Start teachers will be required to have at minimum an associate or 2-year degree.  Following the recommendation of the Head Start 2010 National Advisory Panel, I believe we must elevate the compensation to attract and retain qualified individuals to commit to long-term careers in Head Start.  The loan forgiveness incentives in this bill are meant to encourage recent graduates, current Head Start teachers without a degree, and college students to enter and remain in the Head Start field. In exchange for 5 years of service, a Head Start teacher administrator could receive up to $5,000 of the Federal Stafford Loan forgiven.  I believe we must continue to improve the Head Start program such that children leave the program able to count to ten, to recognize sizes and colors, and can begin to recite the alphabet, to name a few indicators of cognitive learning.  This is just the first step. To further ensure cognitive learning, we must also continue to raise the standards and pay for Head Start teachers.  Ensuring that our nation's youngster have access to highly educated and qualified teachers should be a priority of this Congress.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 140         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
