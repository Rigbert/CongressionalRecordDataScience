President, Food Allergy Awareness Week recognizes howserious and how wide spread food allergies are in this country. One in every 13 children in the United States is affected by a life-threatening food allergy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, food allergy reactions send someone to the emergency room every 3 minutes.  The rising prevalence of food allergies is an important public health issue that is already felt in schools, restaurants, and workplaces across the country. According to the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, food allergies cause 30,000 cases of anaphylaxis and more than 200 deaths every year. We need to support research to develop new therapies and understanding to ultimately prevent and cure food allergies.  As the number of kids living with dangerous and in some cases deadly food allergy attacks at school has increased, some States and cities have responded by improving access to epinephrine auto-injectors as an important strategy to respond safely and quickly when students experience anaphylaxis. While many children with known food allergies are permitted to bring their epinephrine auto-injectors to school, 25 percent of epinephrine administrations in schools involve individuals without a previously known allergy. Many students who will need epinephrine have no history of food allergies and therefore do not carry epinephrine. Further, schools provide a setting where children are exposed to new foods that may trigger severe allergy attacks. Therefore, the decision for schools to stock their own epinephrine can be lifesaving.  I commend the state of Illinois for being a leader in this fight and passing legislation in 2011 to allow schools to stock emergency epinephrine auto-injectors. Last Congress, I worked with my colleague, Senator Kirk, to introduce legislation that would encourage states to require schools to stock epinephrine and to allow trained designated personnel to administer epinephrine in an emergency.  My hope is that Food Allergy Awareness Week can help the public to appreciate the extent of the problem and, importantly, the severity of the disease. It is a health threat that affects every race, age, income group and geographic area, and is growing at a frightening pace. What the public increasingly needs to understand is that this is not simply an inconvenient condition. As the tragic deaths of children each year show, it is frequently a life-threatening disease. Food Allergy Awareness Week is a first step to a better understanding and a greater commitment to our response.                          ____________________
