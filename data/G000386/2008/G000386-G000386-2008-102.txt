 President, I would like to take a few minutes to highlight the tax piece of the housing bill that is before the Senate today. From the beginning, Chairman Baucus and I had a goal. We wanted to develop a bipartisan tax package that responded to the needs of Americans facing difficulty in the housing market. Up until the last stage of this journey, in terms of the process, we met that goal. Unfortunately, at the last stage of the process, when the last House amendment was developed, a bipartisan process became a Democrats-only process. That is unfortunate. It is not the way we have done business in the past. Hopefully, it won't become a pattern.  Mr. President, this bill, with one exception, complies with the Senate Republican conference principles on use of revenue raising offsets. This bill contains new tax policy.
