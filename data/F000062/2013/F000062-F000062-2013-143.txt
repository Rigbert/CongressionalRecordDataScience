 President, today I wish to recognize the dedicated career and service to the Congress and the Nation of Louise Christine ``Chris'' Healey, who is retiring at the end of this week after nearly 30 years of work for the legislative branch. I am pleased to have the opportunity to publicly thank her and to note my appreciation for her dedicated and dignified efforts.  Chris is leaving the Senate as the general counsel on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, serving as the top legal advisor to the committee.  As committee counsel and general counsel over the past 8 years, Chris has been instrumental in the debating and drafting of every significant piece of intelligence legislation passed, and in some cases not passed, over the past decade. She was the principal drafter of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which is among the most complex pieces of legislation recently enacted, and certainly one of the most important to the security of our Nation. She has been as responsible as anyone for the passage of a string of four annual intelligence authorization bills, including the fiscal year 2013 act that was completed in December.  In her time at the SSCI, Chris has exemplified the professional and bipartisan spirit of the committee, working closely with Members and staff on both sides of the aisle. She has invested herself in conducting oversight, drafting bills, carrying out investigations, and reviewing and shepherding the President's nominees to Senate-confirmed positions, among many other things.  Her approach has always been dignified and calm. I am proud to be able to say that the rancor and divisiveness of the Senate over the past years has not infiltrated the work of the committee. Among the reasons we have been able to work together, review and debate serious issues, and come to bipartisan solutions is that we have people like Chris Healey who are more interested in getting the right results the right way rather than succeeding at the expense of someone else.  Prior to working for the committee, Ms. Healey worked for the Government Affairs Committee on the landmark legislation that reformed the intelligence community and created the position of the Director of National Intelligence. She was a senior counsel and team leader on the 9/11 Commission. And prior to that, she spent a decade on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, including as staff director. Chris has been the institutional memory of intelligence in the Congress, and her expertise and experience will be sorely missed.  But while a leading voice within these congressional committees and commissions and in interactions with the nonprofit community and executive branch, Chris has managed the rare feat of having a life as well.  She married musician Ryan Brown in 1989 and had her first son, Nathaniel, in 1990. Nathaniel has begun following Chris' footsteps, exploring his own work in government and politics. Chris and Ryan had their second son, Gabriel, in 1994, and he, too, has now grown up and is nearing his graduation from Oberlin College. Chris has walked to work every day from her Capitol Hill home, while supporting in many ways Ryan Brown's Opera Lafayette. He notes that in addition to her dedication to public service, Chris is an avid reader and an enthusiastic theater and concert goer, and looks forward to exploring the wider world in the years to come. I wish her the very best as she now has the time to pursue those interests, rather than being stuck in a windowless office in front of multiple computers for long hours.  Mr. President, I am one of many Members of Congress to have benefited from the advice and hard work of Chris Healey, starting with Barbara Kennelly, including Nancy Pelosi and Jane Harman, and ending with Jay Rockefeller and myself. On behalf of them, and the Senate Intelligence Committee, I thank Chris Healey and wish her the very best in what I know will be a long and productive retirement from the Congress.                          ____________________
