Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides for payments to be made within 30 days to officers and their families under the Public Safety Officers Benefits of certification of a public agency that a public safety officer was killed or suffered a catastrophic injury as a result of a personal injury in the line of duty of rescue or recovery efforts related to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.  The Public Safety Officer's Benefit Act provides benefits to public safety officers and their families for injury or death on duty. The program was established in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended. The program provides a lump sum benefit to survivors of Federal, State, and local public safety officers whose death and disability was the direct and proximate result of traumatic injuries sustained in the line of duty. The current lump sum payment is approximately $175,000 in the case of death. The program offers aid and allows for such sums as may be necessary.  The purpose of this resolution is simple and clearly warranted: that is, to provide swift aid and comfort to the survivors of the public safety officers who perished in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. Their loss and the loss incurred by the New York City fire and police departments is unfathomable.  The bravery exhibited by these men and women was of the greatest magnitude, and was the embodiment of noble service to our Nation and to the citizens of this country.  One wonders where these firefighters and police officers mustered the strength and courage to withstand dozens of stories to battle the raging fire above, all along the way directing and calming thousands of people desperately trying to flee the deadly danger above.  In the towers and on the ground, New York City public safety officers were unflinching in carrying out their mission of saving and protecting thousands of people who now owe their lives to these devoted officers. Because of their dedication to duty, many officers made the ultimate sacrifice for their fellow citizens. May God bless their souls and their families. They will never be forgotten, and their heroism will always be cherished by a grateful Nation, State, and city.  Having said this, let me express my concern that paperwork might result in the delay in the payment of these benefits to families who desperately need the incomes now that a breadwinner is no longer with them.  State law usually governs how a person who is missing is declared dead. This is not done by Federal law. The legislation before us today, as well as the law that has been on the books for over 30 years, requires an appropriate certification of death.                              {time}  1130  Let me urge the Governor and legislature of the State of New York that if there does need to be an amendment to the law to allow for appropriate certification, including but not limited to the issuance of an official death certificate, to take prompt action so that these certifications can be made and the payments issued to the families of the police officers and firefighters who perished in the line of duty.  This concern, however, for me, is not limited just to this bill, because there are literally thousands of people who are missing in the fire and collapse of the World Trade Center whose families will be waiting for insurance proceeds even though they are not police officers and firefighters; and there the same type of certification is needed so that the payments can be made to the beneficiaries under those policies. I would certainly hope that the law would be able to respond to this tragedy so that these payments can be made promptly rather than having months or perhaps even years of litigation before a certificate issues and the payment is to be made.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
