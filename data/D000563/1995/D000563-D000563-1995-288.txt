They have been accredited for their rehabilitation activity and they take a lot of people facing [[Page H 6267]] physical and mental challenges and them to work in good jobs. They pay them a modest amount of income, but really turn their lives around.  I visited a license plate factory in Decatur, IL, several years ago and the administrator told me a story. She pointed to a young woman who was working on the assembly line for these license plates and said, ``When she first came to this facility we literally carried her in. She was considered to be an impossible case; never capable of doing a thing. We trained her and stuck with her. You know what the problem is now, Congressman? When we have a big snowstorm and I want to close down this factory, I know she is going to show up anyway. She feels so dedicated to the job.''  Many people with these challenges and disabilities just need a chance. And the Government comes through with that chance, giving them a helping hand so they can be productive and have real lives.  Your commitment is one I share. And I really fear that the disabled will be the first casualties of these budget cuts and it would be sad for the future of our country if that occurs.
