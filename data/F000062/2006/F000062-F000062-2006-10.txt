 We had a robust and substantive discussion. Ambassador Schwab and Assistant Secretary Spooner assured us that the import monitoring process will be fully consistent with U.S. law and applicable WTO rules. No new precedent would be set. In addition, they also agreed that the import monitoring process should not harm U.S.-Vietnam textile and apparel trade, and they assured us that no additional reporting requirements or other burdens would be placed on importers of textiles and apparel from Vietnam. This means that it is their intention that monitoring will be based upon information already collected in the normal customs entry process or otherwise available to the Government. Finally, they assured us that the views of our constituents and all Members of Congress would be taken into account as the process is developed. Is that the Senator's understanding?
