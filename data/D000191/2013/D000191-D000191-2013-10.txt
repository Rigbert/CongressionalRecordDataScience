Chairman, according to MIT, then, the head of Exxon Mobil perjured himself under oath at the Senate and the Federal Reserve Bank in St. Louis is wrong because they have an in-depth study not paid for by the industry that says, indeed, speculation is a major factor.  Here is over 1 month where you see the price vary by up to $11 per day.Now, you tell me that the supply changed by $11 worth in a day and then, whoops, the next day it is back down? Then, Ben Bernanke said he saw a further decline coming and the industry tanked oil futures by $6.  This is pure speculation. Don't defend it. Support the amendment and give the American people real relief from high gas prices that are unnecessary.
