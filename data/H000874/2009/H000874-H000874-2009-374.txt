Of course, at the center of that question is the crisis that we confront in the economy. As the gentleman knows, he talked about, in a bipartisan way, supporting the President's policy on Iraq. As the gentleman knows, in a bipartisan way, we supported the Bush administration's request, both in January of 2008, in September of 2008, and again in December of 2008, when the President made a request for the second tranche of the TARP. I think every Member of this Congress believes that the first tranche did not work as well as we had hoped it would work.  We also, in these past 2 weeks, have passed extraordinarily quickly and robustly, consistent with the advice of the last administration and this administration, an attempt to do what the gentleman says we want to do, create jobs.  The gentleman also knows that we passed a recovery and reinvestment bill that had over $250 billion of tax relief, some for individuals and some for small businesses, some for businesses generally. About 35 percent of that bill was tax relief for our citizens. The other percentage of that bill was for investment, was for dealing with those who have been put at deepest risk by the economic crisis, in terms of losing jobs, in terms of not being able to feed their families and not having health care available to them.  So I say to my friend that, as we move forward on the budget, and as we look to the administration for the clarification that the gentleman seeks, appropriately, in my opinion, and in our opinion, a more specific outline of how the administration's going to proceed, we will have that in consideration when we produce a budget. And as I say, we intend to produce a responsible budget that looks towards deficit reduction. That obviously won't be until some time from now. We've got to turn this economy around, start creating jobs which, hopefully, will have the effect of the stock market going up, not down, which is to the interest of all of us.
