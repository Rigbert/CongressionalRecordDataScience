 President, recently the Senate passed S. 2610, the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which will be implemented by this legislation, will provide many benefits toU.S. manufacturers and agricultural producers. U.S. consumers will clearly gain from it as well. This agreement will also further cement our friendship with Australia, a long-time ally and our strong partner in the war on terrorism.  The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement is an example of the importance of Trade Promotion Authority. It has been almost 2 years since Trade Promotion Authority was signed into law as part of the trade act of 2002. During this time, the United States has signed free trade agreements with Chile, Singapore, and now Australia. The implementing bills for each of these agreements passed the Congress with strong support, so Congress clearly recognizes the benefits of trade promotion authority.  Many people worked hard to see that this vote became a reality. First and foremost, this would not have happened without the leadership of President George W. Bush. President Bush is committed to building the U.S. economy by opening the world's markets to U.S. goods and services, and the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement is just the latest of the trade accomplishments he has made possible.  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick deserves strong commendation for his efforts in negotiating this agreement. His commitment to expanding U.S. trade opportunities is steadfast.  I would also like to thank chief U.S. agricultural negotiator Allen Johnson for his willingness not only to listen, but also to act, upon the concerns of U.S. farmers and ranchers during the negotiations. Many others at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative deserve my thanks as well.  I commend my colleagues on the Finance Committee for their interest in seeing that the agreement was concluded and that the implementing bill was passed. I would like to extend a special thanks to the ranking member of the Committee, Mr. Baucus. We have worked together over the years to expand trade to the benefit of U.S. workers, farmers, and consumers, and I am pleased with the outcome of our current efforts with the passage of this implementing bill.  My staff on the Finance Committee has worked diligently over the past weeks on the implementing bill and other materials connected with it. My goal was to have this legislation passed prior to the August recess, and they were instrumental in making this happen. Moreover, my Finance Committee staff was engaged in consultations with officials from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative throughout the negotiations, which began way back in March 2003, so this has been a long process for them. I greatly appreciate their hard work.  My Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Kolan Davis, deserves recognition. His talent in managing many legislative issues, including trade, is readily apparent.  The Chief International Trade Counsel of the Committee, Everett Eissenstat, worked tirelessly to see that the passage of this legislation would actually occur, so today's vote is yet another testament to his skills. I would also like to thank the rest of my trade staff--David Johanson, Stephen Schaefer, Dan Shepherdson, and Zach Paulsen--for all of their hard work and dedication to the Finance Committee's work and to the people of Iowa.  Mr. Baucus's Finance Committee staff also deserves recognition. Russ Sullivan and Bill Dauster, respectively staff director and deputy staff director of Mr. Baucus's Finance Committee staff, worked well with my staff throughout the process.  I also appreciate the efforts of Tom Punke--Mr. Baucus's chief international trade counsel--and Sara Andrews, Shara Aranoff, John Gilliland, Pascal Niedermann, and Brian Pomper.  Finally, I would like to thank Polly Craighill of the office of the Senate Legislative Counsel for the many hours she put into drafting the implementing bill. Without her patience, hard work, and skills, today's vote would not have been possible.  I look forward to the signing of this legislation into law by President Bush.                          ____________________
