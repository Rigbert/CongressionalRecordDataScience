 I think there are some distinctions to be made.  It is not entirely the same thing, but granting that that might have some legitimacy, the majority leader offered these Specter protocols with which the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee is intimately familiar, which would have guaranteed some kind of procedure to extricate those nominations from committee and bring them out to the floor and give them an up-or-down vote. We are in the majority, and we volunteered to give up the ability to routinely kill nominations in committee. Yet they turned that down, too.
