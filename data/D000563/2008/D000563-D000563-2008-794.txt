President, earlier, when I was speaking to Senator Kennedy's resolution, I made reference to a New York Times article. It is an article from Tuesday, March 25. It tells in a very graphic way the correspondence of fallen soldiers and the circumstances they faced in Iraq before they died. As I mentioned before, I read this article in its entirety and was moved by it.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this New York Times article so my colleagues and others have an opportunity to read it as well.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Mar. 25, 2008]               Six of the Fallen, in Words They Sent Home  From Latest 1,000, Words by E-Mail, and in Journals to Those at Home               [By Lizette Alvarez and Andrew W. Lehren]       By the time Specialist Jerry Ryen King decided to write      about his experiences in Iraq, the teenage paratrooper had      more to share than most other soldiers.       In two operations to clear the outskirts of the village of      Turki in the deadly Diyala Province, Specialist King and the      rest of the Fifth Squadron faced days of firefights, grenade      attacks and land mines. Well-trained insurgents had burrowed      deep into muddy canals, a throwback to the trenches of World      War I. As the fighting wore on, B-1 bombers and F-16s were      called in to drop a series of powerful bombs.       Once the area was clear of insurgents, the squadron, part      of the 82nd Airborne Division, uncovered hidden caches of      weapons.       Two months later, Specialist King, a handsome former honors      student and double-sport athlete from Georgia, sat down at      this computer. In informal but powerful prose, he began a      journal.       After 232 long, desolate, morose, but somewhat days of      tranquility into deployment, I've decided that I should start      writing some of the things I experienced here in Iraq. I have      to say that the events that I have encountered here have      changed my outlook on life . . .       The most recent mission started out as a 24-36 hour air-     assault sniper mission in a known al-Qaida stronghold just      north of Baghdad. We landed a few hours before daybreak and      as soon as I got off the helicopter my night vision broke, I      was surrounded by the sound of artillery rounds, people      screaming in Arabic, automatic weapons, and the terrain      didn't look anything like what we     were briefed. I knew it was going to be a bad day and a half.                                   Jerry Ryen King, Journal Entry,     March 7, 2007                                  ____       A month later, Special King was sitting inside his combat      outpost, an abandoned school in Sadah, when suicide bombers      exploded two dump trucks just outside the building. The      school partly collapsed, killing Specialist King on April 23,      2007, along with eight other soldiers, and making the blast      one of the most lethal for Americans fighting in Iraq.       In that instant, Specialist King became one of 4,000      service members and Defense Department civilians to die in      the Iraq war--a milestone that was reached late Sunday, five      years since the war began in March 2003. The last four      members of that group, like the majority of the most recent      1,000 to die, were killed by an improvised explosive device,      known as a I.E.D. They died at 10 p.m. Sunday on a patrol in      Bagdad, military officials said; their names have not yet      been released.       The next day we cleared an area that made me feel as if I      were in Vietnam. Honestly, it was one of the scariest times      of my life. At one point I was in water up to my waist and      heard an AK fire in my direction. But all in all the day was      going pretty good, no one was hurt, I got to shoot a few      rounds, toss a grenade, and we were walking to where the      helicopter was supposed to pick us up.                                   Jerry Ryen King, Journal Entry,     March 7, 2007                                  ____       The year 2007 would prove to be especially hard on American      service members; more of them died last year than in any      other since the war began. Many of those deaths came in the      midst of the 30,000-troop buildup known as ``the surge,'' the      linchpin of President Bush's strategy to tamp down widespread      violence between Islamic Sunnis and Shiites, much of it in      Baghdad. In April, May and June alone, 331 American service      members died, making it the war's deadliest three-month      period.       But by fall, the strategy, bolstered by new alliances with      Sunni tribal chiefs and a decision by the Shiite cleric      Moktada al-Sadr to order his militia to stop fighting,      appeared to be paying off as the country entered a period of      relative calm. Military casualties and Iraqi civilian deaths      fell, and the October-December period produced the fewest      casualties of any three months of the war. The past month,      though, has seen an uptick in killings and explosions,      particularly suicide bombings. The violence has traveled      north to Mosul, where the group calling itself Al Qaeda in      Mesopotamia remains strong.       Everything changed in a matter of 15 minutes . . . About      the time I was opening my MRE (meal ready to eat) I heard an      explosion. Everyone started running towards the sound of the      explosion. Apparently a suicide bomber had blown himself up      killing four soldiers from my squadron and injuring another.      Our 36 hour mission turned into another air-assault into a      totally different city, the clearing of it, and 5 more days.      We did find over 100 RPG's, IED making materials, insurgents      implacing IED's, artillery rounds, a sniper rifle, and sort      of like a terrorist training book and cd's.                                   Jerry Ryen King, Journal Entry,     March 7, 2007.                                  ____       Unlike the soldiers of some previous wars, who were only      occasionally able to send letters back home to loved ones,      many of those who died left behind an extraordinary      electronic testimony describing in detail the labor, the      fears and the banality of serving in Iraq.       In excerpts published here from journals, blogs and e-mail,      six soldiers who died in the most recent group of 1,000      mostly skim the alarming particulars of combat, a kindness      shown their relatives and close friends. Instead, they plunge      readily into the mundane, but no less important rhythms of      home. They fire off comments about holiday celebrations,      impending weddings, credit card bills, school antics and the      creeping anxiety of family members who are coping with one      deployment too many.       At other moments, the service members describe the humor of      daily life down range, as they call it. Hurriedly, with      little time to worry about spelling or grammar, they riff on      the chaos around them and reveal moments of fear. As      casualties climb and the violence intensifies, so does their      urge to share their grief and foreboding.                             A Last Goodbye       Hey beautiful well we were on blackout again, we lost yet      some more soldiers. I cant wait to get out of this place and      return to you where i belong.

Juan Campos, 27, flew from Baghdad to Texas      for two weeks last year, there was more on his mind than rest      and relaxation. He visited his father's grave, which he had      never seen. He spent time with his grandparents and touched      base with the rest of his rambling, extended family.       The day he was scheduled to return to war, Sergeant Campos      and his wife went out dancing and drinking all evening with      friends. Calm and reserved by nature, Sergeant Campos could      out-salsa and out-hip-hop most anyone on the dance floor. At      the airport, his wife, Jamie Campos, who had grown used to      the upheaval of deployment, surprised herself.       ``I cried and I have never ever cried before,'' said Mrs.      Campos, 26, who has a 9-year-old son, Andre. ``It was just      really really weird. He knew, and I kind of knew. It felt      different.''       We both felt that it was the last goodbye,'' she said.     Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2006       Mood: gloomy       The life of an infantryman is never safe . . . how do I      know, well I live it every day.       I lost a good friend of mine just two days ago to an enemy      sniper. The worst feeling in the world is having lost one of      your own and not being able to fight back. The more I go on      patrol, the more alert I tend to be, but regardless of the      situation here in Iraq is that we are never safe. No matter      the countermeasures we take to prevent any attacks. They seem      to seep through the cracks. Every day a soldier is lost or      wounded by enemy attacks. I for one would like to make it      home to my family one day. Pray for us and keep us in your      thoughts . . . for an infantryman's life is never safe.     Juan Campos, Myspace Blog                                  ____       Sergeant Campos, a member of the First Battalion, 26th      Infantry, Charlie Company out of Germany, was one of      thousands of infantrymen assigned to stabilize Baghdad and      the surrounding areas last year during the troop buildup.      Troops were sent deep into insurgent neighborhoods, where      they lived in small outposts, patrolled on foot, cleared      houses, mingled with Iraqis and rebuilt the infrastructure.       The extra 30,000 service members--160,000 in all--were      deployed to Iraq to help quell the runaway violence that      threatened large-scale civil war. Most soldiers spent 15      months in Iraq, a length of time that military commanders      have said is unsustainable. Many had fought in the war at      least once. A few had been in Iraq multiple times.       My only goals are to make it out of this place alive and      return you guys and make you as happy as I can.            Juan Campos, E-Mail Message to his Wife, Dec. 15, 2006                                       ____       But to Sergeant Campos and the rest of Charlie Company in      Adhamiya, a north Baghdad stronghold for Sunni insurgents,      the buildup seemed oddly invisible. The men patrolled almost      every day, sometimes 16 to 18 hours a day for months, often      in 120-degree weather. Exhaustion was too kind a word for      their fatigue.       More than 150 soldiers lived in a two-story house with      portable toilets, no air-conditioning and temperamental      showers. Sleep came only a few hours at a time. The fighting      was vicious. Adhamiya was such a magnet for sectarian      bloodletting that the military built a wall around it to      contain the violence.       ``They walled us in and left us there,'' Staff Sgt. Robin      Johnson, 28, said of the 110 men in Charlie Company. ``We      were a family. I would die for these guys before I die for my      own blood brother.''       On patrol, sniper fire rang out so routinely that soldiers      in Sergeant Campos's platoon seldom stood still for more than      four seconds. They scoured rooftops for Iraqi children who      lobbed grenades at American soldiers for a handful of cash.      Roadside bombs burst from inside drainage pipes, impossible      to detect from the street. The bombs grew larger by the      month.       Last year, these powerful improvised explosive devices were      responsible for a majority of American fatalities, a new      milestone. The bombs also killed multiple soldiers more often      than in the past, a testament to their potency.       ``It was the most horrible thing you could possibly      imagine,'' Sergeant Johnson said. ``As soon as you left the      gate, you could die at any second. If you went out for a day      and you weren't attacked, it was confusing.''       Charlie Company soldiers found a steady stream of Iraqis      killed by insurgents for     money or revenge. Some had their faces wiped clean by acid.      Others were missing their heads or limbs.                       ``It Could Have Been Me''     To tell the story of iraq is a hard one.

Wood, 22, a gifted artist, prolific writer and      a sly romantic from Oklahoma, was also one of the bluntest      soldiers inside Charlie Company.       it is fighting extreme boredom with the lingering thought      in the forefront of your mind that any minute on this patrol      could be my last endeavour, only highlighted by times of such      extreme terror and an adrenaline rush that no drug can touch.      what [expletive] circumstances thinking ``that should've been      me'' or ``it could've been me''. wondering if that pile of      trash will suddenly explode killing you or worse one of your      beloved comrads . . . only backed by the past thoughts and      experiences of really losing friends of yours and not feeling      completely hopeless that it was all for nothing because all      in all, you know the final outcome of this war. it is walking      on that thin line between sanity and insanity. that feeling      of total abandonment by a government and a country you used      to love because politics are fighting this war . . . and its      a losing battle . . . and we're the ones ultimently paying      the price.     Ryan Wood, Myspace Blog, Adhamiya                                  ____       For the soldiers in Iraq, reconciling Adhamiya with America      was not always easy. One place was buried in garbage and gore      and hopelessness. The other seemed unmoored from the war,      fixated on the minutia of daily life and the hiccups of the      famous. The media was content to indulge.     What the Hell America??       ``What the hell happened?'' any intelligent American might      ask themselves throughout their day. While the ignorant,      dragging themselves to thier closed off cubicle, contemplate      the simple things in life such as ``fast food tonight?'' or      ``I wonder what motivated Brittany Spears to shave her      unsightly, mishaped domepiece?''       To the simpleton, this news might appear ``devastating.'' I      assume not everyone thinks this way, but from my little      corner of the earth, Iraq, a spot in the world a majority of      Americans could'nt point out on the map, it certainly appears      so. . . . To all Americans I have but one phrase that helps      me throughout my day of constant dangers and ever present      death around the corner, ``WHO THE [expletive] CARES!'' Wow      America, we have truly become a nation of self-absorbed      retards. . . . This world has serious problems and it's time      for America to start addressing them.

But, day      to day, there was no more reliable antidote than Pfc. Daniel      J. Agami, a South Floridian with biceps the size of      cantaloupes, and Pfc. Ryan J. Hill, a self-described hellion      who loved his ``momma'' and hailed from what he called the      ``felony flats'' of Oregon. Funny men in the best sense of      the word, the two provided a valuable and essential commodity      in a war zone.       Their mother jokes--the kind that begin, ``your mother is      so . . .''--were legendary, culminating in a Myspace joke-     off. It ended abruptly after an enough-is-enough phone call      from Private Hill's mother, who ranked No. 1 on his list of      heroes in Myspace. Private Agami proclaimed victory.       About a month later . . . I went to my room and my mattress      was missing and all my clothes were being worn by other      people. I couldn't figure it out so I knew right off the bat      to go to Hill. I saw him walking down the hall wearing five      of my winter jackets. He sold half my wardrobe right off his      back to people in our company and my mattress was in someone      else's room. So then I had go to around and buy all my stuff      back. (Now I think he won).         Daniel J. Agami, Charlie Company.

Jokes scrawled      inside a Port-o-Potty quickly made the rounds. Situational      humor, from goofy to macabre, proved plentiful.       A really girly guy who was a cheerleader in high school,      got knocked down and nearly hurt by the wind of the      helicopter. Listening to Dickson recite what was in every      single MRE was pretty funny. A cow charged and nearly      trampled one of my friends when we were raiding a compound.      And lastly, I thought that it was pretty comical that I shot      at a guy a long ways out but missed and later after taking      his house and using it as a patrol base he offered me Chai      and rice.

I had two of my wisdom teeth pulled. After taking      double the prescribe percocot and morphine pills that the      doctor gave me for the pain I decided to catch a flight back      to my FOB (forward operation base). It was the coolest      Blackhawk ride I've had, I was absolutely ripped and I talked      the pilots into leaving the doors open. We had four more guys      die a couple days ago. They hit an IED, it killed everyone in      the humvee. It's starting to get a little scary. We made it      our first six months with just two deaths and that was      plenty. But now just in the past two and a half weeks we've      had nine more guys get killed, and over 50 wounded. I'm just      hoping that I can make it the 75 more days or so that we have      left of combat operations before we start packing.

He was the kind of guy      who joined an endurance ski contest on a whim. He came in      fourth. He had never skied in his life.       Private Agami had time for everyone, and everyone had time      for him. Affectionately called G.I. Jew, he held his religion      up to the light. He used it to build tolerance among the      troops and shatter stereotypes; few in his unit had ever met      a Jew. He flew the Israeli flag over his cot in Adhamiya. He      painted the words Hebrew Hammer onto his rifle. He even      managed to keep kosher, a feat that required a steady diet of      protein shakes and cereal.       Commander Mom, I can't wait to come home and when I do,      don't worry I'll have a lot to say to the congregation. Don't      worry about my mental state either, we all receive counseling      and help from doctors when something like this happens. I am      a strong individual physically and mentally and if there is      one thing the army teaches you, it is how to deal with death.      Every day that passes it gets easier and easier.

I have never cried this much my entire      life. Two great men got taken from us way too soon. I wonder      why it was them and not me. I sit here right now wondering      why did they go to the gates of heaven and not me.

Sergeant Campos was riding in a Humvee on May 14, 2007, two      weeks after returning from Texas, when it hit an I.E.D. The      bomb lifted the Humvee five feet off the ground and engulfed      it in flames. ``That's when we just left hope at the door,''      Sergeant Johnson said. Severely burned over 80 percent of his      body, Sergeant Campos lived two weeks. He died June 1.      Another soldier, Pfc. Nicholas S. Hartge, 20, of Indiana,      died in the same attack.       Private Agami was driving a Bradley fighting vehicle on      June 21, 2007, when it hit an I.E.D. The explosion flipped      the 30-ton vehicle, which also carried Sergeant Wood. Both      men were killed, along with three other soldiers and an Iraqi      interpreter.       ``Obviously, it came to a point, you didn't care anymore if      it got better,'' said Staff Sgt. Jeremy S. Rausch, 31, one of      Sergeant Campos's best friends in Charlie Company. ``You      didn't care about the people because they didn't care about      themselves. We had already lost enough people that we just      thought, you know, `why?' ''       During their time in Adhamiya, the soldiers of Charlie      Company caught more than two dozen high-value targets, found      nearly 50 weapons caches, detained innumerable insurgents and      won countless combat awards. They lost 14 men. Their mission      was hailed a success.                              Just in Case       Texan to the core, enamored of the military, Specialist      Daniel E.

Strange but this place where we are at is unreal almost. I      hope I come back mentally in shape. LOL.                                       Daniel Gomez, Myspace Blog,                                                     Sept. 9, 2006       He took pride in being the guy who tended to wounded      soldiers under fire, patching them up to help them survive.       As the violence intensified, Specialist Gomez set aside      thoughts of a free Iraq or a safer America and, like      generations of soldiers before him, simply started fighting      for the soldier next to him.       A few days ago I realized why I am here in Baghdad dealing      with all the gunfire, the rocket attacks, the IEDs, the car      bombs, the death. I have only been here going on a month and      a half. Already I have seen what war really is. . . but      officially it's called ``full spectrum operations.'' No, I      don't down Bush, he is my CinC, and I think he is doing a      good job with what Clinton left him. I don't debate why we      are involved in Iraq. I just know why I am here. It is not      for the smiling Iraqi kids, or even the feeling of wearing      the uniform ( it feels damn good though:). I am here for the      soldier on patrol with me.       But why are you there in the States? Why are you having      that nice dinner, watching TV, going out on dates. . . .                       Daniel Gomez, E-mail to Friends and Family,                                                    Sept. 27, 2006       And then Specialist Gomez fell in love. An e-mail      flirtation with Katy Broom, his sister's close friend,      gradually led to a cyber exchange of guarded promises about      the future. Headed home for a rest break in May, the      tentativeness lifted and they began to rely on each other to      get through the day. The two joked about ``the best sex we      never had.''       . . . this R there is someone new in my life. Exactly      what she is to me, and what I am to her is uncertain, but      it's not really important at the moment. Just the thought      that I could spent a second of my life with her, before I      have to come back here makes everything worth it.                                       Daniel Gomez, Myspace Blog,                                                       May 9, 2007                                       ____       Rest and relaxation in Georgia went better than expected.      He fell in love with the love of his life all over again,      this time in person. The couple shared one kiss during his      leave.       ``He was everything I expected and more,'' said Ms. Broom,      20, who spent one week and two days with him. ``It was kind      of surreal when we met. It's almost like a perfect love and      war story.''       Not many soldiers leave behind a just-in-case letter.      Specialist Gomez did. He handed Ms. Broom an envelope at the      airport with the 'words, ``Don't read unless something      happens to me.''       On July 18, 2007, two months after his leave, Specialist      Gomez died in Adhamiya when the Bradley fighting vehicle he      was in struck a roadside bomb. The explosion and flames also      killed three other soldiers.       Ms. Broom waited three days after she got word to open the      letter. She sat alone in the couple's favorite spot, her      apartment balcony.       ``I was very thankful that he wrote it,'' she said of the      letter. ``I have opened and closed it so many times, I'm      surprised it hasn't fallen apart.''                                R+R 2007       Hey baby. If you're reading this, then something has happen      to me and I am sorry. I promised you I would come back to      you, but I guess it was a promise I could not keep. You know      I never believe in writing ``death letters.'' I knew if I      left one for my folks it would scare them. Then I met you. We      were supposed to meet, darling. I needed someone to make me      smile, someone that was an old romantic like I was. I was      going through a very rough time in Iraq and I was starting to      doubt my mental state. Then one day after a patrol, I go to      my facebook and there you were. . . .       I can't stop crying while I am writing this letter, but I      have to talk to you one last time, because maybe the last      time I heard your voice I did not know it would be the last      time I heard your voice. . . .       I Love You. Go be happy, go raise a family. Teach your kids      right from wrong, and have faith, darling. l think I knew I      loved you before I met. I love you, Katy. * Kiss * Goodbye
