  Mr. DeFAZIO. In December the President caved to the Republicans and extended all the Bush tax cuts, immediately increasing this year's deficit by $400 billion and the 10-year deficit by $4 trillion, precipitating the great debt and deficit crisis.  Now we're hearing from the press today that the President is preparing yet another great cave. Instead of saying we will have some revenues to solve this problem, he is apparently about to cut a deal that will be all cuts.  So it's ironic. He cuts taxes to create a crisis, and then we cut spending to protect the tax cuts because tax cuts create jobs, except they haven't created jobs, but we've got to continue to protect them. It's all very, very sad.  If we get rid of all the Bush tax cuts--$4 trillion--no cuts in Social Security, no cuts in Medicare, no cuts in veterans benefits, and $4 trillion less in deficits, now, that would be an equitable solution.                          ____________________
