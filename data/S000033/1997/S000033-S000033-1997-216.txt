 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Essex Technical Center in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Dupuis. My name is Danielle Dupuis and I live in      Colchester. This is Philip Bidwell, he lives in Underhill but      attends Essex Technical Center. Rebecca Johnson and Troy      Hibbard cannot be here with us today.       We did a survey on teenage drug use in our school and we      found that 50 percent of the students in our school use      drugs, we found that 21 percent of them use them on a daily      basis. The top two drugs in high school were marijuana and      alcohol, and they are both used by 50 percent of the      students.       We feel that teenage drug use in this country is a rising      problem. Everyday in and out of school students are using      substances whether they are legal or illegal. We feel that a      required high school level drug education class would be a      way to solve this problem.       Mr. Bidwell. Basically we think that it is more and more of      a problem everyday in the school systems and we think that in      order to resolve this we should have a class that is required      in the school system for drug education because it is not      that the fifth grade students have a class where they are      introduced to drugs and what the effects are and stuff, but      as teenagers these get more and more into peer pressure and      they need to be brought up against anything that can happen.      it is not just a fact of people doing them but people are      dying from them.       Ms. Dupuis. We found that 25 percent of the students that      use drugs use them in school.       Mr. Bidwell. I think that students, if you go up and talk      to somebody like a student, that is just not normal to      anybody else, but if they are going to somebody the same age      just like them they are more open about it.       Ms. Dupuis. They feel more comfortable. Other drugs were      used, but marijuana and alcohol were the main concerns. We      surveyed marijuana, cocaine, speed, acid, alcohol, mushrooms,      hashish and we then had another category and those were all      low, they ran about five or six percent, in that area. There      is such a big campaign against drugs but yet there are so      many students that are using drugs, you want to know what is      the big deal, what is it like? I will try it once. And they      try it once and that is it, you are addicted for life. I      think a lot of it has to do with just being cool, too.                               ____________________
