President, I have to oppose this $1 million study of ``how the Federal Government and State and local governments, through their taxing power or otherwise'' helps support or subsidize the cost of producing ``violent, pornographic or other harmful materials.'' Even though this is just a study, I have serious concerns about researching the need for more taxing power.  Second, the juvenile crime bill already contains a package of amendments regarding the study of the motion picture industry. Third, the causes of teen violence are complex and difficult to handle with tax policy. Fourth, the amendment provides broad subpoena powers.  I appreciate that Senator Bond modified his amendment by taking out the study of how another tax, an excise tax, might be structured for ``violent, pornographic, or other harmful motion picture materials.'' What is considered harmful in Tulsa, may not be considered harmful in Niagara Falls, or Boise, or Key West. But in terms of the ``power to tax'' language still in the amendment it is not clear if the Federal Government, or towns or states, would tell movie producers what content they considered ``harmful'' or ``violent.'' Thus while the ``excise tax'' language was just taken out the study of the ``power to tax'' is still in the amendment. And that raises a lot of issues.  If this power to tax authority were used what would that mean? It is not at all clear how that would work. I do not see why we should spend $1 million to study the ``power to tax.'' There were major fights years ago about whether to censor the line in ``Gone with the Wind''--``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.'' In many towns, that line could have been taxed under a ``power to tax'' if they had it then. Now, that line caused enormous numbers of debates and editorials. I suspect that could have gotten a whopping tax back then. Or Clark Gable could have just said: ``Frankly, my dear, I am really annoyed.''  How would a new ``power to tax'' given to local, state or the Federal government work? The earlier ``excise tax'' idea that was recently dropped raised lots of questions also. I do not know what editing of movies local governments might have ended up doing.  Concerning the excise tax language, now dropped, I wondered would the local or the Federal government have imposed the tax before the movie was produced, after the movie was produced, or during the editing of the movie? Or, would the States or the Federal Government have told the producers ahead of time how much they would tax them on each scene? If they were to do it that way, could they take some scenes out or pay the extra tax, like a gas-guzzler tax? I understand there are a lot of violent battle scenes in the new Star Wars movie. That would have had a pretty big gross to tax. Fortunately, the ``excise tax'' language was taken out by the sponsor of the amendment, but the ``power to tax'' language remains.
