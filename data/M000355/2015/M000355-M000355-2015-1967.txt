 There are several amendments pending from Senators on both sides of the aisle, and I would encourage everyone to work with Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell to get in the queue for consideration.  The next votes will occur on Tuesday, January 20, following the weekly conference meetings.                          ____________________
