President, on June 23, 2004, I gave a statement on the Feingold amendment concerning the Inspector General of the Coalition Provisional authority. When it appeared in the Record, text was somehow inadvertently added to my statement. My statement should have ended after the sixth full paragraph of column three on page S7266. I can certainly understand how something like this could have happened as we were all working late into the night under very tight deadlines. This isn't the first time something like this has happened and I bet it won't be the last.  Of course, this is no fault of the good people of the Official Reporters of Debates. They do outstanding work and I know this will continue.  The following is how my statement should have appeared:       I rise today to express my strong support for the amendment      offered by Senator Feingold.       Senator Feingold's amendment, which I am a proud co-     sponsor, would allow the work of the Inspector General of the      Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA-IG) to continue its work      uninterrupted after the June 30 handover.       This is critical. Congress provided more than $18 billion      to rebuild Iraq, roughly the same amount that we spend on the      rest of the world combined. Congress jammed through the Iraq      supplemental appropriations bill in an extremely short time,      without a sufficient number of hearings, into a very chaotic      environment without the usual financial controls.       Recognizing this reality, Congress created a strong,      independent Inspector General to help police these funds.       In the months that followed passage of the Iraq      Supplemental, we heard numerous reports of waste, fraud and      abuse. If anything, this should have send a clear signal to      the administration and Congress that we need more--not less--     oversight of these funds. It defies logic, then, that the      State Department is now proposing to weaken the one entity      that Congress specifically tasked with keeping track of these      tax dollars.       The State Department's plan could undermine the      independence of this Inspector General and disrupt this      important work, reducing Congress's ability to account for      these funds. It's unlocking the vault to those who want to      cheat us.       The State Department also has told the Appropriations      Committee that it will have to create 25 new positions to      handle the work in Iraq.       Let me get this straight. We want to close down an IG that      has about 60 people in place, which are actively conducting      audits and rooting out waste fraud and abuse.       After the administration is finished closing down that      office, they will turn around and hire 25 new people to do      the same work--only through at a lower level office at the      State Department.       Why on Earth would we want to do this? At a time when we      are hearing weekly reports of abuse by Haliburton and others,      why would we want to re-invent the wheel? Why would we      downgrade the status of the CPA-IG and undermine its      independence? It just does not make any sense.       This is why the amendment offered by Senator from Wisconsin      is so important.       This is why I support his amendment.  I thank the chair for allowing me to make this correction.                          ____________________
