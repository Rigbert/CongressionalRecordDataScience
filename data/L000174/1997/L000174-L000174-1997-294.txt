President, over a year ago, I began having online computer chats with students from around my home State of Vermont. These chats have been a lot of fun and very informative. The questions that the students have asked me reflect not only their interest in government and current events, but also the advantages that they have in terms of access to knowledge via the information superhighway.  Just 3 or 4 years ago, I could not have imagined coming back from a vote on the Senate floor, sitting down in front of my computer and having a conversation with a group of young Vermonters over 500 miles away. The advances in technology have amazed me, but so have the understanding students have about technology and what it means for all of our futures.  Students' questions have ranged from my legislation to protect the privacy of our online communications to United States policy toward Iraq to how to get them out of their next period math test. While I will never be able to help a student skip a math test, these discussions have convinced me of the thirst of our children for the opportunities these technologies represent and our responsibility as leaders to help provide them  Last week, I had the unique opportunity to chat with students from one of the Nation's oldest running one-room schoolhouses in Granville, VT. Iask that the transcript from this chat be printed in the Record as testimony of the wonders of Internet technology and, more important, of our Nation's youth.  I also want to thank Shannon Roland, the teacher at Granville, for her work in preparing these exceptional students. She should be commended for bringing their education outside of and beyond the walls of a one-room schoolhouse.  The transcript follows:       Oneroom 1. Glad to be here. I am now surrounded by 17      beautiful first through fourth graders, aged 7 to 10. AP and      Channel 22 are also here. Hello Senator.       Patrick L. I wish I could be there with you in person but      we are all excited in Washington to be doing this.       Oneroom 1. We are too. Jack has a question for you. Have      you ever seen a land mine?       Patrick L. I am not the world's best typist so I apologize      if I make some mistakes.       Oneroom 1. That's fine. We're learning too.       Patrick L. I have seen landmines all over the world and      have two deactivated ones on my desk. They are horrible      weapons that should all be banned. They kill mostly children      and innocent civilians.       Oneroom 1. Brian wonders if you've ever seen the Granville      School web page.       Patrick L. Love the picture of the school on the front. Who      is the student?       Oneroom 1. That's a picture of Benny. He's going to be a      bug scientist. Dylan asks, where do you live?       Patrick L. I live on a tree farm that belonged to my      parents in Middlesex, Vermont. I drive down route 100 often.       Patrick L. I also have a house in the Washington area where      I live when the Senate is in session.       Oneroom 1. Brooke wonders if you might stop by our school      sometime.       Patrick L. I would like to drop by sometime. Unfortunately      we are often in session while you are in school and you are      out when I get home to Vermont for the weekend. After seeing      your web page I am especially eager to drop by.       Oneroom 1. We'll be going to school on Memorial Day if      you're around. We've had lots of snowdays. Harlie wonders if      you know any of the children who were killed by landmines.       Patrick L. I have visited a lot of hospitals around the      world where we use the Leahy War Victims Fund. My wife is a      registered nurse and I have watched her help with some of the      children who have been injured. It is a real tragedy and it      has to stop.       Oneroom 1. We agree. Benny (the boy in the picture) wonders      what you do in your free time.       Patrick L. Benny I try to cross country ski around my farm      during the winter and hike there during the summer when I am      home. I am also an avid photographer and bring a camera with      me almost everywhere I go even to meetings at the White      House.       Patrick L. Benny you look great in the photo!       Oneroom 1. We like to cross country ski. In fact, we had      lessons here all winter. Sammi wonders if you have ever been      to a one room schoolhouse. We think you would like to meet      our teacher because she's really nice. [Picture].       Patrick L. I think you are very fortunate to have Shannon      as your teacher. I have not been in a one room schoolhouse      since I was a child but it seems to me you are getting a      better education than a lot of very large schoolhouses.       Oneroom 1. We think so too. We're going to Boston to the      museum and the aquarium for our school field trip. Jasmine      wonders when you started being a senator.       Patrick L. The field trip sounds great. I did one like that      when I was 12 and still remember it. Jasmine I became a      Senator when I was 34. That was in 1975.       Oneroom 1. Erica asks, have you ever lost a law you wanted?       Patrick L. Many times, Erica, I will push for legislation      that doesn't pass the first time around but we keep working      until it does. One example is the Northeast Dairy Compact. At      first it failed but finally passed and will help the dairy      farmers in Vermont.       Oneroom 1. Christopher is also concerned about landmines.      He wonders where most of them are.       Patrick L. Most of the landmines, Christopher, are in      Africa.       Oneroom 1. Dylan says that it scared him too. Brooke says      her favorite book is ``Anne of Green Gables.'' Sammi wonders      if you can make a link from your site to our web page.       Oneroom 1. Brian wonders if that's your wife skating with      you in the picture on your web page.       Patrick L. Sammi we will link it with the transcript and a      couple drawing. Dylan I know what you mean and Brooke I liked      that one too and read it to my children when they were young.       Oneroom 1. All of the children say thank you for taking the      time to do this. This is cool to talk back and forth like      this. And it's neat the way we can send questions and have      you answer them. Thank you very much. We have to go to recess      now.       Patrick L. Brian that is my wife Marcelle with me and it      was taken on one of the fields at our farm in Middlesex--just      a ways up route 100.       Patrick L. Thanks--wish I could go to recess with you but      instead will head to the Senate floor. I am very proud of all      of you and thank you!                          ____________________
