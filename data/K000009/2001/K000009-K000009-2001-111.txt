Chairman, I want to compliment the wonderful, wonderful gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) and the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton). Would I not know that the two of them would do something this significant? What they are proposing is only to continue what the House had agreed to do in conference last year, and that is to use the food power of this country to help alleviate suffering around the world, and certainly the plague of HIV/AIDS.  Their effort uses the power of food in the most creative way possible. Yet the sponsors of the amendment and all who support it should keep in mind that the President's budget proposes a review of the 416 programs with an eye toward reducing their availability. So, those who utilize and understand these programs need to be prepared to speak out before these programs are eliminated or reduced.  I want to thank the gentlewomen for bringing this up before the full House to make sure that we effectively use the dollars that are there, and not permit the food surplus of this country to be subscribed in a way that would not be made available to those who truly need it globally. I support them in their efforts.
