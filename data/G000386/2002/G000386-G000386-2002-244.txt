 President, before I speak about the volume of misinformation we have on the renewable fuel standard, there were a couple statements made in the debate by the Senator from Oklahoma that I want to address.  No. 1, don't assume ethanol is going to increase the cost of gasoline. At least in my State, you find in most cases ethanol in gasoline will sell for 2 cents a gallon cheaper than gasoline without ethanol. If that is not the case, it is the same price. Very rarely do you find anytime that ethanol in gasoline causes the price of that gasoline to be higher than gasoline without ethanol.  The other misinformation we ought to clear up is the use of the word ``subsidy.'' Because of the consumer tax on gasoline not being as high if it has ethanol in it as without ethanol, that is a lower rate of taxation. The subsidy, as we use it in this body, refers to money coming from the Federal Treasury to benefit somebody. When a consumer pays less tax on a gallon of gasoline because it has some ethanol in it, that is less tax. Do the proponents of this bill suggest we ought to raise the tax on gasoline because there is ethanol in it? Some of these Members I hear abhor the idea that there ought to be any increase in any tax, let alone an increase in the gasoline tax.  Those are two things I wanted to clear up.  Now, about this misinformation, I know my colleagues who are supporting this amendment are very intelligent people. I don't think they are purposely misleading us. There has been some propaganda spread by some industries in this country, and it has been picked up by some Members of Congress. They have lent their credibility and voice to this antireformulated fuels standard in a way that, quite frankly, does not do anybody any good. This misinformation campaign can help only two interests: It can help producers of MTBE, which production contaminates our drinking water supplies--and it does this in the States of California and New York; that has been very well documented; secondly, Middle East producers of both oil and MTBE that seek to tighten a very dangerous grip they have upon America's energy security.  How does this misinformation campaign help MTBE producers? That is because the reformulated fuel standard includes an MTBE ban. The MTBE producers know that the entire reformulated fuel standard will unravel if they can chip away at it with some amendments.  A broad coalition of interests helped produce this balanced compromise we have before us. This coalition may very well be unprecedented. The coalition consists of farm groups, petroleum and renewable fuel producers, environmental groups, and State environmental agencies. I had an opportunity to address a group where the American Petroleum Institute had one of their employees. I had to tell him, when I heard of their supporting this compromise, it is a good thing I had a good heart. Otherwise, I would have passed out as a result of it because they have never been with this group of people in the past. Here they see the need for renewable fuels as well.  They all agreed to a compromise proposal embodied within the renewable fuel standard that in the past seemed impossible to accomplish.  What do MTBE producers do? They get their consultant, Hart/IRI, to cook numbers to make it look as if requiring ethanol usage will cause motor fuel prices to go up by almost 10 cents a gallon. This is blatantly false. The truth is, according to the Energy Information Administration, requiring ethanol under the renewable fuel standardwill increase motor fuel costs, if at all, by one-half a cent to a penny per gallon.  So we have had a couple Senators address this issue in a Dear Colleague letter. I will quote from the letter, ``MTBE Consultant Misleads Members on Ethanol Debate.'' Let me share with you the letter from Senators Johnson and Hagel. I quote:       Senators from New York and California have distributed      charts and spoken on the floor, claiming that the renewable      fuels standard will increase consumer costs by 4-9.75 cents      per gallon. The source of this data is the MTBE consulting      firm, Hart/IRI, which claims it based its cost estimates on      data from the Energy Information Administration.  Further quoting:       [The Energy Information Administration] has completed two      analyses. . . . The first, found that the MTBE ban would      increase gasoline costs 4-10.5 cents per gallon, while the      renewable fuels standard could increase gasoline costs by 1      cent per gallon in reformulated gasoline areas, and .05 per      gallon overall.  I want my colleagues to listen very carefully to the next sentence from this letter:       Hart/IRI lumped these costs together and attributed . . .      them to the renewable fuels standard, making that provision      appear to be roughly ten times more expensive than it is.  Continuing to quote:       Since the fuels compromise bans MTBE, Hart/IRI has every      incentive to exaggerate and misrepresent the cost impacts on      the legislation. It is ironic and unfortunate that some      members--whose states have already banned MTBE, because it      has poisoned their drinking water--chose to use this MTBE      consulting firm's analysis rather than relying upon the      objective EIA numbers.  We ought to repeat that sentence:       It is unfortunate and ironic that some members--whose      states have already banned MTBE, because it has poisoned      their drinking water--chose to use this MTBE consulting      firm's analysis rather than relying upon the objective EIA      numbers.  We proponents of this renewable fuels standard are trying to help consumers in California and New York. We are trying to reduce their dependence upon MTBE, because it poisons the groundwater, and oil, and both of those come from the Middle East. In fact, we are trying to do so in a manner directly advocated in 1999 by the two California Senators and the senior Senator from New York when the Senate approved Senator Boxer's resolution calling for the ban of MTBE and replacing the MTBE with renewable ethanol. That is what the resolution said.  Yet today our efforts are opposed because our legislation would increase the use of ethanol made by farmers and ethanol producers in America's Middle West as opposed to getting our energy from the Middle East.  Our opponents claim they are worried about supply shortages and price spikes. Yet how can any Member of this body be more worried about ethanol from the Midwest than they are about MTBE and oil from the Middle East? How can anyone oppose America's farmers and ethanol by using bogus information from an MTBE consultant. It is unbelievable, isn't it?  Mr. President, what the MTBE consultant did was distort an analysis of banning MTBE included in an earlier proposal, not the proposal pending before the Senate. The Energy Information Administration did two analyses. The outdated one concluded that an MTBE ban under the old proposal would increase consumer costs by 4 to 10 cents a gallon. Requiring the use of ethanol under the old analysis would cost at most a penny a gallon.  A second Energy Information Administration analysis was conducted, but this time it focused on the pending legislation. The Energy Information Administration concluded that banning MTBE would increase the cost of motor fuel by about 2 to 4 cents per gallon, and again it found that requiring ethanol would increase consumers' cost by less than one penny a gallon.  Again, who are we to believe, the MTBE industry, which will lose if MTBE is banned, or the Energy Information Administration?  Let me critique this for my colleagues with a closer look. Those who are offering killer amendments to this renewable fuel standard point out in detail, State by State, the price increases consumers will supposedly suffer if the renewable fuel standard is adopted.  The bogus Hart/IRI analysis concluded, for instance, Arizona consumers would pay 7.6 cents more per gallon; Maryland, 9.1 cents; Texas, 5.7 cents; Pennsylvania, 9.1 cents; New York, 7.1 cents; California, 9.6 cents, and I can go through the 50 States.  When one looks slightly below the surface and gives the Hart/IRI study even a moment's attention, one will see but half a cent or a penny of these predicted price hikes are related to the ban of MTBE and not the cost of requiring ethanol.  Our renewable fuel standard opponents want us to fear price hikes, but they do not want us to figure out that the price hikes are driven by banning MTBE. Instead, the aim is to mislead us into thinking ethanol causes the price hikes, but by using this pro-MTBE consulting firm study and by subtracting the half cent or penny-cost increase supposedly relating to ethanol, we find that what our New York and California colleagues are really arguing is that if we ban MTBE, the cost of gasoline will go up by 8.6 cents per gallon in California and by 6.1 cents per gallon in New York.  What is the logical conclusion? Isn't that simple? If we are to believe the studies used by our colleagues from New York and California, the only conclusion we can draw is they do not want to ban MTBE because the price of gas will go up.  The opponents of the renewable fuel standard cannot have it both ways. They have to make up their minds. Either they want to ban MTBE to protect drinking water or they want to keep using MTBE so prices do not spike. The bed was made with Hart/IRI; now lay in it.  Mr. President, surely we can put a little more care into debate so important as our energy security. Some of our colleagues who are opposing the renewable fuel standard mentioned in passing that there is cleaner fuel at less cost and that we do not need to use oxygenates. Really.  In 1991, the California Energy Commission compared the cost of ethanol-blended motor fuel with motor fuel that included no oxygenates, neither ethanol nor MTBE. In short, the California Energy Commission found that nonoxygenated fuels could cost more per gallon than ethanol-blended motor fuels.  I note that the California Energy Commission analysis was done when annual ethanol production capacity stood at less than 1.7 billion gallons, and it was when skeptics said there would not be enough ethanol to replace MTBE. Today ethanol production capacity stands at 2.3 billion gallons per year.  I hope that settles some of the fears the Senator from Oklahoma had about whether we have the capacity to do it. We have unused capacity right now. We also have new plants coming online, and production capacity will increase to 2.7 billion gallons per year by the end of December and climb to between 3.5 billion and 4 billion gallons by the end of 2003.  I suggest that given the large increase in ethanol capacity, ethanol-blended motor fuel would be even cheaper than estimated by the California Energy Commission.  Moreover, even the recent Energy Information Administration study concluding motor fuel could go up a penny if ethanol is required may be too high because it does not take into consideration the efficiencies of the credit trading program.  Our California and New York colleagues argue that nonoxygenated motor fuel is cheaper than ethanol-blended fuel, but that contention is just the opposite of what the California Energy Commission reported. Our colleagues choose not to take their information from the California Energy Commission and they choose not to take their information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. They would rather take their information from an MTBE consultant. Why would they do this? I wish I knew.  I want to share another independent source of energy analysis produced by the Department of Energy's Office of Transportation Technologies. These two draft studies underscore the extreme importance of expanding renewable fuel use, particularly now that we aim to ban MTBE because it poisons our water.  In short, these analyses conclude that alternative and replacement fuels leverage lower prices for consumersand reduce the impact of OPEC oil-producing nations.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two economic analyses of the benefits of replacing gasoline with alternative fuels be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Oil Price Benefits of Increasing Replacement/Alternative Fuel Market   Share, Draft Analysis, Office of Transportation Technologies, U.S.                           Department of Energy       Increasing the market share of alternative and replacement      transportation fuels would have significant energy security      and oil market benefits for the United States. Some of these      benefits will occur even if use of the fuels is induced by      regulations, subsidies, or demonstration programs. Additional      energy security benefits would be generated if the fuels are      competitive with petroleum fuels in at least some market      segments.       Competitive alternative and replacement fuels produce      energy security benefits in two principal ways:       First, by reducing the quantity of petroleum consumed and      imported, they reduce the vulnerability of the economy to oil      price shocks.       Second, by increasing the price-responsiveness of oil      demand, they reduce the market power of the OPEC cartel,      making it more difficult for OPEC to raise prices and the      sustain those price increases.       Today alternative and replacement fuels account for 3.6      percent of total U.S. gasoline demand. The majority of this      is blending stocks used in gasoline. Methyl tertiary butyl      ether, MTBE, which is predominately derived from natural gas,      comprises 2.6 percent of gasoline demand. Ethanol produced      from renewable energy sources, which is primarily blended      into gasoline, comprises 0.7 percent of gasoline demand. The      use of MTBE is driven by clean air requirements, while      ethanol use is subsidized by a partial exemption from motor      fuel excise taxes. Alternatives to petroleum-based fuels,      such as propane, compressed natural gas, alcohols,      electricity and biodiesel comprise only 0.3 percent of total      U.S. gasoline use.       Even these modest levels of alternative and replacement      fuel uses are providing some energy security benefits. In a      very preliminary, draft market simulation of world oil      markets, we have estimated the world oil price impacts of      U.S. alternative and replacement fuel use. The following      results were obtained.       The present 3.6 percent market share of alternative/     replacement fuels produces an approximately $1.00/barrel      reduction in oil prices from what they would be if      alternative/replacement fuels were not used at all. At      current U.S. oil consumption levels of 6.8 billion barrels,      this level of alternative/replacement fuel use results in a      savings of approximately $7 billion on an annual basis.       If the U.S. were to achieve the 10 percent replacement fuel      goal of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, oil prices could be      reduced by approximately $3.00/barrel. At current U.S. oil      consumption levels of 6.8 billion barrels, this level of      alternative/replacement fuel use would result in a savings of      approximately $20 billion on an annual basis.                                  ____  The Impacts of Alternative and Replacement Fuel Use on Oil Prices--                                 Draft                          (By David L. Greene)       This memorandum presents estimates of the long-run oil      market benefits of increased use of alternative and      replacement fuels by highway vehicles in the United States.      No attempt is made to estimate the costs of increasing use of      alternative energy sources. Potential benefits in the event      of possible future oil price shocks are not addressed. Nor      are likely environmental benefits considered. Current use of      alternative and replacement fuels is estimated to reduce      total U.S. petroleum costs by about $1.3 billion per year      (about $0.29 per barrel). Cumulative savings from 1992 to      2000 are estimated to be $9 billion. Increasing alternative      and replacement fuel use to 10% of motor fuel use by 2010 is      estimated to increase oil market benefits to $6 billion per      year ($0.68/bbl), for a 2000-2010 cumulative savings of $35      billion. These estimates were made using a very simple model      of world oil markets and are contingent on the assumption      that historical and projected OPEC production levels do not      change.        Oil Market Benefits of Alternative and Replacement Fuels       Displacing petroleum with alternative and replacement      transportation fuels helps hold down petroleum prices in two      ways. First, reducing the demand for petroleum makes it      harder for OPEC to raise oil prices. Although the actual      impact will depend on precisely how OPEC responds, a      reasonable rule of thumb is that a 1% decrease in U.S.      petroleum demand will reduce world oil price by about 0.5%,      in the long-run. Short-run (1 year or less) impacts would be      even greater, due to the short-run inelasticity of oil supply      and demand. The Energy Information Administration offers the      following as a rule of thumb for short-run supply reductions.       ``For every one million barrel per day (1 MMBD) of oil      disputed, world oil prices could increase by $3-5 barrel.''      http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/security/rule.html       Demand reductions would have the exact opposite effect,      assuming OPEC took no action to cut back production in      response. One MMBD would be about 5% of U.S. oil consumption,      whereas $3-5 per barrel would be a 15-25% price increase, if      oil cost $20 per barrel, suggesting a short-run elasticity      about ten times as large as the long-run elasticity. This      leads us to the second oil price benefit of alternative and      replacement fuel use, the potential for increased price      elasticity in case of a supply disruption.       The existence of an alternative source of liquid fuels      supply can also increase the elasticity of oil demand by      providing a potential substitute for oil in the event of a      price shock caused by a sudden reduction in supply. It is      precisely the inelasticity of oil demand and supply that      makes price shocks possible. Increasing the elasticity of      demand mitigates the impact of a supply shortage on      prices.               estimating the long-run oil price benefits       The long-run oil market benefit of alternative and      replacement fuels can be approximately estimated by a simple      simulation model of the world oil market. The model is      comprised of two demand equations and two supply equations      representing U.S. and Rest-of-World, and a assumed level of      OPEC output. All supply and demand equations are linear and      depend on current price and lagged quantity. A year-specific      constant term is used to calibrate the equations to exactly      match the 2000 Annual Energy Outlook Reference Case      projections. Since the equations are linear, elasticity      increases with increasing oil price and decreases with      increasing oil demand. Representative elasticities are shown      in table 1 for the U.S. and ROW at various oil prices and      1998 quantities.

The impact on oil prices is therefore best answered by      answering the question, how much would prices rise if there      were no alternative and replacement fuel use? This      counterfactual analysis also requires an assumption about      OPEC behavior. It is assumed that there is no change in OPEC      behavior. In other words, oil supply by OPEC is held constant      at historical and AEO 2000 projected levels. Given the      relatively small amounts of alternative and replacement fuel      use, this assumption seems quite reasonable. Of course, in      reality OPEC could increase or decrease output. By increasing      output, OPEC would lower prices further, increasing the oil      market benefits. If OPEC cut production, say enough to      restore oil price to the prior levels, there would still be      oil market benefits, though they would be more difficult to      quantify. First, at lower production levels OPEC would have a      smaller market share and thus less market power than before.      This would make it more difficult for OPEC to create a price      shock, to raise prices further, and to maintain discipline      among its members. Second, the loss of wealth by the U.S.      economy due to monopoly pricing would be reduced, because      the U.S. would be consuming less imported oil. Thus, if      OPEC reacted to increased U.S. alternative and replacement      fuel use by further production cutbacks to restore the      price level, the nature and magnitude of oil market      benefits might change, but there would still be      significant benefits.       Two alternative ``what if'' scenarios were analyzed: (1)      what if there had been no alternative or replacement fuel use      after 1991? 2) what if, starting in 2001, alternative and      replacement fuel use increased to 10% of U.S. motor fuel use      by 2010? Actual U.S. alternative and replacement fuel use is      shown in table 2. Alternative fuel use increased from 230      million gallons of gasoline equivalent in 1992 to 341 million      gallons in 1999, with usage of 368 million gallons projected      for 2000. Replacement fuel use increased from 2,106 million      gallons in 1992 to 4,311 million gallons in 1999 with usage      of 4,388 projected for 2000. As a fraction of total motor      fuel use, alternative and replacement fuels amounted to 1.57%      in 1992 and comprised 2.71% in 1999.

The first scenario assumes that there was no alternative or      replacement fuel use by highway vehicles, and that petroleum      use (before oil market equilibration) would increase by      exactly the amount of actual alternative and replacement fuel      use. Assuming OPEC production would not have changed, new      world oil prices, supplies and demands were computed for the      higher level of oil demand. The resulting price increases are      modest, because the 0.14 to 0.29 million barrels per day      (mmbd) of U.S. alternative and replacement fuel use is small      relative to the 67.5 to 77.9 mmbd of world petroleum      consumption over the 1992-2000 period. In 1992, oil prices      are estimated to be $0.08/barrel higher, rising to an $0.16/     bbl increment by 1999. Implied total oil cost savings from      alternative and replacement fuel use rise from $500 million      in 1999 to $1.3 billion by 2000, with a cumulative total      savings of 9.1 billion by 2000 (undiscounted 1998 dollars).       The impacts of increasing alternative and replacement fuel      use to 10% of motor fuel use by 2010 are estimated in a      similar way. The AEO 2000 forecast includes increasing levels      of alternative and replacement fuel use, but the projected      levels are far lower than 10% of total motor fuel use. Rather      than create an alternative world and U.S. oil market      projection, it is assumed that the AEO 2000 projection      contains no alternative or replacement fuel use. U.S.      petroleum demand is then lowered by an amounts which increase      gradually to 10% of motor fuel demand in 2010. Motor fuel      demand is assumed to increase at the rate of 1.5% per year      from 163.15 billion gallons in 2000 to 189.34 billion gallons      in 2010. Thus, alternative and replacement fuel use is      assumed to increase from its estimated 2000 level of 4.39      billion gallons (0.29 mmbd) to 18.93 billion gallons (1.23      mmbd) in 2010. As a result of the consequent reduction in      U.S. oil demand, world oil prices drop by approximately      $0.68/bbl in 2010. The estimated cumulative savings from 2000      to 2010 is $35 billion.       Neither of these estimates takes into account the potential      benefits of increased alternative fuel use in mitigating the      impacts of possible future oil price shocks, or even reducing      the probability of oil price shocks. The size of the      potential benefits would depend not only on the size and      frequency of future price shocks, but on how much the      substitution of alternatives for petroleum increased the      price elasticity of demand for oil. Methods for making such      calculations have yet to be developed. As a result, the      numbers presented above should be considered lower bounds, in      the sense that they estimate only part of the full range of      oil market benefits of greater use of alternative and      replacement fuels. Likewise, no attempt is made here to      estimate the costs of increasing use of substitutes for      petroleum.
