Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  We come to the end of the debate on the central amendment. This is the amendment. This is the vote. This is the time when Congress will decide whether or not we will have campaign finance reform.  I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment. I ask them to take this historic step for the House and for America.
