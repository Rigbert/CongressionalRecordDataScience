President, I rise today to comment briefly on the issue of H1-B visas. Like most if not all Democrats, I believe that the number of H1-B visas--which are used by foreign workers wishing to work in the United States--should be increased.  I also believe that we should address other immigration priorities. First, we should ensure that we treat all people who fled tyranny in Central America equally, regardless of whether the tyrannical regime they fled was a left-wing or a right-wing government. Congress has already acted to protect Nicaraguans and Cubans, as well it should. It is now time to apply the same protections to Guatemalans, Salvadorans, Hondurans, and also Haitians.  Second, we should prevent people on the verge of gaining legal permanent resident status from being forced to leave their jobs and their families for lengthy periods in order to complete the process. U.S. law allowed such immigrants to remain in the country until 1997, when Congress failed to renew the provision. It is now time to correct that error.  Third, we should allow people who have lived and worked here for 14 years or more, contributing to the American economy, to adjust their immigration status. This principle has been a part of American immigration law since the 1920s and should be updated now for the first time since 1986.  Vice President Gore shares these priorities, as reflected in a letter he wrote on July 26 to Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard. In this letter, he endorses an increase in the number of H1-B visas and each of the three proposals I have outlined briefly here today. The Vice President's position on this issue is the right position, and it is the compassionate position. I urge the Senate to take up S. 2912, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act--a bill that would accomplish each of the three immigration goals I have just discussed--and pass it without further delay.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           The Vice President,                                        Washington, July 26, 2000.     Hon. Lucille Roybal-Allard,     Member of Congress,     Washington, DC.       Dear Lucille: As Congress concludes this work period, with      few legislative days left this session, I want to communicate      my continued support for legislation addressing fairness for      legal immigrants.       America's economic prosperity stems in large part from the      hard work of American workers and the innovation offered by      American firms. As a result of the longest period of economic      growth in our history, it is not surprising that we have      achieved record low levels of unemployment. This positive      employment picture is especially true among highly skilled      and highly educated workers. In some sectors of the economy,      it appears there may be genuine shortages of highly skilled      workers necessary to sustain our economic growth. As a      result, our Administration has offered a series of proposals      aimed at dramatic improvements in the education and training      of American workers. These proposals ought to be enacted by      the Congress to assure that any gap between worker skills and      employer needs is addressed comprehensively.       I recognize that periodically American industry requires      access to the international labor market to maintain and      enhance our global competitiveness, particularly in high-     growth new technology industries and tight labor markets. For      these reasons, I support legislation to make reasonable and      temporary increases to the H-1B visa cap to address      industry's immediate need for high-skilled workers. However,      this increase must also include significant labor protections      for American workers and a significant increase in H-1B      application fees to fund programs to prepare American      workers--especially those from under-represented groups--to      fill these and future jobs.       In addition, I support measures that provide fairness and      equity for certain immigrants already in the United States.      Therefore, as Congress considers allowing more foreign      temporary workers into this country to meet employers' needs,      I urge Congress to correct two injustices currently affecting      many immigrants already in our nation. I want to urge Members      to pass two important immigration proposals that have long      been     Administration priorities--providing parity to Central      Americans and Haitians under NACARA and changing the registry      date to allow certain long-term migrants to adjust to legal      permanent resident status. These proposals are much-needed      and would restore fairness to our immigration system and      American families. The registry date and the Central American      and Haitian Parity Act proposals would provide good people      who have developed ties to this country--families, homes, and      roots in their communities--the opportunity to adjust their      status. I am extremely disappointed that many in the      Congressional majority seem intent on refusing to pass or      even vote on these important immigration provisions. One way      or another, however, the Congressional majority has an      obligation to allow a vote on these issues and to join us in      passing these measures of basic justice and fairness. The      migrants and their families who would benefit from the      registry date proposal have been in immigration limbo for up      to two decades and are in desperate need of a resolution to      their efforts to become full members of American society. In      the case of Central Americans and Haitians, the parity      provision would not only provide compassion and fairness for      the affected immigrants, but also contribute to the stability      and development of democracy and peace in their native      countries.       I also urge Congress to pass and fund other Administration      priorities that would address the needs of immigrants.      Reinstatement of section 245(i) would allow families to stay      together while an adjustment of status application is      pending. The Administration's FY 2001 budget proposal would      fund programs to ensure that immigrants' services have the      resources needed to reduce the backlog of applications from      people seeking naturalization and adjustment of status.       Finally, I urge Congress to fully fund the Administration's      $75 million request for the English Language/Civics and      Lifeskills Initiative that will allow communities to provide      more English language courses that are linked to civics and      lifeskills instruction to adults with limited English      language proficiency. Immigrants are eager to learn English      and all about civic responsibility, but the demand for      programs outweighs the supply. We need to provide      opportunities for these new Americans to become full      participants in our society.       For these reasons, Congress should consider and enact these      legislative proposals and fund the programs we requested. I      commend your leadership in this area, and I look forward to      working closely with you to enact these important immigration      measures.           Sincerely,     Al Gore.                          ____________________
