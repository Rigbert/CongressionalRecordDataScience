President, I would like to pay tribute today to a man who has provided immeasurable leadership and dedication to the lives of young people and families around the State of Vermont, Tom Howard of East Montpelier. After 31 years as executive director, Tom will be retiring this month from the Washington County Youth Service Bureau/Boys & Girls Club.  Tom is a native Vermonter who, while growing up, lived in the Philippines, Panama, Germany, and throughout the United States. He served in the U.S. Army in Korea between 1963 and 1966, and earned a B.A. from Johnson State College in history and international relations in 1970. Tom went on to earn a master's degree in executive development in public service at Ball State University in 1974, and wrote his master's thesis on youthful offenders.  Appointed as executive director of the bureau in 1979, Tom has built the agency into a diverse organization with statewide impact. Under his leadership, the organization developed cutting-edge programs, like the Return House in Barre, VT--a program operated by the Washington County Youth Service Bureau for 18- to 22-year-old young men who are returning to the community after being incarcerated. In addition to his commitment to working with young people and youthful offenders, Tom has secured millions of dollars in Federal, State, and foundation grants to bring sustainable services and opportunities to youth.  We are fortunate in Vermont. I am always impressed by the high level of collaboration on behalf of Vermont's communities to solve its problems. Over the years, I have brought the Senate Judiciary Committee to Vermont several times for field hearings to explore community efforts to counter drug-related crime in rural America.On each occasion, I have looked to Tom for testimony about the work he and his organization have done with youthful offenders. Tom not only offers his knowledge of work going on around the State, but provides the expertise of his organization, and personal stories about the lives of the young people he works with.  As a fellow photographer, I would be remiss if I failed to note that Tom's office documents a life full of adventure. His walls depict the bureau's accomplishments--such as when he was invited to represent Vermont's 21st Century Community Learning Center Programs at a White House Ceremony hosted by President Bill Clinton. They also capture the faces of those who inspire him, like the pupils for whom he served as a teacher and counselor at the Wittlich Prison in West Germany.  I believe Tom embodies the core principles of what it takes to serve Vermont's youth, from his skill as an administrator, to his contribution as a caring person. I thank Tom for all that he does, and I commend his work to the Senate as an example to others. We are grateful for his service to Vermont's young people and families for the past 31 years. Marcelle and I wish Tom and his family all the best.                          ____________________
