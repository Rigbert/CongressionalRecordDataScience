Plum Brook is part of the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center and is home to unique world-class facilities that conduct critical and innovative ground tests for the international aerospace community. Plum Brook Station is testing a new generation of space exploration hardware for NASA's efforts to explore the lunar surface and to again land humans on the Moon. Similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate by Senators Brown (D-OH) and Portman (R-OH).  Ohio is not only the birthplace of aviation, it is also the birthplace of one of human history's all-time great explorers and aviators: Neil Armstrong, the first man to ever set foot anywhere other than on our planet Earth. A native Ohioan, Neil Armstrong served as a Navy pilot and later served the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) at the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, now known as north east Ohio's NASA John H. Glenn Research Center, of which NASA Plum Brook is affiliated.  Armstrong's `small step for man, one giant leap for mankind' has gone down as one of the most significant and memorable events in human history. Armstrong has inspired countless young people to pursue careers in aviation and public service, young people who will carry on and build upon his immeasurable legacy. It is an honor to introduce this bipartisan legislation alongside Rep. Gonzalez in the House and Senators Brown and Portman in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________
