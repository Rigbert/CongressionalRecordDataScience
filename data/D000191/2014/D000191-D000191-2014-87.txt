Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us brought by the gentleman from New York has tremendous merit. This is a chapter of history that many of us have forgotten or didn't learn in school, but the 11,500 lives that were lost aboard British prison ships while our country fought for its independence during the Revolutionary War is certainly a very, very important national and nationally significant site.                              {time}  1745  The site has been managed by the New York Department of Parks and Recreation, but the gentleman from New York has rightly pointed out in his advocacy that this should actually be a site that has national significance. He therefore has authored--and hopefully today we will successfully see passed--H.R. 1501, which would direct the Secretary of the Interior to complete a study within 1 year on the feasibility of designating the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, New York, as a unit of the National Park System. I would hope that this legislation would be broadly supported.  With that, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).
