 President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, ACOG, in celebration of their 50th Anniversary. I would also like to include the letter signed by several of my colleagues who have joined with me in offering congratulations to ACOG and to pay tribute to their efforts on behalf of women's health.  With a membership of over 41,000 physicians specializing in obstetric-gynecologic are, ACOG is the nation's leading group of professionals dedicated to improving women's health care. ACOG is a private, voluntary, nonprofit organization.  Throughout its history, the purpose of ACOG has been to maintain the best standards of health care for women. Today, about 95 percent of American obstetricians and gynecologists are affiliated with ACOG. Over 35 percent of ACOG Fellows are women, and over 63 percent of Junior Fellows are women. ACOG works in four primary areas:  Serving as a strong advocate for quality health care for women.  Increasing awareness among its members and the public of the changing issues facing women's health care.  Maintaining the highest standards of clinical practice and continuing education for its members.  Promoting patient education and stimulating patient understanding of, and involvement in, medical care.  ACOG's reliable and informative communication with us on Capitol Hill has been a valuable asset in guiding our policy debates. Congratulations to ACOG, and thank you for providing a welcome voice to Capitol Hill on women's health policy.  I ask that a letter dated February 21, 2001, be printed in the Record.  The letter follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 21, 2001.     Hon.
