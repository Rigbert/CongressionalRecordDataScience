  Specifically, I would like to address the stipulation contained in the committee report that would prevent the Federal Transit Administration from entering into a full funding grant agreement for the BART-SFO extension until all litigation regarding the project has been resolved. I have very strong concerns that this requirement could result in indefinite delays in the project. Further, I understand Secretary Pena, Governor Wilson, and the Federal Transit Administration [FTA] share these same concerns.  I understand it is not the chairman's intent with this report language to kill this project. Further, the chairman does not intend to impose any restrictions on the BART-SFO extension that have not previously been demanded of this and other transit projects seeking full funding grant agreements from the FTA.  I have a July 30 letter from Secretary Pena stating that the language contained in the committee report could encourage lawsuits and further that he would prefer not to see this language included. I understand the chairman does not intend to encourage frivolous lawsuits with this language, and further, I understand in speaking with the chairman that I can be assured this committee report language will be revised during the conference negotiations with the House to reflect the chairman's intent to move ahead with this project.
