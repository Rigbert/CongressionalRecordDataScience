SCALISE. I would be happy to yield when we talk about all the things that this House could be doing that it is not, like lowering drug prices, like getting better trade deals with our friends in Mexico and in Canada and in all the other countries that are lined up that would love to come behind USMCA that can't right now.  They can't because there is this infatuation with impeachment, in a one-sided way, in a closed way, in a Soviet-style Star Chamber.  But that is not happening right now. This is what is not happening; this is what is happening. It is not what the American people expected out of this majority.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.
