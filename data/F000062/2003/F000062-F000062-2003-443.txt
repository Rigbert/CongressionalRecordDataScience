 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. I appreciate that. I was a mayor for 9 years. I required all of the departments to have portable radios. Every Monday we would test their radio systems at 7:30 because, in the event of an earthquake, at that time there was no other way for all the city departments to talk to one another except over a radio system. So I know firsthand the importance of interoperable communications.  I appreciate the comments. Thank you very much.  I yield the floor.
