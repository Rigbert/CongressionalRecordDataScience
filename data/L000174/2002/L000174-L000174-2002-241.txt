407, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, which continues to be blocked from Senate consideration. As I said in an earlier statement on June 7, 2002, there are important bills that have cleared the Democratic side of the aisle and that have bipartisan support, but are being blocked by holds placed by anonymous Republican Senators. Last week, I spoke about legislation concerning national security and law enforcement, including S. 1770, implementing legislation for two anti-terrorism treaties. Fortunately, today, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the Leahy-Hatch substitute amendment to S. 1770 to help ensure that the United States continues to lead the world in the global fight against terrorism. I rise today to speak about protecting the intellectual property of American business.  I introduced S. 407, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, with Senator Hatch last year to provide implementing legislation for an important treaty, the Madrid Protocol. This bill promises to help American businesses better protect their intellectual property in the international marketplace.  The Clinton administration transmitted the Madrid Protocol to the Senate for ratification in 2000, but no action was taken while the Senate was under majority control by the Republicans. Under the leadership of Chairman Biden, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in November, 2001, reported the Madrid Protocol to the Senate with the recommendation that the Senate give its advice and consent to accession to the Madrid Protocol.  S. 407 would implement this new treaty. The legislation would make no substantive change in American trademark law. The bill would set up new procedures for trademark applicants to file a single trademark application with the Patent and Trademark Office. This single filing would give the applicant ``one stop'' international trademark registration--a process only available to signatory countries to the Protocol. This would benefit American businesses and companies who need to protect their trademarks as they sell their goods and services in international markets, including over the Internet.  The House version of this bill, H.R. 741, has already passed the Republican House of Representatives, as it has for the past three Congresses. The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported this bill favorably to the full Senate in July, 2001, and we have been trying unsuccessfully to get it passed by unanimous consent ever since.  This bill is critical in keeping our trademark laws up-to-date. It represents a significant step in our efforts to ensure that American trademark law adequately serves and promotes American interests. It is time for the anonymous, secret Republican holds on S. 407 to be lifted so that the Senate can pass this important legislation to protect the private intellectual property of Americans in the global economy.                          ____________________
