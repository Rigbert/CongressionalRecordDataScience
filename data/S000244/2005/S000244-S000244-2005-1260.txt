Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this concurrent resolution commends the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its contribution to the Nation's economy and the DaimlerChrysler Corporation and its employees for their achievement in receiving the 500,000th design patent issued by the Patent and Trademark Office.  Mr. Speaker, we all recognize the important role that innovation and invention have played in our Nation's history and economy. We also know that by ensuring protection for our ideas, we provide significant incentive for inventors to continue to come up with new concepts that improve our lives, whether it is a machine that raises productivity or a pharmaceutical drug that cures a life-threatening disease. The efforts of the PTO in aiding such accomplishments are certainly noteworthy.  I commend the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the Motor City, for introducing this resolution and congratulate DaimlerChrysler as the recipient of this landmark number patent. I urge the House to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
