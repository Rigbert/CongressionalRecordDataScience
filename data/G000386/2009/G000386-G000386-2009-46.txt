 President, we keep hearing about all the tax cuts that are in this 2,074-page bill. Earlier today, I heard the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois say this, after Senator Kyl was done speaking, and I am reading from the transcript.       First, this bill has $441 billion in tax cuts in the first      10 years for average people trying to pay their health      insurance premiums. I don't know if the Senator from      Arizona--  There he means Senator Kyl--     thinks that is a good idea or not. He has never spoken to      that at least that I have heard. I think it is a good idea.      If you are making less than $80,000 a year, I want to make      sure you have insurance, and this bill wants to make sure we      give you a helping hand. It is a tax cut.  First of all, when you have a tax credit or subsidy for buying insurance, the Joint Committee on Taxation describes 73 percent of that as outlays, 27 percent as tax reductions. So to call $441 billion a tax cut is completely contrary to the way scorekeepers for the Congress keep track of things.  The second thing I noticed, in talking about helping people earning $80,000 a year or so--and I heard another Senator speak frankly about tax increases for people at $75,000--is that there seems to be an effort to define down what the middle class is, from the way the President of the United States described it during his campaign--individuals under $200,000 and families under $250,000 being the middle class.  Well, I wish to go into some detail about this because I have had an opportunity to speak on this point and I think other Members have as well and somehow we don't seem to get through to our friends on the other side of the aisle who have consistently stated that the Reid bill, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, is a net tax cut--and emphasis upon the word ``net.''  Yesterday, this chart was used to illustrate this point--a chart the other side was using to illustrate that point. This chart I am referring to has multiple bars with dollar figures. For example, in 2019 we see here a figure of $40.8 billion net tax cut. My Democratic friends said this number came from the Joint Committee on Taxation. Unfortunately, the chart my friends were using at that time is not entirely clear on how they came up with this net tax cut, so that is what I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues. It was quite natural for most to wonder how that number came about, so they said: Show me the data.  To clear up any confusion, here is the Joint Committee on Taxation table the Democrats relied on to claim that the Reid bill results in a net tax cut. Do you see here this negative figure of $40,786 million? Of course, negative, that minus mark there. My friends on the other side, unfortunately, do not explain what is going on. Instead, it appears the other side simply made an assertion that they hope many of us, and those in the media, would believe. I am not going to let my friends on the other side of the aisle get away with this because the entire story is not being told. So let me take a moment to explain.  First, in simplest terms, where you see the negative number on this chart, the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us there is some type of tax benefit going to the taxpayers. For example, families making between $50,000 and $75,000 you can see have a negative $10,489 number in their column. This means the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us that this income category is receiving $10.4 billion in tax benefits. But I need to have you listen more closely because when we see a negative number on this chart, the Joint Committee tells us there is a tax benefit. So, conversely, where we see positive numbers, in these areas here, where you see positive numbers, the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us these taxpayers are seeing a tax increase.  I have actually enlarged those numbers of tax returns and the dollar amounts where there is a positive number for individuals and families--once again, right in here. These positive numbers indicate a tax increase.  My friends have said that all tax returns on this chart are receiving a net tax cut. If this were so, why are there not negative numbers next to all the dollars on this chart? Because not everyone on this chart is receiving a tax cut, despite what has been said, including just within the last hour. Quite to the contrary, a number of taxpayers are clearly seeing a tax increase. This group of taxpayers is middle-income taxpayers.  I didn't come down to the floor to say my friends on the other side are wrong. After all, you can see the negative numbers quite frequently on the chart. After all, you see this negative number, $40,800 million. What I am doing is clarifying that my friends on the other side cannot spread this $40.8 billion tax cut across all of the affected taxpayers on this chart and then say all have received a tax cut. Why? Because this chart produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation shows that taxes go up for individuals making more than $50,000 and families making more than $75,000. It is right here on these yellow figures. Numbers do not lie.  Of course, people who inhabit the Joint Committee on Taxation are professional people who do not have a political agenda, and they tell it like it is. That is what they are hired for. That is why there are the same people around whether you have a Democratic or Republican majority in the Congress.  I would like to give you my read on what the Joint Committee on Taxation is saying here with these figures.  First, there is a group of low- and middle-income taxpayers who clearly benefit under the government subsidy for health insurance. This group, however, is relatively small.  There is another, much larger group of middle-income taxpayers who are seeing their taxes go up for one or a combination of the following tax increases: the high-cost plan tax, the medical expense deduction limitation, and the Medicare payroll tax increase. In general, this group is not benefiting from the government subsidy. After all, how can taxpayers see a tax cut if they are not even eligible for a subsidy?  Also, there is an additional group of taxpayers who would be affected by other tax increase provisions in the Reid bill that the Joint Committee onTaxation could not distribute as other things in the bill are distributed on this chart. These undistributed tax increases include things such as putting a cap on the flexible savings accounts. There has never been a cap. So when you cap it at $2,500 and people cannot put in more than $2,500 under this 2074-page bill, that is a tax increase for those people who had higher expenses and wanted to put that money in a flexible savings account.  Then also there is a tax that is not accounted for here on cosmetic surgery. My friend from Idaho, Senator Crapo, whose amendment is pending before the Senate, recently received a letter from the Joint Committee on Taxation stating that this additional group exists and many in this group make less than $250,000 a year.  My friends on the other side of the aisle cannot, No. 1, say that all taxpayers receive a tax cut and, No. 2, say that middle-income Americans will not see a tax increase under the Reid bill as promised by the President in the last campaign.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
