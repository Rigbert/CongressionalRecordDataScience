When people are visiting in the United States and hostilities break out in their homeland, we have offered them a chance to stay here on a temporary basis.  I might add, there are safeguards built into this process. If there is anyone about whom we have a question as to whether or not they are safe to remain in the United States, they will not receive this temporary status.That goes without saying. We want to make certain that the people who remain here are truly those innocent travelers--students, members of families--who are concerned about whether returning home could endanger them or people who are here.  I ask the Senator from Michigan, if we are in a predicament where a family is here visiting their relatives in Chicago or Detroit and they have small children and they are from one of the parts of southern Lebanon that has been under fire, does it not stand to reason that we as a compassionate people would say to them: You can wait. Stay with your family. We are not going to force you to leave. We have done this in the past, and I hope the Senator from Michigan believes, as I do, that it is reasonable to do it under these circumstances.
