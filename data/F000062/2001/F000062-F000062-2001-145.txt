 President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma today in introducing a bill to allow the governor of a State to waive the oxygenate content requirement for reformulated or clean-burning gasoline. The bill retains all other provisions of the Clean Air Act to ensure that there is no backsliding on air quality.  We introduce this bill to address the widespread contamination of drinking water by MTBE in California and at least 41 other States.  On April 12, 1999, California Governor Gray Davis asked Carol Browner, who was the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for a waiver of the 2 percent oxygenate requirement. I have written and called former Administrator Browner and the current Administrator Christine Todd Whitman and both former President Clinton and President Bush, urging approval of the waiver. And we are still waiting. It has been two years.  Today, yet again I call on EPA and the Administration to act. In the meantime, I will push Congress to act.  MTBE, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether, has been the oxygenate of choice by many refiners in their effort to comply with the Clean Air Act's reformulated gasoline requirements. California Governor Davis has ordered a phase-out in our State, but the Federal law requiring two percent oxygenates remains, putting our State in an untenable position.  This is because the most likely substitute for MTBE to meet the two percent requirement is ethanol, but there is not a sufficient supply of ethanol to meet the demand in California and the rest of the country with the two percent law in place.  With inadequate supplies, we can expect disruptions and price spikes during the peak driving months of this summer, at a time when there are predictions that retail gasoline prices may climb to an unprecedented $3.00 per gallon or more.  The California Energy Commission reports that without relief from the two percent oxygenate mandate, California consumers will pay 3 to 6 cents more per gallon than they need to. This adds up to $450 million a year.  The Clean Air Act requires that cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline, RFG, be sold in so-called ``non-attainment'' areas with the worst violations of ozone standards: Los Angeles, San Diego, Hartford, New York Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Houston, Milwaukee, Sacramento. In addition, some States and areas have opted to use reformulated gasoline as way to achieve clean air.  Second, the Act prescribes a formula for reformulated gasoline, includingthe requirement that reformulated gasoline contain 2.0 percent oxygen, by weight.  In response to this requirement, refiners have put the oxygenate MTBE in over 85 percent of reformulated gasoline now in use. But, there is a problem: increasingly, MTBE is being detected in drinking water. MTBE is a known animal carcinogen and a possible human carcinogen, according to U.S. EPA. It has a very unpleasant odor and taste, as well.  The Feinstein-Inhofe bill would allow governors, upon notification to U.S. EPA, to waive the 2.0 percent oxygenate requirement, as long as the gasoline meets the other requirements in the law for reformulated gasoline.  On July 27th, 1999, the non-partisan, broad-based U.S. EPA Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline recommended that the two percent oxygenate requirement be ``removed in order to provide flexibility to blend adequate fuel supplies in a cost-effective manner while quickly reducing usage of MTBE and maintaining air quality benefits.''  In addition, the panel agreed that ``the use of MTBE should be reduced substantially.'' Importantly, the panel recommended that ``Congress act quickly to clarify federal and state authority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of gasoline additives that pose a threat to drinking water supplies.''  The bill we are introducing today, while not totally repealing the two percent oxygenate requirement, moves us in that direction. It gives States that choose to meet Clean Air requirements without oxygenates the option to do so. It allows States that choose an oxygenate, such as ethanol, to do so. Areas required to use reformulated gasoline for cleaner air will still be required to use it. The gasoline will have a different but clean formulation. Areas will continue to have to meet clean air standards.  MTBE has contaminated groundwater at over 10,000 sites in California, according to the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Of 10,972 sites groundwater sites sampled, 39 percent had MTBE, according to the State Department of Health Services. Of 765 surface water sources sampled, 287, 38 percent, had MTBE.  Nationally, one EPA-funded study of 34 States found that MTBE was present more than 20 percent of the time in 27 of the States. A U.S. Geological Survey report had similar findings. An October 1999 Congressional Research Service analysis concluded that at least 41 states have had MTBE detections in water.  In California, Governor Davis concluded that MTBE ``poses a significant risk to California's environment'' and directed that MTBE be phased out in California by December 31, 2002. There is not a sufficient supply of ethanol or other oxygenates to fully replace MTBE in California, without huge gasoline supply disruptions and price spikes.  In addition, California can make clean-burning gas without oxygenates. Therefore, California is in the impossible position of having to meet a federal requirement that is 1. contaminating the water and 2. is not necessary to achieve clean air.  A major University of California study concluded that MTBE provides ``no significant air quality benefit'' but that its use poses ``the potential for regional degradation of water resources, especially ground water. . . .'' Oxygenates, say the experts, are not necessary for reformulated gasoline.  California has developed a gasoline formula that provides flexibility and provides clean air. Refiners use an approach called the ``predictive model,'' which guarantees clean-burning RFG gas with oxygenates, with less than two percent oxygenates, and with no oxygenates. Several refiners, including Chevron and Tosco, are selling MTBE-free gas in California, for example.  Under this bill, clean air standards would still have to be met and gasoline would have to meet all other requirements of the federal reformulated gasoline program, including the limits on benzene, heavy metals, and the emission of nitrogen oxides.  This bill will give California and other States the relief they need from an unwarranted, unnecessary requirement. It will give state officials flexibility to determine whether to use oxygenates in their gasoline. The bill does not undo the Clean Air Act. The bill does not degrade air quality.  The two percent oxygenate requirement creates an unnecessary federal ``recipe'' for gasoline. It causes contamination of groundwater. It adds to the price of gasoline unnecessarily, and it will probably trigger disruptions in gasoline supplies this summer.  I call on this Congress to enact this legislation promptly. Californians do not need to have MTBE -laced drinking water to enjoy the benefits of cleaner air. It is that simple.  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the Sacramento Bee describing the MTBE problem in California be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sacramento Bee, Apr. 23, 2001]      Remember MTBE?--Political Inattention May Fuel Price Spikes       It was a poison brew that sent California into an      electricity swoon: rising demand, stagnant supplies and      missed political opportunities. Unfortunately, President Bush      may be about to stir up virtually the same potion with      another source of energy, gasoline. Like the electricity      crunch, this gasoline problem can be averted with timely      political action.       Under federal law, gasoline in dirty air basins must      contain an additive known as an oxygenate. These additives      produce cleaner-burning fuel. The primary additive in      California is the infamous MTBE; a byproduct of the refinery      process. It can cause drinking water to smell like turpentine      at minute concentrations, so the state plans to phase out      MTBE by the end of 2002.       Refiners say that can produce clean-burning gasoline      without an oxygenate but farm politics has kept the      requirement in law. For now, the only alternative to MTBE is      ethanol, which is made from corn and other grains.       That threatens California with the kind of imbalance      between supply and demand that could push up gasoline prices.       Switching from MTBE to ethanol as the additive of choice in      California would increase the nation's consumption of ethanol      by perhaps 800 million gallons a year. This represents about      a 50 percent jump in demand. California produces only 9      million gallons of ethanol a year. That means that the folks      who produce ethanol, who are concentrated in Iowa, may be      able to extort California with the same vigor as Texas-based      electricity marketers.       The seeds of this crisis were planted in some revisions of      the federal Clean Air Act, which combined the laudable goal      of cleaning up the skies with some unwise restrictions on the      legal recipes for fuel. Gov. Gray Davis has been asking for      federal government to waive this mandated recipe for the      fuel, letting the state meet its air-quality goals in a less      expensive way.       Yet with its seven precious electoral votes at stake, Iowa      made ethanol a litmus test for any and all presidential      candidates, and candidates Bush, like most others, said he      would stick to the recipe for gas that favors ethanol.       Is this now the policy of President Bush as well? Bush must      say something, and soon.       Ideally, he should use his administrative powers to waive      the oxygenate mandate and let various fuel recipes compete on      their costs and air-quality benefits. But he must say      something. His silence is preventing companies from building      ethanol (which could be produced from corn kernels or rise      straw) plants in California, if that is what must be done to      replace MTBE.       California can't afford the uncertainty on gasoline any      more than it can afford uncertainty about whether power      plants can be built. For a president who preaches the gospel      of sending clear signals to markets, Bush's silence on MTBE      and ethanol is an expensive sin.                                 ______                                       By
