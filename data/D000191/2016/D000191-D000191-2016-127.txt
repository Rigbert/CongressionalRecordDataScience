Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We are ultimately here because of a failure by the United States Congress to act. The last time Congress revisited the Clean Water Act was in 1987. There are very few Members here today who were elected at that time.  The reason we have the Clean Water Act is that--I remember a time when I was young when the Cuyahoga River caught fire because of industrial waste and when the Willamette River in my State was an open sewer because it was a convenient place to dump your municipal human waste.  It was a disaster for our country, and we decided to deal with that problem under Republican leadership, which we did quite successfully. But now we realize it is a little more complicated than just keeping out the point source pollution from industrial waste and/or municipal waste.  There are other threats to our clean water, one of the most precious things we have. Read the CIA documents or the planning by the Pentagon. Wars will be fought over water. We can't sully this precious resource, and I think there is pretty substantial agreement on that. The question is: What, where, and how do we protect the waters of the United States?  This is incredibly confusing. We have a split Supreme Court, with contradictory decisions out of the Supreme Court, and we are now, today, living under Bush-era guidance regarding the Clean Water Act.  That unfortunately is described by people from the extremes of the debate--from the American Farm Bureau Federation to the Natural Resources Defense Council--as totally unworkable, inconsistent, incomprehensible, and it provides no certainty to farmers or to conservationists or to developers or to anybody else. That is what we are living under. We are living under those rules today.  Here is a quote from the American Farm Bureau:       A hodgepodge of ad hoc and inconsistent jurisdictional      theories, which, ultimately, will result--and is resulting--     in increased delays and costs to the public at large.  That is what we are living under because this new rule, which the House today will act to overturn, is not in effect. What is in effect today is Bush-era guidance.  If this legislation were to pass and become law, which it won't because the Senate has already failed to muster a veto-proof majority over there on this issue--so this is all kind of a show--the provisions of this resolution or disapproval are so broad that all of the work that went into constructing this new rule could not be replicated in any manner.  Essentially, we would be stuck forever unless we change the law, and Congress hasn't acted on the Clean Water Act for 30 years. Unless we change the law, we would be stuck forever with an ad hoc, inconsistent hodgepodge of jurisdictional theories, which are resulting in increased delays and costs to the public at large. That is the ultimate result, were this to pass and become law.  Now, I will admit that the administration caused a good deal of the problem here today. The rule, as initially promulgated by the EPA, was, I would say, turgid at best, and it caused incredible confusion. It seemed to have jurisdictional theories, et cetera, et cetera, very much like the Bush rule.  There was an uproar from Members of Congress, farmers, developers, and conservationists. Everybody had concerns about their initial rule. So what did they do? They went out and they listened. They had a massive number of comments to which they meaningfully responded, and then they found a few areas where they did make major improvements.  Do I think it is a perfect rule? No. But the courts will decide where it is adequate or inadequate, and then that would give direction to a future Congress to actually act and do its job on the Clean Water Act. That would be desirable.  It does deal with roadside ditches. There are huge concerns about roadside ditches. A good change. It has the explicit exemption of municipal separate storm sewers from the Clean Water Act. Again, that was the confusing part of their first rule.  It permanently exempts groundwater and water-filled depressions related to fill or gravel mining activities. There is a huge concern with gravel extraction activities in my State.  Also, a litany of erosional features, artificial ponds, and artificially irrigated areas were exempted from the Clean Water Act, which very explicitly and clearly benefit farmers and developers.                              {time}  0930  In fact, this subject came up at our joint hearing on this issue. Senator Inhofe brought this up. This was subjected to the Clean Water Act regulatory process. They wanted to turn this into a warehouse facility to develop the land. It is very marginal at best as farmland.  Army Assistant Secretary Darcy confirmed, upon a question from me, that, in fact, under her new rule and guidance, this property would be exempt; but under the Bush rule, it isn't. So they can't develop it under the Bush rule, but they could develop it under the new rule, which we seek today to overturn.  So this new rule is an improvement. Is it perfect, no. In fact, I think the courts might find it wanting in a number of ways, which would require further action by Congress. To merely say we reject it, we want to live under the Bush rule--which everybody hates and says doesn't work--forever doesn't make a lot of sense. Also, acting here today, when the Senate has already made it clear that they don't have a veto-proof majority, shows that we are wasting time.  I reserve the balance of my time.
