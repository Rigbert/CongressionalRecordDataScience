 President, as a member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I rise today to speak in support of the Agriculture appropriations conference report.  I would particularly like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee, Senators Bennett and Kohl, for including $7 million in the bill for specialty crop funding.  Americans tend to forget that California is the largest agricultural producing State in the Nation. Of the top 10 agricultural producing counties nationwide, 8 are located in California. We export more crops than any other State, and I am proud to say that 97 percent of our farms are family owned.  As a result, I supported the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act, legislation to boost the marketing of highly nutritious fruits, vegetables and other specialty crops to American consumers and international markets.
