President, we have had three experiences in this century of increasing revenues: One was in the 1920's, one in the 1960's, and then in the 1980's. All three times it was a result, economists had to agree, of the fact that we reduced taxes and gave people more freedom. As a matter of fact, it was not a Republican but it was a Democrat, it was President Kennedy back in the 1960's, who observed that we have to increase revenues and the best way to do that is to reduce taxes. Of course, history showed that it did work. It worked again in the 1980's when we went from a total expenditure to run Government in 1980 of $517 billion to $1.03 trillion in 1990, a 10-year period in which we had the most dramatic decreases in taxes.  So I would certainly agree with the man who I believe will be the next President of the United States that the best way to get this country back on the right track is to reduce regulation, reduce taxes, and give people more individual freedoms.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
