President, I am happy to join Senator Jeffords as a cosponsor of his amendment to restore funding to the solar and renewable budget of the Department of Energy fiscal year 1996 spending bill.  Our amendment restores $25 million to this vital account, boosting funding for solar, wind, and biomass energy research. Renewable energy has the potential to reduce pollution, decrease our dependence on imported fuels, and produce good paying jobs here in the United States.  The United States has the opportunity to lead the world in clean, renewable energy technology. Vermont in particular has taken the lead with the development of wind and biomass energy technology. This ``green technology'' has the potential to generate more than virtually pollution free energy, it generates good paying manufacturing jobs in Vermont and throughout the country.  The energy and water appropriations bill passed by the House mortgages the future of our energy program by dramatically reduced funding for the solar and renewable energy budget, cutting it by 22 percent. I think that is a shortsighted approach.
