  The amendment before us is very simple. It merely asks us to go on record as to whether or not we Members of the Senate believe we should support efforts to decrease class size in the early grades.  As a parent of a child in public education, two children who have gone through our public schools, as a former school board member, as a member of the PTA, as a former educator myself who has been in the classroom, who knows the difference between having 18 young 4-year-olds or 24 4-year-olds, who knows the difference between teaching and crowd control, I will tell the Members of this Senate that decreasing class size is one of the most important things we can do to increase the education for our young children. Every Member here has talked about the need for increased math skills, the need for our young children to be able to read and write and have the skills they need. If we decrease class size, every parent in this country will tell you that it will make a difference. Studies show it. Parents know it. Teachers know it. It is time for this Senate to recognize that and move, on our part, with our responsibility, to decrease class size. I urge the adoption of this amendment.
