 President, over the weekend the world learned the sad news of the passing of Muhammad Ali. Ali was one of the preeminent athletes of the 20th century. His story was an American story. It is one that touched people in every corner of the world. It is one that began in my hometown of Louisville. Louisville is where he grew up. Louisville is where he fought his first professional fight. Louisville is where the Muhammad Ali Center stands today. It is a memorial to his legacy and to his life story. It is where mourners now lay flowers in his memory.  As people around the world honor ``The Greatest,'' the spotlight shines bright upon his hometown. I wish to again add my condolences as well. I wish to again recognize a legend from Louisville who was more than just a boxer, he was an icon known for grace on his feet and power in his fists inside the ring and a great exuberance for life outside it.  Mr. President, after needless and inexplicable delay by colleagues across the aisle, we have begun consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act today and will work to pass it this week.  The NDAA authorizes funds aimed at meeting the combat-readiness needs of our armed services, maintaining our national security posture, and supporting defense health care and benefits for servicemembers and their families. It is an important measure we consider each year. It is especially critical today given the myriad of threats facing our country.  The next Commander in Chief, regardless of party, will take office facing a number of security challenges--everything from instability in Libya, Syria, and Yemen, to a belligerent North Korea, to a newly aggressive Russia. It is imperative to do what we can now to better position our country to confront challenges currently facing us and to better prepare for those yet to come.  Ensuring military readiness and keeping Americans safe should be a top priority for all of us, so I would encourage my colleagues to put aside partisan politics and work together to bring this NDAA across the finish line this week. We may pass the bill on Friday, we may pass it sooner, but we will pass it this week. So let's all work hard to do so.                          ____________________
