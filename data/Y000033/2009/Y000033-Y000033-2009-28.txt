Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 1593 will designate segments of the Illabot Creek in Skagit County, Washington, as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The area being designated is located within the Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The total designated is 14.3 miles in two separate segments.  Although I personally do not believe a wild and scenic designation is necessarily the best way to manage our river resources in every instance, I understand that this bill excludes a section of the river crossed by a needed road and now has local support. I do not object at this time to the passage of this legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.
