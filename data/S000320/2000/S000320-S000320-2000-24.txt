 President, I rise today to join some of my fellow Senators in remembering the extraordinary life and service of our friend and colleague, Paul Coverdell.  It is a somber day in the Senate Chamber, as we deal with this loss. Paul Coverdell served the people of Georgia with distinction for over 30 years. His passing leaves a significant mark on the many lives he has touched over his lifetime. On behalf of myself and my wife Annette, I offer my condolences to Paul's wife Nancy and his family.  Anyone who dealt with Paul Coverdell over the years came to respect him. He was honest, loyal, and dedicated to public service. It was these characteristics that Paul brought to the table every day in his life. Paul's vision as a legislator and commitment to the principles and values for which he truly believed were demonstrated time after time in this Chamber. His commitment to improving education in the U.S. sets a high standard for all public officials. His hard work in the Republican leadership and his vision of a prosperous future for all Americans deserves tremendous praise.  Personally, it was truly my privilege to know and work with Paul over the years. We sat next to each other recently in the Senate, as can be seen.  He will be remembered as a dedicated American who gave much of his life in service to his Nation. I offer my thoughts and prayers to those close to Paul in this difficult time, especially to his family.
