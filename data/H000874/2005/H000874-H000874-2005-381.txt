Speaker, I thank the leader for that response. I understand the problem of pinning down now exact times. Would it be fair, however, Mr. Leader, to say that it would not be considered on the last day we are here, on Friday, or not, so that we could make sure that Members knew and had some degree of confidence, because it is such an important piece of legislation, that it would not be considered on the last day we are here?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  I cannot say that. I really do not have any idea. I know it will be after Tuesday, and that is about the best I can give the gentleman.
