Speaker, due to flight delays, I was unable to vote on H.R. 4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act. I would have voted against this legislation. Changing the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review process timeline from every ten years to every seven will drive up the deficit, and gives financial regulators little time to implement recommendations. I was especially appalled withthe Rules Committee's adoption of an amendment to allow Congress to raid the Federal Reserve to pay for this legislation.  I also disagreed with the provision that includes the CFPB in the EGRPRA review. This is unnecessary and duplicative, as the CFPB is already subject to a review of its rules every five years.  Most importantly, I have serious concerns with shifting the mandate that regulators identify ``outdated and unnecessary'' regulations to a mandate that regulators limit regulatory burdens. Directing regulators to prioritize limiting ``cost, liability risk, and other burdens,'' would further reduce regulations for large banks, payday lenders, and thousands of other financial services companies without consideration for how these rules safeguard consumers.                          ____________________
