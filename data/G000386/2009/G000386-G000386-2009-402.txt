 President, I wish to emphasize that I do not disagree with what he said, he said it accurately, but here is the point I am trying to make. In just a few months, we are going to be working on health care reform and we are going to be working, within those few months, on how the Children's Health Insurance Program fits in with it. We are going to be going through this exercise once again, so we wasted a lot of time here for nothing.  I yield the floor.
