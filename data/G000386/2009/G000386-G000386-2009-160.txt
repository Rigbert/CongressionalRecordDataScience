 I want to be a little more specific about how the health care reform bill is going to very dramatically increase taxes--particularly for groups of people with under $250,000 a year in income, which group President Obama has promised would never have their taxes increased.  On September 12, 2008, in Dover, NH, candidate Obama said:       And I can make a firm pledge: No family making less than      $250,000 will see their taxes increase--not your income      taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes,      not any of your taxes.  You can see on the chart that quotation. It is very firm, very clear. Well, I believe we are at the point of abrogating that promise.  President Obama's pledge has also been repeated by the President and his advisers numerous times since candidate Obama has been in office. However, the health care reform bill reported out of the Senate Finance Committee is loaded with tax hikes on ``the middle class.''  President Obama, however, has defined the middle class as those making under $250,000. Candidate Obama stated that ``if you are making less than $250,000, then you are definitely somewhere in the middle class.''  President Obama's budget tracks this definition by preserving the current income tax rate structure for families under $250,000 and singles under $200,000. And the Democratic leadershipbudgets adopted President Obama's definition of the middle class.  President Obama and congressional Democrats have adopted this definition of the middle class in the context of health care reform.  As evidence, on August 3, 2009, President Obama's press secretary Robert Gibbs said:       Let me be precise.
