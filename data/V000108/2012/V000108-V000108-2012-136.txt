Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I stand before you today to honor Nick Kavadas, who has been recognized by the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, AHEPA, as Chapter, District, and National Ahepan of the Year. AHEPA honored Nick at a celebratory reception that took place on Saturday, November 10, 2012, at Dynasty Banquets in Hammond, Indiana. Also honored at the event were Pete Kavadas, for his heroic efforts at a recent AHEPA conference, and Joseph Skora, who received the Prometheus Award in recognition of his many years of service to AHEPA.  The Order of AHEPA was founded on July 26, 1922, in Atlanta, Georgia, joining the NAACP and B'nai B'rith in the effort to end racism, bigotry, and discrimination against all immigrants. AHEPA was founded on the principles of ancient Greece, to promote civic responsibility, education, philanthropy, family, and individual excellence through volunteerism and community service.  On November 10, AHEPA honored Nick Kavadas, AHEPA Supreme Governor of Region 6 representing districts 12, 13, and 14 of the Supreme Lodge, who has been an outstanding leader, and who has worked tirelessly to develop AHEPA in presence and membership throughout the state of Indiana. Under Supreme Governor Kavada's direction, AHEPA membership has grown to its highest level this year with over 450 members in the state of Indiana. Brother Nick has spearheaded many of AHEPA's charitable endeavors supporting worthy causes including the Saint Baldrick's Foundation, which does exceptional work for children's cancer research, the National Hellenic Foundation, the National Hellenic Museum, Greek relief efforts, and the District #12 Scholarship Foundation, among many other charitable endeavors. Over the years, Nick has held numerous positions including serving on the Gary/Merrillville Chapter #78 Board of Governors, as Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Hoosier District #12, and as Chairman of the Standing Governor's Committee. Nick Kavadas has been able to touch the lives of countless individuals through his work with AHEPA, and for his passionate, selfless life of public service, he is worthy of the highest praise. I am pleased that AHEPA has recognized these admirable contributions with such a prestigious award.  Nick's brother, Pete Kavadas, was also honored at this event for his heroic efforts in a critical situation. While attending an AHEPA conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Pete came across a young man who was contemplating suicide by jumping off of the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge. Pete, along with the help of his brother, persuaded the young man to cease his efforts and obtain the help he needed. For his courageous efforts, Pete is an inspiration, and we are grateful for his incredible bravery in this dire situation.  Joseph Skora was honored at the event with the Prometheus Award in recognition of his many years of service to the organization. Joseph has been one of the most involved members in the Gary/Merrillville Chapter #78 as well as Hoosier District #12. Brother Joe has worked extensively with AHEPA housing and serves as a board member for AHEPA Chapter #78's Housing Board. Brother Joe also served as the Assistant Project Manager for part of the construction of the six apartment phases in Merrillville, Indiana, which provide housing for senior citizens. He has also been the manager of repairs and improvement projects for the AHEPA apartments. For his many years of service and noteworthy dedication to AHEPA, Joseph is to be commended.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating AHEPA, Brother Nick Kavadas as he is recognized as Ahepan of the Year, Brother Pete Kavadas for his heroic efforts, and Brother Joseph Skora as he is honored with the Prometheus Award. For their remarkable leadership, commitment, and enthusiasm shown through their service to so many in need throughout Northwest Indiana and across the nation, they are worthy of the honors bestowed upon them, and I am proud to represent them in Congress.                          ____________________
