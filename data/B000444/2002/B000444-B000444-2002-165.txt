 President, I rise to comment on the vote in relation to amendment number 3198, which was offered by my friend and colleague from the State of Delaware, Senator Carper. The vote by the Senate is on a motion to table the amendment. I believe that Senator Carper should be given a straight up-or-down vote on his amendment, and for that reason, I shall vote against the motion to table.
