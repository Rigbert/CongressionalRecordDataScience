Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 423) recognizing the 5th anniversary of the signing of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 and urging a renewed commitment to eliminating violations of the internationally recognized right to freedom of religion and protecting fundamental human rights, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 423       Whereas the people of the United States enjoy and respect      the freedom of religion and believe that the fundamental      rights of all individuals shall be recognized;       Whereas fundamental human rights, including the right to      freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, are protected      in numerous international agreements and declarations;       Whereas religious freedom is a fundamental human right and      all people are entitled to believe, practice, and worship      according to their conscience;       Whereas the right to freedom of religion is expressed in      the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of      Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief,      adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly      Resolution 36/55 of November 22, 1981; the Helsinki Accords;      the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,      done at New York on December 16, 1966, and entered into force      March 23, 1976; the United Nations Charter; and the Universal      Declaration of Human Rights, adopted and proclaimed by the      United Nations General Assembly Resolution 217(A)(III) of      December 10, 1984;       Whereas the freedom for all individuals to adopt, believe,      worship, observe, teach, and practice a religion individually      or collectively has been explicitly articulated in Article 18      of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article      18(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political      Rights;       Whereas religious persecution is not confined to a country,      a region, or a regime; but whereas all governments should      provide and protect religious liberty;       Whereas much of the world's population is continually      denied or restricted in the right to believe or practice      their faith;       Whereas religious persecution often includes confinement,      separation, humiliation, rape, enslavement, forced      conversion, imprisonment, torture, and death;       Whereas October 27, 2003, marks the 5th anniversary of the      signing of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998      (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.), creating the Office of      International Religious Freedom in the Department of State      and the United States Commission on International Religious      Freedom and resulting in a greater awareness of religious      persecution both in the United States and abroad; and       Whereas the United States recognizes the need for      additional domestic and international attention and action to      promote religious liberty: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes the 5th anniversary of the signing of the      International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401      et seq.); and       (2) urges a renewed commitment to eliminating violations of      the internationally recognized right to freedom of religion      and protecting fundamental human rights.
