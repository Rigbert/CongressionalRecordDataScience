Speaker, I want to make two points, in response, frankly, to the majority whip.  First of all, it was not the Democrats, it was all of us. Let me read from the report of our committee, the majority report, which I supported, which said ``With those additional responsibilities in mind,'' that is the things that are in the bill, ``the allocation is short by approximately $1.3 billion.''  So I tell my friend, the majority whip, that he says it in the report that this is needed. But 7 days ago the gentleman would not do it. Why would he not do it 7 days ago? So he could say to the American public what he has just said now; we are trying to constrain spending: Yes, we think $1.3 billion is necessary; and, guess what, 7 days later we will put it in. But the press release that went out on Friday said no, we are going to have fiscal constraint. For 6 days. For 6 days.  Secondly, I would say to my friend there is no need for this, whatever is happening in the other body. We could have considered the legislative bill on its merits in order, and we could consider the Treasury, Postal bill on its merits in order.                         Parliamentary Inquiry
