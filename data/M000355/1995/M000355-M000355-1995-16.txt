 President, on Monday I will be offering an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the underlying proposed constitutional amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that this amendment appear in the Record at this point. It will be cosponsored by Senator Bennett of Utah, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Bumpers.  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           proposed amendment       Strike all after the enacting clause and inserting the      following:     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Flag Protection and Free      Speech Act of 1995''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--       (1) the flag of the United States is a unique symbol of      national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice,      and equality that make this Nation an example of freedom      unmatched throughout the world;       (2) the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and      should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted      to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to      by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by      free and democratic nations;       (3) abuse of the flag of the United States causes more than      pain and distress to the overwhelming majority of the      American people and may amount to fighting words or a direct      threat to the physical and emotional well-being of      individuals at whom the threat is targeted; and       (4) destruction of the flag of the United States can be      intended to incite a violent response rather than make a      political statement and such conduct is outside the      protections afforded by the first amendment to the United      States Constitution.       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide the      maximum protection against the use of the flag of the United      States to promote violence while respecting the liberties      that it symbolizes.     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST                    USE FOR PROMOTING VIOLENCE.       (a) In General.--Section 700 of title 18, United States      Code, is amended to read as follows:     ``Sec. 700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property        involving the flag of the United States       ``(a) Actions Promoting Violence.--Any person who destroys      or damages a flag of the United States with the primary      purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or      a breach of the peace, and in circumstances where the person      knows it is reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or      a breach of the peace, shall be fined not more than $100,000      or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.       ``(b) Damaging a Flag Belonging to the United States.--Any      person who steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or      to the use of another, a flag of the United States belonging      to the United States and intentionally destroys or damages      that flag shall be fined not more than $250,000 or imprisoned      not more than 2 years, or both.       ``(c) Damaging a Flag of Another on Federal Land.--Any      person who, within any lands reserved for the use of the      United States, or under the exclusive or concurrent      jurisdiction of the United States, steals or knowingly      converts to his or her use, or to the use of another, a flag      of the United States belonging to another person, and      intentionally destroys or damages that flag shall be fined      not more than $250,000 or imprisoned not more than 2 years,      or both.       ``(d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be      construed to indicate an intent on the part of Congress to      deprive any State, territory or possession of the United      States, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of jurisdiction      over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the      absence of this section.       ``(e) Definition.--As used in this section, the term `flag      of the United States' means any flag of the United States, or      any part thereof, made of any substance, in any size, in a      form that is commonly displayed as a flag and would be taken      to be a flag by the reasonable observer.''.       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter      33 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by striking      the item relating to section 700 and inserting the following      new item:``700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property involving the flag               of the United States.''.       Amend the title so as to read: ``A joint resolution to      provide for the protection of the flag of the United States      and free speech, and for other purposes.''.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, every single Senator believes in the sanctity of the American flag. It is our most precious national symbol. The flag represents the ideas, values and traditions that unify us as a people and as a nation. Brave men and women have fought and given their lives and are now entering a war-torn region in defense of the freedom and way of life that our flag represents.  For all these reasons, those who desecrate the flag deserve our contempt. After all, when they defile the flag, they dishonor America. But the issue before this body is: How do we appropriately deal with the misfits who burn the flag?  Many of my colleagues who support a constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning say the only way to ensure flag-burners get the punishment they deserve is to amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in over 200 years. The first amendment, which they propose to alter, contains our most fundamental rights: free speech, religion, assembly, and the right to petition the Government. The freedoms set forth in the first amendment, arguably, were the foundation on which this great Republic was established.  Amending the Constitution was made an arduous process by the Founding Fathers for good reason. The requirements--approval by two-thirds of each House of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the State legislatures--ensure that highly emotional issues of the day will not tear at the fabric of the Constitution. Since the addition of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution has been amended on only 17 occasions.  Let me repeat, Mr. President, after the initial 10 amendments known as the Bill of Rights, we have altered the Constitution only 17 times in the history of our country.  And only one of those amendments--prohibition--actually constricted freedom, and it was soon repealed. The 22d amendment also restricts freedom by limiting the President to two terms, but we will have the term limits debate another day.  The proposed constitutional amendment before us does just that--it rips the fabric of the Constitution at its very center: the first amendment.  Our respect and reverence for the flag should not provoke us to cause damage to the Constitution, even in the name of patriotism.  Mr. President, I seek no protection, no safe harbor, no refuge for those who heap scorn on our Nation by desecrating the flag.  The only thing that those who provocatively burn the flag deserve is swift and certain punishment.  Therefore, the statutory amendment I have proposed would ensure that acts of deliberately confrontational flag-burnings are punished with stiff fines and even jail time.  My amendment will prevent desecration of the flag and at the same time, protect the Constitution.  Those malcontents who desecrate the flag do so to grab attention for themselves and to inflame the passions of patriotic Americans. And, speech that incites lawlessness or is intended to do so, the Supreme Court has made abundantly clear, merits no first amendment protection. From Chaplinsky's ``fighting words'' doctrine in 1942 to Brandenburg's ``incitement'' test in 1969 to Wisconsin versus Mitchell's ``physical assault'' standard in 1993, the Supreme Court has never protected speech which causes or intends to cause physical harm to others.  And, that, Mr. President, is the basis for this amendment, that I am discussing. My amendment outlaws three types of illegal flag desecration. First, anyone who destroys or damages a U.S. flag with a clear intent to incite imminent violence or a breach of the peace may be punished by a fine of up to $100,000, or up to 1 year in jail, or both.  Second, anyone who steals a flag that belongs to the United States and destroys or damages that flag may be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years, or both.  And third, anyone who steals a flag from U.S. property and destroys or damages that flag may also be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years, or both.  Some of my colleagues will argue that we've been down the statutory road before and the Supreme Court has rejected it.  However, the Senate's previous statutory effort wasn't pegged to the well-established Supreme Court precedents in this area.  This amendment differs from the statutes reviewed by the Supreme Court in the two leading cases: Texas versus Johnson (1989) and U.S. versus Eichman (1990).  In Johnson, the defendant violated a Texas law banning the desecration of a venerated object, including the flag, in a way that will offend--offend, Mr. President--one or more persons. Johnson took a stolen flag and burned it as part of a political protest staged outside the 1984 Republican Convention in Dallas. The State of Texas argued that its interest in enforcing the law centered on preventing breaches of the peace.  But the Government, according to the Supreme Court, may not--may not--``assume every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot * * *.'' Johnson, according to the Court, was prosecuted for the expression of his particular ideas: dissatisfaction with Government policies. And it is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment, said the Court, that an individual cannot be punished for expressing an idea that offends. I repeat, the Court said you cannot be punished for engaging in offensive speech.  The Johnson decision started a national debate on flag-burning and as a result, Congress, in 1989, enacted the Flag Protection Act. In seeking to safeguard the flag as the symbol of our Nation, Congress took a different tack from the Texas Legislature. The Federal statute simply outlawed the mutilation or other desecration of the flag.  But in Eichman, the Supreme Court found congressional intent to protect the national symbol insufficient--insufficient--to overcome the first amendment protection for expressive conduct exhibited by flag-burning.  The Court, however, clearly left the door open for outlawing flag-burning that incites lawlessness. The Court said: ``the mere destruction or disfigurement of a particular physical manifestation of the symbol, without more, does not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself in any way.''  But, Mr. President, you do not have to take my word on it. The Congressional Research Service has offered legal opinions to Senators Bennett and Conrad concluding that this initiative will withstand constitutional scrutiny:  ``The judicial precedents establish that the [amendment]''--referring to the amendment I have just been discussing--``if enacted, while not reversing Johnson and Eichman, should survive constitutional attack on first amendment grounds.''  In addition, Bruce Fein, a former official in the Reagan administration and respected constitutional scholar concurs:  ``In holding flag desecration statutes unconstitutional in Johnson, the Court cast no doubt on the continuing vitality of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky as applied to expression through use or abuse of the flag. [The amendment] ``--referring to my amendment--falls well within the protective constitutional umbrella of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky * * * [and it] also avoids content-based discrimination which is generally frowned on by the First Amendment.''  Mr. President, several other constitutional specialists also agree that this initiative will withstand constitutional challenge. A memo by Robert Peck, and Prof. Robert O'Neil and Erwin Chemerinsky concludes that the amendment ``conforms to constitutional requirements in both its purpose and its provisions.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the CRS memos, the Bruce Fein letter, and the legal memo from Robert Peck, Professors O'Neil and Chemerinsky, and Johnny Killian be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Great Falls, VA, October 21, 1995.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: This letter responds for your request for an      appraisal of the constitutionality of the proposed ``Flag      Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995.'' I believe it easily      passes constitutional muster with flying banners or guidons.       The only non-frivolous constitutional question is raised by      section 3(a). It criminalizes the destruction or damaging of      the flag of the United States with the intent to provoke      imminent violence or a breach of the peace in circumstances      where the provocation is reasonably likely to succeed. In      Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court upheld      the constitutionality of laws that prohibit expression      calculated and likely to cause a breach of the peace. Writing      for a unanimous Court, Justice Frank Murphy explained that      such ``fighting'' words ``are no essential part of any      exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a      step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them      is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and      morality.''       In Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the Court concluded that the      First Amendment is no bar to the punishment of expression      ``directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action      and is likely to incite or produce such action.''       In holding flag desecration statutes unconstitutional in      Texas v. Johnson (1989), the Court cast no doubt on the      continuing vitality of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky as applied      to expression through use or abuse of the flag. See 491 U.S.      at 409-410.       Section 3(a) falls well within the protective      constitutional umbrella of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky. It      prohibits only expressive uses of the flag that constitute      ``fighting'' words or are otherwise intended to provoke      imminent violence and in circumstances where the provocation      is reasonably likely to occasion lawlessness. The section is      also sufficiently specific in defining ``flag of the United      States'' to avoid the vice of vagueness. The phrase is      defined to include any flag in any size and in a form      commonly displayed as a flag that would be perceived by a      reasonable observer to be a flag of the United States. The      definition is intended to prevent circumvention by      destruction or damage to virtual flag representations that      could be as provocative to an audience as mutilating the      genuine article. Any potential chilling effect on free speech      caused by inherent definitional vagueness, moreover, is      nonexistent because the only type of expression punished by      section 3(a) is that intended      by the speaker to provoke imminent lawlessness, not a thoughtful      response. The First Amendment was not intended to protect      appeals to imminent criminality.       Section 3(a) also avoided content-based discrimination      which is generally frowned on by the First Amendment. It does      not punish based on a particular ideology or viewpoint of the      speaker. Rather, it punishes based on calculated provocations      of imminent violence through the destruction or damage of the      flag of the United States that are reasonably likely to      succeed irrespective of the content of the speaker's      expression. Such expressive neutrality is not      unconstitutional discrimination because the prohibition is      intended to safeguard the social interest in order, not to      suppress a particular idea. See F.C.C. v. Pacifica      Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 744-746 (1978).       I would welcome the opportunity to amplify on the      constitutionality of section 3(a) as your bill progresses      through the legislative process.           Very truly yours,                                                       Bruce Fein,                                                  Attorney at Law.                              [Memorandum]     To: Interested parties.     From: Robert S. Peck, Esq.; Robert M. O'Neil, professor,          University of Virginia Law School; Erwin Chemerinsky,          Legion Lex Professor of Law, University of Southern          California.     Re S. 1335, the Flag Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995.     Date: November 7, 1995.       This memorandum will analyze the constitutional      implications of S. 1335, the Flag Protection and Free Speech      Act of 1995. As its name implies and the legislation states      as its purpose, S. 1335 seeks ``to provide the maximum      protection against the use of the flag of the United States      to promote violence while respecting the liberties that it      symbolizes.'' S. 1335, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. Sec. 2(b)      (1995). This memorandum concludes that the bill conforms to      constitutional requirements in both its purpose and its      provisions.       It would be a mistake to conclude that S. 1335 is      unconstitutional simply because the U.S. Supreme Court      invalidated the Flag Protection Act of 1990 in its decision      in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990). In this      decision, as well as its earlier flag-desecration opinion,      the Court specifically left open a number of options for      flag-related laws, including the approach undertaken by S.      1335. The Court reiterated its stand in its 1992 cross-     burning case, indicating that flag burning could be      punishable under circumstances where dishonoring the flag did      not comprise the gist of the crime (R.A.V. v. City of St.      Paul, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2544 (1992)).       Unlike the 1990 flag law that the Court negated, S. 1335 is      not aimed at suppressing non-violent political protest; in      fact, it fully acknowledges that constitutionally protected      right. In contrast, the Flag Protection Act, the Court said,      unconstitutionally attempted to reserve the use of the flag      as a symbol for governmentally approved expressive purposes.      S. 1335 makes no similar attempt to prohibit the use of the      flag to express certain points of view. Instead, it both      advances a legitimate anti-violent purpose while remaining      solicitous of our tradition of ``uninhibited, robust, and      wide-open'' public debate (New York Times v. Sullivan, 376      U.S. 254, 270 (1964)).       Moreover, the statute is sensitive to, and complies with      several other constitutional considerations, namely: (1) it      does not discriminate between expression on the basis of its      content or viewpoint, since it avoids the kind of      discrimination condemned by the Court in R.A.V.;  (2) it does      not provide opponents of controversial political ideas with      an excuse to use their own propensity for violence as a means      of exercising a veto over otherwise protected speech, since      it requires that the defendant have a specific intent to      instigate a violent response; and (3) it does not usurp      authority vested in the states, since it does not intrude      upon police powers traditionally exercised by the states.      Each of these points will be discussed in greater detail      below.       One additional point is worth noting. Passing a statute is      far preferable to enacting a constitutional amendment that      would mark the first time in its more than two centuries as a      beacon of freedom that the United States amended the Bill of      Rights. Totalitarian regimes fear freedom and enact broad      authorizations to pick and choose the freedoms they allow.      The broadly worded proposed constitutional amendment follows      that blueprint by giving plenary authority to the federal and      state governments to pick and choose which exercises of      freedom will be tolerated. On the contrary, American      democracy has never feared freedom, and no crisis exists that      should cause us to reconsider this path. Because the Court      has never said that Congress lacks the constitutional power      to enact a statute to prevent the flag from becoming a tool      of violence, a statute--rather than a constitutional      amendment--is an incomparably better choice.i. s. 1335 punishes violence or incitement to violence, not expressive                                 conduct       The fatal common flaw in the flag-desecration prosecution      of Gregory Lee Johnson, whose Supreme Court case started the      controversy that has led to the proposed constitutional      amendment, and the subsequent enactment by Congress of the      Flag Protection Act of 1989 was the focus on punishing      contemptuous views concerning the American flag (Eichman, 496      U.S. at 317-19; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 405-07      (1989)). In both instances, law was employed in an attempt to      reserve use of the flag for governmentally approved      viewpoints (i.e., patriotic purposes). The Court held such a      reservation violated bedrock First Amendment principles in      that the government has no power to ``ensure that a symbol be      used to express only one view of that symbol or its      referents.'' (Id. at 417.)       Johnson had been charged with desecrating a venerated      object, rather than any of a number of other criminal charges      that he could have been prosecuted for and that would not      have raised any constitutional issues. Critical to the      Supreme Court's decision in his case, as well as to the      Texas courts that also held the conviction      unconstitutional, was the fact that ``[n]o one was      physically injured or threatened with injury.'' 491 U.S.      at 399. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals noted that      ``there was no breach of the peace nor does the record      reflect that the situation was potentially explosive.''      Id. at 401 (quoting 755 S.W.2d 92, 96 (1988)). Thus, the      primary concern addressed by S. 1335, incitement to      violence, was not at issue in the Johnson case. The      Eichman Court found the congressional statute to be      indistinguishable in its intent and purpose from the      prosecution reviewed in Johnson and thus also      unconstitutional.       In reaching its conclusion about the issue of      constitutionality, the Court, however, specifically declared      that ``[W]e do not suggest that the First Amendment forbids a      State to prevent `imminent lawless action.' '' Id. at 410      (quoting Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969)). In      Brandenburg, the Court said that government may not ``forbid      or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation      except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or      producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or      produce such action.'' 395 U.S. at 447. It went on to state      that ``[a] statute which fails to draw this distinction      impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the      First and Fourteenth Amendments. It sweeps within its      condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from      government control.'' Id. at 448.       S. 1335 merely takes up the Court's invitation to focus a      proper law on ``imminent lawless action.'' It specifically      punishes ``[a]ny person who destroys or damages a flag of the      United States with the primary purpose and intent to incite      or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace, and in      circumstances where the person knows it is reasonably likely      to produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace.'' S.      1335, at Sec. 3(a). The language precisely mirrors the      Court's Brandenburg criteria. It does not implicate the      Constitution's free-speech protections, because ``[t]he First      Amendment does not protect violence.'' NAACP v. Claiborne      Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 916 (1982).       More recently, the Court put it this way: ``a physical      assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive      conduct protected by the First Amendment.'' Wisconsin v.      Mitchell, 113 S.Ct. 2194, 2199 (1993). Under the Court's      criteria, for example, a symbolic protest that consists of      hanging the President in effigy is indeed protected symbolic      speech. Although hanging the actual President might convey      the same message of protest, a physical assault on the      nation's chief executive cannot be justified as      constitutionally protected expressive activity and could      constitutionally be singled out for specific punishment. S.      1335 makes this necessary distinction as well, protecting      the use of the flag to make a political statement, whether      pro- or anti-government, while imposing sanctions for its      use to incite a violent response.       Courts and prosecutors are quite capable of discerning the      difference between protected speech and actionable conduct.      Federal law already makes a variety of threats of violence a      crime. Congress has, for example, targeted for criminal      sanction interference with commerce by threats or violence,      18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951, (1994), incitement to riot, 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2101, tampering with consumer products, 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 1365, and interfering with certain federally protected      activities. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245. S. 1335 fits well within the      rubric that these laws have previously occupied. It cannot be      reasonably asserted that S. 1335 attempts to suppress      protected expression. II. S. 1335 Does Not Unconstitutionally Discriminate on the Basis of                           Content or Viewpoint       The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that ``above      all else, the First Amendment means that government has no      power to restrict expression because of its message, its      ideas, its subject matter, or its content.'' Police      Department v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972). On this basis,      the Court recently invalidated a St. Paul, Minnesota      ordinance that purported to punish symbolic expression when      it constituted fighting words directed toward people because      of their race, color, creed, religion or gender. Fighting      words is a category of expression that the Court had      previously held to be outside the First Amendment's      protections. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-     72 (1942). In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S.Ct. 2538,      2543 (1992), the Court gave this statement greater nuance by      stating that categories of speech such as fighting words are      not so entirely without constitutional import ``that they may      be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to      their distinctively proscribable content.'' Explaining this      concept, the Court gave an example involving libel: ``the government      may proscribe libel; but it may not make the further content      discrimination of proscribing only libel critical of the      government.'' Id.       As a further example, the Court said a city council could      not enact an ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene      works that contain criticism of the city government. Id. As      yet another example, the Court stated that ``burning a flag      in violation of an ordinance against outdoor fires could be      punishable, whereas burning a flag in violation of an      ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not.'' Id. at 2544.      The rationale behind this limitation, the Court explained,      was that government could not be vested with the power to      ``drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.''      Id. at 2545 (quoting Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of      the N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 112 S.Ct. 501, 508      (1991)).       No such danger exists under S. 1335. Both the patriotic      group that makes use of the flag to provoke a violent      response from dissenters and the protesters who use the flag      to provoke a violent response from loyalists are subject to      its provisions. A law that would only punish one or the other      perspective would have the kind of constitutional flaw      identified by the Court in R.A.V. Moreover, the legislation      recognizes, as the Supreme Court itself did (``the flag      occupies a ``deservedly cherished place in our community,''      491 U.S. at 419) that the flag has a special status that      justifies its special attention. Similarly, the R.A.V. Court      noted that a law aimed at protecting the President against      threats of violence, even though it did not protect other      citizens, is constitutional because such threats ``have      special force when applied to the person of the President.''      Id. at 2546. The rule against content discrimination, the      Court explained, is not a rule against underinclusiveness.      For example, ``a State may choose to regulate price      advertising in one industry but not in others, because the      risk of fraud is in its view greater there.'' Id.      (parenthetical and citation omitted).       The federal laws cited earlier that make certain types of      threats of violence into crimes are not thought to pose      content discrimination problems because they deal with only      limited kinds of threats. To give another example, federal      law also makes the use of a gun in the course of a crime      grounds for special additional punishment. See 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 924(c). In Brandenburg, the Court found that a Ku Klux      Klan rally at which guns were brandished and overthrow of the      government discussed remained protected free speech. Because      guns were used for expressive purposes in Brandenburg and      found to be beyond the law's reach there does not mean that      the law enhancing punishment because a gun is used during the      commission of a crime unlawfully infringes on any expressive      rights.       The gun law makes the necessary constitutional distinctions      that the Court requires, and so does S. 1335's concentration      on crimes involving the American flag rather than protests      involving the flag. S. 1335 properly identifies in its      findings the reason for Congress to take special note of the      flag: ``it is a unique symbol of national unity.''      Sec. 2(a)(1). It notes that ``destruction of the flag of the      United States can occur to incite a violent response rather      than make a political statement.'' Sec. 2(a)(4). As a result,      Congress has developed the necessary legislative facts to      justify such a particularized law.       In its only post-R.A.V. decision on a hate-crimes statute,      the Court upheld a statute that enhanced the punishment of an      individual who ``intentionally selects'' his victim on the      basis of race, religion, color, disability, sexual      orientation, national origin or ancestry. Wisconsin v.      Mitchell, 113 S. Ct. 2194 (1993). A fair reading of the      Court's unanimous decision in that case supports the      conclusion that the Court would not strike down S. 1335 on      R.A.V. grounds. In Mitchell, the Court concluded that the      statute did not impermissibly punish the defendant's      ``abstract beliefs,'' id. at 2200 (citing Dawson v.      Delaware, 112 S. Ct. 1093 (1992)), but instead spotlighted      conduct that had the potential to cause a physical harm      that the State could properly proscribe. S. 1335 similarly      eschews ideological or viewpoint discrimination to focus      on the intentional provocation of violence, a harm well      within the government's power to punish.            III. S. 1335 does not encourage a heckler's veto       First Amendment doctrine does not permit the government to      use the excuse of a hostile audience to prevent the      expression of political ideas. Thus, the First Amendment will      not allow the government to give a heckler some sort of veto      against the expression of ideas that he or she finds      offensive. As a result, the Court has observed, ``in public      debate our own citizens must tolerate insulting, and even      outrageous, speech in order to provide `adequate breathing      space' to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment.''      Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 322 (1988). Any other approach      to free speech ``would lead to standardization of ideas      either by legislation, courts, or dominant political or      community groups.'' Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4      (1949). Thus, simply because some might be provoked and      respond violently to a march that expresses hatred of the      residents of a community, that is insufficient justification      to overcome the First Amendment's protection of ideas, no      matter how noxious they may be deemed. See, e.g., Collin v.      Smith, 578 F.2d 1197 (7th Cir.), Cert. denied, 436 U.S. 953      (1978).       The Supreme Court's flag-burning decisions applied this      principle. In Johnson, the state of Texas attempted to      counter the argument against its flag-desecration prosecution      by asserting an overriding governmental interest; it claimed      that the burning of a flag ``is necessarily likely to disturb      the peace and that the expression may be prohibited on this      basis.'' 491 U.S. at 408 (footnote omitted). The Court      rejected this argument on two grounds: (1) no evidence had      been submitted to indicate that there was an actual breach of      the peace, nor was evidence adduced that a breach of the      peace was one of Johnson's goals; Id. at 407, and (2) to hold      ``that every flag burning necessarily possesses [violent]      potential would be to eviscerate our holding in Brandenburg      [that the expression must be directed to and likely to incite      or produce violence to be subject to criminalization].'' Id.      at 409.       S. 1335 avoids the problems that Texas had by requiring      that the defendant have ``the primary purpose and intent to      incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace,      . . . in circumstances where the person knows it is      reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or a breach of      the peace.'' S. 1335, at Sec. (a)(a). If Texas had      demonstrated that Johnson had intended to breach the peace      and was likely to accomplish this goal, Johnson could have      been convicted of a crime for burning the U.S. flag. Texas,      however, never attempted to prove this.       Moreover, S. 1335 does not enable hecklers to veto      expression by reacting violently because it requires that the      defendant have the specific intent to provoke that response,      while at the same time taking away any bias-motivated      discretion from law enforcers. The existence of a scienter      requirement and a likelihood element is critical to      distinguishing between a law that unconstitutionally punishes      a viewpoint because some people hate it and one that      legitimately punishes incitement to violence.          iv. s. 1335 is consistent with federalism principles       Earlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Gun-Free      School Zones Act of 1990, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(q)(1)(a)      unconstitutionally exceeded the power of Congress to regulate      commerce. United States v. Lopez, 63 U.S.L.W. 4343 (1995). In      doing so, the Court reaffirmed the original principle that      ``the powers delegated by the [] Constitution to the federal      government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in      the State governments are numerous and indefinite.'' Id. at      4344 (quoting The Federalist No. 45, pp. 292-293 (C. Rossiter      ed. 1961) (James Madison)).       S. 1335 respects these principles by directing its      sanctions only at preventing the use of the national flag to      incite violence, preventing someone from damaging an American      flag belonging to the United States, or damaging, on federal      land, an American flag stolen from another person. Each of      these acts have a clear federal nexus and remain properly      within the jurisdiction of the federal government. Moreover,      the bill concedes jurisdiction to the states wherever it may      properly be exercised. S. 1335, at Sec. 3(a)(d).                             v. conclusion       S. 1335 is carefully crafted to avoid constitutional      difficulties by being solicitous of federalism and freedom of      speech by focusing on incitement to violence. By doing so, it      meets all constitutional requirements.                                                                    ____                                   Congressional Research Service,                                      The Library of Congress,                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 1995.     To: Hon. Robert F. Bennett (Attention: Lisa Norton).     From: American Law Division.     Subject: Constitutionality of flag desecration bill.       This memorandum is in response to your request for a      constitutional evaluation of S. 1335, 104th Congress, a bill      to provide for the protection of the flag of the United      States and free speech and for other purposes.       Briefly, the bill would criminalize the destruction or      damage of a United States flag under three circumstances.      First, subsection (a) would penalize such conduct when the      person engaging in it does so with the primary purpose and      intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of      the peace and in circumstances where the person knows it is      reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or a breach of      the peace.       Second, subsection (b) would punish any person who steals      or knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use of      another, a United States flag belonging to the United States      and who intentionally destroys or damages that flag. Third,      subsection (c) punishes any person who, within any lands      reserved for the use of the United States or under the      exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction of the United States,      steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use      of another, a flag of the United States belonging to another      person and who intentionally destroys or damages that flag.       Of course, the bill is intended to protect the flag of the      United States in circumstances under which statutory      protection may be afforded. The obstacle to a general      prohibition of destruction of or damage to the flag is the      principle enunciated in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S.      310 (1990), and Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), that      flag desecration, usually through burning, is expressive      conduct if committed to ``send a message,'' and that the      Court would review      limits on this conduct with exacting scrutiny; legislation that      proposed to penalize the conduct in order to silence the      message or out of disagreement with the message violates the      First Amendment speech clause.       Rather clearly, subsections (b) and (c) would present no      constitutional difficulties, based on judicial precedents,      either facially or as applied. The Court has been plain that      one may not exercise expressive conduct or symbolic speech      with or upon the property of others or by trespass upon the      property of another. Eichman, supra, 496 U.S., 316 n., 5;      Johnson, supra, 412 n. 8; Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405,      408-409 (1974). See also, R.A. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S.Ct.      2538 (1992) (cross burning on another's property). The      subsections are directed precisely to the theft or conversion      of a flag belonging to someone else, the government or a      private party, and the destruction of or damage to that flag.       Almost as evident from the Supreme Court's precedents,      subsection (a) is quite likely to pass constitutional muster.      The provision's language is drawn from the ``fighting words''      doctrine of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942).      That case defined a variety of expression that was      unprotected by the First Amendment, among the categories      being speech that inflicts injury or tends to incite      immediate violence. Id., 572. While the Court over the years      has modified the other categories listed in Chaplinsky, it      has not departed from the holding that the ``fighting words''      exception continues to exist. It has, of course, laid down      some governing principles, which are reflected in the      subsection's language.       Thus, the Court has applied to ``fighting words'' the      principle of Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), under      which speech advocating unlawful action may be punished only      if it directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless      action and is likely to incite or produce such action. Id.,      447. This development is spelled out in Cohen v. California,      403 U.S. 15, 20, 22-23 (1971). See also NAACP v. Claiborne      Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 928 (1982); Hess v. Indiana, 414      U.S. 105 (1973).       A second principle, enunciated in an opinion demonstrating      the continuing vitality of the ``fighting words'' doctrine,      is that it is impermissible to punish only those ``fighting      words'' of which government disapproves. Government may not      distinguish between classes of ``fighting words'' on an      ideological basis. R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S.Ct. 2538      (1992).       Subsection (a) is drafted in a manner to reflect both these      principles. It requires not only that the conduct be      reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or breach of      the peace, but that the person intend to bring about imminent      violence or breach of the peace. Further, nothing in the      subsection draws a distinction between approved or      disapproved expression that is communicated by the action      committed with or on the flag.       In conclusion, the judicial precedents establish that the      bill, if enacted, would survive constitutional attack.      Subsections (b) and (c) are more securely grounded in      constitutional law, but subsection (a) is only a little less      anchored in decisional law.       Because of time constraints, this memorandum is necessarily      brief. If, however, you desire a more generous treatment,      please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.                                            Johnny H. Killian,                                                Senior Specialist,                                      American Constitutional Law.  Mr. McCONNELL. I know my colleagues and their allies who support the constitutional amendment are motivated by the highest ideals and principles.  I share their reverence for the flag and the values and history it represents. But even a constitutional amendment won't succeed in coercing proper respect for the flag. It will, however, do damage to the Constitution and the cause of freedom.  After all, is that not what the flag signifies--freedom? That is what it signifies.  Who can forget the pictures of the fall of the Berlin Wall, as nation after nation of Eastern Europe threw off the shackles of communism for freedom? The American flags flying over our embassies in the countries behind the Iron Curtain held the hopes and dreams of those subjugated under communism.  Spreading freedom is uniquely our American creed. In our history, we have seen freedom triumph over our colonial forbearers, over the slave holders, over the Fascists and over the dictators.  To narrow the Bill of Rights, even in the name of the flag and patriotism, constricts freedom and would reverse the 200-year American experiment with freedom that has made our Nation the envy of the world.  Let us not give flag-burners--the miscreants who hate America and the freedom we cherish--more attention than they deserve. Do not let these few scoundrels with nothing better to do than burn our flag chase freedom from the shores of America.  I urge adoption of my statutory alternative to punish those who desecrate the flag, rather than a constitutional amendment that strikes at the heart of our most cherished freedoms.  So, Mr. President, in all likelihood, we will be voting on this amendment sometime either Monday or Tuesday, depending on whether a unanimous-consent agreement is entered into. I hope that the amendment will be given serious consideration by the Senate as an alternative approach which clearly would meet constitutional standards to amending the Constitution.  Mr. President, on another matter, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so ordered.                          ____________________
