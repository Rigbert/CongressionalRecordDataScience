Speaker, I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in supporting this Resolution, which condemns in the strongest possible terms the barbaric terrorist attacks in Jordan last Wednesday.  These attacks at three Amman hotels--including an attack on a wedding party--killed 58 innocent men, women and children, and are yet another demonstration of the uncivilized, unrepentant evil that possesses the Al Qaeda terrorist organization, which claimed responsibility. And this was, sadly, not the first time Jordan has suffered at the hands of terrorists because it maintains close relations with the West.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to commend King Abdullah for his forthright public comments after these attacks. As reported in the Washington Post today, the King stated: ``What the attack did was show to everybody what we've been saying--that this is an issue of ideology and the Muslim world can no longer be complacent. People can't sit in the middle.''  The fact is, the savage bombings last week in Amman were perpetrated by Muslims, who directed their hatred at Muslims.  The fact is, the entire civilized world--be they Christian, Muslim or Jew--must recognize our common interest in uniting and defeating this mortal threat to our way of life, to the democratic form of government, to basic human decency and to the rule of law.  None of us, as the King said, can be complacent.  Mr. Speaker, the people and the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan have been a stalwart ally in the war on terror.  And, I believe it is important today that this Congress condemn these cowardly attacks; express its condolences to the families and friends of those killed, and its sympathies to those injured; express its solidarity and support of the people and Government of Jordan; and express its readiness to assist Jordanian authorities in bringing those responsible for these outrageous attacks to justice.  I urge my colleagues to support this Resolution.
