President, I say to my good friend from Connecticut, I was surprised to find out he was not a member of the conservative caucus. Now I know. But I would agree with him insofar as the significance of the confirmation vote that will take placetomorrow. There is nothing more solemn, nothing more significant that we have to deal with than confirming judges, whether they are nominated by Democrats or by Republicans.  However, I respectfully disagree with the Senator from Connecticut. I look forward to voting for the successful confirmation of Judge Alito. I have had a chance to talk about him. I believe he will be a strict constructionist and will do a good job for the United States, specifically for my 20 kids and grandkids.                          ____________________
