 President, Al Bauer is a former colleague of mine in the State Senate of Washington. He is also a former educator, and he speaks from his heart when he talks about education. He wrote in his letter that hiring more well-trained teachers will help school districts stave off cuts to other special programs for at-risk students. He argues that more teachers does not have to mean more classrooms. It is the number of well-trained adults in the room that is important, because students' access to time with the teacher is at the heart of learning. He argues that Congress can pay for class-size reductions if we can put billions of extra dollars into transportation.  State Senator Al Bauer is absolutely right. The arguments against this proposal are not valid. It doesn't mean that we need more class space. It doesn't mean that we will siphon money from other places.  It does mean that this Congress, this Senate, the people on this floor are listening to what parents and educators and people across this country are saying. When we send our children off to school, we want to know they are safe, we want to know they will learn, and we know they will be safe and they will learn and get the attention they need if we begin to focus on class size in this country.  Now, a person could spend a year or a lifetime searching, and they would not be able to find someone who understands education in Washington state more deeply than Senator Al Bauer. And he happens to be a former educator, and he happens to be a Democrat. But Senator Bauer and I stood together in the state Senate, and we worked with our Republican colleagues to do everything we could to improve public education.  He knows and I know that Republicans and Democrats in Washington state can work together. They have worked together to reduce class size, increase family involvement in school decisions, fund school construction, improve teacher quality, allow communities to set higher standards for students, publish school report cards, hold schools accountable for results, reward schools that do well and mediate schools that are failing, increase student's options about which school they attend.  All these things were bipartisan proposals, based on what local school communities told us would work to improve results for students. And the great news is that many of these proposals have actually improved things in Washington state schools.  And when I think about the partisan tone of this debate on education, and I look at the education IRA proposal which offers only a seven-dollar a year solution to only a few families--I think of all the things we could be doing that would really make a difference for all students. And class size improvement is near the top of that list.  I think it is important to listen to what educators say. I want to read to you what some of the educators have written to me as I have talked about this issue over the last several months.  Larry Swift, who is the executive director of the Washington State School Directors' Association, wrote to me, and I especially appreciate his words because I am a former school board member and Larry Swift represents the school board members across my State. He says:       As we pursue our state's goal of improving learning for all      of our students, it becomes increasingly important that all      of our resources be used efficiently and effectively. The      most valuable resource in today's schools is the people who      devote their time and effort to make schools successful--the      teachers. Reducing the ratio of students to adults is      particularly critical for youngsters with a variety of      learning challenges that must be overcome if those students      are to meet the new, higher learning standards.  Mr. President, Larry Swift is right. Representing the school boards across my country, he makes a very clear case that increasing the number of teachers and reducing the class size is critical because we are requiring our young students to know more today than we ever have before in the history of this country.  Let me also quote from Kenneth Winkes, who is the head of the Association of Washington State Principals. He represents all the principals in my State, and here is what they say:       It is increasingly evident that students entering our      schools have diverse and unique needs which can only be      addressed by principals, teachers, and support personnel who      are not overwhelmed by crowded classrooms. Rather, educators      must be able to devote attention to each student in smaller,      more manageable classes.  That is what principals say.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four short statements be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Washington State School                                       Directors' Association,                                      Olympia, WA, March 20, 1998.       ``As we pursue our state's goal of improving learning for      all of our students,'' Larry Swift, executive director of the      Washington State School Directors' Association, said, ``it      becomes increasingly important that all of our resources be      used efficiently and effectively. The most valuable resource      in today's schools is the people who devote their time and      effort to make schools successful--the teachers. Reducing the      ratio of students to adults is particularly critical for      youngsters with a variety of learning challenges that must be      overcome if those students are to meet the new, higher      learning standards.       ``We acknowledge and commend Senator Murray for leading the      way to assuring that our students have the learning      environment and the human resources necessary for the kind of      schools that will provide the opportunities and training they      need to become successful,'' Swift said.       The Washington State School Directors' Association is a      statewide organization representing all of the 1,482 locally-     elected     school board members from the state's 296 school districts.      WSSDA serves as an advocate for the state's public schools,      provides training and technical assistance for school board      members and is very active in the legislative process.                                                                    ____                                                The Association of                                 Washington School Principals,                                                      Olympia, WA.       The Association of Washington School Principals (AWSP) is      strongly committed to supporting legislation which reduces      class size in our public school system. It is increasingly      evident that students entering our schools have diverse and      unique needs which can only be addressed by principals,      teachers, and support personnel who are not overwhelmed by      crowded classrooms. Rather, educators must be able to devote      attention to each student in smaller, more manageable      classes.       Recent studies on reduced class size and their impact on      student performance, undertaken in Tennessee (STAR study) and      Wisconsin (SAGE study), speak to learner benefits in areas      such as reading, language arts, and math. In our own state of      Washington, reduction of class size and improved student      performance are priorities for both legislators and      educators.       AWSP is convinced that class size reduction is essential if      our state's, and nation's, efforts towards school improvement      are to be successful. We appreciate and support Senator Patty      Murray's commitment to this end.                                                                    ____                             Washington Education Association,                          Federal Way, WA, Friday, March 20, 1998.        WEA President Applauds Sen. Murray's Work on Class Size Statement of Lee Ann Prielipp, president of the Washington Education Association, regarding Sen. Patty Murray's work to lower class sizes in                        Washington, March 20, 1998       Every student deserves a safe and effective learning      environment, and we commend Sen. Murray's devotion to this      pressing issue. Washington currently has the fourth largest      class sizes in the United States, a dubious distinction which      we must work to change.       When educators have too many students in a class, it is      hard for them to give each student the individual attention      that students need. It is this individual attention that is      at the heart of the learning process, and it is crucial in      helping our students succeed.       The 65,000 members of WEA support Sen. Murray in her work      to lower class size in Washington. This is an issue that is      getting worse, and which we can no longer ignore. Thank you,      Senator Murray, for working to give our students the      education they need and deserve.                                                                    ____                                            American Federation of                                                     Teachers,                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1998.Statement by Sandra Feldman, President, American Federation of Teachers                         on Reducing Class Sizes       Modern schools and more well-trained teachers are the right      antidote for the overcrowding that plagues too many American      schools. Research shows that youngsters, especially in the      early grades, perform better in smaller classes that allow      for greater one-on-one instruction. Smaller classes also help      teachers maintain discipline. Parents and teachers understand      this well, and that's why Senator Murray is absolutely      correct in supporting the President's proposal to provide      subsidies for school construction and to emphasize teacher      recruitment.       Several new studies clearly demonstrate the link between      reduced class sizes and improved academic achievement. A      sampling:       STAR, the highly reputed Tennessee class-size study,      analyzed the achievement levels of K-3 students randomly      assigned to classes of 13 to 17. Those in small classes did      much better than students in regular classes in math and      reading, every year and in all grades. The small classes made      the biggest difference in the scores of children in inner-     city schools.       SAGE, a Wisconsin program begun in 1996-97, reduces class      size for K-3 children in certain high-poverty schools. At the      end of the first year, SAGE kids had made significantly      greater improvements in reading, language arts, and math than      children had in similar schools.
