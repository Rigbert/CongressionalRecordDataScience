 President, this is a key amendment that would destroy the bipartisan tax bill that we have before us. He proposes to stimulate the economy by expanding the range of the income eligible for the new 10-percent rate. But Senator Graham has not emphasized the tremendous price that would be paid, and that would be eliminating the rest of the tax bill. The only thing that would survive is the 10-percent rate. Worst of all, the Senator's proposal would actually increase taxes on middle-income Americans because a family of four with $60,000 in taxable income would pay $100 more in taxes under the Graham amendment than they would pay under our bipartisan tax bill when fully phased in.  If this amendment is successful, Senator Graham then would, of course, destroy our bipartisan effort to provide $1.3 trillion tax relief.
