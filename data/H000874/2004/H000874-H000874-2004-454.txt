Speaker. last November Washington, DC lost one of its trademark voices. Eddie Gallaher, who entertained an entire generation of Washingtonians, passed away on November 26, 2003.  Mr. Gallaher was a radio performer who made his mark on the city during some of our century's most turbulent times. His decades-long career began in 1946 and didn't end until 3 years ago, when Mr. Gallaher was a spry 85. And though he was modest about his popularity, Mr. Gallaher was the man the biggest stars of the day always sat down to chat with when they came to visit the Nation's Capital.  Mr. Gallaher began his radio career at WTOP in Washington in 1946 as the host of the ``Magical Moondial'' show. In 1947, Mr. Gallaher began his ``Sundial'' morning program. As radio changed with the times and WTOP switched to an all-news format, Mr. Gallaher moved to WASH-FM and later on, WWDC-AM.  Mr. Speaker, in between spinning popular American standards and providing news updates and color commentary, Mr. Gallaher attracted listeners with his wit and homespun stories of life in Washington. His smooth voice was legendary as was his generous and affable nature. His reputation earned the attention of advertisers, who recruited his name for their on-air promotions.  Mr. Gallaher had a skillful knack for weaving in amusing anecdotes about the entertainment and political worlds that gave his audience a unique insider's perspective. Yet he enjoyed and valued the community feeling of the Washington area, and encouraged civic participation from his listeners. Mr. Gallaher's devotion to his fans was mirrored in his devotion to Fran Sisk, his partner for close to 50 years.  Mr. Speaker, it was a pleasure for many of us--public officials and private citizens alike--to know Mr. Gallaher. Our Nation's Capital and the radio industry has truly lost a grand, old star.                          ____________________
