Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My bill, H.R. 443, directs the Indian Health Service to transfer 15 acres of Federal land in Alaska to the Maniilaq Association by warranty deed. The IHS has already conveyed these lands to the association by quitclaim deed; however, under Federal Indian health laws, transferring land by quitclaim deed could present some obstacles to the future use of the land by the association. The association is a nonprofit entity that runs Federal Indian health services for Native people in northwest Alaska. The land subject to this legislation is currently the site of a Native health facility and of proposed long-term care facilities and employee housing.  The administration testified in support of the land transfer, and we have heard no other objections to this bill which passed the House over a year ago by a 407-4 vote. The Senate amendment before us today makes four small technical changes to the bill, including changing verb tenses, clarifying the timing of the conveyance, and clarifying a definition. None are controversial and, some might say, even necessary.  I, again, thank Chairman Upton of the Energy and Commerce Committee for allowing H.R. 443, a bill that we share jurisdiction over, to be considered on the floor today.  I urge the House to adopt the Senate amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
