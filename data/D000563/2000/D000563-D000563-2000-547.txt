One thing I found interesting in the analysis of my colleague's bill is the suggestion that most of the benefits for education will go to the wealthiest people in this country.  Will the Senator comment on that and tell me whether he believes, as I do, that though we want every family to have an opportunity, if we are going to have limited resources applied for incentives in education, we should look to working families and middle-income families--and lower income families, for that matter, who otherwise may not ever be able to send their kids off to college--as our highest priority, as opposed to the approach of the Senator, which apparently takes the wealthiest families as the highest priority.
