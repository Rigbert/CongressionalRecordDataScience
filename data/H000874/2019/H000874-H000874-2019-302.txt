 The point of reciting the dollars that were included just some weeks ago to the administration is to point out that they had clearly significant sums with which to operate now, and we will see what funds they need in the future. But I wanted to point out that we have not been negligent or sleeping, with respect to both border security and the humanitarian treatment of those who come across our border seeking asylum.  As I said, we will review it and see what determination needs to be made on what further resources are necessary.
