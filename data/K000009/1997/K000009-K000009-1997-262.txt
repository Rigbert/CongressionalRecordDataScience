Speaker, several months ago I was pleased to cosponsor a congressional briefing addressing the important health issue of heart disease. Those who attended this event had the privilege to listen to four distinguished specialists in the area of heart disease discuss the important benefits of psychological intervention in the care of patients with heart disease.  The speakers were: Dorothy W. Cantor, Psy.D., president, the American Psychological Association; Ernest H. Johnson, Ph.D., director, behavioral medicine research, Morehouse School of Medicine; Wayne M. Sotile, Ph.D., director, psychological services, cardiac rehabilitation program, Wake Forest University; and Redford B. Williams, M.D., director, Behavioral Medicine Research Center, Duke University.  Each day in America, 4,000 people suffer a heart attack--one in five before age 60. Five million Americans have coronary heart disease [CHD], and approximately 400,000 of these individuals each year suffer heart failure. Some 70 percent of the victims of an initial heart attack and 50 percent of individuals who suffer a recurrent heart attack survive. As medical treatment for heart patients improves, a growing number of heart attack survivors are younger than age 65. Nearly 2.5 million Americans have some degree of vocational disability or limitation caused by heart illness. CHD is the leading problem for which patients receive premature disability benefits.  Between 50 and 60 percent of all caridac patients who enter the hospital experience elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and fear. Depression is one of the factors which predicts mortality from heart illness and recurrence of a heart attack. Over 50 percent of spouses and children of caridac patients experience elevated stress, anxiety, and somatic preoccupation for up to 10 years following a loved one's heart illness. Family tensions and social isolation have been shown to be significant risk factors for recovering heart patients.  Research shows that psychological intervention leads to shorter hospital stays, reduced rehospitalization, and reduced rates of recurring heart attacks and death. In fact, as little as 30 minutes of psychological counseling per day for 5-6 days has been shown to lead to discharge from the hospital 2.5 days sooner and from the intensive care unit 1 day sooner, as well as lessening morbidity.  The Clinical Practice Guideline for Caridac Rehabilitation recently published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services emphasized that education alone is not effective in helping heart patients cope. Effective intervention combines education, counseling-providing advice, support and consultation-and behavioral interventions--systematic instruction in techniques to modify health related behavior.  Unfortunately only 12 percent of formal cardiac care programs utilize consultation from a psychologist.  Summary information on the briefing follows:                           Information Sheet       Each day in America, 4,000 people suffer a heart attack--     one in five before age 60. Five million Americans have      coronary heart disease (CHD). Of these, approximately 400,000      suffer heart failure each year in the United States. Seventy      percent of victims of an initial heart attack and 50 percent      of individuals who suffer a recurrent heart attack survive.      As medical treatment for heart patients improves, a growing      number of heart attack survivors are younger than age 65. But      nearly 2.5 million Americans have some degree of vocational      disability or limitation caused by heart illness and in the      United States, CHD is the leading problem for which patients      receive premature disability benefits.        Why Is Psychological Care Important For Heart Patients?       Immediately following heart surgery there is a window of      opportunity in which to educate recovering heart patients      about adaptive coping skills. The Information patients are      given in this time period shapes their thinking about life      after heart surgery for up to five years. For instance, if      patients believe they cannot have sexual relations, or cannot      exercise, and are not told differently, they may hamper their      recovery.       Incorporating psychological intervention into the care of      recovering heart patients is important because:       Between 50 and 60 percent of all cardiac patients who enter      the hospital experience elevated levels of depression,      anxiety or fear.       Over 50 percent of spouses and children of cardiac patients      elevate on measures of stress, anxiety and somatic      preoccupation for up to ten years following a loved one's      heart illness.       A significant percentage of recovering cardiopulmonary      patients and their families experience frustration about      feeling ill-prepared for the long-range course of      rehabilitation.       Family tensions and social isolation have been shown to be      significant risk factors for recovering heart patients.       Depresssion, social isolation and hostility predict      mortality from heart illness and recurrence of a heart      attack.          Psychological Interventions Make a Proven Difference       Reserach shows that:       As little as 30 minutes of psychological counseling per day      for 5-6 days has been shown to lead to discharge from the      hospital 2.5 days sooner and from the Intensive Care Unit one      day sooner, as well as lessening morbidity.       Group therapy with recovering heart attack patients has      consistently been found to improve measures of psychological      well-being and lessen indicators of morbidity throughout the      first three years of recovery.       Two hours of psychological counseling per week for seven      weeks has been shown to reduce incidence of re-     hospitalization for recovering heart attack patients by 60      percent.       Treatment of depression has been shown to reduce rates of      re-occurring heart attacks and death over three years of      follow-up.       A single supportive interview delivered on the evening      before surgery has shown to lessen post-operative psychosis.       Brief psychological counseling prior to medical or surgical      intervention has been found to produce shorter stays in the      Critical Care Unit, less emotional distress, fewer      arrhythmias and shorter hospital stays when compared to      routine CCU care.       Three sessions of psychological counseling in two days      prior to catheterization can significantly improve patient      management of the stress of the procedure.       Relaxation training diminishes post-surgical incidence of      delirium, medical complications and lengths of hospital stay.                        Education is Not Enough!       The Clinical Practice Guideline for Cardiac Rehabilitation      recently published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human      Services emphasizes that education alone is not effective in      helping heart patients cope. Effective intervention combines      education, counseling (providing advice, support and      consultation), and behavioral interventions (systematic      instruction in techniques to modify health related      behaviors). Such combination treatments have been shown to:      Reduce symptoms of angina in recovering CHD populations;      promote stress management and overall psychological well-     being in recovering cardiac populations; increase the rate of      smoking cessation in recovering cardiac patients by      approximately 18 percent compared to rates of spontaneous      smoking cessation; significantly enhance modification of diet      to lower lipids and lower body weight; lower blood pressure,      when added to a comprehensive rehabilitation program.       Research has shown that education, counseling and      behavioral intervention designed to encourage heart patients      to adhere to therapies have been associated with: Reduction      in recurrent coronary event rates; regression of      atherosclerosis; reduction in cardiac and overall mortality      rates.            What Do Psychologists Do To Help Heart Patients?       Enhance self-management skills and self-efficacy.       Reduce psychophysiological arousal with relaxation training      and biofeedback.       Alter specific behavior patterns through stress management.       Enhance social support.       Identify patients who are at high risk.       Diminish resistance to healthy lifestyles.       Develop effective conflict resolution strategies.       What Is Currently Being Done to Help Heart Patients Cope?       Unfortunately only 12 percent of formal cardiac care      programs utilize consultation from a psychologist.                          ____________________
