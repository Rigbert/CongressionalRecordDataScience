 Families across the country should be grateful for the work the Senator is doing on the appropriations side of the committee, which focuses on making sure their kids can go to school, that they have the research and investment they need for their health care, and so many transportation infrastructure projects that allow them to go to work and raise their families in a responsible way.  I respect and admire the work the Senator is doing right now on a very difficult and challenging budget CR that no one wishes looked like it does, but we recognize the reality of the task the Senator has been given. She is managing it in the best way possible.  To answer the question, I would tell the Senator that we are in a very short timeframe. Our Budget Committee will proceed through the amendment process, and tomorrow night pass out our budget after many amendments. At that time, our staff will work over the few short days they have to have the paperwork ready to lay down our bill on the floor of the Senate, hopefully, Monday night. We are under a very constricted timeframe. It is the one piece of legislation that comes before this body like that with 50 hours of debate and multiple amendments. We need to finish that before we can leave for the April break.
