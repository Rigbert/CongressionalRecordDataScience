Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Reverend Benedict J. Benakovic on the 50th Anniversary of ordination into the priesthood. On Sunday, October 17, 1999, the parishioners of St. Joseph the Worker Croatian Catholic Church in Gary, Indiana, will honor its jubilarian priest. Father Benedict's 50th Anniversary festivities will begin at 11:00 a.m. with a Mass of Thanksgiving at the church, followed by a reception in the church hall.  Father Benedict was born on January 18, 1923 in Slavonski Brod, Croatia. He entered the minor seminary of the St. Jerome Province of the Croatian Conventual Franciscans on September 6, 1935, and pronounced his solemn vows on December 26, 1945. He completed studies in philosophy and theology at the Archdiocesan Seminary in Zagreb, Croatia, and was ordained a priest on June 29, 1949 in the cathedral in Zagreb. Father Benedict offered his first Mass on Sunday, July 3, 1949 in Zupanja, his family's hometown.  After one year of military service, Father Benedict was appointed assistant pastor at St. Anthony Church in Zagreb. In 1962, he was sent to the United States to minister to the faithful in a Croatian parish. On February 13 of the same year, he came to Gary, Indiana, where he has lived ever since. The very Reverend Andrew G. Grutka, Bishop of Gary, appointed Father Benedict assistant pastor of St. Joseph the Worker Croatian Church in Gary, Indiana. In 1972, Father Benedict was appointed Pastor, and has remained in that position for the past 27 years.  Father Benedict has never believed that his work as a priest was limited to Sunday mornings. Even though he is extremely dedicated to the people of his parish, Father Benedict has never restricted his humanitarian activities to only his parishioners. Instead, he aids as many people as he can, no matter what the circumstances are. In fact, in October of 1994, Father Benedict was awarded the Columbian Award by the St. Thomas Council, a Catholic fraternal organization based in Hobart, Indiana for his outstanding service and commitment to the community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Reverend Benedict on his 50th Anniversary of ordination into the priesthood. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend him for his service and dedication to our country, and especially the citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
