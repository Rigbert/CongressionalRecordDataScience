 Today, we considered a third appropriations bill. It was a structured rule, which is not uncommon on both sides of the aisle to have a structured rule.  But next week, the gentleman has announced the Defense appropriations bill, and I am wondering whether or not that will be an open rule so that amendments will be able to be offered by Members without constraint of being limited?  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, to answer the gentleman's question, yes, that will come under a structured rule. So Members will be able to offer amendments but before the Rules Committee and then have the debate on the floor prior to passage of the bill.
