President, I wish to honor the members of the radiation protection profession and to recognize that the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors and the Health Physics Society have resolved that November 4-10, 2007, should be named National Radiation Protection Professionals Week.  Since Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen's discovery of x-rays on November 8, 1895, the use of radiation has become vital in the Nation's health care, defense, security, energy, and industrial programs. However, if misused, this vital technology can harm and injure those using it or benefiting from it. Members of the radiation protection profession make it their life's work to allow government, medicine, academia, and industry to safely use radiation. By providing the necessary leadership, these professionals protect people from radiation hazards thus enabling society to reap benefits of this remarkable technology. I encourage all citizens to recognize the valuable resource represented by their professional scientific organizations, such as the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, the Health Physics, the National Registry of Radiation Protection Technologies, and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. I deeply appreciate the commitment of these professionals and professional organization, and their contribution to our Nation and the world. I invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating National Radiation Protection Professionals Week.  I ask that both of their resolutions be printed in the Record at this time.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                Resolution of the Health Physics Society       Whereas, Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen discovered X-rays on      November 8, 1895; and       Whereas, radiation is a useful and necessary part of our      modern world; and       Whereas, radiation exposure can be harmful to people; and       Whereas, Radiation Protection Professionals work with      government, industry, medical, educational, and private      sources to bring the benefits of radiation to the public      while minimizing the hazards of radiation exposure; and       Whereas, the Health Physics Society Board of Directors      supports efforts to encourage all citizens to recognize the      importance of Radiation Protection Professionals who provide      necessary leadership in protecting the public from the      hazards associated with the use of radiation: now be it       Resolved, That November 4-10, 2007 is National Radiation      Protection Professionals Week.       That the week-long observance is dedicated to recognizing      Radiation Protection Professionals for their contributions to      public safety.                                  ____  Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Inc., Resolution       Whereas, Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen discovered X-rays on      November 8, 1895; and       Whereas, radiation is a useful and necessary part of our      modern world; and       Whereas, radiation exposure can be harmful to people; and       Whereas, Radiation Protection Professionals work with      government, industry, medical, educational, and private      sources to bring the benefits of radiation to the public      while minimizing the hazards of radiation exposure; and       Whereas, the Conference of Radiation Control Program      Directors, Inc. supports efforts to encourage all citizens to      recognize the importance of Radiation Protection      Professionals who provide necessary leadership in protecting      the public from the hazards associated with the use of      radiation: Now be it       Resolved, That November 4-10 is National Radiation      Protection Professionals Week.       That the week-long observance is dedicated to recognizing      Radiation Protection Professionals for their contributions to      public safety.                          ____________________
