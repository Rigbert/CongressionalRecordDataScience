What they took out of the bill was the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to list the ingredients on a tobacco package, to put on a warning label that really means something, as opposed to the meaningless warning labels that have been on for 30 or 40 years, and to establish standards and rules for selling tobacco products so children won't become addicted.  I have never met a parent who has said to me: I am so happy. I just learned my teenage daughter has started smoking.  I have never heard that said. There isn't a single one of us who has reared a child who ever wanted to hear they were going to take up smoking or cigarette tobacco. This bill established protections. Those protections were removed. Those tobacco lobbyists who have a big grin on their faces today, because we passed this bill by a big rollcall, should understand their children are at risk, too. The children of families across America are at risk as well.
