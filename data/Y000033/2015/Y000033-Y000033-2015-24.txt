Madam Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Madam Chair, I do not oppose the amendment. I just want to congratulate the lady on backing up what is in the bill, making this correct.  We have had testimony from a lot of the timber tribes on how well they have managed their timber, and right next door will be the Forest Service land that is managed terribly. That is a threat to the tribal timber, too.  I really think, if we want to get back on this track of the freedoms I was talking about, if we allow the tribes to contract with the Forest Service, make it a contract for thinning, encouraging growth, managing growth for future timber needs--you know, the native tribes are doing so much better than the Federal tribes. So I compliment the lady on this deal.                              {time}  1545  I compliment the gentlewoman on this view, and I accept the amendment. I think the gentlewoman is doing a great job, and I appreciate it.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).  The amendment was agreed to.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended.  The amendment was agreed to.  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Holding) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 538) to facilitate the development of energy on Indian lands by reducing Federal regulations that impede tribal development of Indian lands, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 466, she reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.
