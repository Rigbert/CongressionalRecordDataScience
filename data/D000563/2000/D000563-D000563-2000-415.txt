LEAHY. Yes. I say to my friend from Illinois, we may consider sometimes as necessary, under Article V, a constitutional amendment, if the States or Federal Government are unable to do these things otherwise. The fact is, they are doing it very well without a constitutional amendment. Thus, it removes the test of necessity we see in Article V.
