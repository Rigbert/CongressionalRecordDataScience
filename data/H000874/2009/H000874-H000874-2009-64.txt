 I tell my friend again, and he knows this well, we have had hearings on health care reform from 2007 to this day. We have had 81 hours of committee markup. We have had over 86 hours of hearings. We had over 203 hours of caucuses on our side. I presume you have had a similar time, I am sure, paying attention to this bill that has been available to you. It's been 80 days from the time the House bill was first introduced, of which this is obviously an offshoot.  The public has been able to view the bill and extensive information about it is online the entire time. It's been 126 days since, as I said, the House discussion draft was first made available online. I think every one of us has had ample opportunity to debate the bill and offer amendments.  During the markup, 129 amendments were offered by Republicans. You act as if all of a sudden this is a brand-new day. It may be a brand-new day tomorrow, but the legislation has been under consideration for a long time.  Have we made changes? We have. Are those changes so major that your side can't consider them and analyze themover the next 72-plus hours? Because it would be longer than 72 hours. I think the answer to that is no. You certainly have that capability and have been focusing on this very carefully. We promised the 72 hours on the bill and on any manager's amendment that might be offered subsequently, and we are going to do that.  So I tell my friend, I just don't believe that it's a fair criticism to say that a bill that has been discussed, analyzed, more public hearings than any other bill, perhaps, certainly in my career in this House, has somehow all of a sudden come as a surprise to your side of the aisle.
