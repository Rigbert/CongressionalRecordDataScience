 President, this amendment concerns the proposal to build a triple-fence barrier on the Southwest border. Specifically, the amendment I am offering would strike section 108 and replace it with a provision allowing $12 million for the construction and expansion of physical barriers along the border with Mexico, which, in addition to fencing, includes all-weather roads, low-light television systems, lighting sensors, and other technology.  I think we all know that the border represents the front line of deterrence for illegal entry into the country and that the current situation is inadequate. There is a 14-mile stretch of border that separates San Diego and Mexico, and it is patched with some single fencing that is in constant need of repair, has areas with no barriers at all, and roads that wash out and become impassable at the first sign of rain.  The House-passed bill mandates the construction of three parallel fences along the existing 14 miles of reinforced steel fence on the United States-Mexico border in San Diego County. I voted for the triple-fence amendment in the Judiciary Committee because I believed we needed to remedy that situation. After the vote, though, I had a chance to meet with representatives from the Border Patrol and the INS.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the National Border Patrol signed by its president, stating:       A three-tier fence would also create a crime zone within      the boundaries of the United States where illegal immigrants      would be easy prey for robbers, rapists, and     other criminals. The accomplices of these criminals could      easily prevent law enforcement officers from responding to      these crimes by blocking access roads with nails, broken      glass, other debris, [et cetera]. . . .       The Border Patrol Council strongly recommends this bill be      amended by replacing the requirement with a safer and more      effective alternative.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         National Border Patrol Council, American Federation of            Government Employees,                                        Campo, CA, April 15, 1996.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The National Border Patrol Council,      representing nearly 5,000 Border Patrol employees, is deeply      concerned by the provision in S. 1664 (formerly S. 269, the      ``Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995'') that      would require the construction of fourteen miles of three-     tier fencing in San Diego, California. Such fencing would      needlessly endanger the lives of Border Patrol Agents by      trapping them between layers of fences and leaving them with      no expeditious means of escape from the gunfire, barrages of      rocks and other physical assaults that routinely occur along      the U.S.-Mexico border.       A three-tier fence would also create a crime zone within      the boundaries of the United States where illegal immigrants      would be easy prey for robbers, rapists, and other criminals.      The accomplices of these criminals could easily prevent law      enforcement officers from responding to these crimes by      blocking access roads with nails, broken glass, other debris,      barrages of rocks and/or gunfire.       Rather than facilitating the accomplishment of the Border      Patrol's mission, a three-tier fence would decrease the      effectiveness of its operations, and would make an already      dangerous job even more so.       The National Border Patrol Council strongly recommends that      S. 1664 be amended by replacing the requirement to construct      a three-tier fence with a safer and more effective      alternative. Those who deal with the problem of illegal      immigration on a daily basis should be allowed to decide      which technologies, including physical barriers, all-weather      roads, low-light television systems, lighting, sensors, and      other means, are more appropriate and effective for a given      area.       Your support of this amendment would be greatly      appreciated.           Sincerely,                                                      T.J. Bonner,                                                        President.
