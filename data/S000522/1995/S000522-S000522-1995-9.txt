Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. We do work together on a number of other issues, but unfortunately, on this one we have a difference.  Let me reiterate, and make this so very clear to everyone who may be listening to this debate, that we will provide family planning funds, as we did during the Reagan and Bush years when we provided in excess of 40 percent of all the subsidies globally for family planning, but we did it in a way that did not promote or perform abortions. That is the key.
