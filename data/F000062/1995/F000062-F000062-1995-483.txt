 President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Boxer's legislation that is critical to the ports of California. Ports are a vital component of the infrastructure of those States located along the coasts of this country. Commercial cruises are an important contributor to the well-being of our ports, and are critical to the economies of a number of port cities in California.  In 1993, the Johnson Act was amended to allowing gaming on U.S.-flag cruise ships with the provision that States could regulate gambling on intrastate cruises. Since that time, California has passed a law prohibiting gambling on intrastate cruises for reasons that were in fact unrelated to the cruise industry. Because of California's coast line is so long, cruise ships with onboard gaming are unable to make [[Page S394]] more than one port of call in the state without being subject to State regulation.  Consequently, cruise ships bypass cities where they would otherwise stop, with a detrimental impact resulting to those ports that are passed over. The San Diego Port of Port Commissioners estimate that San Diego alone has lost 77 cruise line calls, and $30 million in tourism benefit. Smaller port cities such as Eureka are struggling to attract cruise vessels to bolster its economy, but will likely be bypassed by cruise lines if the lines are limited to one stop within the State.  This legislation in no way promotes the proliferation of gaming cruises. It simply allows interstate cruises with onboard gaming, that would otherwise be allowed to make one stop within a State's borders, to make additional stops within that State as part of a longer voyage.  What this legislation will do is provide an important economic boost to port cities in California, and we urge its quick consideration and passage.                                 ______      By
