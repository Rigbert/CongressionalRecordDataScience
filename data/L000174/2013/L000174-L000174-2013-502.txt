President, the Senator from Nevada is absolutely correct. I would even argue that in some areas it is more important than the Supreme Court because on so many of the issues that go there, they will have the final word. The Supreme Court could never hear all of the requests for appeals from the DC Circuit, and they become the final word.  So on the issues that involve average Americans based on what their government does, they will be decided in that circuit court, not in the Supreme Court. So it is extraordinarily important that we have a balanced court there.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
