Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to explain my motion to instruct conferees on this agricultural appropriations bill, and fundamentally this motion would require the conferees on H.R. 4101, which is the 1999 appropriations bill for agriculture and related agencies, to agree to the language in the Senate bill which provides funding for agricultural disaster assistance, including reserve inventories, and designates that assistance as emergency spending without offsets.  Mr. Speaker, there is a real crisis facing most American farmers and rural communities today, and many have been unduly affected by the drought and other extreme and unusual weather conditions. Some are suffering the impact of crop disease, and others have been impacted by falling farm prices and an increasing inability to obtain credit. While the rest of the country may be experiencing economic recovery, thousands of farm and ranch families and the communities that depend on them have been left behind.  But the current farm crisis is one that will eventually touch every American, rural and urban, if we do not address this problem and this set of circumstances immediately.  The Senate agriculture appropriation bill provides a total of $521 million in emergency spending to begin to assist farmers in addressing this crisis. My motion does not address the adequacy of the funding level. That provision was added in July before the true extent of the summer drought and its impact on crops and livestock could be known. The appropriate funding level is something that we on the Committee on Appropriations will be discussing with the administration, with the authorizing committee and the Members most impacted by this crisis as we move to completion of this appropriations conference.  But my motion does address the designation of the funding provided to assist farmers in crisis as emergency spending, as defined under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, with no offsetting reductions in other areas. This has symmetry with the Senate bill.  I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will argue that the Congress has been offsetting emergency spending since 1994 and that this emergency should be treated no differently than the other supplemental spending bills we have passed. Well, it seems to us that we have found a way to bend these self-imposed rules on offsets in selected emergencies. We have done so in the supplemental appropriation bill passed last year. We offset only domestic emergency spending, not the defense-related emergency spending included in that bill. Surely our Nation's farmers are as deserving of emergency assistance and designation, particularly this year, as have been our military forces in prior years, and the offsets used for the earlier domestic supplemental bills were primarily funds from the HUD section 8 housing program, funding which we will eventually need to pay back in that program to ensure adequate low-income housing for low-income citizens, particularly the elderly who need this program.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue to rob Peter to pay Paul when it comes to addressing funding for natural disasters and other emergencies. It is time to abandon the so-called budget shell games and face our responsibilities and address the real emergencies facing our country today.  Mr. Speaker, this farm emergency is real. Several of my colleagues who are here on the floor have districts more directly impacted by this crisis, and I will be pleased to yield to them so that they can discuss the severity of this crisis and the immediate impact on their constituents. I ask that the House support this motion to instruct conferees and send a message to America's farmers that we recognize the impact of this farm crisis, that we recognize the contributions that farmers and ranchers make to this country's economic success and the well-being of our families and that we are going to act in a responsible way to assure that they get the assistance they need to get beyond this crisis and continue to ensure the productivity of this Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                             General Leave
