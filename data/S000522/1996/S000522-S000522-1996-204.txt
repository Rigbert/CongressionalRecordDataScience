Mr. Speaker, very briefly, we have tried to make this bipartisan. I have had markups in my subcommittee, because much of this is from my subcommittee. We had no-shows at the subcommittee markups. At full committee we had lack of participation, and the same thing happened in the House-Senate conference committee.  The substitute offered by the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton], the Democratic alternative, said exactly what this bill says on the issue of population control, nothing. His bill said it, our bill says it, nothing, so it is not an issue here.  The issue of isolationist is absurd. When you have groups backing provisions of this bill like the United Israel Appeal, the American Jewish Committee, the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and a whole host of other groups, this is not an isolationist bill at all.
