 President, I would call to the attention of the leadership of the majority party that I have a unanimous consent request I wish to make. I am going to be visiting with my colleagues about the issue of taxes on medical devices, so my unanimous consent is in regard to that. I hope people would observe that if there is an effort to block this motion I am going to make, I think it is an endorsement of the tax on medical devices such as the Berlin heart and hundreds of others that children across this country rely on.  With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment in order to offer my motion to commit.
