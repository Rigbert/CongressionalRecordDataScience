President, pending before the U.S. Senate is the nomination of Judge Sam Alito from the Third Circuit to the U.S. Supreme Court. As I mentioned earlier in the day, it is a historic moment seldom seen on the floor of the Senate when we discuss the possible elevation of an individual to a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land.  The Supreme Court is the last refuge for America's rights and freedoms. It is an important institution for our values and our future. That is why during the course of the day many Members of the Senate have come to the floor to express their feelings about Judge Alito. It is largely broken down on partisan lines. Those on the other side of the aisle--the Republican side--are virtually all in support of Judge Alito. Most on the Democratic side oppose him.  I have listened to what many of the Republican Senators who have come to the floor have said. Almost every Republican Senator who has come to the floor today has made the argument that we should all vote for Judge Alito because in 1993, some 13 years ago, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Supreme Court nominee of President Clinton, was confirmed overwhelmingly by the Senate. That appears to be talking point No. 1 that the White House generated not only in conversation today on the floor, but also at the hearing concluded recently in the Senate Judiciary Committee. There are some fundamental flaws in their reasoning and I will point out three:  First, as I mentioned this morning, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose vacancy is being filled, has been the fifth and decisive vote on many issues central to our democracy. The Justice who takes her place is truly in the position to tip the scales of justice in America. In the last 10 years, 193 cases have been decided in the Supreme Court by the closest of votes, 5 to 4; and of the 193 cases, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has been the deciding vote in 148; 77 percent of these closely divided decisions were decided by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Now, the Justice whom Ruth Bader Ginsburg replaced in 1993, Byron White, didn't play the same pivotal role Justice O'Connor has played as the decisive vote on so many important issues.  Second, President Clinton selected Justice Ginsburg after a real, authentic consultation with Republicans in the Senate. This morning, I saw Senator Hatch early in the day and I said his book sales must be up because everybody is quoting him. It is a book he wrote entitled ``Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen Senator.'' In that book, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah described how in 1993, as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, he received a telephone call from President Clinton to discuss possible Supreme Court nominees. Senator Hatch recounted in his book--and still stands by it--that he warned President Clinton away from a nominee whose confirmation Senator Hatch believed ``would not be easy,'' in his words. He wrote in his book that he suggested the names of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom President Clinton had never heard of, according to Senator Hatch, and Stephen Breyer. Senator Hatch wrote that he assured President Clinton that Ginsburg and Breyer ``would be confirmed easily.''  What a contrast to the situation we face today. President Bush sends the names of nominees to the Senate without previous consultation. In fact, I may be mistaken on this particular nominee, Judge Alito, but I do recall Senator Specter saying he learned of Harriet Miers' nomination when the news media announced it--or only shortly before. I think he said he was called within an hour or so before the news announcement. That is much different than the consultation that took place with Senator Hatch and President Clinton, where President Clinton went to the ranking Republican--not even the Chair at that moment--and asked him for advice and consultation on the next Supreme Court nomination.  Judge Alito was nominated not as a product of bipartisan consultation with the Senate but, rather, as a payoff--or at least a satisfaction to the radical right who had turned their back on Harriet Miers' nomination.  There is another crucial difference between Judge Alito and Judge Ginsburg. Despite some Republican Senators' efforts to rewrite history, Judge Ginsburg was viewed at the time of her nomination as a moderate and centrist judge based on her dozen years of service on the Federal bench. In a National Public Radio news story dated June 18, 1993, a reporter named Nina Totenberg said as follows:       Why did the Republicans feel so comfortable with Judge      Ginsburg? The answer is that her judicial record shows her to      be the most conservative Carter-appointed judge on the U.S.      Court of Appeals here in the District of Columbia.  She's considered a centrist, a swing vote. And in fact, a statistical analysis done in 1987 of that Court's voting pattern shows Judge Ginsburg voting substantially more often with the court's conservative Republican bloc of judges, led by then-Judge Robert Bork, than with the liberal Democrat judges.  Judge Alito, by contrast, has never been called a centrist judge. At least those who looked at his record have not called him that. He is not a judge who votes more often with his Democratic colleagues than his Republican colleagues. Far from it. Judge Alito is a staunch conservative and the most frequent dissenter on his court. When he dissents, it is almost always in a rightward and more conservative direction.  I spoke earlier about Judge Alito's track record on civil rights. I talked about some of the cases in which he showed a particular insensitivity to those who came before his court without the trappings of power. In fact, Judge Alito, in many of those cases, was the sole dissenting judge. Because Justice O'Connor was the fifth and deciding vote on so many cases involving civil rights and racial justice, Judge Alito will tip the scales of justice on those issues if he is confirmed.  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of January 6, 2006, from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights that has been submitted in opposition to the nomination of Judge Alito, signed by Dr. Dorothy Height, chairperson, and Wade Henderson, executive director.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             Leadership Conference                                              on Civil Rights,                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 2006.     Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman,     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member,     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf      of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), the      nation's oldest, largest, and most diverse civil and human      rights coalition, we write to express our opposition to the      confirmation of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. as Associate      Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The      Supreme Court's jurisprudence over the past 50 years has      often served to protect the fundamental constitutional rights      of all Americans. Judge Alito's decisions, however, often      stand in direct contrast to that jurisprudence and embrace a      much more limited and narrow view of constitutional rights      and civil rights guarantees. A careful examination of Judge      Alito's record reveals a history of troubling decisions in      the areas of civil rights, civil liberties, and fundamental      freedoms, decisions that undermine the power of the      Constitution and of Congress to, protect the civil and human      rights of all Americans. LCCR believes that Judge Alito's      record does not demonstrate an adequate commitment to      protecting fundamental rights and, therefore, urges the      Senate to reject his nomination.       The Supreme Court is the final arbiter of our laws, and its      rulings can drastically impact the lives, liberties, and      rights of all Americans. As such, LCCR believes that no      individual should be confirmed to the Supreme Court unless he      or she has clearly shown a strong commitment to the      protection of civil rights and liberties, human rights,      privacy, and religious freedom. The evidence reviewed to date      shows that Judge Alito's record in these areas is highly      troubling. His overall record reveals a jurist whose views      are clearly to the right of where most Americans stand on a      number of issues, including the reach of civil rights laws,      the constitutional safeguards afforded those within our      criminal justice system, and the power of Congress to protect      Americans in the workplace and elsewhere.       In addition, LCCR is very troubled by the statements Judge      Alito made in his 1985 application to be the Reagan      administration's Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the      Office of Legal Counsel. In particular, Judge Alito cited his      disagreement with key rulings by the Supreme Court on      legislative reapportionment, criminal justice and religious      liberties, and added that he was ``particularly proud'' of      his work to restrict affirmative action and limit remedies in      racial discrimination cases. Although he now claims that      these were just mere words on an application, his record as a      jurist reveals something different. The ideological views      taken in the application and during his time in the Reagan      administration are exemplified throughout his judicial      decision making, where he routinely favors a reading of      statutory and constitutional law that limits the rights of      individuals and the power of Congress to protect those      individuals. The following is a summary of the reasons for      LCCR's opposition:     Judge Alito's ``Disagreement'' with Supreme Court Rulings on                             Reapportionment       In an essay attached to a 1985 application for a position      within the Department of Justice, Judge Alito wrote that he      had been motivated by his opposition to, among other things,      the Warren Court's rulings on legislative reapportionment.      Because those rulings first articulated the fundamental civil      rights principle of ``one person, one vote,'' and paved the      way for major strides in the effort to secure equal voting      rights for all Americans, his stated opposition to them is      extremely troubling. It is vital to understand the context in      which these cases were decided.       Prior to the 1960s, as urban areas throughout the country      experienced rapid population growth, many state and federal      legislative districts were not redrawn, often leaving rural      voters with far more representation per capita--and thus far      more political power--than urban residents. In Florida, for      example, just 12 percent of the population could elect a      majority of the state senate. While unequal districts      affected all voters, their impact was especially harsh in the      South, where, along with discriminatory requirements like      poll taxes and literacy tests, malapportionment virtually      guaranteed the exclusion of racial minorities from the      democratic process. Until 1962, the federal courts generally      refused to intervene, dismissing such matters as ``political      questions.''       The Supreme Court's ruling in Baker v. Carr broke new      ground when the Court declared, for the first time, that the      federal courts had a role to play in making sure that all      Americans have a constitutional right to equal      representation. In Wesberry v. Sanders, the Court examined      Congressional districts in the State of Georgia, which had      drawn its legislative map so that 823,680 people in the      Atlanta are were all represented by one Congressman, while a      rural Congressman represented only 272,154 people. The Court      held that these disparities violated the Equal Protection      Clause of the 14th Amendment, and ordered that the districts      be redrawn more evenly. In Reynolds v. Sims, the Court      applied the principle of ``one person, one vote'' to state      legislatures, which, in many cases, had even more drastic      malapportionment than Congressional districts. For example,      the Reynolds case itself challenged Alabama's legislative      districts, in which one county with more than 600,000 people      had only one senator, while another county with only 15,417      people also had its own senator.       In articulating the concept of ``one person, one vote,''      the so-called ``Reapportionment Revolution'' cases equalized      political power between urban and rural voters, and ensured      that every citizen would have an equal voice in the      legislative process. Along with the passage of the Voting      Rights Act of 1965 and its subsequent amendments, the      decisions also paved the way to far greater representation of      racial and ethnic minorities, at both the state and federal      levels of government. They also helped open the door for      legal challenges to the ``at-large'' and ``multi-      member'' districts that many Southern states established      in an effort to circumvent the Baker rulings and continue      excluding African-American voters from the political      process.       The Warren Court decisions that established the      constitutional principle of ``one person, one vote'' were a      catalyst for tremendous progress in our nation's efforts to      secure equal voting rights for all Americans, and quickly      became so accepted as a matter of constitutional law that      they could fairly be described as ``superprecedent.'' Yet two      decades later, long after most of the nation had come to      embrace this progress, Judge Alito still boasted of his      opposition to it. The fact that he would use his opposition      as a ``selling tactic'' for a job in 1985 is disconcerting,      and raises suspicions about his overall legal philosophy that      deserve extensive scrutiny. Judge Alito's Narrow Reading of Anti-Discrimination and Other Worker                             Protection Laws       Judge Alito's record also raises concerns about whether he      would be a strong enforcer of our nation's civil rights and      labor laws. His decisions thus far in such cases show a      pattern of narrow interpretations of the laws, placing      greater burdens on civil rights plaintiffs to prove      discrimination and making it harder for the government to      protect workers.       In a number of cases involving race, gender, disability,      and age discrimination, Judge Alito was clearly to the right      of his colleagues on the Third Circuit. In Bray v. Mariott      Hotels, for example, the Third Circuit ruled that an African-     American plaintiff who had been denied a promotion had shown      that racial discrimination might have been a factor, and that      she was therefore entitled to take her case to trial. But      Judge Alito dissented, writing an opinion that prompted the      majority to charge that ``Title VII would be eviscerated if      our analysis were to halt where the dissent suggests.'' In      Sheridan v. E.I DuPont de Nemours and Co., a gender      discrimination plaintiff sued after being denied a promotion.      A jury ruled in her favor, but the trial judge threw out the      verdict. The Third Circuit found that she had presented      enough evidence to persuade the jury that discrimination was      a factor, but Judge Alito was the lone dissenter in the en      banc decision. Judge Alito acknowledged that additional      evidence of discrimination, beyond proof that an employer's      explanation for an adverse decision was pretextual, should      not usually be required for a plaintiff to get to a jury, but      he maintained that summary judgment might still be      appropriate in some cases. The result Judge Alito would have      reached in the Sheridan case, however--reversing a jury      finding of sex discrimination that every other judge on the      Third Circuit would have upheld--undermines the neutral      standard he articulated. To reach this result, Judge Alito      not only gave the employer the benefit of the doubt but      failed to consider some of the most important evidence      brought by Sheridan. Finally, in Nathanson v. Medical College      of Pennsylvania, a prospective medical student filed suit      under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, claiming that the      school failed to provide accommodations for a back injury.      The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the      school, but a Third Circuit panel reversed on the      Rehabilitation Act claim because there were different factual      assertions that necessitated a jury trial. Judge Alito      dissented, prompting his colleagues to write that under his      standards, ``few if any Rehabilitation Act cases would      survive summary judgment.       Judge Alito's record on anti-discrimination cases becomes      more troubling when considered in light of his record prior      to serving on the Third Circuit. As Assistant to the      Solicitor General during the Reagan administration, Judge      Alito co-authored several amicus curiae briefs that sought to      eliminate affirmative action policies that were put in place      to remedy past discrimination, discrimination which, in one      case, persisted in contravention of at least three court      orders over an eight-year period. In his 1985 application for      a promotion within the Justice Department, Judge Alito later      mischaracterized these cases as involving nothing more than      challenges to ``racial and ethnic quotas.'' Judge Alito's      involvement in the Reagan Justice Department's zealous      campaign to undermine affirmative action remedies suggests      that he adheres to an ideology that goes beyond mere      conservatism on civil rights matters.       In cases involving other worker protections that deal with      such matters as salary,     pensions and job safety, Judge Alito has also demonstrated a      clear and unmistakable tendency to rule narrowly and against      working people. Given a choice between reading a statute      broadly, consistent with Congress' intent to provide workers      with basic protections, or reading a statute in the narrowest      way possible, he again shows a disturbing tendency to come      down against workers. In Reich v. Gateway Press, for example,      Judge Alito dissented from a ruling in which the Third      Circuit found that employees of a group of related community      newspapers were protected by the overtime rules of the Fair      Labor Standards Act. The majority reasoned that while the law      may not have covered each individual newspaper, which were      small in size and circulation, the papers and all employment      decisions were managed by one company and thus amounted to an      ``enterprise'' that was subject to the overtime law. Judge      Alito dissented, however, and would have denied this      coverage, claiming that neither the statute nor the      legislative history could support the majority's conclusion.      In Belcufine v. Aloe, on the other hand, Judge Alito took a      more expansive reading of the law, but in this case it was in      order to benefit corporate officers at the expense of      workers. Belcufine involved a state law that held corporate      officers personally liable for unpaid wages and benefits.      Judge Alito ruled, in a split decision, that the law could no      longer be applicable, as a matter of policy, once a      corporation has filed a bankruptcy petition. The dissenting      opinion pointed out that nothing in the statute in question      ``even remotely can be read to excuse the agents and      officers'' from liability once a company files for      bankruptcy.   Judge Alito's Willingness to Undercut Fundamental Privacy and Due                              Process Rights       In cases involving criminal justice matters such as the      Fourth Amendment, habeas corpus, and the right to effective      assistance of counsel, Judge Alito has shown an excessive      tendency to defer to police and prosecutors. This deference      frequently comes at the expense of the constitutional rights      and civil liberties of individual Americans, and it raises      concerns about whether Judge Alito would help enable      governmental abuses of power.       In Doe v. Groody, Judge Alito argued in dissent that police      officers who conducted strip searches without a warrant could      still be entitled to qualified immunity. The majority      concluded, in a decision authored by Judge Chertoff, that      strip searches of the suspect's wife and ten-year-old      daughter went well beyond the police's warrant to search the      home of a suspected drug dealer, and that the officers were      therefore not entitled to claim qualified immunity as a      defense to a subsequent lawsuit. As Judge Chertoff noted,      holding otherwise would ``transform the judicial officer into      little more than the cliche `rubber stamp.' '' Judge Alito,      in criticizing the majority for what he called a ``technical      and legalistic'' ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, would      have granted authority to the police to decide who could be      searched and therefore, would have given the officers      immunity for invading the privacy rights of the wife and      daughter. In United States v. Lee, Judge Alito upheld the      warrantless video surveillance by the FBI of a suspect's      hotel suite. He justified his ruling on the ground that the      FBI only turned on the surveillance equipment when an      informant was present in the suite and could ``consent'' to      the surveillance, but this ruling disregarded the fact that      the equipment was capable of being used at any time and thus      enabled the FBI to invade the suspect's privacy at any time.      And in Baker v. Monroe Township, a woman and her children      were searched as they were entering premises that were the      subject of a search wacrant. The search warrant specified a      location but there were no names included on the warrant,      which led the majority to conclude that the warrant was      deficient under the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.      Judge Alito dissented, however, arguing that the lack of      particularity in the warrant allowed the officers more leeway      to search anyone on the premises.       Judge Alito's overly deferential attitude toward law      enforcement at the expense of privacy rights was also evident      before his appointment to the Third Circuit. In a 1984      memorandum, Judge Alito--then an attorney with the Justice      Department--opined that the Attorney General and other      government officials should have absolute immunity from civil      liability for wiretapping the phones of Americans without a      warrant. He urged the administration not to pursue such an      argument in a pending Supreme Court case, but only on purely      strategic grounds. The Supreme Court, in Mitchell v. Forsyth,      went on to rule that absolute immunity did not apply in such      situations, rejecting the broad, troubling view expressed in      Judge Alito's memorandum.       Judge Alito's record is equally troubling in other areas of      criminal justice, and shows the same excessive deference to      law enforcement that can open the door to abuses. In another      1984 memorandum, Judge Alito argued in defense of a state law      that had authorized Tennessee police to use deadly force      against any fleeing felon suspect whom police have probable      cause to believe had committed a violent crime or was armed      or dangerous. In the case of Tennessee v. Garner, that law      was invoked after police shot and killed an unarmed, 15-year-     old, 5'4'' burglary suspect while he was climbing a fence.      While Judge Alito did not recommend filing an amicus curiae      brief in support of the police in the case, he still found      the shooting to be constitutionally defensible. When given a      choice between killing a possibly nonviolent suspect and      allowing a possibly violent suspect to escape, Judge Alito      argued that ``[r]easonable people might choose differently      in this situation.'' The Supreme Court disagreed wiih      Alito's farfetched analysis, finding ihe statute      unconstitutional by a 6-3 margin.       Judge Alito's record also reveals a distressing tendency to      deny habeas corpus claims of those in the criminal justice      system. In Rompilla v. Horn, Judge Alito held that in ihe      sentencing phase of a capital murder case, the failure of a      defense attorney to investigate and present mitigating      evidence, including ihe defendant's traumatic childhood,      alcoholism, mental retardation, cognitive impairment and      organic brain damage, did not amount to ineffective      assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment.      His ruling was decried as ``inexplicable'' by the dissent and      was overturned by the Supreme Court, which noted that some of      the mitigating evidence was publicly available in the very      courthouse in which the defendant was tried. Justice O'Connor      concurred in reversing Judge Alito's ruling, describing the      defense attorney's performance as ``unreasonable.'' In      another case, Smith v. Horn, Judge Alito's dissent would have      denied ihe habeas claims of a death row inmate. Judge Alito      concluded that a jury instruction regarding the defendant's      guilt, which the majority found the jury could have      reasonable misunderstood, did not amount to a constitutional      violation.       Finally, the case of Riley v. Taylor shows Judge Alito's      reluctance to question prosecutors even where racism is      alleged in the jury selection process. In that case, Judge      Alito did not find a constitutional violation in the      prosecution's apparent use of peremptory challenges to      exclude black jurors from a death penalty case involving an      African-American defendant. His dissent in the case      illustrated a disregard for ihe impact of racially motivated      peremptory jury strikes on African-American defendants. The      majority had relied, in part, on statistical data to conclude      that black jurors had been excluded, but Judge Alito took      issue with the use of statistics, questioning the exclusion      of black jurors as a statistical oddity and comparing it to      the fact that five of the last six U.S. Presidents had been      left-handed. His comments drew a sharp rebuke from the      majority, who said that ``[t]o suggest any comparability to      the striking of jurors based on their race is to minimize the      history of discrimination against prospective black jurors      and black defendants.           Judge Alito's Troubling Record on Immigration Law       Judge Alito's record in appeals of asylum and deportation      orders reveals an abnormally strong tendency to let adverse      Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and lower court rulings      stand. For example, an analysis by The Washington Post found      that Judge Alito has sided with immigrants in only one out of      every eight cases he has handled, which, according to the      Post, sets him apart even from most Republican-appointed      judges. Judge Alito's record is more problematic in light of      the recently growing criticism, by many other federal      judges from both parties, of asylum rulings by the BIA and      administrative immigration judges.       In asylum cases, Judge Alito has a strong tendency to rule      against individuals who are seeking protection in the United      States, even where evidence shows that they have been or      would have been persecuted in their own countries. In Chang      v. INS, Judge Alito dissented from the court's grant of      asylum for a Chinese engineer who claimed he would face      persecution if returned to his own country. Judge Alito found      no reason to reverse the INS denial of asylum despite the      fact that Chang had presented evidence that his wife and son      already faced persecution and he was threatened with jail if      he returned to China. Similarly, in Dia v. Ashcroft, Judge      Alito dissented from a majority opinion granting asylum to an      immigrant from the Republic of Guinea whose house had been      burnt down and whose wife had been raped in retaliation for      his opposition to the government. The majority noted that the      immigration judge seemed to be searching for ways to deny      asylum and find fault with the credibility of Dia. Judge      Alito's dissent pushed for a higher standard. The majority      criticized Judge Alito's dissent, noting that his proposed      standard would ``gut the statutory standard'' and ``ignore      our precedent.''       Judge Alito's excessive tendency to defer to the BIA is      also evident from his record in deportation cases. In Lee v.      Ashcroft, Judge Alita dissented when the court ruled that a      false tax return is not an ``aggravated felony,'' an      immigration law term that triggers mandatory deportation and      bars most forms of humanitarian waivers. The court reasoned      that Congress only intended for tax evasion to trigger      mandatory deportation, but Judge Alito disagreed and pushed      for a more expansive reading of the law. The majority noted      that ambiguity in the law should be resolved in favor of the      immigrant and that Judge Alita's interpretation was grounded      in ``speculation.'' In Sandoval v. Reno, Judge Alito's      dissent would have construed the Antiterrorism and Effective      Death Penalty Act of 1996 to strip the federal courts of      their ability to hear habeas corpus claims from aliens in      custody challenging deportation orders. The Supreme Court      ultimately rejected     Judge Alita's reading of the law, in INS v. St. Cyr, because      such an interpretation would raise serious constitutional      questions.       Also troubling is a 1986 letter Judge Alito wrote, in his      capacity as Deputy Assistant Attorney General, to former FBI      Director William Webster in which he suggested, inter alia,      that ``illegal aliens have no claim to nondiscrimination with      respect to nonfundamental rights,'' and that the Constitution      ``grants only fundamental rights to illegal aliens within the      United States.'' Judge Alito uses a strained reading of the      1976 Supreme Court ruling in Mathews v. Diaz to support this      assertion, but oddly, he makes no mention of the 1982 ruling      in Plyler v. Doe, which squarely ruled that a state could not      discriminate against undocumented children in public      education, even though education is not considered a      fundamental constitutional right. As such, Judge Alito's      letter raises questions about whether he would be willing to      adequately protect undocumented immigrants from      unconstitutional forms of discrimination.       Judge Alito's Restrictive View of the Establishment Clause       Judge Alito's record shows that he takes an overly narrow      view of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, a view      that sets him apart from Justice O'Connor and the majority of      her colleagues to serve on the Supreme Court. His record--     along with his acknowledged disagreement with the Supreme      Court's most noteworthy rulings in this area--raises concerns      that he would not do enough to protect the religious      liberties of an increasingly diverse America.       For example, in ACLU of New Jersey v. Black Horse Pike      Regional Board of Education, Judge Alito voted--against an en      banc majority of his colleagues on the Third Circuit--to      uphold a public school policy that allowed high school      seniors to vote on whether to include prayer during a      graduation ceremony. By allowing a popular majority of public      school students to waive the rights of a minority, Judge      Alito's view--had it not also been subsequently rejected by      the Supreme Court in a later case--would have essentially      defeated the purpose of the Establishment Clause.       Judge Alito's ruling in ACLU of New Jersey v. Schundler      (Schundler II) is equally troubling. In Schundler, the      municipality of Jersey City, New Jersey had placed a creche      and menorah outside of City Hall. After a district court      ruled that the display violated the Establishment Clause, the      city added additional figures to the following year's      display, including those of Santa Claus, Frosty the Snowman,      a red sled, and Kwanzaa symbols. The district court      eventually found that this modified display was also      unconstitutional. Judge Alito reversed this decision,      however, and upheld the modified display. In doing so, he      minimized the fact that the display had only been modified in      response to litigation and that the city had been attempting      to promote religion through its holiday displays for      decades--even though the Supreme Court considers such history      to be highly relevant when determining whether a practice or      policy violates the Establishment Clause.  Judge Alito's Efforts to Limit Congressional Authority in Favor of                            ``States' Rights''       Judge Alito's record demonstrates a troubling tendency to      favor ``states' rights'' over the rights of ordinary      Americans. During his tenure on the Third Circuit, he has      engaged in an excessively narrow reading of the Commerce      Clause and an excessively broad reading of state sovereign      immunity under the 11th Amendment. In fact, his decisions      show that he would go even further than the current Supreme      Court in undercutting Congress' ability to protect Americans.       In United States v. Rybar, the Third Circuit upheld the      conviction of a firearms dealer for the sale of outlawed      machine guns, joining six other circuits in finding the      federal law banning the transfer or possession of machine      guns to be a valid exercise of Congressional authority under      its power to regulate interstate commerce. But Judge Alito      dissented, arguing that the Supreme Court's recent decision      in United States v. Lopez, which invalidated Congress' gun-     free school zone ban, made clear that Congress did not have      such power. The majority distinguished Lopez because it dealt      with a small geographic area--school zones--whereas the law      at issue in Rybar applied nationwide. Judge Alito would have      taken Lopez a step beyond to place further restrictions on      Congress' power to use its Commerce Clause authority to      protect Americans from machine gun violence. Judge Alito's      extraordinarily narrow perspective of Congressional power      expressed in his Rybar dissent raises serious concerns about      whether he will uphold major and historically effective      pieces of civil rights infrastructure such as the ban on      discrimination in places of employment or public      accommodation in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and whether he      will hold a restrictive view of Congress' power to move the      country forward with additional civil rights laws such as      hate crimes and non-discrimination legislation.       In Chittister v. Department of Community and Economic      Development, Judge Alito's majority opinion would have denied      a state employee the benefits of the Family and Medical Leave      Act of 1993 (``FMLA''). In this case, a state employee had      sued after being fired for taking medical leave that had been      approved pursuant to FMLA. A jury ruled in Chittister's      favor, but the trial court reversed the verdict on the ground      that the state was immune from suit under the 11th Amendment.      On appeal, Judge Alito affirmed the ruling, claiming that      Congress had not abrogated state sovereign immunity. The      Supreme Court later reached an opposite conclusion from Judge      Alito's holding in its 2003 decision in Nevada Department of      Human Resources v. Hibbs. The Court held that state employees      could in fact sue their employers under the FMLA, a decision      that has subsequently been read by some courts to validate      the constitutionality of the entire law.     judge alito's membership in ``concerned alumni of princeton''       In the same job application essay described above, Judge      Alito also stated that he was ``a member of the Concerned      Alumni of Princeton University. a conservative alumni group''      (``CAP''). Throughout its existence, CAP was notorious for      its outspoken, inflammatory rhetoric opposing Princeton's      decision to enroll female students. Indeed, CAP reportedly      advocated limiting the percentage of women admitted to the      school. CAP also derided Princeton's efforts to increase the      number of minority students; the group argued that children      of alumni were more deserving of admission. In the group's      magazine, Prospect, one of the organization's founders fondly      recalled that Princeton had once been ``a body of men,      relatively homogenous in interests and backgrounds,'' but      that he now worried about the future of the University ``with      an undergraduate student body of approximately 40% women and      minorities, such as the Administration has proposed.'' In      1975. an alumni panel reviewed admission issues and condemned      CAP's characterization of Princeton's policies. The panel,      which included current Senate Majority leader Bill Frist,      determined that CAP ``presented a distorted, narrow and      hostile view of the university that cannot help but have      misinformed and even alarmed many alumni.'' It is unclear      when Judge Alito joined the group or what role he played in      its activities. But his membership in the organization is      troubling, given the group's outspoken hostility towards the      inclusion of women and minorities at Princeton University,      and it raises serious questions about the level of his      commitment to gender and racial equality.       Also troubling is Judge Alito's current effort, following      his nomination to the Supreme Court, to now deny he ever had      any affiliation with the group. In a questionnaire he      recently submitted to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,      Judge Alito stated that ``[a] document I recently reviewed      reflects that I was a member of the group [Concerned Alumni      of Princeton] in the 1980s. Apart from that document, I have      no recollection of being a member, of attending meetings, or      otherwise participating in the activities of the group.''      This supposed lack of any recollection of being a member of      CAP seems difficult, at best, to reconcile with the statement      he made in his 1985 job application essay--a statement in      which he not only cited his membership in CAP, but      deliberately used this claim of membership in an effort to      bolster his conservative credentials.                               Conclusion       The stakes could not be higher. The Supreme Court is      closely divided on cases involving many of our most basic      rights and freedoms. Judge Alito has been nominated to fill      the seat of retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was the      crucial deciding vote in so many of those cases. The American      people want and deserve to know that any new Supreme Court      justice will be committed to protecting individual rights,      and will put our freedoms ahead of any political agenda.      Unfortunately, Judge Alito's record not only fails to show      such a commitment, but also raises serious doubts.       In addition, we also have doubts about whether Judge Alito      will, at his confirmation hearings, address the above      concerns in a fully open and candid manner. For instance,      Judge Alito has given numerous shifting and conflicting      reasons for why he did not, as he promised to Senators before      being confirmed to the Third Circuit, recuse himself from      cases involving the Vanguard companies, in which he had      financial holdings. Furthermore, Judge Alito has also      recently tried to dismiss a number of troubling statements in      his 1985 job application, such as his disagreement with the      Warren Court's reapportionment cases, by suggesting that his      statements should not be taken seriously because he was      simply applying for a job. Finally, as discussed above, Judge      Alito has also attempted to deny any affiliation with the      radical group Concerned Alumni of Princeton, even though he      himself proudly claimed to be a member in 1985. These      incidents raise doubts about whether Judge Alito's responses      to tough questions about his record and his legal philosophy      can be completely believed when his confirmation hearings      begin next week.       For the above reasons, we must oppose his confirmation as      Associate Justice. We appreciate your consideration of our      views.
