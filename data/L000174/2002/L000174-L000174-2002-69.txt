President, today marks the 15-month anniversary of the reorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee following the change in the Senate majority last summer. This week also became another milestone as the Judiciary Committee voted on the 100th judicial nominee of President George W. Bush. This historic demonstration of bipartisanship toward this President's judicial nominees has been overshadowed by partisan attacks in this very chamber and in the press.  I have worked diligently along with the other Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee to hold a record number of hearings for this President's district and circuit court nominees during the past 15 months and to bring as many as we could to a vote this year. Given all of the competing responsibilities of the committee and the Senate in these times of great challenges to our Nation, hearings for 103 judicial nominees, voting on 100, and favorably reporting 98 is a record of which the Judiciary Committee and the Senate can be proud. We have transcended the relative inaction of the prior 6\1/2\ years of Republican control by moving forward on judicial nominees twice as quickly as our predecessors did. Indeed, the Senate has already confirmed more judicial nominees in 15 months than the Republican-controlled Senate did during its last 30 months. More achieved, and in half the time.  The raw numbers, not percentages, reveal the true workload of the Senate on nominations and everyone knows that. Anyone who pays attention to the federal judiciary and who does not have a partisan agenda must know that. In addition, Democrats have moved more quickly in voting on judicial nominees of a President of a different party than in any time in recent history. Led by Majority Leader Daschle, the Democratic majority in the Senate has confirmed 80 judicial nominees, including 14 circuit court nominees, for a President of a different party, in just 15 months since the reorganization of the Judiciary Committee. In comparison,in the first two full years of President George H.W. Bush's administration, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed 71 judicial nominees. In fact, during the first 15 months of the first Bush Administration, only 23 judges were confirmed, with eight to the circuit courts. Our confirmation of 80 of President George W. Bush's judicial nominees in just 15 months is historic progress for a President and a Senate led by different parties.  Apparently, however, Republicans believe that there is partisan hay to be harvested in complaining that every single judicial nominee has not yet been confirmed. The fact is that we have proceeded with hearings for 103 of the 110 judicial nominees eligible for hearings 94 percent, for those focused on percentages. The other 17 judicial nominees who have not participated in a hearing either lack home-state consent or peer reviews or both. Thus, when partisans harp on the nominations of Terrence Boyle and Carolyn Kuhl and other nominees without home-State Senator support, they know they are being misleading. Senator Hatch never proceeded on a nomination without home-State Senator support and acknowledges that this is the Senate's tradition. At least six of the President's circuit court nominees fall into this category and, for many if not all of them, the White House knew about the lack of home-State Senator support before the nominations were made.  The committee has voted on 100 of the 103 judicial nominees eligible for votes--97 percent. Of those voted upon, 98--98 percent have been reported favorably to the Senate. In addition to the 80 judges already confirmed, another 18 approved by the Judiciary Committee await Senate action on the Senate Executive Calendar.  It is disappointing that the Republican leader and others are reported to have said that they will not be allowed Senate votes before we adjourn. Earlier this year the majority leader had to work through a problem caused by the administration's failure to work with Senators on executive branch appointments. The majority leader was required by Republican objection to invoke cloture in order to vote on President Bush's judicial nominations. Whether there is time left in this session to overcome Republican objections to action on the roster of President Bush's judicial nominations currently on the calendar is problematic.  To date, and unlike the recent past, every judicial nominee who participated in a hearing has been considered and voted upon by the Judiciary Committee but for the three controversial circuit court nominees we continue to consider.  I know that Senator Thurmond is very disappointed that we could not bring his choice for the Fourth Circuit to a vote this week. I regret that he is upset. The nomination of his former aide for a promotion to the Court of Appeals has grown more controversial. On our committee, as on all committees, controversy takes a toll in the time needed for action on a bill or on a nomination. Members of the committee need time to fully evaluate the merits of concerns about this nomination raised by hundreds if not thousands of citizens from throughout the Fourth Circuit and the Nation. In accordance with our responsibilities under the Constitution to evaluate these nominations for lifetime appointments, the members of the committee continue to work diligently on simultaneously evaluating three controversial circuit court nominations.  As much as I personally would have liked to resolve this nomination by now at the request of the distinguished Senior Senator from South Carolina, and as hard as I have worked to resolve the problems with it, we were not able to vote on it this week. I worked hard to try to move the nomination of his former aide forward to a vote up or down but, with war resolutions pending before the Senate and limited time for debate this Tuesday, I had to make a difficult decision. Seventeen relatively noncontroversial judicial nominations were ready for committee votes this week. I decided to try to bring some relief to 17 vacant seats in district courts across our country rather than begin what promised to be a lengthy and inconclusive debate about Judge Shedd's record as a Federal district court judge and whether he should be elevated. That was a tough decision for me, personally, but the rising tide of citizen distress over the Shedd nomination made bringing that vote to a conclusion an impossibility this week.  Republican efforts to gain some political advantage for this difficult situation are especially unfounded given the stark contrast between what we have achieved in the past 15 months compared with the most recent period of Republican control of the committee. In the 15 months before the reorganization of the Judiciary Committee after the shift in Senate majority, the Senate confirmed only 32 judicial nominees, including three to the circuits. Under Democratic leadership, we have already confirmed 80, including 14 to the circuit courts, in just 15 months. Even if we compare our record with a period of Republican control that is twice as long--the last 30 months of Republican control--our predecessors confirmed only 72 judges, while in half the time, we have confirmed 80. Alternatively, if we go back and compare the Republicans' first 15 months of Senate control in 1995 and 1996, we have accomplished far more: more hearings, 26 versus 14, for more judicial nominees, 103 versus 67, with more committee votes, 100 versus 61, for more confirmations, 80 versus 56. We have reached the century mark for committee votes in less than half the time, 15 months, while it took our predecessors 33 months to vote on 100 judicial nominees.  In another departure from the past, we have had hearings even for several controversial judicial nominees and brought them to votes this year. Most were voted out of committee despite their controversy. Given the number of vacancies that we inherited--110--concentrating on the most controversial, time-consuming nominations would have been to the detriment of the courts. The President has made a number of divisive choices--divisive to the American people and divisive to the Senate--for these lifetime seats on the courts, and they take more time to bring to hearings and votes. None of these nominees, however, have waited as long for hearings or votes as did some of President Clinton's judicial nominees, such as Judge Richard Paez, who waited 1,500 days to be confirmed and 1,237 days to get a final vote by the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, or Judge Helene White, whose nomination languished for more than 1,500 days without ever getting a hearing or a committee vote.  As frustrated as Democrats were with the lengthy delays and obstruction of scores of judicial nominees in the prior 6\1/2\ years of Republican control, we never attacked the Chairman of the Committee in the manner Republicans chose this week. Similarly, as disappointed as Democrats were with the refusal of Chairman Hatch to include Allen Snyder, Bonnie Campbell, Clarence Sundram, Fred Woocher and other nominees on an agenda for a vote by the committee for months following their hearings, we never resorted to the tactics and tone used by Republicans in committee statements, in hallway discussions, in press conferences or in Senate floor debate. We never tried to override the chairman's prerogative to set the agenda for consideration of judicial nominees by trying to manipulate the committee's cloture rule. We did not try to use the committee rule to hold off consideration of an agenda item for at least a week to force either legislation or nominations to be voted on in one week's time. During Republican rule, even some uncontroversial nominees like Judge Kim Wardlaw were held over more than once. We also never sought to invoke Senate Rule 26.3 to make an end-run around Chairman Hatch--even when weeks and months passed without a single nominee on the agenda or when nominees who had hearings went for months without being placed on the agenda. As frustrated and disappointed as we were that the Republican majority refused to proceed with hearings or votes on scores of judicial nominees, we never sought to override Senator Hatch's judgments and authority as chairman of the committee.  Some in the other party have spared no efforts in making judicial nominations into a partisan, political issue, all the while refusing to acknowledge the progress made in these past 15 months when 100 of President Bush's judicial choices have had committeevotes. We have perhaps moved too quickly on some, relaxing past standards, being more expeditious and generous than Republicans were to a Democratic President's nominees, and trying to take some of them at their word that they will follow the law and the ethical rules for judges.  Just last week, on October 2, 2002, we confirmed Ron Clark to an emergency vacancy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Two other judicial nominees, Larry Block and Judge James Gardner, were confirmed the very same day. The commissions for Judge Block and Judge Gardner were signed by the President on October 3, but the judge for the emergency vacancy in the President's home state was not. Just this week we learned that Mr. Clark was quoted as saying that he asked the White House to delay signing his commission while he runs as a Republican candidate for re-election to a seat in the Texas legislature. The White House apparently has been complicit in these unseemly political actions by a person confirmed to the federal bench. Mr. Clark, who the Senate has confirmed to a seat on the Federal district court in Texas, has been actively campaigning for election despite his confirmation.  These actions call into question Mr. Clark's ability to put aside his partisan roots and be an impartial adjudicator of cases. In his answers under oath to the committee, he swore that if he were ``confirmed'' he would follow the ethical rules. Canon 1 of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges explicitly provides that the Code applies to ``judges and nominees for judicial office,'' and Canon 7 provides quite clearly that partisan political activity is contrary to ethical rules. In his answers to me, Mr. Clark promised: ``[s]hould I be confirmed as a judge, my role will be different than that of a legislator.'' Yet now that he is confirmed, he has been flaunting his written statements to me personally and to the Senate Judiciary Committee and, by proxy, to the Senate as a whole. That the White House would go along with these partisan ploys reveals much about the political way this administration approaches judicial nominations.  Senators Kennedy and Schumer have written a letter of complaint to the Fifth Circuit Judicial Council, which has jurisdiction over ethical complaints arising in that jurisdiction. I ask unanimous consent that the letter and a newspaper report of the Clark scandal be included in the Record. Tonight, only after this scandal came to the Nation's attention in today's news account in the New York Times, the President has apparently signed Mr. Clark's commission.  With a White House that is politicizing the Federal courts and making so many nominations, especially to the circuit courts, to appease the far-right wing of the Republican Party, it would be irresponsible for us to simply rubber-stamp these nominations for lifetime appointments to our independent Federal judiciary. Advice and consent does not mean giving any President carte blanche to pack the courts with ideologues from the right or the left.  I have worked hard to bring to a vote an overwhelming majority of this President's judicial nominees, but we cannot afford to make errors in these lifetime appointments out of haste or sentimental considerations, however well intentioned. To help smooth the confirmation process, I have gone out of my way to encourage the White House to work in a bipartisan way with the Senate, as past Presidents have, but, in all too many instances, the White House has chosen to bypass bipartisan cooperation in favor of partisanship.  The American people expect the federal courts to be fair forums and not bastions of favoritism on the right or the left. These are the only lifetime appointments in our whole system of government, and they matter a great deal to the future of each and every American. I will continue to work hard to ensure the independence of our Federal judiciary.                                                  U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2002.     The Hon. Carolyn Dineen King,     Chief Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, New          Orleans, LA.       Dear Chief Judge King: We write to raise an ethics issue      regarding Ronald W. Clark, who was nominated by President      Bush on January 24 and confirmed by the Senate on October 2,      to be a judge on the U.S. District court for the Eastern      District of Texas, but whose commission has not yet been      signed by the President.       It has come to our attention Mr. Clark continues to hold      his seat in the Texas state legislature and continues to      campaign for re-election to that seat. Although Mr. Clark      does not officially become a federal judge until he takes the      oath of office, his continuing campaign activities appear to      be in clear violation of Code of Conduct for Untied States      Judges. The commentary to Code of Conduct makes clear that      the Canons of Ethics define judicial nominees as judges and      bind them to the same ethical rules. Canon 7 of the Code      states that ``a judge should refrain from political      activity'' and should not ``act as a leader or hold any      office in a political organization; make speeches for a      political organization, or candidate or publicly endorse or      oppose a candidate for public office; [or] solicit funds.''      Canon 7 goes on to state that a judge ``should not engage in      any other political activity.''       Traditionally, this provision has been construed to have      limited application to nominees. Because of the contingent      nature of the Senate confirmation process, it would be unfair      to require nominees to resign from elective office merely      upon being nominated. But once the President's nominees are      confirmed by the Senate, the process loses its uncertainty.      The only step between nominee and judge is a ministerial act      that should be completed promptly, and not delayed for      partisan or political reasons.       Despite the clear applicability of the Code of Conduct, Mr.      Clark continues to be a candidate for re-election to the      Texas House of Representatives. This matter is of grave      concern to us. As Members of the United States Senate      Judiciary Committee, we take our Constitutional confirmation      responsibilities seriously. Mr. Clark's continued candidacy      appears to be a flagrant violation of the judicial code of      conduct, which is deeply troubling. Judges should be paragons      of ethics, and Mr. Clark's actions do not set a sterling      standard at the outset of his judicial career.       According to the Code of Conduct, complaints of ethical      misconduct may be lodged with the Circuit council, which we      understand you chair. We would appreciate your prompt      consideration of this inquiry, and we look forward to hearing      from you in the near future.           Sincerely,     Charles E. Schumer,       U.S. Senator.     Edward M. Kennedy,       U.S. Senator.                                  ____  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Oct. 10, 2002]               Bush Acting To Forestall an Issue in Texas                           (By Neil A. Lewis)       Washington, Oct. 9.--The White House moved quickly tonight      to quash a politically embarrassing problem with one of      President Bush's nominees to a federal court seat.       Although the nominee, Ron Clark, was confirmed by the      Senate earlier this month to be a federal district judge      based in Texas, he was out campaigning today for re-election      as a state representative from his district north of Dallas.      Mr. Clark had said he might want to delay taking his seat on      the bench to serve one more term in the State Legislature,      where his vote might be crucial to Republicans winning the      speakership.       Two Democratic Senators, Charles E. Schumer of New York and      Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, complained about Mr.      Clark's actions today, saying they were a blatant violation      of judicial ethics, a view with which some legal scholars      agreed. The senators wrote to Carolyn D. King, the chief      judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth      Circuit based in New Orleans, asking her to evaluate whether      Mr. Clark had violated the judicial canons of ethics even      before he had put on his robe.       By evening, the White House intervened, saying President      Bush would soon sign the formal commission for Mr. Clark, the      last step in making him a federal judge.       In an interview earlier today, Mr. Clark said he was just      playing it safe.       ``If the president signs the certificate then, I'll move      forward,'' he said before going out to a campaign appearance      in which he presented a flag to some cub scouts. He said he      had no control over Mr. Bush's actions and ``right now, I'm      running for state representative.''       Mr. Clark said he had been trapped by circumstances because      he was confirmed on Oct. 2 and the last date for withdrawing      from the ballot under Texas law was Sept. 3. ``There is no      legal way to take it off, so I'm in the race, until Election      Day,'' he said. Asked if he intended to keep campaigning for      re-election, he said: ``Oh, yes, I go to functions, go block      walking, that sort of thing.''       Mr. Clark has asserted that he did not know why Mr. Bush      had not yet acted, yet he was quoted in this week in Texas      Weekly, a political journal, as saying he had asked the White      House to delay signing his commission so he could serve      another legislative term. Ross Ramsey, the journal's editor,      who wrote the article, said Mr. Clark had told him he would      be interested in serving through May, when the 20-week      session is expected to end.       In his article, Mr. Ramsey said Mr. Clark's presence in the      Legislature when it convenes     in January might be crucial to Republican hopes to retain the      speakership in what is expected to be a close race.       Senators Schumer and Kennedy, both of whom serve on the      Judiciary committee, said in their letter that Mr. Clark's      legislative campaign ``appears to be in clear violation of      the Code of Conduct for United States Judges.'' The canons      mandate that ``a judge refrain from political activity.''       Steven Gillers, the vice dean of the New York University      Law School and an authority on ethics, said that provisions      in both the federal and state codes of conduct mandated that      Mr. Clark resign his political office. The Texas code, he      said, makes it clear that a candidate for a judicial office      has to behave as a judge in avoiding politics. The federal      rules require a judge to resign from office when he or she      becomes a candidate for political office.       ``While a person seeking a judgeship may have an argument      that he not give up a political office, this man is, for all      intents and purposes, a judge,'' Mr. Gillers said.       Erwin Chemerinsky, a visiting law professor at Duke      University, said Mr. Clark seemed to be using the formality      of Mr. Bush's signature to avoid his obligations.       ``But judicial ethics is all about removing judges from      politics,'' Mr. Chemerinsky said, and given that Mr. Bush is      the president who appointed him, Mr. Clark should not run for      office.       Senate Republicans and President Bush have said that there      is an urgent need to fill federal judgeships and that action      is being blocked by the Democrats who have opposed several of      the president's nominees.       In fact, today, at a White House celebration of Hispanic      Heritage Month, Mr. Bush criticized the Senate's handling of      his nomination of Miguel Estrada to a seat on the United      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.       ``There are senators who are playing politics with this      good man's nomination,'' the president said. ``There are      senators who would rather not give him the benefit of the      doubt, senators looking for a reason to defeat him as opposed      to looking for a reason to herald his intelligence, his      capabilities, his talent. I strongly object to the way this      man is going to be treated in the United States Senate.''       The Judiciary Committee recently held a hearing on Mr.      Estrada's nomination but has not scheduled a vote.                          ____________________
