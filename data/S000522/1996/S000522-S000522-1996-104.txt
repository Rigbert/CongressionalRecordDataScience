Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, for more than two decades the multimillion-dollar abortion industry has sanitized abortion methods by aggressively employing the most clever and most benign of euphemisms market research can buy. Until today they succeeded in a massive coverup about the sickening truth about abortion methods, including chemical poisoning of the child by highly concentrated salt water or some other potion, dismemberment of the baby's fragile body by a knife connected to a suction machine that is 20 to 30 times more powerful than the average vacuum cleaner, and now brain extraction, the method at issue today, as if the child's brain were a diseased tooth in need of extraction or a tumor to be excised. Make no mistake about it, Mr. Speaker, partial-birth abortion is child abuse. And those who do it today have an unfettered right to kill. We can revoke that license to kill, Mr. Speaker, and we must. If the President vetoes this legislation, then he alone will have empowered the abortionist to kill babies in this way. If he vetoes this bill, he renews this license to kill. He bears the responsibility for the thousands of kids who will die from this hideous method of abortion. Veto this bill, and there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that Bill Clinton will go down in history as the abortion President.  Mr. Speaker, the abortion lobby lies to women and they lie to society at large, and they usually get away with it. But not this time. On this issue, they have said that partial-birth abortion is used primarily to save the life of the mother, an exception included in the bill, or for the deformity of the child. Leaving aside the inhumane notion that handicapped kids are throw-aways or are to be construed as so much garbage, I thought we took care of that with passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which said that handicapped people have rights and they have inherent value, and we need to respect that.  Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is then, perhaps most of the partial-birth abortions procured in the United States are elective; in other words, they are abortions on demand. Dr. Martin Haskell, an abortionist who alone has performed over 1,000 partial-birth abortions, said in a tape recorded interview with the American Medical News that of the procedures he does, from 20 to 24 weeks, 80 percent are, ``purely elective.''  Mr. Speaker, the abortion lobby has also said that anesthesia kills the babies before they are removed from the womb. Even if that excuse were true, even if that rationalization were true, it would still mean that a baby dies. But again it is another lie. The American Society of Anesthesiologists, the ASA, has testified that such an assertion by the abortion lobby has, and I quote, ``absolutely no basis in scientific fact,'' and is, ``misleading and potentially dangerous to pregnant women.'' According to the ASA general anesthesia given to a pregnant woman does not kill nor does it injure an unborn baby or even provide the baby with protection from pain. And Dr. Haskell himself has said that local anesthesia he uses has no effect on the baby.  Mr. Speaker, to my left is a chart, one of a series of charts, medically correct, a diagram of what the actual procedure is all about. In a paper given by Dr. Haskell to the National Abortion Federation in 1992, entitled ``Second Trimester Abortion From Every Angle,'' in September Dr. Haskell describes the partial birth abortion this way. Remember, this man, one of the pioneers who is trying to promote the use of this despicable form of child abuse, and he says, and I quote,       With the instrument, when the instrument appears on the      sonogram screen, the surgeon is able to open and close its      jaws and firmly and reliably grasp a lower extremity of the      child. The surgeon then applies firm traction to the      instrument, causing a version of the fetus and pulls the      extremity into the vagina.  He then goes on to say that,       With a lower extremity in the vagina, the surgeon uses his      fingers to deliver the lower extremity, then the torso, the      shoulders, and then the upper extremities, the skull lodges      in the internal cervical os. Usually there is not enough      dilation for it to pass through. At this point, the right-     handed surgeon slides the fingers of the left hand along the      back of the fetus and hooks the shoulders of the fetus with      the index and ring fingers palm down, while maintaining      tension, lifting the cervix and applying traction to the      shoulders with the fingers of the left hand. The surgeon      takes a pair of blunt curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right      hand. He carefully advances its tip curved down along the      spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact      the base of the skull.  Mr. Speaker, according to Dr. Haskell, the surgeon then forces the scissors into the skull, right into the skull of that baby. And then he introduces a, suction catheter, holds it and excavates the skull contents.  Mr. Speaker, one nurse, a registered nurse by the name of Brenda Pratt Schaefer, witnessed several of these partial-birth abortions while working for Dr. Haskell. She said, in describing the process that,       The baby's body was moving, his little fingers were      clasping together, he was kicking     his feet. All the while his little head was still stuck      inside. Dr. Haskell took a pair of scissors, inserted them      into the back of the baby's head. Then he opened the scissors      up. Then he stuck a high-powered suction tube into the hole      and sucked the baby's brains out.  This is child abuse, Mr. Speaker, let us face reality. And we can stop it.  Finally, just let me say, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the distinguished gentleman from Florida, Mr. Canady, the chairman of the subcommittee, for his courage in bringing this very important human rights legislation to the floor. The other side hates him for it. The abortion, lobby certainly does. They hate many others who fight for unborn kids.  But just let me say, protecting children and protecting human rights is always difficult. I serve as the chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. For 16 years I have been promoting human rights abroad. This, I would say, and submit to my distinguished colleagues, is a human rights abuse. Children are being slaughtered, some say 500, as if 500 is a small number of executions. That is, I think, a very conservative estimate; it is very likely many, many more than that. And it is being promoted as a method of choice.                              {time}  1800  I would submit that we have the opportunity today to stop this kind of child abuse and to protect little children from this kind of killing. We ought to do it. Support the rule and support the bill.
