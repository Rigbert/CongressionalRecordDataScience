 President, we are making progress. We might not be making progress as quickly as some people would like. Maybe we did spend a lot of time on this amendment, but it is very important. We have debated it. I guess it has been disposed of, at least that part of it, now. But there are a lot of other important amendments coming up. We can work together and work through some of them because a lot are duplications to some degree, and some of them we can take. Senator Dodd and I can help our staffs on that. Remember, this affects all of our economy--everything.
