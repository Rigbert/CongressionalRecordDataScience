 President, today I rise with great sadness. On Monday, May 15, 2000, Harry L. Gardner, Sr.--a quiet giant in the long history of Delaware civil rights--died. He was a man whose very presence, literally, brought calm to the most difficult, seemingly intractable problems of race at the height of the civil rights movement in Delaware.  When citizens first heard that the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King had been assassinated in April of 1968, what was once a cauldron of mounting tension between disillusioned African-Americans and Whites exploded into a series of violent and destructive acts--on both sides--reflective of unrest, resentment, and downright anger.  As you may know, of the many inner-cities ravaged by full-scale rioting and violence during this time period, Wilmington, Delaware--my hometown--was the only urban area where the National Guard occupied the city for an extended period of time. Indeed, for nine months, police officers and guardsmen patrolled the streets of Wilmington in an effort to bring order to what was seen by many in the mainstream as chaos.  As a young attorney, continually advocating for equity and social justice for African-Americans and other minorities, I saw things quite differently than many of my mainstream counterparts.  There were reasons for my own view: my Mom and Dad, who taught many lessons about the importance of equality, liberty and justice for all citizens; the people of East Side and East Lake, predominantly African-American communities where I spent a few summers life-guarding for neighborhood children; and African-American leaders like Harry L. Gardner, who taught me to believe that if I could not change the world and the view of race relations, there was no reason that I could not set a standard by which I lived my own life and became an example for others.  This was, in fact, the beauty of Harry Gardner. For 35 years, I had the pleasure of knowing a man whose deep respect for people engendered a deep respect for him. During the period of National Guard occupation, Harry was one of a very select group of people who were allowed to talk to rioters during racial disturbances. He was depended upon by city officials and neighborhood residents both to help in diffusing threatening situations and to continue to articulate the very legitimate concerns of African-American people. Though quite a difficult tightrope to walk, Harry made it look easy. In no small part, it was his ability to touch the heart of diverse groups of people and find common ground that, in effect, saved the city.  This, however, is just a portion Harry Gardner's legacy. While a career officer at the Ferris School, a juvenile correctional facility for adolescent boys, Harry founded Northeast Civic Alliance, chaired the Wilmington Police & Community Advisory Council and the Wilmington Fire & Community Council and helped start and maintain a group home for troubled youth. Yet, having said all of this, Harry received few accolades for his many faithful years of service. He was self-effacing, and traded in recognition and reward for diligent, undaunted self sacrifice for the voiceless in our community.  We may all know a Harry Gardner in our respective communities. A man who changed the way we think through living a reality of public service that surpassed rhetoric and funadmentally changed the way people from all different backgrounds see themselves and interact with each other.  Dr. W.E.B. DuBois, the famed sociologist and civil rights scholar, once said, ``peace will be my applause.'' Harry, today, we in the Senate--and so many others back home-- are all clapping loudly for your life and for its resounding impact in Wilmington and throughout the State of Delaware. Your presence will be missed, but your lessons will remain in our hearts forever.                          ____________________
