 President, I rise today to honor a respected Kentuckian, Mrs. Elizabeth S. Runner. On August 25, Mrs. Runner will turn 100 years old.  Mrs. Runner was born in Arkansas and moved to Warren County, KY, when she was just an infant. Her early years were not without struggle. She lost her father at the age of five, and her mother died during the flu epidemic that swept across the country in the early part of the last century. She was raised by her maternal grandmother.  At an early age, Mrs. Runner recognized the importance of a good education, and she pursued her passion for teaching. In 1925, she began her teaching career at Indian Creek, a one-room school in northern Warren County. She later transferred to the Richardsville School, where she taught until 1965. Over the course of her 40-year teaching career, she touched the lives of many Kentucky schoolchildren and their families.  In addition to being a devoted teacher, Mrs. Runner is a wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She married J. Elvis Runner on June 28, 1930, and they were happily married until his passing in 1997. They raised two sons, Randall S. Runner and Phillip J. Runner. She has one granddaughter, Karen Elizabeth Runner, and two great-grandsons, Kory and Wren.  Mrs. Runner is a woman of faith and a founding member of the Rays Branch Church of Christ congregation. Kentuckians admire Mrs. Runner for her dedication to teaching, her family, her faith and her zest for life. I understand that Mrs. Runner's family and friends will gather on Sunday, August 26, to celebrate and honor her reaching the rare and marvelous milestone of a 100th birthday. I ask my colleagues to join me in sending Mrs. Runner well-wishes and congratulating her on her centenarian status.                          ____________________
