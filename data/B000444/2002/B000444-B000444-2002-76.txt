 President, on behalf of myself and my colleagues I would like to place in the record a bipartisan statement of appreciation for the outgoing Ambassador of Pakistan, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi.  Ambassador Lodhi has served her country with exceptional distinction. Her prior experience as both an academic and a journalist has proved to be a great advantage: she has always articulated her government's positions with the precision of a scholar and the persuasive reach of a news analyst.  Perhaps most significantly, Ambassador Lodhi has served as a cultural bridge. She has played an invaluable role in harmonizing the various goals shared by Pakistan and the United States, goals ranging from advancing the international war on terror to de-escalating tensions in South Asia. Moreover, Ambassador Lodhi has- by both her words and her personal example- helped bridge the chasm of misunderstanding between the United States and the Islamic world.  Ambassador Lodhi's mission has been to serve the people and nation of Pakistan, and she has fulfilled that mission superbly. But at this critical juncture, Ambassador Lodhi has also been a great asset in furthering the common interests not only of Pakistan and United States, but of many voices of moderation, tolerance and progressive thinking all across the Muslim world. Her presence here in Washington will be sorely missed, and we wish her all the best on her return home.''                          ____________________
