Speaker, the gentleman is correct. I would note that in the gentleman's earlier statement, he said: ``whose lamps use more than 180 watts of electricity,'' but, in fact, it is 190 watts or less, but the gentleman, again, is correct.  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, again reclaiming my time. I thank the chairman and acknowledge that correction.  I understand that, in preparation for ceiling fan light kit standards going into effect in January 2019, many manufacturers have already switched production and produced kits without the device that limits total lamp consumption to 190 watts or less.  Lighting manufacturers have informed me that the limiting device has been a major source of product failure and that, due to the vast gains in lightbulb technology and a huge drop in the price of highly efficient bulbs, it is no longer necessary to have such a device to keep consumption low.  Unfortunately, because the limiter requirement is tied by statute to the date of enactment of the new standard, technically this bill that is designed to ease regulatory burdens may inadvertently extend for an additional year the 190-watt limiter requirement. I do not believe this is the intent of this body or our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol, in other words, the Senate.
