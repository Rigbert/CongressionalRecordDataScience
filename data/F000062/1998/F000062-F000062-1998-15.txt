 President, I rise in memory of Mayor Tom Bradley, who is being laid to rest in Los Angeles today. I join with all Angelenos, and indeed all Californians, in mourning this kind, gentle, and wonderful man who led one of the world's great cities with such skill for so many years.  For nine years during my tenure as Mayor of San Francisco, I had the pleasure of working with Mayor Bradley on state and national issues and together we offered a loud drumbeat that the cities of our nation need attention. As cities go, so goes the nation, we often said. Through and through, I saw Tom Bradley as mayor who earned the respect of his peers while he demanded attention for his city.  First elected Mayor in 1973, Mayor Bradley paved the way for many other leaders on the local and national level. Although he made history as the first African-American mayor of a major city, Tom Bradley ran and won a campaign where he pledged to be a mayor who represented the entire city. He was true to his word, and for a record-setting five terms, he served all the millions of people who call Los Angeles home--from every racial, cultural, and religious group.  Born into a sharecropper's family, Tom Bradley was seven years old when he and his family headed to California to start a new life. When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1924, Tom Bradley remembered that ``reaching California was like reaching the promised land.''  A product of the Los Angeles public school system, his academic abilities enabled him to parlay his high school athletic prowess into a university education. Bradley received a scholarship to attend UCLA, where he soon distinguished himself as a track star.  Prompted by a desire to serve the city, Tom Bradley joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1940. In May 1941, he married the former Ethel Arnold. They had two daughters, Lorraine and Phyllis.  As an early example of his enormous capacity for hard work that marked his years as mayor, Tom Bradley worked full-time as a police officer and went to law school at night. he graduated from Southwestern University in 1956 and passed the California Bar Exam.  After 21 years of service, he retired from the LAPD with the rank of Lieutenant in 1961 and began to practice law. Urged by community leaders, he decided in 1963 to run for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council. He became one of the first African-Americans ever to serve on the Council, and held his seat for 10 years before becoming the city's 37th Mayor in 1973. He ran for Governor of California twice, in 1982 and 1986, and nearly became the first African-American governor of the largest state in the Union. I think he would have made an outstanding governor.  Mayor Bradley once said, ``My guiding philosophy as mayor has been and will continue to be, to paraphrase the Athenian Oath, to transmit this city * * * not as a lesser * * * but as a greater, better and more beautiful city than it was transmitted to me. This philosophy continues to be my inspiration.''  Mayor Bradley did so much for the city he loved so well. He attracted businesses to the city and established policies that resulted in the dramatic resurgence of the downtown Los Angeles economic center. The impressive skyline that graces Los Angeles' downtown is the realization of his vision. He turned the city's Harbor and Airports into top-of-the-line businesses, expanding the number of people employed and the city's ability to compete in the world market. Today, when people fly into the Los Angeles airport from abroad, they land at the Tom Bradley International Terminal: a fitting tribute to the man who expanded the airport into the second-busiest in the country.  Mayor Bradley secured the 1984 Summer Olympic Games during a time when many predicted economic gloom. Instead, his signature approach of uniting the private and public sectors behind a common goal produced the most successful Olympic Games in modern history. The Games boosted economic activity in Southern California by $3.3 billion, created 68,000 jobs, and ended with a $215 million surplus. Just as important, the Games made all of us proud to be Americans. When we think of Carl Lewis winning his four gold medals, or Mary Lou Retton vaulting her way into the country's heart, we have Mayor Bradley to thank.  Mayor Bradley focused economic opportunities both on the inner city, with such community revitalization projects as the Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw and Vermont-Slauson shopping centers, and on the entire city, where he put forward affordable housing and fair planning policies.  Mayor Bradley also led a long and hard battle to bring rail transportation to the city of Los Angeles. There were many times it would have been easy to give up, to say the will simply was not there. Yet he was determined, came to the halls in Washington, D.C. often to appeal for funding, and never gave up. Today the Metro Blue Line carries passengers from Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles, and the Metro Red Line carries passengers from downtown to MacArthur Park. Construction is now underway to extend the Red Line to North Hollywood.  Finally, to reinforce his strong emphasis on education and to shield Los Angeles youth from drug peddlers and street gangs, Mayor Bradley initiated an ambitious plan, called L.A's BEST(Better Educated Students for Tomorrow), to provide computer training, tutorial assistance, and other enrichment activities to students in Los Angeles' low income neighborhoods. Under the program, parents are able to voluntarily keep their children at school from 2:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. each school day to learn and play. Today L.A.'s Best serves over 5,000 children each day, and has shown dramatic results in boosting students' academic achievement and self-esteem.  Mayor Tom Bradley shaped Los Angeles. He guided the City through enormous growth and change. His 20 years were marked by too many triumphs to count, and even in the bad times, during the devastating civil unrest that took place after the Rodney King verdict, his strong leadership and gentle demeanor brought Angelenos together to work for the common good. For many Angelenos, Mayor Bradley was a father figure: physically imposing at six-foot-four, and intellectually imposing as the sharp-minded, politically astute big city mayor, but always so warm and gentle that you instantly felt at ease when you talked with him. He was a great leader, but more than that, he was a great person. There are simply not enough people like him in politics.  Mr. President, I know that Tom Bradley will be remembered as one of the city's greatest and most beloved mayors. His loss is a blow to the City of Los Angeles. I know that I join all Angelenos today in sending my thoughts and prayers to his wife and daughters.                          ____________________
