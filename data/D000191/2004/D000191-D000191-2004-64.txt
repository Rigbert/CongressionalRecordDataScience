  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, finally, finally Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay, or ``Ken Boy'' as the President affectionately called him, has been indicted and done the perp walk. He masterminded Enron, a corporation that built billions from millions in the Western United States while his employees gloated about sticking it to Grandma Milly. Every Oregonian is paying 40 percent more for their electricity because of manipulation of the market by Enron.  Now the President does not return Ken Boy's calls anymore despite his past generosity, but the President should do more. The President should return the $139,500 Ken Lay personally contributed to him, the $602,625 that Enron gave to President Bush. This is money stolen from Grandma Milly and other Western consumers, and the President should give it to a low-income energy assistance fund. It is tainted money. Let us put this chapter behind us, but let us have restitution, Mr. President.                          ____________________
