''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters to Congress regarding tax extenders from biofuel and biodiesel businesses and associations across the United States.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 February 5, 2019.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Speaker of the House,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Richard Neal,     Chairman, House Committee on Ways & Means, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,     House Republican Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Schumer,     Senate Democratic Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Kevin Brady,     Ranking Member, House Committee on Ways & Means, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Pelosi, Republican Leader McCarthy, Majority      Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer, Chairman Neal,      Ranking Member McCarthy, Chairman Grassley, and Ranking      Member Wyden: As you continue your negotiations on the final      Continuing Resolution Fiscal Year 2019, the advanced and      cellulosic biofuels industry urges you to extend a suite of      critical advanced biofuels tax incentives--the Second      Generation Biofuel Producer Tax Credit, the Special      Depreciation Allowance for Second Generation Biofuel Plant      Property, the Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel Fuels Credit,      and the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property.       These tax extenders expired at the end of 2017 after having      been extended retroactively in the Bipartisan Budget Act of      2018. Allowing these tax incentives to lapse has created      uncertainty for investors and the industry about the      availability of these credits; jeopardizing the long-term      investments necessary for the development of these biofuels.      Availability of these credits are critical as our companies      make significant investments to create new agricultural      supply chains, build infrastructure for liquid biofuels, and      develop innovative new technologies. These credits have      enabled our industry to create new jobs, contribute to rural      prosperity, and diversify our nation's energy supply.      However, the continued delays in extending these credits puts      these investments and benefits at risk.       In the interest of job creation, infrastructure      development, innovation, and energy security, we respectfully      ask Congress to immediately pass a seamless multi-year      extension, which includes 2018 retroactively, to ensure      companies will be able to account for these credits in this      year's tax filings.       We look forward to working with you to achieve this      important goal.           Sincerely,     Advanced Biofuels Business Council,     Algae Biomass Organization,     Biotechnology Innovation Organization,     Growth Energy,     National Biodiesel Board,     Renewable Fuels Association.                                       ____                                                 February 5, 2019.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,     Republican Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Richard Neal,     Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Schumer,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance,     Washington, DC.       Dear Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer and      Leader McCarthy, and Chairmen Grassley and Neal: On behalf of      the entire biodiesel supply chain--including biodiesel      producers, feedstock providers, blenders, fuel marketers and      consumers--we urge you to maintain and extend the biodiesel      blenders' tax credit as soon as possible. In light of      Congress's past practice of retroactively extending the tax      credit after it lapses, our industry has been compelled since      January 1, 2018 to operate on the assumption that the credit      would be extended, effectively pricing the credit's value      into our costs of doing business. It is essential that the      businesses that have priced product artificially low are made      whole. In addition, we urge Congress to extend the credit      prospectively, thereby augmenting consumer benefits and      encouraging additional investment in clean-burning biofuels.       The blenders' credit has worked successfully to build a      robust biodiesel and renewable diesel industry in the United      States. As a result, the U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel      market has grown from roughly 100 million gallons in 2005 to      nearly 2.6 billion gallons in 2017. The tax credit is an      important demand stimulus, which improves plant efficiencies,      encourages investment in U.S. distribution infrastructure,      and supports high-paying jobs throughout the country, all      while incentivizing consumption of fuels that significantly      reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The biodiesel tax credit      lowers the price that truck drivers pay for fuel, and lowers      the price that heating oil customers pay to heat their homes.       Extending the biodiesel blenders credit will allow us to      continue to provide these economic and environmental      benefits.       Unfortunately, the uncertainty caused by the ``on-again,      off-again'' tempo of legislative extensions, including the      Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 which retroactively extended      the biodiesel tax incentives through the end of 2017, has      somewhat frustrated our sector's ability to anticipate the      availability of the incentives and make the necessary      investments. This severely disrupts access to capital, as      well as the ability to hire and expand.       Since the credit's inception, the market responded as      Congress intended. The undersigned trade associations are      united in urging Congress to act on a multiyear extension of      this successful program and provide our industry long-term      certainty as expeditiously as possible.           Sincerely,         Advanced Biofuels Association, American Farm Bureau            Federation, American Trucking Associations, National            Association of Convenience Stores, National Biodiesel            Board, National Renderers Association, NATSO,            Representing America's Travel Centers and Truckstops,            New England Fuels Institute, Petroleum Marketers            Association of America, Society of Independent Gasoline            Marketers of America.                                  ____                                                February 11, 2019.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Richard Neal,     Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Kevin Brady,     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways & Means, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairmen Grassley and Neal, and Ranking Members Wyden      and Brady: The undersigned organizations represent users,      retailers, customers, fleet managers, utilities, and      producers of clean alternative transportation fuels.       We ask your support for including a reinstatement of the      $0.50/gallon alternative fuels tax credit (AFTC) (26 USC      6426(d) and 6427(e)) in a fiscal year 2019 government      spending package. The AFTC is a credit of $0.50 per gasoline      gallon equivalent (GGE) of certain transportation fuels,      including natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, P Series      Fuels, liquefied hydrogen and others. Extending the AFTC      retroactively for 2018 and prospectively for 2019 will allow      businesses and customers to continue to deploy cleaner      alternative fuel technologies. A full five-year extension of      the AFTC would provide business certainty along with a      significant contribution to our nation's economic growth.      Unfortunately, the credit has currently lapsed as of December      31, 2017 and many fleets, businesses, and manufacturers are      unable to plan future investments as they manage current      uncertainty. Immediately reinstating the AFTC for 2018 and      2019 is necessary to encouraging further deployment of new,      clean transportation technology.       Extending the AFTC will bring significant environmental      benefits, improved air quality, and enhance our energy      independence by lowering our dependence on foreign oil.      Renewal of the AFTC also promotes increased private-sector      investment in infrastructure and equipment, which leads to      more jobs and economic output.       Thank you for your continued support for the AFTC and for      the use of cleaner-burning alternative transportation fuels.      We appreciate your consideration of this request.
