 I can remember one time in Cleveland, Ambassador Holbrooke during one large gathering walking through meetings with his garrulous nature, and full of life, and keeping Ohio in a very special corner of his heart. I remember how proud he was of his own heritage, of his wife's heritage, and how hard he worked for our country. One can only imagine all those flights from capital to capital to capital trying to piece together the Dayton Peace Accord and his absolutely indefatigable efforts on behalf of peace around the world.  He will truly, truly be missed by the people of Ohio. I am just very fortunate to be a Representative from that State who had the privilege of knowing him and working with him over the years. And America is better, the world is better, because of his life.  I thank the gentleman for yielding and allowing me this time on the floor today.
