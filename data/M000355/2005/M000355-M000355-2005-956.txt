 President, today we will begin consideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. We have an agreement that all first-degree amendments to that bill will be filed by 4 p.m. this afternoon. That will allow both managers of the legislation to get a better understanding of how many issues and amendments are expected in relation to the Homeland Security measure.  As the majority leader announced prior to the recess, there will be a rollcall vote this afternoon at approximately 5:30. That vote is expected to be in relation to a resolution regarding the recent bombing in London.  We will have a busy stretch of activity over the next 3 weeks with many pressing legislative and executive items that must be completed prior to the August recess. I encourage Senators to make themselves available on Mondays and Fridays throughout the month as the majority leader will be using all available time to make progress on appropriations bills and other priorities.  I will have a statement in a few moments, but I yield the floor so the Democratic leader can make whatever observations he would like to make.                          ____________________
