  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, just 3 years ago the Republican leaders and the Clinton administration touted all the benefits that would flow from telecommunications deregulation. Cable would compete with phone, phone with cable, lower rates, better service, new technology. Three years' experience has shown those promises to be hollow.  There is no competition between phone and cable. Cable rates have skyrocketed, local phone rates are going up, service has deteriorated. Then we get all those evening phone calls. This is not a consumer-friendly bill. But, all in all, it has delivered a golden egg for Wall Street and a few companies and a goose egg for Main Street consumers and small business.  Now the Clinton administration and the Republican leaders want to rush to deregulate our electric power. Lower rates, new technology, more competition. We have heard it before. Wall Street and a number of large energy companies are just slathering over the products. The results for consumers and small business will be the same as telecommunications, evening phone calls, higher rates, worse service.                          ____________________
