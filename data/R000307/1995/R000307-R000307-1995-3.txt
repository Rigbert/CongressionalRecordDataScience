Speaker, I associate myself with the gentleman's timely remarks and his tribute and for his leadership in naming Ed's hometown post office in his name.  He was a good friend, a colleague and a mentor for many of us. Like Mr. de la Garza, the distinguished gentleman from Texas, the chairman emeritus of the committee, has indicated, we have worked together long and hard on many matters in regard to farmers and ranchers and agriculture in general.  I would think the gentleman from Illinois is certainly following his example on the House Committee on Agriculture in terms of his demeanor and in working hard for agriculture and his farmers and ranchers. I would only add that Ed Madigan is now certainly sorely missed by his friends and colleagues. We certainly need him in the midst of the agriculture debate that we are having in regard to the reconciliation bill.  One thought is that I would not be surprised if the good citizens of his hometown of Lincoln, IL, will now be assured of the best postal service of any in the country. Ed would not have it any other way.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Ewing].  (
