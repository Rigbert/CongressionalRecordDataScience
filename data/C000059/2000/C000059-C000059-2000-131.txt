Speaker, I rise today to join with the California Inland Empire Council Boy Scouts of America in saluting Dr. Raymond L. Orbach as their Distinguished Citizen of the Year--2000.  Dr. Raymond L. Orbach has been Chancellor at the University of California, Riverside for eight years, where he is also Distinguished Professor of Physics. At UCR, Chancellor Orbach has made community service and partnerships the focal point of his administration. The major part of that focal point is the students themselves. In fact, to remain in touch with the student population, he teaches the calculus-based freshman Physics course at UCR every winter quarter.  Chancellor Orbach has been and continues to be a shining example of a person with passion and principles, who has strived to change the cultural and political direction of our nation. His approach and policy has been a simple one, that a community's strength comes from just that--the community. We must first start close to home and then radiate out if we hope to have fulfilling lives and impact others.  We have a vast system of public higher education in this country; a network of great state universities and colleges. Today we enjoy academic excellence in America as it is enjoyed nowhere else in the world. Chancellor Orbach is responsible for that part of America's incredible educational experiment known as UCR.  Every student at UC Riverside is the beneficiary of this man, who is deeply committed to educating our nation's young people and ensuring that they have a bright future. In fact, a New York Times Magazine article, in May of 1999, lauded Chancellor Orbach for his passion and principles. He is one person, making a difference. Chancellor Orbach reminds us what we, as Americans, ought to be. What we, as Americans, are capable of achieving.  Since 1910, the Boy Scout has been the epitome of the good American citizen. He has been instilled with the drive to ``help other people at all times,'' and to keep himself ``physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.'' To do this he must be: trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.  Chancellor Orbach has gone above and beyond the Boy Scout protocol. I ask all of my colleagues in Congress to please join me in honoring the Chancellor for his courage, innovation, and commitment to the youth of tomorrow as he is recognized on May 8th.                          ____________________
