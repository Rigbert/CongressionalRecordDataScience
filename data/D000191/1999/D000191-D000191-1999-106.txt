Speaker, I am deeply saddened by the tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. It brings back emotions my hometown experienced last year when a group of students at Thurston High School were shot by a fellow student. Last week's violent rampage was an incomprehensible and devastating act and I know my community joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families in Colorado.  We can't legislate all solutions, but we can take prudent steps to help prevent similar acts in the future. As we learned in Springfield, the changes needed to prevent similar tragedies are going to require an enduring commitment from each and every one of us. Preventing youth violence depends on our ability to support children and families. Each of us needs to look for ways to do more to help our neighbors and communities. In small ways and large, we can all help keep our children and families safe.
