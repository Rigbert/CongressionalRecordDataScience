 If we fail to resolve this issue now, it will simply plunge us into another manufactured crisis which will quickly undermine the stability and confidence that some believe this agreement is bringing.  The fact that this agreement deals temporarily with preventing a cut in Medicare's physician reimbursement rate is welcome but, as with our fiscal sustainability, it needs to be dealt with on a permanent basis.  I am pleased that the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee today marked up legislation to do so. However, it is unconscionable that the budget deal before us today does not extend unemployment insurance, which helps those who are most at risk in our society; and if we do not help them, the economy will suffer, and 200,000 jobs are predicted to be lost.  On December 28, 1.3 million Americans will lose their unemployment insurance if we do not act, and they will be joined by an additional 3.5 million Americans in 2014. The House should not leave town without ensuring that individuals looking for work have the safety net of unemployment insurance.
