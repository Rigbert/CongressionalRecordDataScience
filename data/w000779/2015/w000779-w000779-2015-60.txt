President, I agree with the Senator from Wyoming that we need to find a solution to this problem and I have introduced legislation with Senator Crapo that currently sits in the Budget Committee. Oregon is on fire and the Forest Service tells me that with current fire seasons getting longer and current budgetary constraints, the days of spending over 50 percent of their budget on suppressing fires is here to stay. The time for talking is coming to an end and the time to negotiate a fix to this very serious problem is at hand. I would like to work under the leadership of my friend, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, over the summer, on an answer to this chronic problem.
