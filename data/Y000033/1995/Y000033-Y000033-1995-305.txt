Mr. Chairman, I support H.R. 614, which was introduced by the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Minge].  This legislation would transfer the ownership of the New London Fish Hatchery facility from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to the State of Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources. H.R. 614 would convey all rights, title, and interest of the United States to the State of Minnesota. This includes all property, buildings, water rights, and easements of the New London facility.  It is my understanding that the hatchery has been operated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources for the Fish and Wildlife Service under a memorandum of agreement [MOA] since 1983. This MOA, which was extended in 1993, expires in 1998.  The hatchery facility is actually located on two separate pieces of land. One is located outside the town of New London and is owned [[Page H5647]] by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The other is located within the town of New London; the State had owned the property but transferred it to the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1939.  Finally, the bill stipulates that this property revert back to the Federal Government if the State of Minnesota decides it no longer wishes to operate the hatchery as a fishery resources management facility.  The Fish and Wildlife Service supports this transfer and I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on this measure.
