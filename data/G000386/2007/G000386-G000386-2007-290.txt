 Currently, the bill before us contains penalties, but those penalties won't mean much to large global corporations. In fact, the penalties amount to the cost of doing business. This amendment is intended, then, to give the Food and Drug Administration, the watchdog, some bite along with its bark.  There is opposition to having strong civil monetary penalties, but that does not make sense to this Senator. Even the Consumers Union supports this amendment. The reality is, drug companies provide lifesaving pharmaceuticals throughout the world. The pharmaceutical companies make miracles happen. Before a drug is approved, a drug company has an incentive to provide evidence of a drug's effectiveness to the Food and Drug Administration. Without it, they can't sell drugs in this country. However, once a drug is already being sold in the marketplace, drug companies have almost no incentive to look for and evaluate safety issues. The bottom line is, sometimes market forces guide businesses in a way that may be contrary to the public interest.  We have seen this happen many times. For the Food and Drug Administration's new authorities to be meaningful in this legislation, there must be stronger civil monetary penalties in the underlying bill; hence, my amendment. Fines are nothing more than the cost of doing business, and we can't change behavior. More importantly, we can't even deter bad behavior. If a company does what it is supposed to do, a drug company doesn't need to fear any penalties. It is that simple.  I ask Members of the Senate to support this amendment because it adds real teeth to the FDA's bite.  I thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for the tremendous efforts they went to in bringing this bill to the Senate floor. Again, I want to make this bill even better. They have already included several ideas Senator Dodd and I have shared with them.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
