President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2216, a bill to extend the Indian Employment Credit Depreciation Rules for property within an Indian reservation, and that the bill be read a third time and passed. I further ask that the bill then be held at the desk until the House companion arrives and that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate-passed bill be inserted, and the House bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed.  Again, this is one of those I just referred to on the floor of this body.
