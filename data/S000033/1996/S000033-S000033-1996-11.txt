 Speaker, in a time when this Congress is proposing huge cuts in Medicare, and Medicaid, and education, environmental protection, veterans programs, it is absolutely insane that we continue to provide $125 billion a year in corporate welfare, tax breaks and subsidies which go to some of the largest, the most profitable corporations in America, and that is why I am delighted that last month legislation which I offered with the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Smith] passed this body and would take a major bite out of one of the most outrageous examples of corporate welfare, and that is the billions of dollars in Pentagon subsidies which taxpayers are providing to huge defense contractors, subsidies which, if my colleagues can believe it, are providing incentives to merge their companies and in the process lay off tens of thousands of American workers.  Yes, that is what we are doing: Taxpayer subsidies are going for payoffs for layoffs, to lay off tens of thousands of American workers.  Mr. Speaker, while this important legislation passed the House unfortunately it did not pass the Senate, and it will be going to conference committee. My hope is that this body will urge our conferees to say no to payoffs, for layoffs.                          ____________________
