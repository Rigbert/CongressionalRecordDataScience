Speaker, we think taking the time to do this right is better than doing it immediately or quickly. It is, obviously, of great importance to our seniors but as well to our families in America. We appreciate the fact that it is going to be given some time. We hope that there will be full participation in that conference.  On the child tax credit, and there was discussion about this on the floor just a few days ago. We are very concerned about the fact that checks will be going to people on July 25. The individuals who were included in the Senatebill but were dropped in conference will not be receiving a check. That is largely because we have yet to pass a bill. It is now almost 37 days since we appointed conferees, and the checks for those who will get the credit go out next Friday. What is the status of that piece of legislation?
