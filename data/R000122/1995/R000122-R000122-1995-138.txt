Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a gentleman who has dedicated his life to one of our Nation's most honorable and arduous professions: teaching. Mr. William K. Waters has been a social studies teacher at Park View Junior High School in Cranston, RI, for his entire 31 year tenure with the Cranston public school system. At the end of this school year, Mr. Waters will retire after his many years of teaching.  Mr. Waters first went to Park View as a student teacher while studying at Rhode Island College in 1963. The following year, he returned to Park View as a full-time social studies teacher. He quickly became immersed in this dynamic school, and soon his duties extended far beyond the classroom.  Mr. Waters has worked tirelessly with students on Park View's award winning yearbook for over 20 years. As the ninth grade class advisor for 28 years, Mr. Waters' encouragement and guidance instilled qualities of responsibility and leadership. However, Mr. Waters' legacy to Park View will be most remembered as advisor to the student council, a position he has held for 29 years.  Park View's student council has long been the envy of junior high schools throughout Rhode Island. The council's many longstanding traditions and services have benefited students, teachers, and the community. Students chosen by their peers to represent their class on the student council have managed school stores, a student handbook, all-school dances, the ninth grade dance, and fundraisers. Overseen by the always attentive and dedicated Mr. Waters, these were not merely student activities, they fostered a cooperative and active student body within the Park View community.  And for the students fortunate enough to serve on the council, it served as a life-long lesson. Someone believed that at their age they could be trusted with money, to carry out responsibilities, and to deliver results. Leadership and commitment are not easily learned, but Mr. Waters not only encouraged these, he expected them.  The student council's organizational skills and resources also benefited the local community. The Meeting Street Center, the Heart Association, the R.I. Lung Association, and Rhode Island's senior citizens have all come to recognize that Park View is not just another junior high school. At the same time, students were able to learn about life beyond the confines of classes, teachers, and friends.  Of course, none of this would have been possible had someone not taken on the enormous responsibility of going beyond the afternoon school bell. Junior high school teachers [[Page E1108]] are a rate commodity. They face challenges in the classroom that go far beyond textbooks, homework, and grades, Mr. Waters is a dedicated professional who went beyond the call of duty and always bestowed any credit to his students.  Mr. Waters has gotten to know many generations of young adults growing up in eastern Cranston. His guidance and devotion is demonstrated by the caliber of students who have graduated. Prepared academically when they graduated to high school, these young adults were also prepared to be role models and leaders for other students. Mr. Waters is an institution, and will always be fondly recalled by his students, their parents, and his colleagues.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Mr. Waters' service to Park View Junior High School and commend him as a teacher, an advisor, and a person. Mr. Waters is truly a role model for future teachers and students, and I would like to wish him continued success in retirement.                          ____________________
