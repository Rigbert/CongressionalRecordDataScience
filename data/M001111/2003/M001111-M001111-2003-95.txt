 The President's proposal under homeland security combined these grants with other programs. The Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the committee, rightfully separated this back out to where it was.  Unfortunately, the funding for this has remained static for the last decade. Since September 11, every county, every city across this country has had an additional responsibility in planning not just for a tornado or earthquake or national disaster but to have an emergency plan in case of a terrorist attack--very different planning, very different understanding, very different concerns. It is critical we help our local communities have a plan in place so when a call goes to a desk after a terrorist attack, people have a plan in front of them and know what to do and there is not pandemonium.  This amendment simply adds $100 million. By the way, the people across the country in emergency management say they are $200 million short in this area. We simply add $100 million for our planners across this country to be prepared for a terrorist attack.
