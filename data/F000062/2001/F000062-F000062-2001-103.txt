 To this end, I am willing to reduce funding for two California land acquisition projects--the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge and the San Joaquin National Wildlife Refuge--by $250,000 each. I want to be very clear--I fully support these projects. In fact, they were included in the bill at my request. I intend to see that they are fully funded by the end of this process. However, due to the procedural necessity of providing an offset, the only way to ensure that all three equally important projects go forward is to make this reduction. Should the interested parties fail to come to an acceptable agreement over the San Francisco baylands, the funding could return to the San Diego and San Joaquin projects.
