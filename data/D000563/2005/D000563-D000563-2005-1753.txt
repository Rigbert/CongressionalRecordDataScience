Con. Res. 25) was agreed to, as follows:                            S. Con. Res. 25       Whereas Airbus is currently the leading manufacturer of      large civil aircraft, with a full fleet of aircraft and more      than 50 percent global market share;       Whereas Airbus has received approximately $30,000,000,000      in market distorting subsidies from European governments,      including launch aid, infrastructure support, debt      forgiveness, equity infusions, and research and development      funding;       Whereas these subsidies, in particular launch aid, have      lowered Airbus' development costs and shifted the risk of      aircraft development to European governments, and thereby      enabled Airbus to develop aircraft at an accelerated pace and      sell these aircraft at prices and on terms that would      otherwise be unsustainable;       Whereas the benefit of these subsidies to Airbus is      enormous, including, at a minimum, the avoidance of      $35,000,000,000 in debt as a result of launch aid's      noncommercial interest rate;       Whereas over the past 5 years, Airbus has gained 20 points      of world market share and 45 points of market share in the      United States, all at the expense of Boeing, its only      competitor;       Whereas this dramatic shift in market share has had a      tremendous impact, resulting in the loss of over 60,000 high-     paying United States aerospace jobs;       Whereas on October 6, 2004, the United States Trade      Representative filed a complaint at the World Trade      Organization on the basis that all of the subsidies that the      European Union and its Member States have provided to Airbus      violate World Trade Organization rules;       Whereas on January 11, 2005, the European Union agreed to      freeze the provision of launch aid and other government      support and negotiate with a view to reaching a      comprehensive, bilateral agreement covering all government      supports in the large civil aircraft sector;       Whereas the Bush administration has shown strong leadership      and dedication to bring about a fair resolution during the      negotiations;       Whereas Airbus received $6,200,000,000 in government      subsidies to build the A380;       Whereas Airbus has now committed to develop and produce yet      another new model, the A350, even before the A380 is out of      the development phase;       Whereas Airbus has stated that it does not need launch aid      to build the A350, but has nevertheless applied for and      European governments are prepared to provide $1,700,000,000      in new launch aid; and       Whereas European governments are apparently determined to      target the United States aerospace sector and Boeing's      position in the large civil aircraft market by providing      Airbus with continuing support to lower its costs and reduce      its risk: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That--       (1) European governments should reject Airbus' pending      application for launch aid for the A350 and any future      applications for launch aid;       (2) the European Union, acting for itself and on behalf of      its Member States, should renew its commitment to the terms      agreed to on January 11, 2005;       (3) the United States Trade Representative should request      the formation of a World Trade Organization dispute      resolution panel at the earliest possible opportunity if      there is no immediate agreement to eliminate launch aid for      the A350 and all future models and no concrete progress      toward a comprehensive bilateral agreement covering all      government supports in the large aircraft sector; and       (4) the President should take any additional action the      President considers appropriate to protect the interests of      the United States in fair competition in the large commercial      aircraft market.                          ____________________
