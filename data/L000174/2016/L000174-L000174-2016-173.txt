President, it has been 5 weeks since the Senate last confirmed a judicial nominee. In that time, judicial vacancies have continued to increase. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has repeatedly objected to unanimous consent motions made to overcome the obstruction of 20 judicial nominees. These are nominees who were voted out unanimously by committee and are awaiting a confirmation vote.  The majority leader claims that President Obama's nominees have been treated fairly, but anyone paying attention to the Senate over the past 7 years knows that is not the case. It has been almost 2 months since Chief Judge Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is widely respected, and prior to his nomination, he had repeatedly received praise from the very Republicans who now refuse to allow him to appear for a confirmation hearing. These same Republicans refuse to do their jobs as Senators while outside groups pour millions of dollars into television ads that seek to discredit Chief Judge Garland's record. Before there was even a Supreme Court nominee, one Republican aide promised conservatives were ``going to light this person up.'' Sadly, it appears they are making good on their threat while simultaneously refusing to allow him a public hearing where he could respond.  Meanwhile, lower court nominees have stalled. Paula Xinis, whom we will vote on today, was nominated more than a year ago to fill an emergency vacancy--not just a regular vacancy but an emergency vacancy in Maryland. Since 2011, she has practiced as a criminal defense attorney at a law firm. Prior to that, she served in the Federal Public Defender's Office for the District of Maryland for 13 years, from 1998 to 2011. Ms. Xinis has extensive trial experience, representing hundreds of clients as a public defender and trying 16 cases to completion over the course of her career. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Ms. Xinis ``well qualified'' to serve in the district court. They gave Paula Xinis their highest rating. She is strongly supported by both Senators from Maryland, and her nomination was unanimously approved by the JudiciaryCommittee by voice vote 8 months ago. All the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee approved her nomination from the Committee by unanimous voice vote.  Senator Sessions came to the floor today to oppose Ms. Xinis's nomination based on her experience as an examiner of complaints against police officers in the District of Columbia. From 1995 to 2011, Ms. Xinis served as a complaint examiner in six cases where she made determinations on complaints brought against Metropolitan Police Department officers. At her Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Sessions questioned Ms. Xinis about her experience and expressed concern that, in the six cases Ms. Xinis served as a complaint examiner, she sustained rulings against police officers in all of them. Senator Sessions questions Ms. Xinis's fairness to police officers based on her determinations in these six cases.  However, as Senator Sessions said on the floor today, he does not question her personal qualifications or her integrity to be a Federal judge. And he also did not question her testimony before the Judiciary Committee in which she committed to being a fair and impartial judge, should she be confirmed. Furthermore, Ms. Xinis's record as a complaint examiner shows that each one of her six determinations was sustained by the chief of police; none of them was overturned. Her decisions could have been appealed and overturned if they were incorrect, but they were not.  Paula Xinis has earned the express support of law enforcement and has defended police officers as an attorney on a number of occasions. For instance, in one case, she provided legal counsel to a Baltimore police officer unfairly accused of criminal wrongdoing. That officer wrote a letter of support for Ms. Xinis, where he said: ``Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she `had my back' and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all of the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year.'' This does not sound like a person who holds any biases against law enforcement. In addition to this officer, several other members of the law enforcement community have written in support of Ms. Xinis's nomination.  After we actually vote on Paula Xinis's nomination today, there will still be 19 judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar waiting for a confirmation vote. Every single one of these nominees was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. Instead of allowing a vote on these nominees on a regular basis, the Republican leadership objects to the Senate being able to do our jobs.  After today's vote, the next in line for consideration is a district court nominee from New Jersey and then a district court nominee from Nebraska. I know the Senators from New Jersey are pushing for a vote on the nominee to serve in their State. I hope the Republican Senators from Nebraska are urging their leadership to schedule the confirmation of Robert Rossiter, who was approved by unanimous voice vote in committee. That vacancy has been pending for over a year and a half. There is no good reason for votes on these nominees to be further delayed.  Senator Grassley has indicated that Republicans will shut down the judicial nominations process in July, even though vacancies have risen from 43 to 81 since Republicans took over the majority. They have allowed vacancies to rise dramatically and now want to shut it down even though the judicial nominees pending are not controversial and we have numerous vacancies that need to be filled. This is wrong. Contrast this to the last 2 years of George W. Bush's administration, when Democrats were in control. At this same point in the Bush Presidency, Democrats had reduced vacancies to just 46.  Because of Republican obstruction, our independent judiciary is struggling to perform its role under the Constitution. The Marshall Project recently interviewed several sitting judges to examine the impact judicial vacancies are having on our courts. Chief Judge Ron Clark of the Eastern District of Texas, which currently has three judicial emergency vacancies, said: ``We're managing the best we can--but if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to see some more draconian kinds of delays.'' There is a nominee to this court pending in the Judiciary Committee, but the Texas Senators, who both are members of the committee, have not returned their blue slips to allow that nominee to even receive a hearing. I hope the Texas Senators heed the call of Chief Judge Clark and get moving on their nominee.  And I hope the Senate majority allows this body to return to regular order when it comes to processing judicial nominees. We have a constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on the President's nominees. The Constitution has not changed, but once President Obama took office, this body's normal practice for treating nominees turned for the worse. Deference to home State Senators was no longer the norm, and procedural delay after procedural delay quickly became the standard practice of the Republican caucus, whether they were in the minority or now in the majority. In a New York Times op-ed a week ago, former Judge Shira Sheindlin of the Southern District of New York warned that the Republicans' obstruction to district court nominees ``undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of the judiciary.''  I was heartened to hear the majority leader last week make the point that an election year is ``not an excuse not to do our work.'' I could not agree more. That is why in the last 2 years of the George W. Bush administration, when I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees. That is compared to a handful of President Obama's nominees that the Republicans have allowed. We confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees, and we confirmed right up to the time we went out for the elections in September, not in June or July or May.  We have also confirmed more than a dozen Supreme Court Justices in Presidential election years, and many in this Senate served at the time. The last one we had, of course, was during President Reagan's final year in office. We did so because we knew the Supreme Court should not be held hostage to election-year politics; yet we are being held hostage to election-year politics because we are not doing our jobs. And the Supreme Court issued a couple more 4-to-4 opinions today.  I urge the majority leader to heed his own advice and to schedule a confirmation vote for the pending lower court nominees, and I urge the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to follow suit by scheduling confirmation hearings for Chief Judge Garland so that we can do our jobs.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Judge Sheindlin's op-ed and the Marshall Project review be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Marshall Project, April 26, 2016]       What Happens When There Aren't Enough Judges to Go Around?                             (By Eli Hager)       The ninth seat on the Supreme Court has been vacant for two      months.       But Antonin Scalia's chair is not the only empty one in the      vast federal judiciary, where several judgeships have      remained unfilled for 30 months or more. Around the country,      there are 84 of these vacancies, largely as a result of the      Senate's historically low rate of confirming President Barack      Obama's nominees. And since the beginning of last year, the      number of unfilled seats and pending nominations have been      steadily rising.       Down in the gears of the justice system, all those absent      judges have taken a toll.       Because courts are obligated to find ways to meet speedy-     trial rules, at least in criminal cases, the vacancies have      not caused across-the-board delays. But by all accounts, the      unconfirmed nominees--combined with what advocates say is an      insufficient number of judgeships overall--have forced the      system to find sometimes extraordinary ways to make do with      the few judges available.       Some judges, for example, are having to drive hundreds of      miles to cover the empty seats. Less-qualified magistrate      judges, senior judges who are supposed to be entering      retirement, and visiting judges who fly in from other states,      have all had to pitch in. And many of the remaining judges      say that it's hard, with such a lack of personnel, to give      every case the attention it deserves.       In the worst-hit districts, including all four districts of      Texas, some areas of Florida     and California, Middle Alabama, and elsewhere, the situation      is now considered an ``emergency.''       Ron Clark, chief judge of the Eastern District of Texas,      which has three judicial emergencies out of only eight total      judgeships, says that ``we're managing the best we can--but      if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to      see some more draconian kinds of delays.''                Judicial Vacancies in the Federal Courts       In the past year, unfilled federal judgeships have been      rising dramatically. Similarly, the number of seats on the      bench considered ``emergencies''--vacant for many months with      a large caseload per judge--and the number of White House      nominations awaiting Senate confirmation have climbed.       A 2014 study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that      the vacancies led to a host of negative consequences. Among      them were unresolved motions, habeas corpuspetitions waiting      years to be heard (or being handled by law clerks instead of      judges), judges spending less time on each case, and      defendants pleading guilty because they believed a trial      would not get the timely attention it deserved.       And in civil proceedings, where the Speedy Trial Act does      not apply, longer wait times for trial are becoming more      common.       Morrison C. England Jr., chief judge of the Eastern      District of California, says that ``cases that aren't the      priority are going to get pushed back for years, literally.''       In Middle Alabama, Ricky Martin, a pastor, had been      allowing registered sex-offenders to stay in mobile homes      surrounding his church--until the state legislature made it      illegal for him to do so. Martin filed suit in August of      2014, and the local D.A. responded with a ``motion to      dismiss'' a few months later. But a judge didn't get around      to weighing in--in Martin's favor--until this April, and the      case may not actually be resolved for two more years or      longer.       The process would have taken only three to four months if      there were more judges available, says Randall Marshall,      legal director of the ACLU of Alabama.       But sometimes, the effect is the opposite: the proceedings      get rushed.       Brian McGiverin, a civil-rights lawyer in Austin, Texas,      says that because there are so few judges, the remaining ones      are all overbooked. As a result, they often ``give you a      cramped amount of time for trial, regardless of how many      witnesses you'd like to call.''       McGiverin recently assisted in the case of a woman named      Abieyuwa Ikhinmwin, who claimed that she was racially      profiled, handled with excessive force, and wrongfully      arrested by police in San Antonio.       He says the court tried to ``fast-track'' her lawsuit,      threatening to dismiss it within 21 days unless she paid a      fee and submitted additional information--which would not      have happened when there were enough judges.       Clark, chief judge in the nearby Eastern District of Texas,      says that ``with so few of us, it's definitely harder to have      the flexibility that a defense lawyer might want us to. So      the answer sometimes has to be, `No, sorry, we can't offer      that time in court.' ''       Meanwhile, the consequences of too few judges are worsened      in the most geographically expansive districts.       ``When there's a missing judge in a state like ours,''      Clark says, ``it's not like we can walk down the hall and      take care of a trial for him--the trip from Beaumont to Plano      is five and a half hours, and that's if the traffic is      good.''       He and the other judges in his district waste about two      days a week on the road.       ``We're one traffic accident away from the wheels falling      off,'' he says.       As an additional stop-gap measure, the worst-hit districts      are relying on pinch hitters.       In Middle Alabama, less-experienced magistrate judges (who      are appointed directly by the district judges, rather than      nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate) have      for several years been doing work once reserved for the      district judges, from taking guilty pleas to overseeing      evidentiary hearings. The district is also getting last-     minute help from visiting judges, who have traveled from Iowa      and Florida to pitch in.       ``When there are judges who come in from elsewhere,'' says      Christine Freeman, executive director of the federal      defender's office in Montgomery, Ala., ``they are strangers      to us, to the prosecutor, to court officials, to the      probation officers, to every single person involved in a      case.''       ``That makes it very hard to predict outcomes for your      client,'' Freeman adds.       But the lack of judges has perhaps fallen hardest on senior      judges, who, because they are typically over 70 or 80 years      old, usually take on 50 percent or less of a full caseload.       Instead, in Middle Alabama and elsewhere, their caseloads      have been 150 or even 200 percent of normal.       ``I'm 73, and I'd like to be able to say, `Look, I'm done,      I want to spend more time with my family,' '' says Michael      Schneider, one of the senior judges in Eastern Texas. ``I'm      encouraged that the president has nominated someone, but I      can't actually cut back until a nominee is approved.''       ``I'm going to be at this for awhile,'' Schneider adds.      ``It's frustrating.''       England, the chief judge in Eastern California, says that      senior judges are the only reason why vacancies haven't      become more of a crisis.       ``We are living and dying with our senior judges,'' England      says. ``They're taking on cases they shouldn't have to, but      that's what's saving us.''       Of course, federal courts being overburdened is the symptom      of more than simply a lack of nominations and confirmations.       Since 1990, Congress has not passed major legislation      creating new judgeships, even as the war on drugs, and now      the surge in prosecution of undocumented immigrants, have      jammed up the system with exponentially more cases.       As a result, by 2013, there was a 39 percent uptick in the      number of overall filings, while only 4 percent more judges      were added to handle all that extra work.       Throw in the higher-than-normal number of vacancies, and      it's a recipe for an overburdened judiciary. After a three-     year wait, for instance, the Eastern District of California      finally got a vacancy filled last October. But Chief Judge      England says the crushing burden of too few judges hasn't      lessened.       ``One way or the other, Congress would need to give this      district more judges,'' he says. ``We need help--we have too      many trials. I'm booked for 2016 and 2017 already.''                                  ____                 [From the New York Times, May 6, 2016]        America's Trial Court Judges: Our Front Line for Justice                        (By Shira A. Scheindlin)       The outcry over the Senate's failure to hold hearings on      Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court is      fully justified. But that isn't the only judiciary scandal on      Capitol Hill. Even as the spotlight shines on the high court,      the Senate has refused to confirm dozens of uncontroversial      nominees to fill vacancies in the federal trial courts.       Such obstructionism has become an everyday occurrence. Just      last week, Senate Republicans refused to vote on 11 federal      district court nominees whom the Judiciary Committee had      already approved--even those who were supported by      Republicans in their home states. During President George W.      Bush's last two years in office, the Democratic-controlled      Senate confirmed about 57 district court judges. Since      Republicans took power in 2014, the Senate has confirmed only      15 of President Obama's trial court nominees.       This is an even bigger problem than Judge Garland's stalled      nomination. Trial court judges do the bulk of the work in the      federal court system: Last year nearly 375,000 new cases were      filed, while the Supreme Court justices issued just under 75      opinions. And because most trial court decisions are never      appealed, they become the final word in significant disputes      that affect millions of Americans.       I know this firsthand. I served as a trial judge for over      21 years, and stepped down from the bench last week. As I      walked out of a federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan on one      of my last days, an African-American United States marshal      asked me if he could have a word.       He explained that he had grown up in New York City's public      housing, and thanked me for my 2013 decision in the ``stop      and frisk'' case. (I ruled that the New York Police      Department's practice in which police officers stopped      hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers without reasonable      suspicion, a vast majority of whom were innocent African-     Americans and Latinos, was unconstitutional.)       ``You just can't know what a difference this has made to so      many people in my community,'' he said. ``You can't even      imagine.''       But I think I can. At the policy's peak in 2011, officers      stopped nearly 700,000 people. That number dropped to about      23,000 last year, and the policy change was not accompanied      by a rise in serious crime, despite dire predictions to the      contrary. As a result of my rulings and community outcry, the      Police Department agreed to reforms, which include better      record keeping, the use of police body cameras and the      abandonment of racial profiling.       Other examples abound. In 1974, Judge Jack Weinstein of the      Eastern District of New York found the de facto segregation      in a Coney Island public school to be unconstitutional, a      ruling affirmed on appeal. The school was ultimately      integrated under his supervision, and without the ``white      flight'' that politicians had feared would result.       And in one of the highest-profile civil rights cases ever      in a trial court, Leonard about a decade later that both the      housing and schools in Yonkers were intentionally segregated,      and ordered construction of integrated housing in the city.      An appeals court upheld this ruling, which, despite years of      public protest, immensely improved the living conditions for      thousands of Yonkers residents.       The influence of district judges has likewise had an effect      on national security. In the mid-2000s, Judge Alvin      Hellerstein, also from the Southern District of New York,      ordered the government to disclose photographs under the      Freedom of Information Act that depict the abuse of Abu      Ghraib detainees, which was affirmed by the appellate court.      Judge Hellerstein also effectively forced the government to      turn over the Department of Justice's infamous ``torture      memos,'' which incited a national conversation about whether      torture is ever appropriate.       Not every decision by district court judges benefits the      public: Last week Judge Thomas Schroeder of North Carolina's      Middle District upheld myriad legislative changes to the      state's voting rules that will result in reduced voting      opportunities for minorities, unless reversed.       Whether Judge Garland should be confirmed or not, there can      be no denying that Supreme Court nominations are inherently      political. So it's no surprise that they are drawn out for      ideological or partisan reasons. But district court      nominations are different. Ideology is not the issue:      Experience and competence are the only criteria.       And yet the Senate majority's policy of delaying qualified      district-court nominations on purely political grounds      undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of      the judiciary. This is especially worrisome because the      public's understanding of how justice is administered is most      likely based on its access to and experience with lower court      proceedings.       Presidential debates have focused on the Islamic State,      trade pacts and immigration policy; meanwhile, the next      president will most likely appoint 130 trial judges over the      next four years. The public needs to know what's at stake.      Trial judges must spot the issues, decide the outcomes and      fashion the remedies in all kinds of disputes. I cannot force      this Congress to do its job. But I urge voters not to forget      the White House's power to appoint all judges when they      choose the next president.
