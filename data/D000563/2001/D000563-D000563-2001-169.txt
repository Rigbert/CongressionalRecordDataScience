Alderman James Balcer is a hero by any definition, and the Bronze Star recently pinned to his chest is only a token symbol of a life marked by bravery and service.  The people of Chicago know Jim Balcer as Alderman Balcer, representing the 11th ward on the City Council. They know him as a strong advocate for the city's veterans and as an effective voice for his community. Few know more about military history or are more dedicated to understanding the challenges facing those who have fought for our country. During his four years on the city council, Alderman Balcer has worked tirelessly for his constituents and sung their praises without so much as a note from his own horn.  But long before he was Alderman Balcer, Jim was Pfc. Balcer in the U.S. Marine Corps. As an 18-year-old soldier more familiar with the streets of his home area of Bridgeport than the jungles of southeast Asia, Balcer was a member of the 9th Marine Regiment during the Vietnam War. In late February of 1969, Pfc. Balcer and his company were holding their position on a hilltop in the A Shau Valley in Laos. As a group of the soldiers descended into the valley below on a reconnaissance mission, enemy fire erupted from the dense foliage, trapping the group in a hail of bullets and shrapnel.  With dozens of young Marines killed and wounded at the bottom of the hill, it was Pfc. Jim Balcer who volunteered to lead the mission to rescue them. Through that long Laotian night, in the pouring rain and deep, treacherous mud, Balcer made trip after trip into the valley to reach his fallen comrades. Half-hour descents through the jungle were followed by nearly four hours of backbreaking climbs up steep and slippery embankments, under enemy fire and carrying makeshift stretchers made from ponchos.  Thanks to Pfc. Balcer and his fellow Marines, every member of the 9th Regiment who went into the valley that night in 1969 came out. The Bronze Star is given to soldiers who distinguish themselves ``by heroic or meritorious achievement or service . . . while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States or while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force.'' Ordinary language to describe extraordinary courage, but hardly enough to describe the actions of someone who to this day still tells his own story without a hint of bravado.  The City of Chicago is fortunate to have someone so tenacious and selfless on its side. Alderman Jim Balcer is as dedicated to Chicago and its people now as he was to his fellow soldiers then. A man of integrity and honor, he is to be commended on receiving the Bronze Star. Wear it proudly, Jim, for we are proud of you.                          ____________________
