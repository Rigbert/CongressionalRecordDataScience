Speaker, September 11, 2001, is a date that will forever be etched in our memories as a day our very way of life was attacked. These acts of cowardice took the lives of innocent souls away from their families and friends. My thoughts and prayers go out to the families who lost loved ones and my thanks go out to all of the emergency personnel who risked their lives to save others.  The perpetrators believe that our weakness is our freedom. They are so wrong. This will unite our country and they will soon know that freedom is our greatest strength. We should support President Bush and we should expeditiously make available all necessary means so that justice can be carried out. God Bless America.                          ____________________
