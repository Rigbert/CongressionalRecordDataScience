 President, the Senator from New York has asserted several times that NATO's enlargement to include Poland would for the first time bring NATO up to Russia's borders. This is because Poland shares a small border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.  As I mentioned in our floor debate last month, the Senator's assertion is factually incorrect. Ever since the founding of NATO in 1949, Russia--first as the Russian Republic in the Soviet Union, then since 1991 as the Russian Federation--has shared a border with Norway, a charter member of NATO.  Norway's relations with Russia have remained excellent throughout. In fact, Norway gives Russia foreign aid, as do many other NATO members, the United States included.  The Senator from New York responded by minimizing both the size and importance of the Russian-Norwegian border. Here again, he was incorrect.  First, in regard to length, the Russian-Norwegian border is nearly as long as Poland's border with the Kaliningrad exclave--104 miles versus 128 miles, to be exact.  Second, militarily speaking the Russian-Norwegian border is much more important than the Polish-Kaliningrad border. Norway abuts Russia's Kola Peninsula, one of the most heavily militarized regions on earth. Among the Kola Peninsula's armaments are nuclear weapons.  In spite of the strategically sensitive nature of the NATO-Russian border, for nearly half-a-century relations have remained very good.  One might ask why. Aside from the tact and diplomacy of the Norwegians, another reason may be that NATO has not permanently stationed in Norway troops from other Alliance countries.  Mr. President, this is precisely what NATO declared on March 14, 1997 as the Alliance's policy for the prospective new members. So let's dispose of this bogey-man: Russia will not have to worry about large numbers of permanently stationed non-Polish NATO troops facing Kaliningrad.  I would like to return to geography for a few minutes, since the Senator from New York and the Senator from Virginia have brought this topic up several times.  I think that they would agree that in the bad, old Soviet Union the non-Russian Republics were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Moscow. Ethnic Russians who took their orders directly from the Kremlin filled the key positions in the Republics' political, economic, and military structures.  In that context, it is important to note that since Turkey entered NATO in 1952, the Alliance had a common border with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia--at that time Russian-ruled parts of the old Soviet Union.  For the record, that border was considerably longer than either the Russian-Norwegian or the Polish-Kaliningrad borders--328 miles long, to be exact.  So for nearly forty years, NATO had a lengthy border with the strategically vital southwestern flank of the Russian-ruled Soviet Union.  In fact, Mr. President, even today there are Russian troops stationed in the independent states of Armenia and Georgia.  So, once again, let's finally put to rest the nonsensical argument that Poland's joining NATO would constitute a new geographic move by NATO up to Russia's borders. It just isn't true.            alleged aggressive posture of nato toward russia  Moreover, the opponents of enlargement, the Senator from New York included, have asserted that by enlarging to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, NATO will be assuming a militarily aggressive posture toward Russia.  Mr. President, nothing could be further from the truth. NATO simply does not threaten Russia. Never did--never will.  Critics often characterize NATO's enlargement as if it were a massive deployment toward Russia. In reality, NATO's entire evolution since the end of the Cold War has been in the other direction, a fact which is patently clear to Moscow.  Since 1991, NATO countries have greatly substantially reduced their military forces, as measured by total spending, spending as a proportion of GDP, and by overall force levels.  American troop levels in Europe have declined by over two-thirds, down from a peak of over 300,000 to about 100,000 today.  NATO's forces during this period have moved away from Moscow, not toward it, as the Alliance abandoned its Cold War doctrine of forward, stationary defenses and relied instead on rapid reaction.  These changes have made NATO's posture unambiguously less threatening to Russia. The Alliance's enlargement does not appreciably change this fact.  Those who characterize NATO's enlargement as a movement of NATO power into Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are simply wrong, and they do the public a grave disservice by suggesting this is the case.  The record has been clear for well over a year that this is not what enlargement means. In December 1996, the Alliance declared that it had ``no intention, no plan, and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members,'' and has clarified that this statement subsumes nuclear weapon storage sites.  I have already cited the March 1997 statement regarding no need to move combat troops into the territory of the new members.  Moreover, the willingness of all Allies to negotiate adaptations to the Treaty on Conventional Force in Europe (CFE) is a clear signal to Moscow that NATO seeks a post-Cold War arms build-down, not a build up.                     nato's reaching out to moscow  NATO enlargement to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic,in the real world--not the rhetorical world--will not trigger an adverse Russian reaction. Why? Because the U.S. and our allies have taken so many steps to reach out to Russia since the end of the Cold War.  As I mentioned in my opening statement on Monday, the critics of enlargement are guilty of what might be called the ``Weimar Fallacy.'' They suggest that Russians will see NATO enlargement as post-Cold War punishment, which will trigger a nationalist backlash in the same way that the Treaty of Versailles helped to trigger the rise of National Socialism in Germany.  But the supposed parallel is utterly specious. The Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to pay billions in reparation to the victors of World War I. by contrast, we and our allies imposed no reparations on Moscow after the Cold War.  On the contrary, reparations went in the other direction. We and our allies have provided Moscow with over $100 billion since 1991 to aid its political and economic reform.  One of the most important forms of aid has been through the Cooperative Threat Reduction program--known popularly as the Nunn-Lugar Program--which has provided $2.3 billion to Russia and other former Soviet states since 1992, with $442 million requested for FY99.  Today, this program is supporting the annual elimination of over 20 Russian SS-18s and 10 SSBNs. The Russians have proposed using the program to support processing of missile materials from dismantled Russian warheads for storage at the Mayak facility.  Through this program, we are helping to finance efforts that make both our countries safer--not punishing the Russians at their own expense.  The spurious comparison to Weimar Germany is also a fallacy because we and our allies have sought to integrate Russia into the transatlantic community, not isolate it.  In 1991, we made Russia and the other former Soviet states part of NATO's North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and part of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the successor to the NACC, in 1997. In 1994, we made Russia and the other newly independent states part of the Partnership for Peace program.  After the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, NATO invited Russia to participate in the coalition in Bosnia, and today Russia has an airborne brigade of approximately 1,400 troops servicing in northern Bosnia under NATO command alongside American and other NATO forces.  In May 1997, President Yeltsin joined President Clinton and the other NATO leaders in signing the NATO-Russia Founding Act. The Permanent Joint Council has met several times at the ministerial level since then, and proved a useful forum for discussions with Russia on security issues of mutual concern.  Our efforts to reach out to Russia go well beyond NATO. In March 1997, at their summit in Helsinki, President Clinton told President Yeltsin that the U.S. would support Russia efforts to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).  In May 1997, President Yeltsin joined G-7 leaders in Denver to inaugurate the ``summit of the Eight.'' The ``Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission'' continued to meet during the very period that NATO was pursuing its enlargement, and American cooperation with Russia continues on a wide range of cultural, scientific, technological, and environmental efforts, such as our continuing efforts in space.                       Russia's Nuclear Doctrine  The Senator from new York in a recent speech in Texas warned darkly that NATO enlargement might lead to nuclear war. With all due respect to my good friend, I think his assertion is incorrect and alarmist.  He and other opponents of NATO enlargement have underscored Russia's disproportionate reliance on its nuclear forces, sometimes even resorting to scare tactics.  It is well known that the dissolution of the Soviet empire and Russia's transition to a market economy required jolting changes within Russia. Since 1990 Russia's economy has contracted by perhaps 40 percent and has only recently established and shown the first signs of recovery.  Partly as a result, Russian military spending contracted substantially. Russia's number of combat-ready divisions has also declined.  Beyond these measures, non-payment of wages and other factors have dampened morale among officers and enlisted personnel. The war in Chechnya showed the cumulative toll on Russia's forces.  Given this decline in Russia's conventional forces, it is understandable that Russia has apparently placed a heavier reliance on nuclear weapons. But this change became evident as early as 1992, when Russia declared that it would no longer abide by its previous policy of ``no first use'' of nuclear weapons.  There are many signs that ``no first use'' had been more of a propaganda tool than an actual reflection of Soviet policy, but the declared abandonment of this policy was significant. The move away from ``no first use'' gained a higher profile when it began to be discussed in public in 1997.  The Senator from New York and other proponents of NATO enlargement have recently charged that this increased reliance on nuclear forces was a consequence of Russia's fear of NATO's enlargement. This analysis is simply not credible.  First, as noted earlier, NATO's enlargement results in no significant increase in NATO's military capability relative to Russia.  Second, it is hardly likely that NATO's enlargement, begun in 1994, could have triggered a change in Russian policy that began in 1992. The fact is that opponents of NATO enlargement have constructed this argument retroactively.  The same is true for those who have attributed delays in Duma ratification of START II to NATO enlargement. Well before NATO enlargement was proposed, Duma critics of START II based their opposition on other arguments, from the cost of compliance with START II to the loss of national pride.  NATO enlargement became another useful argument for confirmed opponents, but hardly the cause of their opposition.  In any case, the Russian government is now moving to push ratification of START II through the Duma, perhaps by the end of June--another sign that NATO enlargement is no impediment to constructive relations with Russia or progress on arms control.  So, I would sum up by reminding my friend, the Senator from New York, of four key facts:  First, Poland's accession to NATO will not be creating a geographically new move of the Alliance to Russia's borders. It has had a strategically important border with Russia in the north for nearly fifty years, plus one in the south with Russian-ruled territory.  Second, there is absolutely no comparison with the allies' trimuphalist behavior toward defeated Germany after World War One and the reaching out of the United States and its NATO partners to Russia after it lost the Cold War.  Third, NATO has conclusively demonstrated through its movements of troops and equipment away from Russia's borders, and by concluding and carrying out significant arms control agreements, that it in no way threatens Russia.  Finally, it is completely false--even irresponsible--to assert that NATO enlargement is driving the world toward nuclear war. Cooperation, not confrontation is occurring on many fronts.  Russia need have no fear from NATO enlargement.
