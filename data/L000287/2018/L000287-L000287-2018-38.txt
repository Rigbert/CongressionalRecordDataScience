Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Ms. Tara Lynn Jones, a warm and dynamic spirit. It is hard to believe that this young woman with her beautiful smile and passion for her community is no longer with us.  Born and raised in Maryland, Ms. Jones graduated from La Reine High School before attending Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia where she earned an undergraduate degree in chemistry. Tara continued her education at George Washington University and received a master's degree in public health, epidemiology, and biostatistics and a certificate in public management.  Mr. Speaker, throughout her career Tara seamlessly moved between the business world and public service. Many remember her work as the Director of Neighborhood Services when Ms. Jones worked to connect residents to health, economic, and social justice services and programs in Washington, D.C. She continued to apply this experience in building coalitions, developing national media campaigns, and coordinating effective events across the country.  I, along with many of my colleagues--especially those of us who serve in the Congressional Black Caucus--truly learned to appreciate and respect Tara's unique gifts and skills when she served as the Vice President of Public Affairs for BET Networks. During a challenging and pivotal time in our nation's history, Ms. Jones used her platform to bring together young people, corporations, media, and policy makers to address the key, core civil rights and social justice matters of the day.  At every opportunity, Ms. Jones built bridges and made new friends. She was a communicator and a convener whose faith inspired a deep passion for service and mentorship in the Capital City Chapter of Links, Inc., Destination DC, and ColorComm. In recent years, Tara continued to employ her expertise on a global scale as the founder of the Tara Jones Group, LLC, which incorporated brand marketing, strategic solutions, and business development with increasing diversity and inclusion.  As an active, engaged member of the National Urban League, and in particular during her tenure as President of the Washington Thursday Network, Tara continued the mission of integrating the necessary pursuit of opportunity, equity, equality, and justice into both her personal and professional life.  Mr. Speaker, Ms. Jones truly dedicated her life to serving others--she managed to be everywhere and everything to everyone she met. As one who knew and worked alongside the late and great, Whitney Young, Jr., who served as the executive director of the National Urban League during pivotal years of the Civil Rights Movement, I can say that she epitomized his spirit and continued his legacy.  Tara Lynn Jones was a thoughtful, loving, and kind young woman who leaves behind a legacy of excellence as she joins her beloved brother Edward V. Jones, Jr. During this difficult time, I extend my deepest condolences to Tara's loving parents--Edward and Sharon Jones; her cherished nieces--Jasmine, Brittany, Amber, and Nyema Jones; and the innumerable family, friends, colleagues, and members of the Spelman and Links sisterhoods who mourn the passing of this beautiful spirit.                          ____________________
