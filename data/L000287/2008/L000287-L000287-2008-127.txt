Madam Speaker, it is an honor for me to help celebrate the Centennial Anniversary of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated. For the past 100 years, the ladies of Alpha Kappa Alpha have served as leaders in the United States and throughout the world. Since their founding in 1908, Alpha Kappa Alpha has been one of the most successful historically Black sororities and continues its strong community work today.  In particular, I would like to recognize the South Atlantic Region of Alpha Kappa Alpha, which includes undergraduate and graduate chapters from the states of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. This Region's monumental history includes one of the sorority's original founders, Mrs. Marie Woolfolk Taylor, two former International Presidents, Dr. Mary Shy Scott and Dr. Norma Solomon White and the first honorary member, Mrs. Coretta Scott King.  Today through the leadership of Ms. Ella Springs Jones, current regional director, the ladies of Alpha Kappa Alpha continue to leave their mark in the community. Through programs such as B.R.A.T.S (Brilliant, Responsible, Alert, and Talented Scholars) Program, high school students are provided academic, health and economic support to make their dreams viable and support the growth of the African American community.  Madam Speaker, I extend my deepest gratitude to the women of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority for their service to our communities, in the United States and across the world, on this historic day.                          ____________________
