 President, I am pleased to offer this amendment to protect the safety of employees at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, as well as the safety of the greater Paducah community.  The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant produces enriched uranium and employs some 1,800 people. By all who live in the Paducah area, the Gaseous Diffusion Plant, which occupies more than 3,400 acres, is regarded as a nuclear plant. This year, the plant is undergoing a transition from being a Department of Energy owned and operated facility to one owned by the U.S. Enrichment Corporation and operated by private contract. The plant will be under the regulatory authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by year's end.  Historically, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant has maintained an on-premises security force to protect the plant and employees from sabotage, theft or unauthorized control of the nuclear material. The security personnel are currently authorized to make arrests, and they carry firearms in support of their mission. In the past several years, these plant security officers have foiled a number of unauthorized entries onto plant premises, protected the facility from disgruntled former employees and enforced security rules against contract employees who have access to the plant. In an era of domestic terrorism, as in the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings, these security employees perform an increasingly vital function.  In the transition from DOE to NRC supervision, the security force currently employed at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, absent adoption of this amendment, will be downgraded. under current NRC regulations, they will lose their authority to make arrests and carry firearms. But privatization does not change the nature of the work or the risk at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The plant will continue to produce radioactive enriched uranium.  The amendment simply continues the authority of the plant security personnel at enriched uranium facilities to execute arrests and carry firearms. Without this authority for the security officers at the plant, the plant will have to rely on area law enforcement officials to respond in emergency situations. The city of Paducah has informed plant officials that their response time for their police and firefighters will be approximately 20 minutes. The Kentucky State Police has a special response team which would assist the Paducah facility in the event of a threat to public safety. That special response team is located in Frankfort, halfway across the State from Paducah and it would take 4 hours to have a helicopter respond to an emergency at the Paducah plant. The McCracken County Sheriff's Department has expressed serious concern at the prospect of the security force losing its arrest authority. McCracken County Sheriff Frank Augustus has advised the U.S. Enrichment Corporation of the problems his department would encounter in responding to an emergency call by the Paducah plant:       If a hostile situation should occur, I could not guarantee      adequate personnel or response time due to our department's      manpower shortage. When only seconds matter I am very much      afraid it would take many minutes to adequately respond.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of Sheriff Augustus be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Sheriff of McCracken County,                                       Paducah, KY, July 10, 1996.     Bern Stapleton,     Safeguard and Security Associate, U.S. Enrichment Corp.,          Bethesda, MD.       Dear Mr. Stapleton: It has recently been brought to my      attention that Security personnel at the Paducah Gaseous      Diffusion Plant may possibly lose their arrest authority and      their ability to be armed. This issue causes me a great deal      of concern.       I understand the police operation of the Paducah Gaseous      Diffusion Plant is responsible for the protection of      classified material, sensitive nuclear material, government      property, and over 2,200 employees situated on 3,423 acres,      including 748 acres of fenced area. In contrast, the      McCracken County Sheriff's department is responsible for      patrolling over 250 square miles in order to meet the needs      of our County's citizens. Since I took office in 1994,      citizens' calls for law enforcement have increased by 23,000      calls. Crime is on the rise in McCracken County and due to      financial constraints, my department has only 17 full-time      road deputies to handle these increases.       I am extremely concerned that if a major problem should      arise at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant it would be      extremely difficult for my department to provide proper      security for such a sizable site until more enforcement could      arrive. If a hostile situation should occur, I could not      guarantee adequate personnel or response time due to our      department's manpower shortage. When only seconds matter I am      very much afraid it would take many minutes to adequately      respond.       Another issue that must be addressed is our officers' lack      of knowledge in regard to the actual facility and surrounding      grounds. As noted above, the immense size of this facility      poses many problems in regard to providing adequate safety to      plant employees as well as my deputies.       In my opinion, the current security staff is of immense      value to the safety of the plant facility and the employees      that work within. I fully understand the move toward      privatization necessitates many changes in operations that      have been in place for many years. I would like to strongly      recommend, however, that a long serious look be taken at      proposed changes in the security force at the Paducah Plant      before a final decision is made. I am sure that your utmost      concern,     as well as it is mine, is for the safety of the people of      McCracken County as well as the safekeeping of the Plant,      whether it remains a government facility or is privatized in      the future.       I would be more than happy to discuss this matter with you      in more detail at your convenience. Please feel free to call      me.           Very truly yours,                                                   Frank Augustus,                                         McCracken County Sheriff.  Mr. McCONNELL. The bottom line, Mr. President, is that the employees of the Gaseous Diffusion Plant, as well as the residents of Paducah are entitled to an immediate response to an emergency situation. While the security force may need assistance in the event of a serious threat, the employees should not be left unprotected while local law enforcement responds.  This amendment does not add any additional security protection to the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant; it maintains the status quo, allowing the current security officers to continue doing their job, protecting the plant and employees from danger. I urge the adoption of my amendment.                           amendment no. 5109       On page 5 add the following between lines 2 and 3:      ``Seekonk River, Rhode Island bridge removal $650,000;''.                                                                    ____                           amendment no. 5110(Purpose: To provide funding for the Secretary of the Army to maintain   Compton Creek Channel, Los Angeles County drainage area, California)       On page 7, line 6, after ``facilities'', insert the      following: ``, and of which $500,000 shall be made available      for the maintenance of Compton Creek Channel, Los Angeles      County drainage area, California''.                                                                    ____                           amendment no. 5111(Purpose: To provide funding for the Secretary of the Army to carry out   the restoration study for Bolinas Lagoon, Marin County, California)       On page 2, between lines 24 and 25, insert the following:      ``Bolinas Lagoon restoration study, Marin County, California,      $500,000;''.
