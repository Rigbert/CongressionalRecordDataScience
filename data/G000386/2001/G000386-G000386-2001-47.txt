 President, I rise to pay tribute to a departing Senate Finance Committee staffer, Monica Tencate. She has served the Senate with great distinction, and it is with much sadness that I am bidding her goodbye. I'd like to take a few moments to describe her contribution.  Monica came to the Senate from California in 1998, and joined Chairman Roth's Finance Committee health team. After effective service there, she moved to Senator Frist's Subcommittee on Public Health, making a tremendous contribution on a broad range of challenging HELP Committee issues. I know her years with Senator Frist were very rewarding ones for her, so I was delighted that she was willing to return to the Finance Committee to work with me, as Director of the Finance Committee's health policy team.  As I look back at this year, Monica was a real leader in the Committee's effort to strengthen and improve Medicare for the 21st Century, including prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. She did a stellar job in helping to assemble a Tripartisan group, which put forward a framework for future success in this area. Due to the September 11 terrorist attacks, making major improvements to Medicare will have to wait until 2002. I believe, however, that we've laid a solid foundation for next year's efforts, and Monica's contribution was indispensable.  Monica also played a key role in the Committee's efforts to help provide coverage to the uninsured, to streamline Medicare regulations for beneficiaries and providers, and to address potentially serious problems posed by the new hospital outpatient payment system. She's done all this while keeping in mind the reality that our federal health programs aren't free--it's hard-working Americans who pay for them. It's easy to lose sight of that fact here inside the Beltway, but Monica never has.  Monica's contribution to me and to the Senate, in fact, went beyond policy and politics. She was a true team player, earning the respect of everyone she worked with, and the affection of her fellow Finance Committee staffers. And she did all this during one of this body's most tumultuous years in recent history--a year we'll all remember for the 50-50 Senate, the change in party control, the September 11 attacks, and finally the anthrax attack that drove many of us out of our offices. She served in her extraordinarily challenging job under these difficult circumstances with grace, commitment, and good humor. She will be sorely missed.  Now Monica is heading home to San Diego, to rejoin her husband Mike, who's also serving the nation in the United States Marines. I wish her and Mike every blessing in this new phase of their life, and I extend to her my deepest thanks.                          ____________________
