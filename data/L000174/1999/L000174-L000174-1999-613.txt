CRAIG. I will not yield for a moment. Let me correct another area the Senator from New York and I had a disagreement on, but that is a gentlemanly disagreement. We still disagree. That deals with pawnshops.  In the Brady environment--that was the period of time in which we were building the national background check--a 3-day period was instituted, not to keep the gun from a person, but to check a person's background for the purpose of finding out whether it was legal for that person to own a firearm, whether the person was a felon or not. If, during that period of time, you pawned your gun at a pawnshop and then you went back to retrieve it, the pawnshop owner gave it back to you, no questions asked. It was your gun, your name was on it, you had the pawnshop ticket; as long as you could show ID, you got your gun back.  ATF and this administration are now interpreting this differently through instant check. They are saying you have to go through a background check again, and there are lawsuits out there in the marketplace today because of that.  It is very important for the Record to show what happens. If I am the person who takes a gun to a pawnshop and I pawn my gun, if I have my pawn ticket, within 24 hours the pawnshop owner must not only report the pawning of that gun to the local law enforcement authority with the serial numbers of the gun and my name--that is what goes on today in the law. So there is a background check, per se, because if my name happens to come up the name of a felon, I will never get that gun back; the law enforcement can go and collect it.  But what is happening now is that I go in 3 months later to get my gun. I have my money and my ticket and my record is clear. The ATF, and this administration, are saying: Foul. You have to go through a background check.  We are saying that is wrong. We are reinstating the Brady environment during the period of the 3-day waiting period.
