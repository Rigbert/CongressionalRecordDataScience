President, I rise today to express my support for and cosponsorship of the Hatch-Durbin amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill to increase funding for the Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by $2 million.  As we all know, the high costs of prescription drugs are on the minds of Americans because having access to affordable prescription drugs is essential for people of all ages. Over the next 5 years, the patents of name brand drugs with approximately $22 billion in sales will expire. Consumers will save millions of dollars from generic prescription drug alternatives. This will help to alleviate cost pressures facing some of our most vulnerable citizens--seniors and the chronically ill.  The FDA will be able to help make drugs more affordable only if it has adequate resources to review and approve generic drug applications in a timely manner. In recent years, I have worked with Senators Specter, Harkin, and other cosponsors of this amendment to urge our colleagues to increase funds for the Office of Generic Drugs. These efforts have paid off in a reduction in the backlog of generic drug applications. Unfortunately, the President did not request an increase for the Office of Generic Drugs for the 2001 fiscal year. However, the workload for the office continues to increase and for the first time in several years, the backlog of applications has increased rather than continue to decline.  An increase of $2 million for the Office of Generic Drugs will be used for training and the upgrade of information technology systems that will allow for the electronic submission and review of generic drug applications.  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. This amendment will put the review record of the Office of Generic Drugs back on course.
