We are going to have better regulations if, in fact, you ask folks: Is this going to work? Maybe tweak it, maybe repeal it. Who knows. The President himself said that.  In addition, I have encouraged the administration to review any comments received on these regulations that have already been issued for any concerns that indicate a potential to further our economic problems and crises.  In closing, I invite my friends on both sides of the aisle to sign on as a cosponsor of my legislation, realizing the immense opportunities it creates for meaningful review and possible revocation of regulations counter to our Nation's growth.  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
