 President, in May, after weeks of Democratic efforts, Congress extended unemployment benefits for the 2\1/2\ million Americans who have been laid off due to the economic downturn in this country. So far, our Republican colleagues have refused to include assistance for the 1.1 million Americans who have been hit hardest by this economic crisis--those long-term unemployed who have already run out of their unemployment benefits.  Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer this amendment before the Senate. The amendment will provide additional unemployment insurance compensation to more than 1 million Americans who have exhausted all of their unemployment insurance benefits.  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Kennedy, Durbin, Daschle, Sarbanes, Clinton, and Reed as cosponsors of my amendment.
