 President, I don't take exception to anything the Senator from Nevada stated. I simply add, we have been on this very important bankruptcy reform legislation over a week and we have gotten to where we are on this legislation only because we have had an extreme amount of bipartisan cooperation, starting with the introduction of the bill by Senator Torricelli and myself, getting it out of the Judiciary Committee in April by a vote of 14-4, awaiting our place in line to come up on the floor of the Senate, and having had considerable success eliminating a lot of amendments and hoping to get it to conference before we adjourn for the first session of the 106th Congress.  We have had that bipartisan cooperation. I expect to continue to work with the Senator from Nevada; the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee; and Senator Torricelli, my partner on the subcommittee, to bring this bill to finality.
