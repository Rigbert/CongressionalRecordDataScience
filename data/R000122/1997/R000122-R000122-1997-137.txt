President, I rise to recognize the Rhode Island Historical Society on the occasion of its 175th anniversary.  Founded in 1822, the Rhode Island Historical Society was established for the purpose of rescuing artifacts and records pertaining to the history of our State and spreading the legacy of Rhode Island history. The society today represents the fourth oldest historical society in the United States and remains as one of the noble guardians of American history and culture. Over the years the society's repository of Rhode Island history and culture has grown under the stewardship of generations of knowledgeable scholars, dedicated staff, and the generosity of gracious benefactors.  From its humble beginnings, the society has served as a haven for precious artifacts which serve to record and preserve the rich history of Rhode Island. Today, we mark not only the past accomplishments of the Rhode Island Historical Society, but we pause at an exciting threshold as we embark upon the creation of Heritage Harbor.  Housed at the site of a former power plant at the head of Narragansett Bay, the historical society will lead a consortium of museums and cultural organizations in forming Heritage Harbor. The new community will bring together the stories and treasures of the Ocean State through entertainment and enlightenment. Remaining true to Rhode Island's founder Roger Williams, this new endeavor will be a lively experiment. It will teach, entertain, and inspire. The Heritage Harbor promises to bring together the diverse cultures and communities of Rhode Island to celebrate the time, traditions, and our many contributions to collective greatness of this Nation.  Mr. President, I would ask that my colleagues join me in applauding the Rhode Island Historical Society as we mark this milestone of 175 years, celebrating its legacy, both past and future.                          ____________________
