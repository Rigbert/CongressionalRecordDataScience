Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come.  Mr. Speaker, I want to say I yield to my friend, but maybe I had better say it at the end to see how pleasant we are. I yield to the majority leader.  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)                              {time}  1115  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I first want to begin by thanking my friend. Today could be our last scheduled colloquy together.  Over the years, we have had many spirited debates on this floor. We have celebrated moments of cooperation, from tackling the opioid epidemic to fighting human trafficking to leveling tough sanctions on American adversaries. As my friend knows, most of what we do in this Chamber is bipartisan.  A study by Quorum found that the 115th Congress enacted the highest percentage of bipartisan bills of any Congress in the last 20 years. That success could not have happened without a lot of working across the aisle to find common ground.  Now, beyond legislation, I look forward to continuing to work with my friend on our shared passion for a more efficient, effective, and accountable government through events like Congressional Hackathon.
