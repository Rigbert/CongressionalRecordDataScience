President, I rise today to introduce the ``Anti-Spoofing Penalty Modernization Act of 2019'' with my colleague, Senator Sinema, who serves with me on the Senate Committee on Aging, which I chair. I am also pleased that Senators Hawley, Peters, and McSally have joined as original cosponsors.  This morning, the Senate Aging Committee held its 23rd hearing in the past six years to examine scams targeting our Nation's seniors. Scams the Committee has examined include the infamous IRS imposter scam the Jamaican Lottery scam, computer tech support scams, grandparent scams, elder financial exploitation, identity theft, and the notorious ``Drug Mule'' scam--where seniors are tricked into unwittingly serving as drug couriers.  Two things are central to nearly all of these scams: first, the scams are initiated by robocallers who cast a wide net in their hunt for potential victims, and second, the scammers ``spoof' the victim's Caller-ID to mask their identity, a key to the success of their outrageous frauds. When victims see the ``Internal Revenue Service'' or the ``local Sheriff's Department'' pop-up on their Caller-ID, they are understandably worried, scared, and often easily hustled into doing whatever the scammers demand.  Last year, robocallers generated more than 26 billion unwanted calls that reached American mobile phones. When landlines are included, the number soars to 48 billion. In Maine alone, our residents received an astonishing 93 million robocalls last year. That averages out to 73 calls to every person in Maine. So far this year, scammers are on pace to generate more than 58 billion unwanted, illegal robocalls targeting Americans.  Putting a stop to these illegal robocalls requires a coordinated approach from all levels of our government, working in coordination with the private sector. Recently, this body overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan ``TRACED Act,'' which makes a number of important changes to our law that will help make it easier to fight illegal robocalls, such as increasing civil penalties on robocallers and extending the statute of limitations for violations to three years. The TRACED Act also requires telecommunications carriers to implement the so-called SHAKEN/STIR technology to verify whether Caller-IDs that appear on incoming calls are authentic. When fully implemented, this technology will be a major advance against illegal spoofing. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the TRACED Act, and I am hopeful it will soon become law.  The bipartisan bill we are introducing today complements the TRACED Act by doubling the penalties on illegal spoofing. Except for inflation adjustments, the penalties on illegal spoofing have not been updated since they were first passed into law through the Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009. Our bill also extends the statute of limitations to three years for spoofing violations to match the extension for robocalling violations included in the TRACED Act.  Mr. President, putting an end to the scourge of illegal robocalls will take an aware public, aggressive action by regulators and law enforcement agencies, and a coordinated effort at every level of our telecommunications industry. The enhanced penalties called for by the ``Anti-Spoofing Penalty Modernization Act'' are an important tool in the fight. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________
