Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2370) to amend the Organic Act of Guam for the purposes of clarifying the local judicial structure and the office of Attorney General, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 2370       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Guam Organic Act Amendments      of 1998''.     SEC. 2. ATTORNEY GENERAL OF GUAM.       Section 29 of the Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. 1421g) is      amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:       ``(d)(1) The Attorney General of Guam shall be the Chief      Legal Officer of the Government of Guam. At such time as the      Office of the Attorney General of Guam shall next become      vacant, the Attorney General of Guam shall be appointed by      the Governor of Guam with the advice and consent of the      legislature, and shall serve at the pleasure of the Governor      of Guam.       ``(2) Instead of an appointed Attorney General, the      legislature may, by law, provide for the election of the      Attorney General of Guam by the qualified voters of Guam in      general elections after 1998 in which the Governor of Guam is      elected. The term of an elected Attorney General shall be 4      years. The Attorney General may be removed by the people of      Guam according to the procedures specified in section 9-A of      this Act or may be removed for cause in accordance with      procedures established by the legislature in law. A vacancy      in the office of an elected Attorney General shall be      filled--       ``(A) by appointment by the Governor of Guam if such      vacancy occurs less than 6 months before a general election      for the Office of Attorney General of Guam; or       ``(B) by a special election held no sooner than 3 months      after such vacancy occurs and no later than 6 months before a      general election for Attorney General of Guam, and by      appointment by the Governor of Guam pending a special      election under this subparagraph.''.     SEC. 3. LEGISLATIVE QUORUM.       Section 12 of the Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. 1423b) is      amended by striking ``eleven'' and inserting ``a simple      majority''.     SEC. 4. CLARIFICATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER.       The first sentence of section 11 of the Organic Act of Guam      (48 U.S.C. 1423a) is amended--       (1) by inserting ``rightful'' before ``subjects''; and       (2) by striking ``legislation of local application'' and      inserting ``legislation''.
