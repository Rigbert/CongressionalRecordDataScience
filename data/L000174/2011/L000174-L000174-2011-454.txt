The vacancy rate we reduced from 10 percent at the end of President Clinton's term to less than 4 percent in 2008 has now risen back to over 10 percent. In contrast to the sharp reduction in vacancies we made during President Bush's first 2 years when the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed 100 of his judicial nominations, only 60 of President Obama's judicial nominations were allowed to be considered and confirmed during his first 2 years. We have not kept up with the rate of attrition, let alone brought the vacancies down. By now they should have been cut in half. Instead, they continue to hover around 100. After tonight's confirmation, they will still number 96.  The Senate must do better. The Nation cannot afford further delays by the Senate in taking action on the nominations pending before it. Judicial vacancies on courts throughout the country hinder the Federal judiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a backlog of cases that prevents people from having their day in court. This is unacceptable.  We can consider and confirm this President's nominations to the Federal bench in a timely manner. President Obama has worked with Democratic and Republican home State Senators to identify superbly qualified, consensus nominations. The nominations on the Executive Calendar should not be controversial. They all have the support of their home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats. All have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution.  During President Bush's first term, his first 4 tumultuous years in office, we proceeded to confirm 205 of his judicial nominations. We confirmed 100 of those during the 17 months I was chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office. So far in President Obama's third year in office, the Senate has only been allowed to consider 72 of his Federal circuit and district court nominees. We remain well short of the benchmark we set during the Bush administration. When we approach it we can reduce vacancies from the historically high levels at which they have remained throughout these first 3 years of the Obama administration to the historically low level we reached toward the end of the Bush administration.  I have thanked the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, for his cooperation this year. I was pleased to see him taking credit for what he called ``our rapid pace.'' I was encouraged by his commitment to ``continue to move consensus nominees through the confirmation process.'' That should be good news to Ms. Jackson and the other judicial nominees now available and ready to be confirmed without further delay.  My friend from Iowa is fond of pointing to the vacancies for which there are not nominees. Of course, some of that is attributable to a lack of cooperation by certain home State Senators with the White House. Nonetheless, I agree with the Senator from Iowa that we can do little about confirming nominations we do not have. What we can do is proceed expeditiously with the qualified nominations the President has sent to the Senate.  In that regard, I would temper my friend's extolling our achievements this year by observing that every judge confirmed so far this year could and should have been confirmed last year. Every one of them was unanimously reported last year and would have been confirmed had Republicans not objected and created a new rule of obstruction after midterm elections. We have long had the ``Thurmond rule'' to describe how Senator Thurmond shut down the confirmation process in advance of the 1980 Presidential election. Last year's shutdown was something new. I cannot remember a time when so many consensus nominees were left without Senate action at the midterm point of a Presidency. That new level of obstruction has contributed to our being so far behind and judicial vacancies having been perpetuated at so high a level for too long.                               Exhibit 1                                               U.S. District Court                                 for the District of Columbia,                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2010.     Re Judicial Vacancies--United States District Court for the          District of Columbia     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of the      judges of the United States District Court for the District      of Columbia, I request that the Senate act soon to fill the      vacancies that exist at our Court.       Of our 15 authorized judgeships, we currently have four      vacancies. One has been vacant since January 2007. With the      additional vacancy that will result from Judge Ricardo M.      Urbina's assumption of senior status, effective January 31,      2011, this Court faces the prospect of having only 10 of its      15 authorized judgeships filled. The severe impact of this      situation already is being felt and will only increase over      time. The challenging caseload that our Court regularly      handles includes many involving national security issues, as      well as other issues of national significance. A large number      of these complex, high-profile cases demand significant time      and attention from each of our judges.       Without a complement of new judges, it is difficult to      foresee how our remaining active judges will be able to keep      up with the heavy volume of cases that faces us. A 33 percent      vacancy ratio is quite extraordinary.       Two nominees (Beryl Howell and Robert Wilkins) have been      reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and await      floor votes; two nominees (James Boasberg and Amy Jackson)      have had their hearings and hopefully will soon be reported      out of Committee.       We hope the Senate will act quickly to fill this Court's      vacancies so the citizens of the District of Columbia and the      Federal Government and other litigants who appear before us      continue to enjoy the high quality of justice they deserve.           Sincerely,                                                Royce C. Lamberth,     Chief Judge.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2                [From the Palm Beach Post, Mar. 6, 2011]Federal Judge Vacancies: Confirmation Lag Keeping Benches Cool in South                                 Florida                           (By Jane Musgrave)       U.S. District Judge Daniel T.K. Hurley has been waiting 741      days--about two years--for his replacement to be named.       Although the genial 67-year-old former Palm Beach County      circuit judge planned to remain on the bench in a limited      capacity, he said the delay is worrisome.       ``One of the great concerns for the court as an institution      is that over time we'll have other vacancies, and if the      vacancies aren't filled in a timely manner,'' legal logjams      eventually will prevent people from getting their day in      court, he said.       With two of his colleagues--U.S. District Judges Alan Gold      in January and Paul Huck in July--joining him on what is      known as senior status, his concern is more than academic.       The glacial speed of the U.S. Senate's judicial      confirmation process, blamed on partisan politics, has      hobbled courts throughout the country.       In January, a judicial emergency was declared in Arizona.      To help judges deal with burgeoning immigration and border      security cases, the declaration lets them waive 70-day      speedy-trial requirements and not bring criminal defendants      to trial for as long as six months.       Although spurred by the shooting rampage that left Chief      Judge John Roll dead and U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords      wounded, the situation in Arizona was dire even before Roll's      death.       South Florida is in danger of a similar crisis. Like 26      district and appellate courts throughout the country, it is      on a federal watch list because of the high caseloads and      disappearing judges.       Today, a person filing a civil lawsuit in federal court can      expect to wait two years to get to trial, according to the      Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Such delays have      widespread and unintended ripple effects, said Ian Millhiser,      a policy analyst for the left-leaning Center for American      Progress.       ``It has serious consequences for business,'' he said.      ``Imagine you're a corporation with a multimillion- dollar      lawsuit hanging over your head. Even if you think you can win      it, you're not going to be hiring until it is resolved, and      it could take years.''       The number of seats that have remained vacant since      President Obama took office two years ago is unprecedented,      he said. Obama's predecessors enjoyed confirmation rates as      high as 93 percent, but less than 60 percent of his nominees      have been confirmed. George W. Bush had a 76 percent      confirmation rate during his first two years in office.       Though the Senate confirmed six federal judges last month,      98 seats are vacant, says the Office of U.S. Courts. More      vacancies are expected.       ``Federal judges are now retiring faster than they are      being replaced,'' Millhiser said.       Further, he said, 81 of the vacancies are district      judgeships, appointments that have historically never      generated controversy. Unlike appellate judges, who often      establish law, the work of the lower-court judges--drug and      immigration violations, job discrimination and defective-     product lawsuits--is generally routine.       ``It's not ideological,'' he said. 'There's no Democratic      or Republican way to set a summary judgment hearing.''       Rachel Brand, who oversaw judicial appointments as an      associate counsel to Bush, pointed out that Bush made      judicial appointments a priority. Although Obama initially      made a flurry of nominations, it slowed, she said in a panel      discussion in November sponsored by the American Constitution      Society for Law and Policy. Of the 98 vacancies, only 46      nominations are pending.       Other priorities, such as getting two U.S. Supreme Court      justices confirmed, seemed to distract Obama's      administration, she said.       Further, she said the delays can't be blamed solely on      Senate Republicans. ``You'd think (59) senators could do      something,'' she said of the Democratic majority that existed      until the party lost six seats in the November elections.       The problem, Millhiser said, is that Senate rules empower      ``the extreme fringes.'' Though Senate Majority Leader Harry      Reid, D-Nev., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,      recently cut a deal to speed nominees through floor votes,      that agreement means nothing if more ideological wills      prevail.       ``The Senate rules allow an single senator to allow 30      hours of debate,'' he said. ``The extreme fringe can prevent      a significant amount of progress. It creates a minority-rule      situation.''       Senate Judiciary Committee approval of Kathleen Williams,      the lawyer tapped to replace Hurley, has been delayed despite      the bipartisan support she received from Florida Sens. Marco      Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat. Obama      submitted her name to the committee in July.       Local attorneys said they are flummoxed by the delay in      confirming Williams, the federal public defender for      Florida's Southern District since 1995.       Other candidates have enjoyed bipartisan support. Of the 38      candidates who cleared the Judiciary Committee last year, 29      were endorsed unanimously but never presented for      confirmation to the full Senate, Millhiser said.       Among local attorneys, the conclusion seems obvious: ``it's      just partisan politics,'' Val Rodriguez said.       Miami attorney Neal Sonnett, a former president of the      American Judicature Society, which focuses on promoting an      independent judiciary, agreed. Last year Republican senators      blocked the confirmation process, hoping they would seize      control of the Senate in the November elections, he said. Now      it appears some are intent on stalling nominations until      after the 2012 elections, when they hope to put one of their      own back in the White House, he said.       So far, attorneys said they haven't seen lengthy delays in      getting cases heard and resolved in South Florida. Chief U.S.      District Judge Federico Moreno said the district is lucky      because seven senior judges still handle some cases. Further,      Hurley said, case filings have slowed, in part, because of      the economy.       While he credits the 15 full-time judges with moving cases      quickly, attorney Ted Babbitt says eventually something has      to give.       ``The average person is going to get hurt because they're      going to have to wait to have their cases heard,'' he said.                                  ____               [From the Associated Press, Mar. 7, 2011]             RI Judge Holdup Sends 2 Dozen Cases to NH, MA                          (By Ian MacDougall)       Providence, RI.--Rhode Island's top federal judge says a      four-year judicial vacancy left open amid partisan bickering      in the U.S. Senate has prompted her court to take the unusual      step of reassigning more than two dozen civil cases to judges      in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.       In an interview, Chief Judge Mary M. Lisi told The      Associated Press the vacancy has left her and Rhode Island's      other federal judge, William E. Smith, with a growing      caseload that has begun to reach a critical mass.       The vacancy ``has had a major impact on the business of the      court,'' Lisi said. ``We have an increasing caseload being      handled by only two people where three judges are      authorized.''       Lisi said her primary reason for moving the cases was that      she worried a lag in rendering decisions at key points in the      litigation would leave plaintiffs and defendants in the      lurch. She said she chose to reassign cases with important      motions pending.       ``Our job is to resolve cases and to do so in as timely and      efficient a manner as we can. And when our ability to do so      is hampered, I don't think that's good for any participants      in the process,'' she said.       A third judge, Ronald R. Lagueux, who is a senior judge,      has volunteered to help to ease the burden on Lisi and Smith.       The case reassignment is one example of a real effect and a      real cost, to travelling litigants, lawyers and judges of the      often-snarled judicial appointment process whose unknotting      U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts called for in      December.       ``Each political party has found it easy to turn on a dime      from decrying to defending     the blocking of judicial nominations, depending on their      changing political fortunes,'' Roberts wrote in his 2010      report on the federal judiciary. ``There remains . . . an      urgent need for the political branches to find a long-term      solution to this recurring problem.''       Twenty-five of the Rhode Island civil lawsuits were      reassigned to New Hampshire and two to Massachusetts in late      January, about two weeks after President Barack Obama      nominated Jack McConnell, a Rhode Island trial attorney, to      the state's vacant judgeship for the third time. The      nomination has faced resistance from some Senate Republicans      and staunch opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The      chamber claims McConnell's track record, which includes suing      former lead paint companies, evinces a bias against business      defendants.       McConnell declined to comment on his nomination.       In November 2007 almost a year after the vacancy opened      then-President George W. Bush nominated Lincoln Almond, a      federal magistrate judge in Rhode Island. His candidacy      fizzled after a lukewarm reception from U.S. Sens., Jack Reed      and Sheldon Whitehouse.       Normally, cases are assigned to judges elsewhere, who      follow the rules of the originating court, only when all      judges in a given district recuse themselves. Lisi says the      current situation is unique in recent state history.       Other districts facing stalled appointments have not yet      taken similar steps.       However, Peter Oppeneer, court clerk for the Western      District of Wisconsin, said that court might need to look to      other districts for help if a vacancy there takes a long time      to fill. Some Senate Republicans have opposed Obama's nominee      to that judgeship, Louis Butler.       The Rhode Island reassignment has generated some confusion      and consternation among state lawyers.       George Babcock, who's suing on behalf of more than a dozen      clients in a foreclosures case transferred to New Hampshire,      says the move is upsetting to some of his clients and      potentially expensive. He says the court has told him the      case, if it goes to trial, will be heard in Concord, N.H.       ``I want to work on my cases in my office, not in a Motel      6,'' Babcock said. ``And with all these clients, I'm going to      have to rent a whole wing at the Motel 6.''       Other lawyers with reassigned cases say New Hampshire      judges have offered to travel to Providence. It is ultimately      up to each individual judge to decide where the case should      be heard, according to David DiMarzio, clerk for federal      court in Rhode Island.       There are just over 2,500 civil cases and 205 criminal      cases pending in Rhode Island, according to court figures. Of      the civil cases, over 1,600 are part of multi-district      litigation that Lisi says the court accepted before realizing      it would be faced with an extended vacancy.       For now, Lisi says, she does not plan to transfer more      cases to other districts.
