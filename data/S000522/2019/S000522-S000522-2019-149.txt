Madam Speaker, Raymond A. Miller, of Ocean County, N.J. is a dedicated, decorated American hero who has served our country in wartime and peace.   Ray donned the uniform first as a member of the U.S. Air Force to serve and protect his country. After success in the military, Ray put on a different uniform that was no less important--serving and protecting the citizens of New Jersey during a long and distinguished career in law enforcement, all-the-while and even to this very day, never forgetting his fellow veterans.   Born in Jersey City and raised in Trenton, N.J., Ray went on to join the Air Force in 1963, completing both basic training and Air Police School as part of four years of active duty in Germany, as well as two years in the reserves. He entered the State Police Academy in 1969, and after 30 years as a New Jersey State Trooper, he retired as a lieutenant. Ray continues to work for the NJ State Police as a part-time background investigator of applicants to law enforcement.   Ray married his loving wife Laurinda in 1971, and together they raised two wonderful daughters, Kimberley and Natalie in Manchester Township, N.J. in my district. Laurinda has served the Unit 129 Auxiliary for 28 years and is the current president of the Ocean County American Legion Auxiliary. Ray and Laurinda have four grandchildren: Kailee Lynn, Kyle, MacKenzie and Brooke. Today Ray and Laurinda live in Island Heights, Ocean County, N.J.   As a trooper Ray was decorated for valor twice: first for helping apprehend a murderer who killed two police officers and permanently maimed another in Mount Holly, N.J., and later for selflessly and courageously saving a Westfield police officer who was being assaulted by two escaped murderers.   A dedicated Airman and trooper, Ray's service was complemented by his tireless efforts to aid his fellow veterans--the core of the mission of the American Legion.   I have known Ray Miller for a long time. He is a friend. One of our many, many meetings was last year at the New Jersey American Legion's Centennial Gala in Point Pleasant, N.J., where we kicked off the celebration of the successful and awesome history of the Legion.   This coming September 16, 2019 will mark the 100th anniversary since Congress passed the Charter for the American Legion.   It has been a good 100 years for the Legion, and Ray has the honor of leading legionnaires in the State of New Jersey during this special century anniversary.   Since its founding, the American Legion has become the largest wartime veterans' organization, counting nearly two million members across the U.S.A. with more than 12,000 posts. Established by an act of Congress, the Legion--with leaders like Ray and his predecessors at the helm locally, statewide and nationally--was instrumental in getting the original GI Bill through Congress and the creation of the Department of Veterans Affairs, today known as the Veterans Administration.   A nonpartisan, not-for-profit organization with legendary leadership and strong organizational structure built on its grass-roots involvement in the legislative process, every member in the House and Senate seeks the advice of the American Legion, which always, always has the interest of veterans and their families at heart.  As the former chairman of the House Veterans' Committee, I can attest to the influence, commitment and hard work of the American Legion. Its leaders like Ray Miller were indispensable when I wrote such laws as the Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act (P.L. 107-95), and the Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act (P.L. 107-103)--i.e. the GI Bill expansion--just to name a few.   Before taking the reins of the American Legion Department of New Jersey last year as the State Commander, Ray served various positions at his hometown post, Post 129 in Island Heights, including twice as Post Commander.   Last year, the American Legion began celebrating 100 years since it first gathered on the Jersey Shore so many years ago. Representatives from chapters all across the state have held the American Legion Convention at Wildwoods Convention Center since 1918.   To honor the upcoming centennial milestone, local and state legionnaires buried a time capsule in Wildwood, NJ in front of American Legion Post 184 last June. Since 1918, the American Legion has held its annual convention in Wildwood.   The Cape May County Herald reported the capsule, filled with 100 years of historical items from different posts and counties within the Garden State, will remain buried for 25 years. On June 8, 2043, it will be unearthed by Ray's grandchildren.   Across my District, across the great State of New Jersey, and across this great nation, the traditions and legacy of the Legion have become a legacy of wholesome Americana: American Legion baseball, Boys State, Troop and Family Support, educational scholarships, and many other activities sponsored by the Legion.   This Saturday, his fellow veterans, friends and family, will honor Ray for a lifetime of service that continues today. And, 25 years from now, Ray's grandchildren will unearth the memories and history of the New Jersey American Legion--a history that is replete with the outstanding contributions and leadership of American Legionnaire Ray Miller.   I thank Ray, and may God bless him and his family and all servicemember and veterans.                          ____________________
