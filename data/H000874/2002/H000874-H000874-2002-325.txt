Speaker, I rise today to recognize the tremendous community spirit shown by the people of Charles County, Maryland. As my colleagues may know, a devastating tornado ripped through Southern Maryland on April 29, 2002 destroying the town of La Plata and creating a 24 mile path of destruction. Not only were homes and businesses leveled, but farms and government buildings were heavily damaged. Under the circumstances, you would think that a tornado of this magnitude would cripple an area. Not in Southern Maryland and particularly not in La Plata.  Immediately following the tornado, the residents took to the streets to check on friends and neighbors. Once everyone was accounted for, the clean-up efforts began. Under the leadership of the Mayor of La Plata, William Eckman, and the Charles County Commissioners, directed by Board President Murray Levy, an immediate plan of action was put into place and countless hours were spent with residents and business owners, surveying each situation and assisting wherever possible. A ``People's Place'' was set up to offer a myriad of services ranging from food, water and shelter, to helping people find lost pets. Clothing and money poured into the area, but most of all people reached out to help their neighbors rebuild their lives.  Volunteers came from across the States of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania, as well as the District of Columbia to assist in removing debris left behind by this vicious storm. SMECO, Verizon and Maryland Department of Transportation had staff working round the clock to restore electrical power, establish valuable communication systems and clear the roadways. The Amish communities of Maryland and Pennsylvania donated much-needed manpower to get the Town of La Plata up on its feet again.  The Charles County Chapter of the American Red Cross went into immediate action, once the tornado passed, even though their own building was destroyed. Mr. Paul Facchina had a ``mini business district'' set up for the business owners to get back up and running. The Charles County Chamber of Commerce offered office space and business services to companies in need and for days following the disaster local churches and other civic organizations offered food to the hundreds of volunteers.  Mr. Speaker, it has often been said that the ``worst of times, bring out the best in people'' and on behalf of the many, many grateful residents and business owners in La Plata, I want to say Thank You to all the volunteers who gave of themselves so unselfishly. A disaster occurred, and people came from all walks of life to help in any way they could. It did not matter how big, or how small a job, volunteers were available to lend a helping hand. This is the true spirit of America and it was shining bright and continues to beam forward in Charles County, Maryland.                          ____________________
