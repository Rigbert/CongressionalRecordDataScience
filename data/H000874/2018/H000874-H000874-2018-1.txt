Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule to come.  Mr. Speaker, let me just preface it: I know all of our Members are concerned. I know the majority leader, having spoken to him, is very concerned about what we are doing and when we are doing it. Members, obviously, Christmas is coming, and they want to know what they can do. I am pleased that the majority leader agreed to have this colloquy to give us a sense of the schedule as he sees it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), my friend, the majority leader.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  Let me bring clarification. I know there is frustration. I am frustrated as well. I know we would like to be home with our family, but there is work still to be done.  Wait. There is still good news. Because the flood bill went down on suspension, we do not want to leave and have that lying out there.  So, after the colloquy is done, we will debate the Senate bill on flood. It will take about 30 minutes, and we will come back for another vote series. I don't want to say anything, but if the bill passed, we would not be back.  After that, tomorrow, there are no votes scheduled. We are waiting on action in the Senate. When the Senate has action, I will notify everybody, giving them ample time to come for that vote.
