This week we join together once again to commemorate National Crime Victims' Rights Week.  Yesterday marked the official beginning of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. Since 1981, communities in Vermont and across the Nation have observed this week through candlelight vigils and public rallies to renew our commitment to crime victims and their families. It is important, especially during this time of national sorrow, that we recognize the needs of crime victims and their family members and work together to promote victims' rights and services.  We have been able to make some progress during the past 26 years to provide victims with greater rights and assistance. In particular, I have been honored to support passage of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, VOCA, Public Law 98-473, which established the Crime Victims Fund, ``the Fund.'' The fund allows the Federal Government to provide grants to State crime victim compensation programs, direct victim assistance services and services to victims of Federal crimes. Nearly 90 percent of the fund is used to award State crime victim compensation and victim assistance formula grants. TheseVOCA-funded victim assistance programs serve nearly 4 million crime victims each year, including victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, elder abuse, and drunk driving, as well as survivors of homicide victims. Our VOCA-funded compensation programs have helped hundreds of thousands of victims of violent crime.  The Crime Victims Fund is the Nation's premier vehicle for supporting victims' services. It bears repeating that the Crime Victims Fund does not receive a dime from tax revenue or appropriated funding. Instead, it is made up of criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalties, and special assessments.  Since fiscal year 2000, Congress has set a cap on annual fund obligations expressly for the purpose of ensuring ``that a stable level of funding will remain available for these programs in future years.'' The ``rainy day'' fund created by this spending cap has been used to make up the difference between annual deposits and distributions three times during the past 7 years.  The future of the fund is being threatened, however. After 26 years of progress, the Bush administration is proposing to rescind all amounts remaining in the fund at the end of fiscal year 2008. That would leave the fund with a balance of zero going into fiscal year 2009 and create a disastrous situation for providers of victims' services. Over the last few years, the Senate has successfully blocked several past attempts by this administration to rescind the fund's remaining balance and has supported the retention of all amounts deposited into the fund. Over the past 6 years, the Bush administration has squandered record surpluses and racked up $8.5 trillion in Federal debt. It is wrong to try to pay for its failed fiscal policies by emptying out the Crime Victims Fund. These resources are appropriately set aside to assist victims of crime.  In order to preserve the fund once again, Senator Crapo and I, joined by more than a dozen other Senators are sending a letter this week to the Senate Appropriations Committee asking that the committee oppose the administration's proposal to empty the Crime Victims Fund and, instead, permit those amounts to remain in the fund, in accordance with law, to be used for the important programs and services needed by crime victims.  Also, last week the Vermont Department of Corrections received a $400,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to implement a Statewide Automated Victim Information and Notification, SAVIN, system to provide timely notifications to crime victims who request it. Programs like these give crime victims some peace of mind and facilitate communication among the courts and corrections and other law enforcement officials.  We need to renew our national commitment to crime victims. The Senate can help by recognizing the importance of the Crime Victims Fund and supporting its essential role in helping crime victims and their families meet critical expenses, recover from the horrific crimes they endured, and move forward with their lives. I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to honor our longstanding commitment to crime victims by working together to commemorate victims of crime and to preserve the Crime Victims Fund.                          ____________________
