 President, in November's election, the people called for a new direction, a change from the last 8 years. Today, we took a meaningful step toward that new direction as we inaugurated a new President of the United States.  I think it is important for all Americans--regardless of party--to remember the significance of inauguration day. As we celebrate our Nation's rich electoral tradition, we can begin to move our country forward together.  It is always an honor to participate in the historical transition of power and the ceremonies surrounding it. Today was certainly no exception. On behalf of the Senate, I wish to express our gratitude to each individual, from law enforcement personnel to Inaugural Committee staff, to congressional staff of volunteers whose efforts made this event a success.  I wish to again congratulate President Trump and Vice President Pence on today's inauguration. We are eager to work with you and the administration in advancing policies that can improve the lives of the American people.  Today marks a new beginning. We are faced with many new opportunities. We are faced with some new challenges too. I will have more to say on that in the coming days. For now, the Senate remains hard at work as we move forward with the confirmation process on President Trump's nominees. We will have an opportunity to confirm some today.  It is imperative to proceed with confirmations without delay, especially when it comes to key national and economic security needs. I urge colleagues to remember that we worked with the administration of former President Obama after he was first inaugurated. We confirmed seven--seven--members of his Cabinet on the day he took office and nearly the entire Cabinet was filled within 2 weeks.  I wish to say, parenthetically, there is a lot the minority can do at the very beginning by refusing to give consent to drag this out, and that is what apparently is occurring here. The nominations we are not doing are not even controversial.  I would hope the feeling around here would be at least on day one to have some level of cooperation. We should work in the same spirit with the current administration and put the rest of President Trump's team in place as soon as possible. Specifically, it is important that we confirm General Mattis and General Kelly to their crucial positions as the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security.  That is not enough. We live in dangerous times. As the Democratic leader noted earlier just today, ``We face threats foreign and domestic.'' It is critical for the President to have a full national security team today, day one. That includes, in particular, the Director of the CIA. It makes no sense toleave the post open, not for another week, not for another day, not for another hour. America's enemies will not pause in plotting, planning, and training simply because the Democrats refuse to vote. The American people expect more.  Earlier today, the Director and Deputy Director of the CIA resigned. They left. They are gone. The Director's job is open and unfilled. We need to confirm a new Director today. We need to confirm the rest of the Cabinet as quickly as we can.  Republicans treated a newly inaugurated President Obama's nominees fairly, and our Democratic friends should do so now. Our country is counting on it. I am told we want to have some debate about this. We will have as much debate time, starting right now, as our Democratic colleagues would like, but at the end of the debate, today--not Monday--we should install a new CIA Director.                          ____________________
