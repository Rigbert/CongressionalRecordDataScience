President, today we are going to remember the victims and families whose lives were forever changed by the bombing in Oklahoma City 21 years ago. This homegrown terrorist attack--this bombing shook our Nation to its core. In fact, it remains the worst act of homegrown terrorism our Nation has endured.  The destruction and the loss of life were overwhelming. This photograph I have never forgotten. The firefighter is carrying the limp and bloodied body of a toddler from the wreckage. Those of us who are parents and grandparents know the joy we have had in caring for children this age. You can only imagine the sadness of that firefighter. It symbolized the horror of the attack: 168 innocent lives perished that day; 19 of them were children.  The impact, of course, and the loss in the Oklahoma City community was enormous. Nearly everyone knew someone who had lost a friend or family member. The city's emergency services and their victims support resources were quickly overwhelmed. As the days went by and the needs mounted, it became clear that the existing State and Federal resources were simply insufficient to respond to such a massive attack.  So to respond to the victims' needs, I proposed, and Congress passed, the Victims of Terrorism Act of 1995. Among important matters, the legislation I wrote created an emergency reserve as part of the Crime Victims Fund to serve as an emergency resource in the wake of an act of terrorism or mass violence. Even though every one of us, Republicans and Democrats alike,prayed there would never be such another act, we had, in my legislation, an emergency reserve, because without such a fund, State victim compensation and assistance programs are quickly overwhelmed. This new fund was critical to ensuring that additional resources got to the field quickly.  Over the last two decades, this fund has been instrumental in allowing the Federal government to immediately respond to the victims of other unspeakable acts of mass violence, including the 9/11 terrorist attack and more recently, the domestic terror attack in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina.  Last month I met with the former Federal prosecutor who managed the investigation and the prosecutions of the Oklahoma City bombers. We talked about the prosecution. That former prosecutor was Chief Judge Merrick Garland. He was nominated to the Supreme Court last month. But before he was a judge and a nominee to serve on the highest Court in the land, he was a prosecutor and a senior official at the Justice Department. Those of us who have had the privilege of being prosecutors, none of us could ever think of facing what he did.  Immediately after hearing the news of the devastation in Oklahoma City, Merrick Garland turned to the Deputy Attorney General. He said, very simply: ``You need to send me there.'' The next day, Merrick Garland became the highest ranking Department of Justice official on the ground in Oklahoma City after the bombing. He helped to oversee every aspect of the criminal investigation and response. Years later, he still considers his work in Oklahoma City the most important in his life.  Chief Judge Garland's commitment to fairness during that difficult period and his work with the citizens of Oklahoma City were formative for him. I know from talking with him that it left a lasting impression on him, but it left especially a lasting impression on the people he served.  Last year, the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum honored Merrick Garland with a Reflections of Hope Award for his work on behalf of victims. After his nomination to the Supreme Court last month, the Oklahoma museum's Executive Director said: ``We are so proud that Judge Garland, who kept the family members and survivors front and center during his work in Oklahoma City, has been nominated.''  We have also heard from a team of former prosecutors, law enforcement agents, and victims' advocates who worked directly with Chief Judge Garland in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing. They have written to the leadership of the Senate and the Judiciary Committee to highlight Chief Judge Garland's work on this terrorism case. They strongly support his nomination to the Supreme Court. The law enforcement team writes of Chief Judge Garland:       Twenty years ago, the nation could not find a better lawyer      to manage the investigation and prosecution of what was then      the worse crime ever committed on American soil. Today, our      nation could not find a better judge, nor a more honorable      man, to join its highest court.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter highlighting Chief Judge Garland's work on the Oklahoma City bombing.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   April 19, 2016.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Reid,      Chairman Grassley, and Ranking Member Leahy: As former      prosecutors, law enforcement agents and victim advocates who      worked as a team with Merrick Garland, as well as state and      local authorities, to secure justice for the thousands of      victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, we write to offer our      enthusiastic support for Chief Judge Garland to serve on the      Supreme Court of the United States.       We are a diverse group: we live in different parts of the      country and work in a variety of fields, we have no common      political affiliation, and indeed some of us are occasionally      adversaries in court. But despite those differences we are      united today, as we were united two decades ago, in our      respect and admiration for the integrity, brilliance,      leadership, and judgment of Merrick Garland. Twenty years      ago, the nation could not find a better lawyer to manage the      investigation and prosecution of what was then the worst      crime ever committed on American soil. Today, our nation      could not find a better judge, nor a more honorable man, to      join its highest court.       On April 19, 1995, while first responders were still      searching for the injured and the dead in the ruins of the      Alfred J. Murrah Federal Building, Merrick Garland worked      with the folks on the ground to provide the best federal      resources, personnel and counsel to assist with the      investigation and prosecutions. He knew that the best thing      he could do was to leave Washington and travel to Oklahoma      City to ensure that the investigators, the prosecutors, the      victims and the survivors had the full support of the Justice      Department. He arrived to find the largest and most complex      crime scene anyone in American law enforcement had ever      encountered. He helped to ensure that the many different      local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies worked      together as a team, despite their sometimes differing ideas      about how best to build a case. At the same time, he made      sure the victims, the survivors and their families had the      critical resources they needed to deal with the unspeakable      losses they had suffered.       Once the two men responsible for the bombing had been      identified and arrested, Judge Garland was careful to ensure      that each was treated fairly and with dignity to ensure that      no one could reasonably accuse the government of a rush to      judgment. He meticulously oversaw every step of the      prosecution's initial proceedings, building an overwhelming      case and ensuring that no legal error would allow the bombers      to escape responsibility for their atrocity. And with the      victims' families and the nation desperate for information      and justice, Judge Garland ensured that they would have both.       After the case was on a sound footing, Judge Garland      returned to his critical responsibilities at the Justice      Department, but maintained close contact with the rest of us      who continued to work on the case. With his towering      intellect, exceptionally sound judgment, and extraordinary      decency, he provided the leadership and wise counsel that      helped us face both novel legal issues in the courtroom and      unprecedented challenges in supporting a community of victims      that numbered in the thousands.       On a personal level, we all benefitted from having Judge      Garland in our corner. For some of us, the bombing had ripped      through our home town and killed and wounded neighbors and      colleagues; for the rest of us who came to the task force      from across the country, the case required many months away      from friends and family. For all of us, working to secure      justice for the victims and to reassure the nation that our      judicial system could respond fairly but forcefully to such      an act of domestic terrorism, the pressure to get it right      was unyielding--and Judge Garland's support was critical. He      was not just a supervisor; he was a mentor, a counselor, and      a friend.       From the day of the Oklahoma City bombing until his      judicial appointment at the start of the first of the trials,      Merrick Garland provided our team with leadership,      confidence, determination, and hope. If confirmed, he will      bring to the Supreme Court the same humanity, talent, and      judgment that we have seen in him for two decades. We      unconditionally support his nomination and urge you to      support his confirmation as an Associate Justice of the      Supreme Court.           Very truly yours,         Donna Bucella; Vicki Zemp Behenna; Sean Connelly; David            Chipman; Aitan Goelman; Jamie Gorelick; Joseph            Hartzler; Carolyn Hightower; Arlene Johnson; Wan Kim;            Larry Mackey; Scott Mendeloff; James Orenstein; Patrick            Ryan; Beth Wilkinson.
