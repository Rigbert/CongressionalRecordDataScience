President, on Friday April 5, a distinguished retired Vermonter, Dr. George W. Albee will receive the American PsychologicalAssociation's Presidential Citation for the work he has done in the field of psychology over the last 50 years.  Dr. Albee and his family moved to Vermont in the early 1970's, after a long and prolific career at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He taught and wrote at the University of Vermont for the next 25 years, and was an active and influential member of Vermont's academic community.  Dr. Albee's career began in a small office at APA's national headquarters in Washington in the early 1950's. In the fall of 1953, he went to Finland after landing a Fulbright Professorship at Helsinki University. He returned to accept a job in the Department of Psychology at Western Reserve University, and was named George Trumbull Ladd Distinguished Professor of Psychology in 1958.  Under President Eisenhower, Albee was the Director of the Task Force on Manpower of the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health. The book that he wrote, coupled with the work and recommendations of the commission, helped lead to the establishment and development of community mental health centers.  He also served as a consultant to the U.S. Surgeon General, the Peace Corps, and headed President Carter's Commission on Mental Health in 1977.  Prior to moving to Vermont, Albee was elected President of the American Psychological Association where he served with distinction during a turbulent time of change in the psychological and psychiatric communities.  He was always known in Vermont as a leader also willing to wade into controversy and fight for the causes he believed in. In 1977, he began an annual conference at UVM on the Primary Prevention of Psychopathogy, which over the years have brought scholars and policy makers from around the country and around the world to discuss ways to shape local state and national policies on a range of important public policy areas.  In addition to his prolific writings, Dr. Albee taught thousands of undergraduate and graduate students at UVM. His contribution to Vermont and our nation has been profound. I am honored to consider him and his wife Margaret friends--and am proud that he has raised four children, all of whom are contributing in their own ways to making this world a better place.  A previous award Dr. Albee received articulated better than I his contribution to the field of psychology. Its says:       Dr. Albee has had an active role in plotting the direction      and independence of professional psychology. He saw and      articulated early the need for an independent profession of      psychology, freed from the domination of older professions      and older models. His ``Declaration of Independence for      Psychology'' has been reprinted endlessly. His argument and      clinical psychology students should be trained in a service      center operated by psychology was widely accepted. His study      of the nation's manpower needs and resources in mental health      was one of the major influences in developing the community      mental health center movement. He has been a frequent critic      of the mental health establishment, but he has been as      sharply critical of his own field when it seemed tempted to      yield principle for power and status. At times of greatest      crisis, however, George W. Albee has helped find ways of      compromise which have held psychology together.  I congratulate Dr. Albee for this award.                          ____________________
