President, I wish to support the nomination of Dr. Peter R. Orszag to be the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  As our Nation wrestles with the economic crisis, the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, must be prepared to tackle serious fiscal and budgetary crises.
