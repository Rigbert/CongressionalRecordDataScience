 President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the concurrent resolution be agreed to, that the preambles be agreed to en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be laid on the table, that the consideration of these items appear separately in the Record, and that any statements be printed in the Record.
