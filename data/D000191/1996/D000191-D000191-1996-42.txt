Chairman, reclaiming my time, yes, the Department of Agriculture's own statistics for 1995 show that 97 percent of the mortality was due to causes other than predation, the largest being respiratory problems, 27 percent; second largest, digestive; third largest, calving problems.  Perhaps if we applied more money to research in these areas there would be greater gains. But we have had this animal predator control program since 1931, and we have today more coyotes in the United States than when they started the program but they are more dispersed, and there are other problems that have been a consequence, particularly inadvertent kills of nontarget species.  Mr. Chairman, I had a constituent whose dog was killed, and when she ran to rescue the dog who had gotten into one of those M44 explosive devices, she also had a cyanide poisoning.
