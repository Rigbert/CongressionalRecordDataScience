 President, today, Senator Thomas has introduced a bill to establish a medicare subvention demonstration project for veterans and I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the issue of medicare subvention for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care. I have heard from many Iowa veterans who are frustrated that Medicare does not reimburse for medical care provided by the VA. While veterans who have a disability connected to military service have their health care paid for in whole or in part by the VA, veterans who do not have a service connected disability are listed as ``priority 7'' and are required to pay co-payments for the receipt of VA health care. Many of these priority 7 veterans are Medicare eligible, yet they cannot use their Medicare benefits to pay for VA health care.  The number of priority 7 veterans enrolled in VA health care has increased greatly in recent years, especially in my state of Iowa. This is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of veterans eligible to enroll in the VA health system as priority 7. However, the current VA funding formula does not allocate resources to pay for the care of priority 7 veterans. These costs are intended to be recouped by billing private insurance or through out-of-pocket co-pays charged to the veteran, which in fact fall far short of covering the additional costs to the VA system of serving priority 7 veterans. Allowing Medicare to reimburse for health care provided in VA facilities would help alleviate this funding short-fall in the VA system while giving Medicare eligible veterans greater choice and flexibilty in meeting their health care needs. Medicare subvention for VA health care would be a win-win situation for veterans, which is why I strongly support the concept of Medicare subvention for VA health care.  Questions remain about what effect Medicare subvention for VA health care could have on the Medicare trust fund. It is possible that Medicare outlays will increase if Medicare begins to pay for health care at VA facilities for Medicare eligible veterans currently using the VA. However, if veterans who are covered by Medicare begin to use the VA in lieu of private health care and the VA is able to provide those services at a lower cost, Medicare could actually see savings.  In the 106th Congress, the Senate Finance Committee reported a bill, S. 1928, which included a Medicare subvention demonstration program similar to the one introduced by Senator Thomas today. The CBO scored the Medicare subvention portion of this bill as costing Medicare $70 million over five years. This is a matter that should be studied further and is an issue that would be closely examined in a demonstration program such as the one Senator Thomas has proposed.  At the end of the day, Medicare subvention for VA health care is a good idea. I believe that Senator Thomas is on the right track with his proposed Medicare subvention demonstration program and I look forward to working with him and other members of the Senate Finance Committee to move forward on this important issue.                          ____________________
