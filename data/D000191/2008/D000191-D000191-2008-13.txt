 After 2 days of regular order and much noise on that side of the aisle about wanting to waive the rules of the House and have the Rules Committee waive the rules of the House to consider county schools, the chairman of the committee gave everybody in the House, including the minority who has been so loud in the last few days, a chance to waive the rules of the House and accept 1 year's funding for county and school payments. The end of those payments means 8,000 teachers have been laid off in rural counties across America, and thousands of deputy sheriffs, police and public safety officers. People will die because these payments aren't being extended.  The authorization expired when the Republicans controlled the House, the White House and the Senate. And now, today, because Republicans have yet again chosen to stonewall county payments by objecting to a unanimous consent request by the chairman of the full committee to waive the rules of the House and insert those payments, I am shocked, I am saddened, and I am absolutely stunned.
