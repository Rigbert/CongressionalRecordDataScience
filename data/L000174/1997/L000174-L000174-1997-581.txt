President, think back again to last night's State of the Union address. The President said all it takes is for us to cast the votes and for me to sign the bill to balance the budget. Many of us who cast those tough votes to cut programs, to bring the deficits down, have faced in the short term the wrath of our constituents but in the long term a realization that we have done the right thing for the country.  I am proud that I have voted for budgets that have now, 4 years in a row, brought down the deficits, something that has not happened certainly in the last 15 years or so. We have had a President who has had the courage to give us four budgets in a row that bring down the deficits. They have meant tough votes.  Some Members who voted to bring down the deficit have probably lost elections because of those tough votes. How much better they have been to themselves, to their children and their children's children because they resisted the temptation, as Senators and Representatives have for over 200 years, to amend our Constitution unnecessarily.  So let us not proceed to a view of short-run popularity but with a vision of our responsibilities to our constituents and the Nation in accordance with our cherished Constitution.  Mr. President, first and foremost I am going to cast votes on this floor to protect that Constitution, popular or otherwise. I take my oath of office seriously. I appreciate the privilege the people of Vermont have given me to represent them in this body. There is nothing I will ever do in my life that will make me as proud as being in this body representing the people of Vermont. As I have told the people of Vermont in each one of my elections, I will protect the Constitution first and foremost. As I told them in my last two elections, I will vote against this constitutional amendment because it does not protect our country, it demeans the Constitution, and it lets us off the hook from doing the things that we really should do.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 4, 1997]                       Constitutional Boondoggle       With President Clinton about to deliver his State of the      Union Address and new budget, this is an apt moment to say      that the President is right and the Republicans are wrong on      item one of the GOP Congressional agenda. The balanced budget      amendment is a flake-out.       The notion of amending the Constitution to outlaw budget      deficits is silly on any number of counts. Politically it's      empty symbolism. Legally it clutters the Constitution with      dubious prose. Today's lesson, though, concerns economics and      accounting. You can't measure economic rectitude by any one      number, let alone the ``deficit,'' however defined, let alone      the deficit projections the proposals will inevitably involve      in practice. The attempt to enshrine such a number in the      Constitution is bound to prove a snare and a delusion.       The proposal passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee says      that outlays (``except for those for repayment of debt      principal'') shall not exceed receipts (``except those      derived from borrowing''). While this concept sounds simple,      in fact it reflects neither accounting principles nor      economic reality.       If you can balance your family budget, the thinking goes,      the government can balance the federal budget. But applying      the budget amendment's principles to households would outlaw      home mortgages, which have proved a boon to countless      families and the general economy. What a family balances is      its operating budget, a concept foreign to the federal      accounts. In corporate accounting, similarly, the health of      an enterprise is measured by careful distinctions such as      accruals or depreciation. Even the balanced budget restraints      of state and local governments exclude spending on capital      improvements financed by bond issues approved by voters.       The reality is that borrowing money is not a sin; it      depends on how much money, and in particular on the uses of      the borrowed funds. Even the amendment itself recognizes this      by allowing Congress to waive the amendment by majority vote      when war is declared or when a joint resolution declares ``a      military conflict which causes an imminent and serious      military threat to national security.'' Other emergencies      would presumably be dealt through the provision that Congress      could approve borrowing by a two-thirds vote.       Republicans back the amendment because it scores well with      focus group participants, who don't understand the      difficulties, and with Ross Perot, who doesn't care. They      also hope that limiting the government's power to borrow will      force it to limit spending. Democrats seem pretty much to      agree, and want to voice support for the amendment to appease      focus groups while also killing it to avoid a spending      straitjacket. We're not so sure.       For one thing, we've observed how European politicians,      even supposedly conservative ones, have been behaving toward      the budget-deficit requirements they imposed on themselves in      the Maastricht agreement. To get within the numerical      criteria, the Italians are taking their railroads off and on      budget; the French government, in return for an infusion of      funds this year, assumed pension obligations running into the      far future. Governmental accounting, you see, simply counts      formal government debt; it ignores unfunded governmental      promises.       This is a loophole enormous enough that Rep. Fernand St      Germain could drive half of     the S crisis through it in one night in 1980, when he      doubled deposit-insurance limits. Another enormous loophole      is the government's ability to offload, or ``mandate,'' costs      on corporations, individuals and state and local governments      without running any receipts or outlays through the      Washington books. And when the bill for Rep. St Germain's      coup suddenly came due in 1989, would it really have been      better to avoid borrowing and put the rest of the government      through a temporary wringer?       These imperfections might not matter if the amendment did      no harm, but it's easy enough to imagine scenarios in which      it would keep us from doing the economically right thing.      Take the proposals by the most conservative bloc in the      recent Social Security Commission. They would allow current      taxpayers to personally invest part of what they owe in      payroll tax, giving them a better return. But meeting      obligations to those retiring before their benefits were      funded would require a big issue of government debt. The new      debt would merely formally recognize current obligations, and      the privatization would dramatically reduce future      obligations. Though this transaction would plainly improve      the federal fisc, the balanced budget amendment would outlaw      it.       Or for that matter, take the Reagan defense build-up, which      led to victory in the Cold War. The balanced budget amendment      would have allowed a majority to vote for borrowing if      fighting broke out, but not for expenditures to deter it. Is      this what we want?       And take the Reagan tax cuts, which in combination with      Paul Volcker's tight money, led the country out of 1970s      malaise, conquering inflation without an extended recession.      Clearly, deficit projections would have prevented the tax      changes.       Yes, this policy mix gave us deficits, but the 1980s      deficits are themselves a large part of the reason we have a      new concern with budget discipline today. Indeed, it seems to      us that history argues that discipline comes from forcing      governments to borrow, and pay interest--instead of raising      taxes or making unfunded promises or issuing unfunded      mandates. Yet in the form passed by the Finance Committee,      the amendment says you need a majority to raise taxes, a      majority to declare a military emergency, but two-thirds to      borrow.       What President Reagan understood is that if you limit      taxes, spending will sooner or later have to follow. For      permanent budget discipline, the best idea now on the table      is Rep. Joe Barton's proposal, up for a vote in the House      April 15, simply to require a two-thirds vote to raise taxes.      If that should pass, nature will take its course.       We do need to get the national debt declining as a per cent      of economic output. We do need to restrain federal spending.      We do need to solve the Medicare crisis, as Senator Phil      Gramm notes alongside. We do need to look beyond the year      2002. But these battles have to be fought one by one, and      can't be solved by amending the Constitution. The concept      embodied in the proposed amendment measures nothing useful;      it is at best a distraction, and at worst spreads confusion      that will make the right things harder to do, not easier.
