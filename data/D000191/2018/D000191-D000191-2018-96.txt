Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Chair, I offered a narrow fix for this in what was true interstate commerce because of the potential confusion between Federal hours of service and State hours of service, and that was rejected.                              {time}  1600  This is an incredibly broad preemption. It is not as stated. For instance, we just heard you have to pull over, no matter where you are. No. If you don't take your rest break, you have to be paid, but you don't have to stop and pull over.  Beyond that, this would preempt paid rest breaks, paid meal breaks, paid sick leave, paid family leave, payment for time detained at a loading dock, payment for anything other than a flat rate by the load.  This is an extraordinary preemption that we have here. The drivers are already exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. So they can't get overtime. If we wipe out the State laws and there is no existing Federal law, truck drivers are really getting it stuck to them here.  In fact, this amendment would expand Federal preemption over trucking operations to include, for the first time, wages and working conditions, something Congress never contemplated in 1994.  It is opposed by the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, the largest trucking organization; the Teamsters; American Association for Justice; and numerous safety groups. This is not as it is being presented. This is overly broad, and it should be opposed.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
