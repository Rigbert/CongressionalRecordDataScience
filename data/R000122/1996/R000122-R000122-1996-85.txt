Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleague, Representative Patrick Kennedy, in an effort to protect Rhode Island's precious coastline from the environmental devastation of oil spills.  Tragically, on January 19, the tug boat Scandia caught fire in severe weather off the coast of my congressional district.  The tug's crew could not control the fire and abandoned both the tug and the barge's cargo of 4 million gallons of oil to the high winds and seas.  While the tug crew was swiftly pulled from the sea by brave members of the Coast Guard, the same cannot be said for the unmanned barge which spilled 1 million gallons of oil off the Rhode Island coast.  The environmental and economic destruction of the spill is, at the present time, incalculable. Indeed, no one can estimate the damage to the fishery's long-term health, the wildlife, or my State's tourism industry.  But what has become clear in articles from the Providence Journal and my own experience as a member of the now defunct Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, is that Congress must address the growing reliance of this Nation on towing vessels to transport hazardous materials like oil.  It may surprise some of my colleagues that a tug boat which pulls 4 million gallons of oil and has a crew of 6 is not required to be inspected by the Coast Guard.  That's correct, the tug boat that pulled thousands of barrels of oil off the coast of my district and the estimated 2 to 4 barges that ply the waters of Narragansett Bay each day do not even get inspected once a year like an automobile.  Moreover, even though the Scandia's pilot had a master's license, no license is actually required to pilot these vessels.  And, perhaps even more disturbing is the fact that tug boats are not required to have some of the most basic navigational and safety equipment on board.  This body has tried to address this situation in previous years, only to have efforts to improve tug safety sink in the other body.  However, I would urge my colleagues, especially those from our Nation's coastal States, to consider joining me and Congressman Kennedy in supporting legislation that tries to prevent avoidable accidents in the future.  The Towing Vessel Safety Act of 1996 takes a better safe than sorry approach to protecting our Nation's environment and the hard-working families who make their living on the water.  This legislation will require tugs that pull hazardous materials to be inspected once a year, just like the cars of my constituents.  It will also establish licensing standards for the pilot and crew of tug boats towing hazardous materials, just like truckers who have a license to carry these items.  The bill would also ask the Coast Guard and Secretary of Transportation to ensure that tug boats carry basic navigational items like a radar system, a compass, and up-to-date charts as well as adequate fire fighting equipment, just as oil tankers must do.  The legislation protects crew members who report safety violations from wrongful discharge, like other employees who handle volatile cargo.  These common sense, preventative measures are a responsible first-step in addressing the increase in oil barge traffic off our Nation's pristine beaches. Indeed, the National Transportation Safety Board has made similar recommendations in the past.  At the same time, we need to take other steps to ensure that the barges pulled by these tugs are safe, and in the weeks to come we will be examining legislation to accomplish this aim.  The Coast Guard recognizes that there is a need to improve tug and barge safety, and it has proposed some new safety measures. And, the towing industry plans to have a self-inspection regime ready in 2 years.  However, I believe we need to take direct, reasonable steps to prevent environmental and economic catastrophes like the spill off Rhode Island.  Prevention is not without cost, but as the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  At the present time, questions remain as to the cause of the accident and whether the accident could have been prevented, but concerns remain that this disaster was preventable. It is in this spirit that we are introducing the Towing Vessel Safety Act.  Mr. Speaker, my State has seen the results of an oil spill once, and I hope this legislation can reduce the chances of it happening again.                          ____________________
