 President, each of us at one point in the well of the Senate raised our right hand and swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States. On 21 occasions in the last 26 years, efforts to restrict issue advocacy by outside groups have been struck down, including just last summer when the second circuit struck down the precise language in Snowe-Jeffords.  This bill is fatally unconstitutional. I hope Senators will uphold the oaths they have taken and oppose this unconstitutional bill.  I yield the floor.
