 President, before I send an amendment to the desk, I am going to talk about the amendment. This is one of those seven amendments that I had suggested, and it deals with our seafarers being paid bonuses during time of war and to equalize the bonuses between people who are seafarers and the bonuses that people in our Navy would receive in the very same part of the world under the very same conditions.  If seafarers do decide to serve, I think I pointed out in my original remarks on the bill, they have many more options than people who are military. When the people in Texas were told by the President of the United States, ``Pack up, you're going to go to Kuwait,'' the families had tears in their eyes, and we saw on television the men and women of America who are committed to the defense of our country respond to the Commander in Chief.  Seafarers have options: to go or not. And if seafarers do decide to serve and sail into the designated war zone, they are paid 100-percent base pay as a war-zone bonus. The military sealift command reported to me that one seafarer was paid $15,700 for a 2-month PersianGulf war bonus. That is on top of the regular pay that they would get.  The most that our men and women in the regular military or Reserve could get for that 2-month period is $300, or $150 a month. So compare this $15,700 for a 2-month war bonus for a seafarer with the $300 that one of our men or women would have received during that same period of time.  But that isn't the end of it. Our seafarers are eligible for much more--much, much more. If their vessel is in a harbor that is attacked, a seafarer can get an extra $400 per day. If their vessel is actually attacked, not just in the harbor that is attacked, they get an extra $600 per day.  So the amendment that I am offering puts an end to this nonsensical approach and inequitable approach between our men and women in the regular military or Reserve compared with what the seafarers get. Taxpayers' support for seafarers' war bonuses will be limited to the level provided for the men and women in our Reserves and regular military.  This amendment makes very certain taxpayers don't pay seafarers higher war bonuses than the active military.  Seafarers get this extra 100-percent base pay. I think everybody would agree that this is clearly nonsense and unfair. It ought to be demoralizing to our troops to look at the paycheck of one person and have $300 compared to the paycheck of a person in the same environment with $15,700 and some. We ought to realize that this is inequitable. It might even be considered a huge waste of taxpayers' money, or it could be equitable to pay our men and women in uniform more.  The seafarers get incredibly large salary and benefits year in and year out from taxpayers supposedly so they will serve Uncle Sam when needed. It seems to me it is not right to gouge the taxpayers a second time when they are actually called into a war zone.  It is fair for them to get a bonus, but it is not fair for them to get a bonus well beyond what regular military people get who, by the way, get paid a lot less than the seafarers get anyway. I want to talk about the biggest war bonus paid to a civilian mariner assigned to an MSC ship during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. On March 27, 1991, the Department of Defense approved the payment of war zone bonuses to those mariners operating in the Persian Gulf area west of 53 degrees east longitude. Civilian mariners were eligible for war zone bonuses equal to 100 percent of pay for each day their ships were within the designated war zone. Payments were effective retroactive to January 17, 1991, and ceased on April 11, 1991, the day of the final cease-fire.  The largest war bonus payment made to a civilian mariner aboard an MSC controlled ship was approximately $15,700 for that 2-month period. The ship was anchored within the designated war zone area approximately 56 consecutive days. Consequently, the crew members earned larger payments than those assigned to other MSC controlled ships.  The vast majority of the MSC's vessels transported military equipment and other supplies from the continental United States and European ports to the Middle East. These ships were only in the war zone area for approximately 2 to 5 days per voyage. As a result, war bonus payments for these civilian mariners averaged approximately $69.50 to $1,467 per voyage.  The war zone areas for military personnel included the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, that portion of the Arabian Sea which lies north of the 10 degrees north latitude and west of the 68th degrees east longitude or the Gulf Aden and all of the Red Sea. This made it more likely that active-duty sailors would qualify for hazardous pay.  This is the guidance that clarified which bonuses are paid and when under Desert Shield/Desert Storm. The imminent danger pay on applicable contracts, the actual direct costs of a reasonable crew imminent danger pay mandated by compulsory regulations or collective bargaining agreements, not to exceed $130 per month, are payable to each crew member under the following circumstances: Vessels in the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman, the portion of the Arabian Sea that lies north of the 10 degrees north latitude, west of the 68th degrees east longitude, or the Gulf of Aden, and vessels in this zone for a minimum of 6 days within one calendar month or 6 consecutive days beginning in one month and ending in the next, and vessels in this zone between August 2, 1990, and until the time in which the Secretary of Defense determines that an imminent danger no longer exists in the region. And the $130 is not prorated. The full amount is paid to anyone satisfying the above criteria.  Time spent in the war bonus zone described below does not count toward the 6 days criteria.  Let me point out that my war bonus amendment is supported by the retired admirals. These were the admirals that I had named earlier. I think it is fair to say that retired admirals know that it is not fair to pay $15,700 to a seafarer for 2 months, but only $300 to our men and women in the reserve or the regular military and Navy.  In regard to the war bonus--because I just told you about the imminent danger pay--in regard to the war bonus, on applicable contracts, actual direct costs of the reasonable crew war bonuses, mandated by compulsory regulation or collective bargaining agreement not in excess of an extra 100 percent of the crew's base pay, exclusive of supply penalties, are payable to each crew member under these circumstances: The vessel is in the Persian Gulf west of the 53 degrees east longitude, a bonus is payable for any day or portion of a day in this zone continuing until one day after the vessel passes east of the zone, and the vessel then is zoned between January 17, 1991 and the time when the final cease-fire marks an end to the hostilities, as referred to in the U.N. Security Resolution 686 of April 11, 1991.  Then we have next the war bonus for harbor attack. I gave a slight definition of this earlier. But this would apply in circumstances where war bonuses are applicable. It would then be $400, payable to each crew member aboard a ship in a harbor which is attacked. This is MARAD's determination. Only one harbor attack bonus is payable per day. A harbor attack bonus is not payable to a crew member earning a vessel attack bonus for the same day.  Then we have the war bonus that applies, not to the harbor attack, but to the actual attack on the vessel. In circumstances where war bonuses are applicable, $600 is payable to each crew member aboard a ship which is attacked. And that also is MARAD's determination.  There are certain document requirements. There is a requirement to submit imminent danger pay and war bonus invoices to appropriate MARAD paying offices in accordance with billing instructions clearly identifying which imminent danger war zone is being built, the corresponding dates and times in the zone. Note that the base wages must be identified for each rating, and MARAD then will request vessel deck logs and payroll sheets and individual pay vouchers containing crew's signatures for reconciliation of crew wages.  We have had some instances where seafaring unions sued the U.S. Government to obtain bonuses for gulf war trips. Seafaring labor unions sued the Government. According to this article, they sued the Government in an effort to win war bonus payments for their members who worked on Government cargo ships during the war against Iraq.  The Sailors Union of the Pacific, the Marine Firemen's Union, and the Seafarers International Union filed suit in Federal District Court claiming the U.S. Maritime Administration unfairly cheated their members out of hazardous duty pay. War bonus payments, of course, as I said are extra compensation for ship crews that go into risky shipping zones. Generally, crews get twice their regular pay, plus extra lump sum payments, should their vessels or harboring areas come under direct attack.  The shipping areas where war bonus payments apply are usually the traffic lanes within war zone areas designated by the White House. When the Persian gulf conflict began in 1991, the unions and the American President Line, a primary carrier for U.S. forces agreed to use a war zone designated by President Bush as the area where the war bonus payments would apply. However, the Maritime Administration later established a war zone area that wassmaller than the original White House designation.  The American President Line which operated 23 of its own ships, 11 Ready Reserve force ships for MARAD, argued that it had to use a smaller war zone area because it was relying on reimbursement from the Government for the Ready Reserve force operations.  The unions brought the case to an arbitrator from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Arbitrator William Eaton ruled that because of its earlier agreement, APL should pay seafarers on its own ships at war bonus rates for the entire zone established by the White House, but seafarers on the RRF ships could not be included, he decided. The union failed in an earlier attempt to get the Federal district court here to overturn the arbitration denial of war bonus payments to the RRF workers.  Another newspaper report on these bonuses says:       The Defense Department officials have agreed to reimburse      civilian ship operators for war bonuses up to 100 percent of      normal wages paid to seafarers who crewed scores of military      cargo ships supplying the Persian Gulf. Although strict      conditions will apply, the Navy notified ship owners this      week that it will pay for war bonuses given to men and women      who entered the war zone after August 2, 1990, the day that      Iraq invaded Kuwait. The higher levels of benefit will be      paid for voyages after January 17, 1991, when the United      States launched its air war against Iraq. The bonuses will      continue to be reimbursed until the formal cease-fire is      declared by the United Nations according to a notice from the      Military Sealift Command, the Navy agency in charge of the      ocean transportation.  Marge Holtz, director of public affairs for the Sealift Command, said she did not know how many ship crews would be affected or what the total costs would be. She added that certain military censorship policies are still in effect and will not be relaxed until the cease-fire is declared.  Sealift commander Admiral Francis Donavan said in early March that 446 voyages had been made into the gulf during the first 7 months of the operation. Some individual ships, especially those under the U.S. flag, have made multiple voyages.  At its peek operation, Desert Storm-Desert Shield employed 128 U.S.-flag ships, 111 foreign-flag ships; crew sizes of the ship ranged from about 20 to more than 70 on some specialized vessels. According to the Sealift Command notice, crew members on the ships sailing through much of the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman, and portions of the Arabian Sea will have their war bonuses paid by the U.S. Government. The maximum of $135 a month will be paid for voyages in the period leading up to January 17. After that and into the future, until the U.N. cease-fire, the war bonuses will be 100 percent of base daily wage of each crew member. The notice, however, will not ease one festering controversy with the U.S. merchant marine. It stems from the fact that reimbursement is not yet being made for ships that are part of the Government's Ready Reserve Fleet, a fleet of aging cargo ships kept for use in military enterprises. Seventy-eight ships for the Ready Reserve were activated to participate in the Persian Gulf buildup, and a fight is already on for war bonuses for those crews, said one West Coast maritime labor leader.  Whitey Disley, president of the Marine Firemen, Oilers, Watertenders and Wipers Association, said that shipping companies that operate Ready Reserve ships under contract to the Government are not paying war bonuses. Companies are refusing to pay, even though some of them have labor contracts that specifically call for war bonuses.  One such company is American President Line, Ltd., of Oakland, but representatives of the company indicated they will pay if the Government offers reimbursement.  ``It looks like we will have to go to arbitration, a grievance procedure on this,'' the union leader said.  The issue is under ``active review'' by the Maritime Administration, the Transportation Department agency responsible for the Ready Reserve force. MARAD officials contacted this newspaper and had not responded with any comment at press time.  It is pretty complicated, Mr. President, but one thing that stands out here is that we do not have an equitable situation between people who are in the full-time military in a war zone with their life just as endangered as seafarers who get 100 percent base pay war bonuses. And remember, seafarer pay is already higher than what our military people get in the first place. It seems to me that we have a responsibility to our military personnel that they be treated fairly with the seafarers.  I want to alert my colleagues to actual amounts of money that are paid for these war bonuses to specific shipping companies. We paid $29,197.56 to Gulf Trader of the All Marine Service; to the American Foreign Shipping Company, war bonuses we paid, $40,512.48; to the American Overseas Marine, we paid a total of $599,747.98. That is broken down into separate figures for eight different ships, ranging in payment from a small amount of $5,937.58, all the way up to figures like $253,334.18 and $239,430.80 for a couple of other ships.  The International Marine Carriers received for two ships $259,642 total; for the Interocean Management Corporation, war bonuses totaled $369,279.27, ranging from a low of $14,276 for one ship to $105,884 for another ship; to the Marine Carriers, we paid $55,299.47, ranging from a low of $7,553 up to a high of $30,000 for another ship, spread out over four ships. Marine Transport Lines received $193,170. OMI Ship Management received a total of $439,646. That is a grand total of $1,987,496 war bonuses for these shipping lines.  As I stated previously, these are not the only bonuses that are available.                           Amendment No. 5391(Purpose: To provide for a uniform system of incentive pay for certain              hazardous duties performed by merchant seamen)
