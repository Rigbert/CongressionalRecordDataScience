 Secretary Thompson says, ``I would not approve a plan for participation in the Part D program if I found that the design of the plan and its benefits, including any formulary and any tiered formulary structure, would substantially discourage enrollment in the plan by any group of individuals. If a plan, however, complies with the USP guidelines then it would be considered to be in compliance with this requirement. Thus, if a plan limited drugs for a group of patients (individuals living with HIV/AIDS) it would not be permitted to participate in Part D.'' Secretary Thompson goes on to say, ``Under the Conference Report, the beneficiary protections in the Medicare drug benefit are more comprehensive than the protections now required of State Medicaid programs. This will ensure access to a wide range of drugs. For example, there are extensive information requirements so that beneficiaries will know the drugs the plan covers before they enroll in the plan. Beneficiaries can also appeal to obtain coverage for a drug that is not on their plan's formulary if the prescribing physician determines that the formulary drug is not as effective for the individual as another drug, or if there are adverse effects. As a result, access to all drugs in a category or class will be available to a beneficiary when needed.''  Is this your understanding as well?
