I think we all know the Senate budget process is a lot of complicated lingo. People in the coffee shops in New Hampshire and Oregon don't follow all the fine points of reconciliation.  As the Senator has just said, what they are using is a process that is known as reconciliation. That is the most partisan process you can come up with. There is no more partisan kind of process, and we were talking about the tally. As of this afternoon, two committees in the House have acted.  The Senator from New Hampshire just mentioned, I think, there were 11 Republican amendments in just one of the committees.
