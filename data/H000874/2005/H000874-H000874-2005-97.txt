Speaker, I hope everybody in America knows, I say to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite), your party has been in charge for all 5 of the years that spending has gone out of control, and your conservatives are telling you just that, including Mr. Dick Armey, your former majority leader. It is you who have allowed spending to go out of control.                              {time}  0030
