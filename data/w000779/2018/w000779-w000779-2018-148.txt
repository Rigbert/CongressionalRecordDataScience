President, reserving the right to object, and I will object here in a moment. I just would like to say that on our side, we feel so strongly about getting this resolved. We now are seeing a whole host of discussions between Members on both sides of the aisle in the Senate. We are hearing about discussions between this body and the other Chamber.  It would be my hope that with the good faith we have seen since last night--and I know the distinguished Presiding Officer is involved in some of these discussions--that with those kinds of good-faith discussions, we would have a chance to get this resolved and address the concerns the American people have in a matter of days rather than several weeks.  So, for that reason, I object.
