President, I rise today to congratulate Heidi Kirk Duffy upon her receipt of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, First Class.  Heidi was selected to receive the Order of Merit to recognize her ``outstanding contribution to the development of academic and economic interchanges between universities and companies of the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany.'' The Order of Merit will be bestowed upon Heidi in particular recognition of her commitment to the cultivation of a strong relationship between the University of Rhode Island's International Engineering Program and the Federal Republic of Germany.  A native of the Dusseldorf area, Heidi is currently the Chair of the Advisory Board of the University of Rhode Island's International Engineering Program. At the conclusion of this five-year program, graduates receive two degrees, one in English and the other in German. Recently, the University of Rhode Island has also added degrees in Spanish and French. This International Engineering Program is considered to be one of the most unique programs of its kind in American higher education.  Under her direction, the University of Rhode Island's Engineering Program provides both German and American students a global education. Due to Heidi's dedication and hard work, the Program has been truly successful in strengthening a transatlantic relationship between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany.  Heidi was notified earlier this year by the Consul General of the Federal Republic of Germany, Dr. P.C. Hauswedell, that she had been selected to receive the Order of Merit. The Verdienstkreuz 1. Klasse des Verdlenstordens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, as it is known in German, is one of the highest honors give to civilians by the Federal Republic. She will receive the Order of Merit on Friday, August 4th at ceremonies in her honor in the Rhode Island Capital.  I congratulate Heidi for her accomplishments and wish her luck as she continues in her endeavors.                          ____________________
