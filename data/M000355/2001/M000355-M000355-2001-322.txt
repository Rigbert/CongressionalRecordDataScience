 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until the hour of 9:15 a.m. on Tuesday, March 27. I further ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume consideration of the Hagel amendment to S. 27, the campaign finance reform bill.
