President, I encourage my colleagues to join with me to oppose the amendment.  The amendment would provide government loans for brick-and-mortar projects, including food refrigeration capacity. We are talking about refrigerators--big refrigerators. At a time when we are working to streamline current programs and reduce the size of government, I am concerned we would be expanding the size to serve a new pool of applicants competing for very limited resources at the Department ofAgriculture. In this regard, the gleaners would be taken to the cleaners.  I encourage my colleagues to oppose the amendment.
