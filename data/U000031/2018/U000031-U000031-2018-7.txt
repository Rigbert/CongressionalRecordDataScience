Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the record. We were going to take this up and pass it like that, but the Senate acted first, which is why we are taking up the Senate bill. It does have bipartisan support.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
