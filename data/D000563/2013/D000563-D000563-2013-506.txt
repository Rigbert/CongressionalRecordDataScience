I met someone just like that in the year 2007, and I hired her for my staff. It was a great decision.  For the better part of 6 years, Sarah Neimeyer has been a senior member of my staff, and this week she left my office for a new adventure which she started today, working with the new Secretary at the Department of the Interior. I am sorry to lose her, but I wish her well.  Sarah comes by her idealism honestly. She grew up in a family of progressives in rural Minnesota. Her dad practiced law and her mom raised honey bees and grew her own vegetables.  From her parents Sarah inherited progressive ideals, practical Midwestern values and a deep love of the land.  During college, she spent her summers leading canoe trips through the Boundary Waters Wilderness in northern Minnesota and Ontario, Canada.  Her first boss in the Senate was a dear friend and one of my personal heroes, Paul Wellstone. Sarah worked for Paul for 10 years. After he passed away, she left Capitol Hill and worked as an advocate for land conservation and wilderness preservation.  Illinois has benefited from Sarah's passion, her practicality and her incredibly hard work.  Lake Michigan is one of Illinois' most beloved treasures. As a member of my staff, Sarah has fought many battles to protect the Lake from threats from toxic dumping to invasive Asian carp.  She has worked alongside energy companies in Illinois that are cleaning up the way energy is produced.  Whenever safe water, clean air and healthy lands are at stake, you can be pretty sure Sarah Neimeyer is close by. She is committed and tenacious. And she usually wins.  There is one cause which is even dearer to Sarah and that is her family--her husband, Joe Warren, and their teenage sons, Will and Harry. As accomplished as Sarah is in her professional life, if you ask her what she is proudest of, she will tell you in an instant: it's her boys.  Paul Wellstone had a great definition for politics. He used to say:       ``In the last analysis, politics is not predictions and      politics is not observations. Politics is what we do.      Politics is what we do, politics is what we create, by what      we work for, by what we hope for and what we dare to      imagine.''  Paul Wellstone was right. That is politics at its finest. That is the kind of public service Sarah Neimeyer has performed for me and for the people of Illinois for the last nearly 6 years and I am grateful to her.  I want to thank Joe, Will and Harry, first of all, for sharing Sarah with us. And I want to thank Sarah for helping to protect and preserve some of my State and our Nation's greatest natural treasures.  I wish her continued joy and success as she gets back on the ``green bus'' to begin her next professional challenge.                          ____________________
