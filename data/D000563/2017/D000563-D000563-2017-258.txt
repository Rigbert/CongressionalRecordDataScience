. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. The motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal and Carper.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare is now financially stable for an additional 11 years.  Because of the healthcare reforms that improve the delivery of healthcare, seniors are now paying $700 less annually in premiums and cost-sharing.  The ACA is also closing the dreaded Medicare ``donut hole''--the gap where seniors were faced with high costs for their drugs--saving 11 million seniors an average for $2,127 each year on their medications.  But Republicans want to jeopardize this progress.  Instead of strengthening Medicare for the long run, many of the Republican repeal bills would give a huge tax giveaway to wealthy Americans--cutting years off Medicare's solvency.  That is why my motion to commit would instruct the Finance Committee to report out a bill--within 3 days--that does not shorten Medicare's solvency.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Motion to Commit With Instructions       Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same      back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which      the Senate is not in session, with changes that--       (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and       (2) ensure that the bill will not shorten the solvency of      the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under section 1817      of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i).
