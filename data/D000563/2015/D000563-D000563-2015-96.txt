 What we have tried to do with a number of Senators is to lay out the case that when we go to higher education reauthorization, we owe the taxpayers and we owe families across America the responsibility to look at this industry. What is happening here in inexcusable and unacceptable. It is unfair. Ten percent of the high school graduates, 20 percent of the Federal aid education, 40 percent of all student loan defaults.  Senator Murphy pointed to the statistics that came out today. You are in just as bad shape with a diploma from a for-profit school as if you drop out of school at a not-for-profit school. That is a damning statistic, just like the 40 percent in student loan defaults.  We cannot continue to look the other way. Wall Street is not looking the other way; they are downgrading these for-profit colleges and universities because they believe this model is flawed. They don't believe it can be sustained. Why do we kid ourselves? Let's apply standards across higher education--standards that are fair to students, fair to families, and fair to the schools--and say to them: This is what we expect as a minimum if you are going to offer higher education to the students across America.  I ask unanimous consent that this transcript from Sharyl Attkisson's television program ``Full Measure'' which played last Sunday be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Transcript                  sharyl attkisson's ``full measure''                    (Aired Sunday, November 1, 2015)       Washington (Sinclair Broadcast Group).--Some for-profit      colleges are allegedly preying on military troops; veterans      with benefits and a desire to build a new life become      targets.       They've even been given a name by some college recruiters:      cash cows.       About 300 thousand vets get up to $21K a year in G.I. Bill      money. In all, 1800 colleges--many of them for profits--have      received more than $20 billion G.I. Bill tax dollars.       With so many billions in the mix, it's easy to see why some      colleges use high pressure and allegedly dishonest tactics.      Now, taxpayers are about to be on the hook for alleged      misconduct by the schools.       As a U.S. Marine, Bryan Babcock fought on the front lines      in Iraq including the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004. His      post-military plan: police work. He used his GI Bill money to      pursue a criminal justice degree at the for-profit college      ITT Tech.       Attkisson: How did you hear about it?       Babcock: I saw a commercial on TV. That kind of got me      interested in them.       Babcock says ITT promised that police agencies everywhere      would accept the degree. The cost--$70,000--would far exceed      his GI Bill grant at the time, but ITT made it easy for      Babcock to borrow. He says they even helped him fill out      paperwork for student loans. Then, after his third year, he      made a startling discovery.       Babcock: We applied to 22 or 23 police departments.       Attkisson: And what did they say?       Babcock: All of them said that they did not recognize ITT's      degrees or their credits.       Attkisson: And what thoughts went through your head when      you heard this?       Babcock: I was angry that I'd spent all this money in      student loans and it turns out that the degree, if I would      have finished there, would have been pretty much worthless.       It's a story told by thousands of vets who attended for-     profit colleges where students are more likely to drop out,      default on their loans, or graduate in dire debt without a      useful degree.       Of eight for-profits that get the most GI bill funds, seven      have been targets of inquiries for possible violations      including deceptive or misleading recruiting.       Together, they received nearly a billion ($939,086,610      million) tax dollars over two school years.       One of those companies is DeVry University where Chris      Neiweem was hired as the school recruited vets under the new      GI Bill.       A veteran himself, Neiweem was assigned to ``Team Camo''      where he says managers urged the sales team to use high-     pressure tactics on troops who sometimes weren't suited for      college.       ``Working in the industry at that time truly reminded me of      the film `Glengarry Glen Ross,' '' he said.       ``There is this scene where a corporate sales manager is      brought in to improve the performance of the sales floor--     played by Alec Baldwin.''       In the scene, Baldwin says to a salesman ``they're sitting      out there waiting to give you their money, are you gonna take      it?''       ``And that was similar at the company,'' said Neiweem.       If ``Team Camo'' dared to let veterans suspend class while      in combat like those in the National Guard Neiweem says      management called them on the carpet.       Neiweem: The company didn't care. They just wanted to make      sure that they stayed in their classes and so the university      could continue to be paid and they would continue to be on      the enrollments books.       Attkisson: Even if they were in a combat zone that didn't      make sense for them to try to go to college on the computer?       Neiweem: Yes. Management's guiding wisdom was, to be frank,      ``get their ass in class.''       Neiweem showed Full Measure today's sales tactics at work.       In a chat on DeVry's website, he asks about costs and      benefits--but can't get direct answers.       ``I can have a representative from our military admissions      team reach out to you,'' he said, reading the response of a      recruiter.       ``It's fairly frustrating that I asked these questions and      I can't get answers. Rather, they're trying to sort of tie me      in and get me closer so they can work towards selling the      school.''       DeVry officials declined an on camera interview but said      ``DeVry has a long history of serving veterans and military      personnel'' dating back to the 1940's. And ``['W]e offer      quality academics and student services with flexibility to      meet their busy schedules.''       Former Congressman Steve Gunderson leads the main national      for-profit college trade group called the Association of      Private Sector Colleges and Universities (APSCU).       ``If anybody has a bad outcome, and certainly if a veteran      has a bad outcome, that's a problem and we want to solve      that,'' he said.       He believes for-profits are under assault from opponents      and competitors.       Gunderson: I have never before seen a situation where a      sector is the target of attacks for ideological reasons. I      mean, there simply are good people who do not believe the      private sector oughta be involved in the design and delivery      of education.       Attkisson: Fair enough, but is there any doubt in your mind      that some schools have used unfair, unethical, or even      dishonest tactics?       Gunderson: There is no doubt in my mind that there are bad      schools in every sector of higher education who have engaged      in inappropriate conduct for various reasons whether it be      athletics or whether it be admissions or it be something      else.       Gunderson said the industry is improving.       A Government Accountability Office report found for-profits      catering to military students actually beat public schools in      one area: higher graduation rates.       With billions flowing to for-profits under investigation,      President Obama dispatched a warning at Ft. Stewart army base      about any for profits that may be preying on the troops.       ``It's not right. They're trying to swindle and hoodwink      you. They don't care about you; they care about the cash,''      he said.       But as federal scrutiny surged, the industry has countered      with Washington lobbyists and campaign cash.       Since 2010, for-profit colleges have poured nearly $10      million ($9,906,512) into campaign contributions and spent      $41 ($41,924,452) million on lobbying, according to the      Center for Responsive Politics.       Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois): That's how you really win      friends and influence people on Capitol Hill. The for-profit      colleges and universities have friends in high places.       Attkisson: That implies some members in Congress, you      think, are bought and paid for on this issue.       Sen. Durbin: I would say this--they are influenced by it.       Senator Durbin has pushed one bill after another to fight      for-profit college fraud, only to see the bills get watered      down and voted down.       ``If these schools that are enticing kids into loans for      educations that are worthless had some `skin in the game,'      some responsibility for default, they'd think twice about it.      But they don't. They could care less,'' he said.       It turns out taxpayers have the most skin in the game.       In June, the federal government said it will forgive loans      for students at Corinthian College, putting taxpayers on the      hook for up to $3.5 billion. Corinthian shut down in May amid      fraud accusations, which the company denied. And the feds may      wipe out loans at other problematic colleges.       In May, the federal government charged Babcock's alma      mater, ITT Tech, with fraud, alleging it concealed financial      information from investors.       ITT is fighting the charges, but declined our interview      request.       Gunderson says he doubts Babcock's ITT degree would have      really been useless.       ``I am willing to say, that if he graduated, from an      accredited criminal justice program, there are many police      agencies that would hire him. Maybe not the one he wanted to      go to, but there are many that will, and evidence all across      the country shows that,'' said Gunderson.       Babcock gave up on the ITT degree and his dream of police      work. Instead, he's focused on warning other vets, and      working to pay down his $40 thousand student loan debt.       ``I think it's a shame that they prey on men and women that      volunteered to protect this country. And that earned a      benefit with their service, and then ITT and the other for-     profit schools are just trying to take that,'' he said.       The Defense Department recently banned the University of      Phoenix from recruiting on military bases, alleging a pattern      of violating policies designed to protect military students.      Senator Durbin says ITT is now facing investigations by the      Justice Department and 18 Attorneys General.
