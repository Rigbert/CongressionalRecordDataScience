 I remember the negotiations. I remember everyone coming out in a bipartisan manner, in fact struggling to get their press conferences before their counterparts in the other party, in order to take credit for the class size reduction.  Senator Gorton here in the Senate was part of those negotiations. As the Senator mentioned, the House chairman, a Republican, as well as Dick Armey, came out and said: We have made progress. We have done something that is important. We are behind the class size reduction. This is a commitment we are going to make.  So it is very surprising to me that the House has zeroed out money now and said it is no longer a priority, and here in the Senate bill we are doing the same thing.
