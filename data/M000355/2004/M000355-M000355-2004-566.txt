R. 4, the welfare reform reauthorization bill. Under a previous agreement, at 12:15 p.m., the Senate will vote on the pending Snowe amendment on childcare. The vote on the Snowe amendment will be the first vote of tomorrow's session. For the remainder of the day, the Senate will continue debate on the welfare reauthorization bill.  As the majority leader stated earlier today, we hope that Senators will offer relevant amendments to the bill so we can finish this important legislation this week.  Additional rollcall votes are expected tomorrow afternoon as we try to make progress on the underlying welfare reauthorization bill.
