Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am offering this amendment on behalf of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella), my good friend and colleague, who was unavoidably detained on official business. As a supporter of the Fossella amendment, I offer it on his behalf.  This amendment very simply seeks to withhold U.S. funding from any U.N. commission, organization or affiliated agency that is chaired or presided over by a country the government of which the Secretary of State has determined has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism until such time that the President determines that they are no longer doing so.  If Members of the U.N. elect known state sponsors of terrorism to lead U.N. organizations, we believe U.S. tax dollars should not support those entities.  In a post-9/11 world we are seeking to build multilateral strategies to address threats of global terror. We must use all available diplomatic tools and leverage such as U.S. contributions, to halt the influence of countries that sponsor and export terror.  This amendment seeks to prevent identified state sponsors of terrorism such as Iran, Syria, North Korea, Cuba and Libya from being able to attain leadership positions at U.N. commissions, organizations or affiliated agencies such as the Conference on Disarmament and U.N. human rights bodies.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
