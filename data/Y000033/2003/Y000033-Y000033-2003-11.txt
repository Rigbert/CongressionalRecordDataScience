Madam Chairman, I cannot specifically answer the gentleman's question at this time. It is my intent to make sure the vessels, whatever vessels operate in these waters, will be under Coast Guard jurisdiction, and I think that is what the intent of this is. It is my intent, personally, as chairman.  The gentleman brings up a point about a Customs ruling that can be changed. I do not intend to do anything. As my colleague knows, I support the Jones Act equally as he does, and we will be reviewing this, and I am willing to work with the gentleman as this legislation goes forward to see if we cannot make sure that his and my ideas are implemented because I am not going to get involved right now with the trips to nowhere because I do not know the effect of this legislation on those activities at this time.
