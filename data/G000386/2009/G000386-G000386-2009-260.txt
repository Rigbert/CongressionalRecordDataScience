  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership in this area. I very much enjoy working with him. We may come from different political parties, but he has been very cooperative in a lot of the efforts I wanted to make on individual pieces of legislation. On this one, he and I are working together very closely. I thank him for the opportunity to work with him and thank him very much for including within this legislation some things both he and I have an interest in dealing with the False Claims Act.  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act. This is a timely piece of legislation, given the current economic downturn and the unprecedented amount of taxpayer dollars that are being expended to shore up banks and financial institutions, corporations, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, et cetera. When taxpayer money is being injected into these corporations, there is more opportunity for fraud, and we ought to stay on top of it. We have a responsibility as Senators, as guardians of taxpayer money, to make sure fraud does not occur anytime but, more importantly, when there is taxpayer money keeping a lot of these organizations afloat that would not otherwise be there.
