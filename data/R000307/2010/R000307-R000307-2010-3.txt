The health care reform bill that is current law--big issue. A lot of talk about repeal, fix what is wrong in the bill, what is right in the bill, depending upon your personal opinion.  I think that the Senate--more especially the committees of jurisdiction, and I am talking about the Senate Finance Committee--has a unique obligation, especially at this time, to conduct its oversight responsibility. Unfortunately, that was not the case as of yesterday.  One of the major problems with the new health care law is the huge amount of power and authority it grants to one man, the Administrator, perhaps we should call him the czar, of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS. Rest assured, every health care provider in the country knows what and who CMS is.
