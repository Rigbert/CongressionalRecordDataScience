Mr. Chairman, this amendment would not only hamstring the flexibility of rebuilding fish stocks that this bill provides, it would add serious bureaucratic delays in the development of fishery management plans across the country.  Furthermore, according to NOAA, this amendment would eliminate some of the flexibility currently provided under the national standard, one which was updated under the Obama administration, and would cause an unnecessary reduction in the catch.  NOAA also expressed concerns regarding the potential impact on international fishing agreements that wouldchange how the U.S. can negotiate on rebuilding plans. According to a letter authored by the National Coalition for Fishing Communities, this amendment would undermine the act, impede reforms that are desperately needed, and attack jobs in coastal communities.  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter to the leadership of the House and to myself where they say such an amendment sponsored by Mr. Jared Huffman of California and Mr. Alcee Hastings of Florida will ensure it does not: ``We believe it would actually undermine the MSA, impede reforms that are desperately needed, and attack jobs in coastal communities around the country, including in California and Florida, the home States of Mr. Huffman and Mr. Hastings.''                                                National Coalition                                      for Fishing Communities,                                                    July 10, 2018.     Hon. Paul Ryan,     Speaker, United States House of Representatives, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,     Majority Leader, United States House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McCarthy: H.R. 200      (formerly H.R. 1335), the ``Strengthening Fishing Communities      and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act'' is      the product of three Managing our Nations Fisheries      (``MONF'') conferences, and numerous hearings with well over      a hundred witnesses (from to 2009 through 2017). These many      efforts were held in large part to address unintended      consequences in the implementation of the 2006      reauthorization.       The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management      Act (MSA) has largely been a success, but no law is perfect,      and H.R. 200 contains a number of important updates and      refinements. But as a result of a barrage of last-minute      amendments, proposed outside of the committee process, years      of hard work to create honest reform of the MSA is now in      jeopardy.       One such amendment, sponsored by Congressman Jared Huffman      (D-California) and Alcee Hastings (D-Florida) purports to      ``ensure that rebuilding plans are successful in rebuilding      overfished fish stocks.'' However, we believe it would      actually undermine the MSA, impede reforms that are      desperately needed, and attack jobs in coastal communities      around the country, including in California and Florida, the      home states of Mr. Huffman and Mr. Hastings.       In a letter delivered to their offices on last week, we      asked Mr. Huffman and Mr. Hastings to please explain to us      how they foresee that this amendment could be enacted without      having the effect of reducing commercial, charter and      recreational fishing quotas significantly. We also asked that      since they represent California and Florida, and since our      membership includes members who represent fishing interests      in California and Florida, that they explain how they see      this amendment improving conditions for seafood harvesters      and processors in your respective home states. Unfortunately      we did not receive a response to those questions.       In the provisions contained in this amendment were      implemented, the required theoretical probability of      management measures rebuilding a stock in the shortest time      period as possible would increase from 50% to 75% for many      species. The ``Huffman-Hastings Amendment'' would impose a      burden on many U.S.-managed fisheries.       While this sounds like an innocuous effort to strengthen      and improve the law, the fact is, the only way to meet the      requirements of the amendment would be to significantly      reduce many commercial, charter and recreational fishing      quotas significantly. Considering the status of U.S. fish      stocks recently described in NOAA's 2018 Report to Congress      as ``Overfishing remains near all time lows and we reached a      new milestone with the number of overfished stocks at the      lowest level ever'', the validity and intent of the ``Huffman      Amendment'' should be seriously questioned.       Why, if the current Act's requirements are having success      in rebuilding stocks, is there a reason to require the law to      be substantially more conservative?       In addition, the amendment removes a subtle but important      update to the MSA.       Section 304 of MSA states that ``For a fishery that is      overfished, any fishery management plan, amendment, or      proposed regulations . . . shall . . . specify a time period      for rebuilding the fishery that shall . . . be as short as      possible, taking into account the status and biology of any      overfished stocks of fish, the needs of fishing communities,      recommendations by international organizations in which the      United States participates, and the interaction of the      overfished stock of fish within the marine ecosystem.''       There is widespread support to change the term ``possible''      to ``practicable'' in this section. The intent of this change      is not to compromise or weaken the effectiveness of the MSA,      but rather to help better fulfill one of the fundamental and      original goals of the Act, emphasized in National Standard      1--to prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing      basis the optimum yield from each fishery. Changing the      terminology from ``possible'' to ``practicable'' would      provide Regional Fishery Management Councils with much-needed      flexibility and the option to choose between several      rebuilding scenarios to achieve specified conservation and      management objectives, not just the shortest and, quite      often, most harmful to fishing communities.       We must remain committed to restoring common sense to MSA.      We must not undermine our Nation's fisheries law in the name      of improving it, and cause harm to commercial charter and      recreational fishermen from Alaska to Maine.       Coastal communities and fishing families are relying on the      passage of clean legislation, as developed in committee.       We urge Members to vote NO on the Huffman Amendment to H.R.      200!
