 ``We need $6 or $7 billion to take care of our Members,'' meaning projects that Members had that they wanted in the Defense budget.  That is just exactly the amount of money that we are above the President's figures. So I figure we have about $6 or $7 billion in here just to take care of a bunch of pork barrelers.  That is what I am complaining about.
