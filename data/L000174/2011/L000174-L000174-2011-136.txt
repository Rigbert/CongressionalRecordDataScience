President, in a few moments the Senate has the opportunity to proceed to the American Jobs Act. The bill the President asked us to pass a month ago includes bipartisan proposals that have received broad approval in the past from Members of both parties, including road and bridge repairs, teacher retentions and extensions of tax relief for businesses to encourage hiring. We should answer the President's call and the American people's needs and act to help get Americans back to work and grow the economy.  There is another unacceptable rate that we can help change to the benefit of all Americans. That is the judicial vacancy rate. It now stands at nearly 11 percent, with 92 vacancies on Federal courts around the country. I will ask to have printed in the Record an editorial on this topic entitled ``The Other Federal Crisis'' that appeared in McClatchy--Tribune papers last week.  We can act today to bring down that rate dramatically by considering and confirming 26 judicial nominations approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee that are awaiting final Senate action.  Today we are voting on only one of those judicial 26 nominees. With Republican agreement, all 26 could have been voted on today. Of the 25 judges who will remain on the Executive Calendar after today's vote, 21 were reported with the unanimous support of all Democrats and all Republicans serving on the Judiciary Committee. All of them have the support of their home State Senators, 10 include Republicans home State Senators.  Today, the Senate will finally vote on the nomination of Jane Triche-Milazzo to serve as a district judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. While I am pleased that we are finally having a vote on Judge Triche-Milazzo's nomination, after 3 months of unnecessary delay, more than two dozen well-qualified, consensus nominees still await a Senate confirmation vote. At a time when vacancies on Federal courts throughout the country have remained near or above 90 for more than 2 years, delaying votes on these nominees needlessly undermines the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around the country.  The Senate could take significant steps today to address this ongoing crisis in judicial vacancies just by acting on the nominations thoroughly vetted by the Judiciary Committee and reported with bipartisan support. This week, with Republican cooperation, the Judiciary Committee could report five more consensus nominees to fill judicial emergency vacancies on the Eleventh Circuit and in Utah, as well as vacancies in Missouri, Nebraska, and Washington. I have repeatedly noted Senator Grassley's willingness to work with me to make sure that the Judiciary Committee makes progress on nominations. Regrettably, the Judiciary Committee's efforts to act on nominations have not been matched by action by the Senate, where the Republican leadership has refused promptly to consider even consensus nominations. They are delayed for months. The Republican leadership's refusal to promptly schedule votes on pending judicial nominations is a departure from the Senate's action in regularly considering President Bush's nominations, which we did whether the Senate had a Democratic or Republican majority. At this point in George W. Bush's presidency, the Senate had confirmed 162 of his nominees for the Federal circuit and district courts, including 100 during the 17 months that I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee during his first term. By this date in President Clinton's first term, the Senate had confirmed 163 of his nominations to circuit and district courts. In stark contrast, after today's vote, the Senate will have confirmed only 105 of President Obama's nominees to Federal circuit and district courts. In the next year, we need to confirm 100 more of his circuit and district court nominations to match the 205 confirmed during President Bush's first term.  We can and must do better to address the serious judicial vacancies crisis affecting Federal courts around thecountry. Nearly half of all Americans--136 million--live in districts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled today if the Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on the nominations currently pending on the Executive Calendar. As many as 21 states are served by Federal courts with vacancies that would be filled by nominations stalled on the Senate calendar. Millions of Americans across the country are being harmed by delays in overburdened courts. The Republican leadership should explain to the American people why they will not consent to vote on the qualified, consensus candidates nominated to fill these extended judicial vacancies.  The unnecessary delays in our consideration of judicial nominations have contributed to the longest period of historically high vacancy rates in the last 35 years. The number of judicial vacancies rose above 90 in August 2009, and it has stayed near or above that level ever since. Vacancies are twice as high as they were at this point in President Bush's first term when the Senate was expeditiously voting on consensus judicial nominations. We must bring an end to these needless delays in the Senate so that we can ease the burden on our Federal courts so that they can better serve the American people.  Last week, the Senate voted to confirm Judge Jennifer Guerin Zipps, who was nominated to fill the emergency judicial vacancy created by the tragic death of Judge Roll in the Tucson, AZ, shootings. I was pleased that, with cooperation from Republican Senators, the time from when the Judiciary Committee reported Judge Zipps' nomination to full Senate consideration was less than a month even including a recess period. All nominations should move at that rate. It should not take a tragedy to spur us to action to fill a judicial emergency vacancy. Indeed, the time it took the Senate to consider Judge Zipps' nomination was in line with the average time it took for the Senate to consider President Bush's unanimously reported judicial nominations, 28 days. Her nomination would not have been an exception during those years as it regrettably has become today. President Obama's consensus nominations, reported with the unanimous support of every Republican and Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, have waited an average of 79 days on the Executive Calendar before consideration by the Senate. Today's nominee is a good example. She was reported unanimously on July 14. That was nearly 3 months ago.  Last week, I invited Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer to appear before the Judiciary Committee and discuss the important role that judges play under our Constitution. Justice Scalia agreed that the extensive delays in the confirmation process are already having a chilling effect on the ability to attract talented nominees to the Federal bench. Chief Justice Roberts has also described the ``persistent problem of judicial vacancies in critically overworked districts.'' Hardworking Americans are denied justice when their cases are delayed by overburdened courts. While people appearing in court are waiting years before a judge rules on their case, they feel they are being forced to live the old adage ``justice delayed is justice denied.''  Today the Senate will confirm an experienced, consensus nominee who could and should have received a vote prior to the August recess. Jane Triche-Milazzo is nominated to fill a vacancy in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Currently a Louisiana State court judge, she previously spent 16 years in private practice in her family's law firm in Napoleonville, LA. Judge Triche-Milazzo has the bipartisan support of her home State Senators, Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu and Republican Senator David Vitter. The Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination without a single dissenting vote almost 3 months ago. I expect that the Senate will confirm her unanimously today.  We must do more to make progress in considering the other 25 judicial nominations pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. The excessive number of vacancies has persisted in Federal courts throughout the Nation for far too long. The American people should not have to wait for the Senate to do its constitutional duty of confirming judges to the Federal bench. With millions of Americans currently affected by the vacancy crisis in our courts, there is serious work to be done.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the editorial to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Miami Herald, Oct. 2, 2011]                        The Other Federal Crisis       In the month since Congress returned from the summer      recess, the crisis over the deficit and federal spending has      been the focus of attention, with ideological gridlock      obstructing progress. But partisan politics has also produced      a separate crisis in the nation's federal courts.       During September, the Senate confirmed a grand total of      three federal judges--leaving 95 vacancies in courthouses      around the country. This means that there are simply not      enough federal judges to handle the judicial workload,      resulting in justice delayed in both criminal and civil      cases. In 35 of those instances, including two district seats      in the Southern District of Florida, the courts have declared      a judicial emergency, meaning the dockets are overloaded to      the breaking point.       According to a recent report by the Congressional Research      Service, this is a historically high level of vacancies, and      the prolonged slowness in filling the empty seats makes the      Obama presidency the longest period of high vacancy rates in      the federal judiciary in 35 years.       Clearly, the Senate is not fulfilling its constitutional      duty to confirm judges. Some 58 Obama administration nominees      are pending in the Senate to fill the 95 vacancies.      Republican senators have complained that there should be a      nominee for every vacancy--fair enough--but that does not      explain why so many of the nominations have been stalled for      so long.       The Senate, of course, has a duty to ensure that nominees      are qualified. No one wants a ``fast-tracked'' judge hearing      cases. But it's hard to escape the conclusion that partisan      politics rather than the quality of the nominees is the root      of the problem when even consensus candidates must wait for      prolonged periods.       This Monday, for example, the Senate is expected to fill      some of those vacancies when six of the nominations go to the      floor for a vote, meaning there has been a preceding      agreement not to block the vote.       That generally leads to confirmation. Of those six, five      have been pending since May and June--and all of them were      approved with a unanimous vote by Democratic and Republican      members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In other words,      there is no question that the nominees have the      qualifications to do the job--so why the delay?       In the past, Democrats have been slow to approve nominees      from Republican presidents. But the record shows that      approvals for nominees by the last Republican president,      George W. Bush, moved faster even when Democrats had the      power to block confirmation.       At this point in the presidency of President Bush, 144      federal circuit and district court judges had been confirmed.      By comparison, according to Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy,      chairman of the Judiciary Committee, total confirmations of      federal circuit and district court judges during the first      three years of the Obama administration have been only 98.      ``The Senate has a long way to go before the end of next year      to match the 205 confirmations of President Bush's judicial      nominees during his first term,'' he said.       This is a problem senators can solve easily. First, vote on      all 27 pending nominees who have already won committee      approval, beginning with those who received a unanimous vote.      Then move the other nominations to the floor without      unreasonable delay. The deterioration of the federal      judiciary because of partisan politics is inexcusable.
