 President, for the benefit of our colleagues, we are making pretty good progress here. We only have a few amendments to go. To try to get a sense for our schedules and time, I will start by saying I don't see any reason why we will not finish this bill early tonight, No. 1. No. 2, I am told by the leaders that there will be no votes between now and 4.  We are prepared to take up, debate, discuss, and accept some amendments. I wish to ask my colleagues who have amendments--Senator Vitter is working with us right now. We may be able to work something out on his amendment. Senator DeMint has an amendment that we have debated. We are ready to vote on it, but he indicated he may have other people wishing to speak to it. We are ready to vote, after 4 o'clock, on that. I wish to set a time for that. Senator Craig has two amendments. One we are prepared to accept, and the other we are prepared to vote on. I believe he is ready to vote when we can set the time. Senator Kyl has an amendment that I believe we are ready to vote on. The only question is whether there will be a point of order on that amendment because it relates to the budget. That is being discussed now. Senator Sessions has an amendment which we are desperately trying to figure out how to proceed on and work out. We may be able to accommodate that and end up with a voice vote on that amendment.  I want my colleagues to know that in the next ensuing minutes and hours we are going to try to work out specific times. As my grandfather used to say, ``With the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors,'' by 4 o'clock, we will be able to set a series of votes. I don't see why we cannot finish this by 5 o'clock. That is the intention, but intentions here are not always met with reality. That is the intention.  I see my colleague, the ranking member of the committee, standing up. I don't know if he wants to make any comment.
