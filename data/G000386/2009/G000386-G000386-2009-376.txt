 President, while we are debating this trillion dollar bill, we need to keep our eye on the ball. We have a preliminary study that I have referred to a couple times in previous debates by the Congressional Budget Office, which shows that jobs created by the economic stimulus legislation being debated in the Senate would cost the taxpayers between $100,000 and $300,000 apiece.  These numbers should be contrasted to those under the January baseline of the Congressional Budget Office, in which there is no stimulus, that shows that the gross domestic product per worker is about $100,000. In other words, without the bill, the new analysis indicates that the cost of each stimulus job to be as much as three times more than jobs created without the stimulus bill.  There has been a lot of talk about getting the most ``bang for the buck,'' but there is no talk about actually making sure it happens so that Americans get the help they need. Before Congress spends another trillion dollars, we ought to make sure we are getting our money's worth. I will reiterate a caution that I gave the other day. Before this bill passes the Senate, we ought to have the full analysis of the Congressional Budget Office that they said would take a few days to get done. We need to know what these jobs are going to cost so we get our money's worth. We are the caretakers of the taxpayers' dollars--tossing money at a program, when you figure that our gross domestic product would produce about $100,000 per worker--and we have in this bill these jobs costing up to $300,000 apiece.  I yield the floor.
