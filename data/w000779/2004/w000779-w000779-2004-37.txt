President, the threat of terrorism is an unfortunate fact of life today, and it is not going to go away any time soon. Protecting American citizens against this threat will continue to be an essential and urgent task for the foreseeable future.  However, I do not believe that fighting terrorism aggressively requires tossing civil liberties protections into the scrap heap. This is not an ``either or'' choice. This country's tradition of high standards of civil rights and civil liberties should not and need not become the first casualty of the war on terrorism.  I have made this point repeatedly in the time since the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Still, all too often, we have seen well-meaning government agencies take the approach of designing a security system or program first, and worrying about the civil liberties and privacy implications later.  I am convinced that the approach of making civil liberties an afterthought doesn't work and isn't acceptable. Civil liberties and privacy considerations need to be built into the DNA of the Homeland Security Department and its various programs.  The legislation that created the Homeland Security Department included some very positive steps in that regard, by creating an Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and a Privacy Officer.  Today, I am joining Senator Collins in introducing new legislation to flesh out the role and stature of these key offices within the Department.  Specifically, the legislation would add a reference to civil liberties to the statutory mission statement of the Department of Homeland Security. It would provide further detail as to the duties of the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. It would specify that both the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Privacy Officer shall report directly to the Secretary. And it would direct the DHS Inspector General to designate a point person within the I.G. office to focus expressly on civil liberties matters.  None of these items represents a radical departure from the original Homeland Security legislation or the current practice of the department. Rather, this new bill codifies much of what is already going on, giving it a firm statutory basis.  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Collins and me in supporting this legislation, and in delivering a strong message that civil liberties matters remain a core factor in this country's homeland security efforts. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.                                 ______                                       By
