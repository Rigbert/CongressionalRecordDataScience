Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I have already informed the Fish and Wildlife of this issue; and, to my knowledge, there has been no fines of that amount, but they could occur. We have to change it so it could not occur. If there has been any fines placed after the passage of the law last year, they have been in the $100, $200, $300 range, and we expect to keep it that way.
