 President, in light of this agreement, on behalf of the leader, I announce that there will be no further rollcall votes tonight.  It is the hope of the managers--Senator Lautenberg and I--that this bill will be passed by 1 p.m. on Thursday, tomorrow. All Members have a lot in this Transportation appropriations bill. I hope all Members who have amendments will come forward. A lot of Members are already coming. We are working them out. If we work together, I think we can work this out tomorrow.
