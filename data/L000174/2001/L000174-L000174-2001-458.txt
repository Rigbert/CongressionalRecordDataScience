President, in the last Congress I introduced a bill, S.2993, with Senator Kohl to give the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, and the Department of Justice, DOJ, the ability to effectively enforce antitrust laws concerning contract and payment arrangements between drug companies which could hurt consumers.  Unfortunately, no action was taken on that Leahy-Kohl bill, and the newspapers are now full of articles about allegations that Shering-Plough paid $90 million to generic drug manufacturers to delay sales of a low-cost generic drug taken by heart patients.  While these allegations have yet to be resolved for those particular companies, this story highlights the need to pass legislation to prevent this type of problem from happening in the future.  If Dante were writing The Inferno today, he might well have reserved a special place for those who engage in these anti-consumer conspiracies.  The Federal Trade Commission deserves credit for exposing this problem, during last Congress and this Congress. Under the bill we are introducing today, companies are required to give the FTC and the Justice Department the information they need to prevent manufacturers of patented drugs--often brand-name drugs--from simply paying generic drug companies to keep lower-cost products off the market.  These deals which prevent competition hurt senior citizens, hurt families, and cheat healthcare providers.  These pharmaceutical giants and their generic partners then share the profits gained from cheating American families.  The companies have been able to get away with this by signing secret deals with each other not to compete. Our bill, the ``Drug Competition Act of 2001'', will expose these deals and subject them to immediate investigation and appropriate action by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department.  This solves the most difficult problem faced by federal investigators: finding out about the improper deals. This bill does not change the so-called Hatch-Waxman Act, it does not amend FDA law, and it does not slow down the drug approval process. It allows existing antitrust laws to be enforced by ensuring that the enforcement agencies have information about no-compete deals. The same confidentiality requirements will still apply to the FTC and to DOJ, as under current law.  The issue of making deals which prevent competition was addressed in a New York Times editorial titled, ``Driving Up Drug Prices,'' published on July 26, 2000. The editorial noted that even though the FTC ``is taking aggressive action to curb the practice. It needs help from Congress to close loopholes in federal law.''  This bill is that help, and the bill slams the door shut on would-be violators by exposing the deals to our competition enforcement agencies.  Under current law, manufacturers of generic drugs are encouraged to challenge weak or invalid patents on brand-name drugs so that consumers can enjoy lower generic drug prices.  Current law grants these generic companies a temporary protection from competition to the first manufacturer that gets permission to sell a generic drug before the patent on the brand-name drug expires.  This approach then gives the generic drug manufacturer a 180-day head start on other generic companies.  That was a good idea. The unfortunate loophole that has been open to exploitation is the fact that secret deals can be made that allow the manufacturer of the generic drug to claim the 180-day grace period, to block other generic drugs from entering the market, while, at the same time, getting paid by the brand-name manufacturer for not selling the lower-cost generic drug.  The bill we are introducing today will shut this loophole down for companies who want to cheat the public, but keeps the system the same for companies engaged in true competition with each other. This bill would give the FTC or the Justice Department the information they need to take quick and decisive action against companies driven more by greed than by good sense.  It is important for Congress not to overreact to these outrages by throwing out the good with the bad. Most generic companies want to take advantage of this 180-day provision and deliver quality generic drugs at much lower costs for consumers. We should not eliminate the incentive for them to do that.  Instead, we should let the FTC and DOJ look at every single deal that could lead to abuse so that only the deals that are consistent with the intent of that law will be allowed to stand.  We look forward to suggestions from other Members on this matter and from brand-name and generic manufacturers who will work with us to make sure this loophole is closed. .  We are pleased that Congressman Waxman will introduce a companion bill in the House of Representatives. I look forward to working with him and with the other cosponsors in this effort.  I ask unanimous consent that a brief summary of the Drug Competition Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              Summary of the Drug Competition Act of 2001       The bill facilitates Federal Trade Commission and      Department of Justice confidential review of agreements      between brand-name drug manufacturers and potential generic      competitors so that they can more efficiently enforce      existing antitrust laws.       The bill covers brand-name drug manufacturers and generic      manufacturers that enter into agreements regarding the sale      or manufacture of a potentially competing generic equivalent      (of any particular brand-name drug).       In cases where those agreements could have the effect of      limiting sales of that generic-equivalent drug, or could      limit the research or development of that competing generic,      both (or all) companies are required to file the texts of      those agreements with the Federal Trade Commission and with      the Attorney General within 10 business days after the      agreement is executed.       Failure to file may result in a civil penalty of not more      that $20,000, per day. The Act would take effect 90 days      after enactment.       No existing time limits, requirements, or patent or drug      approval systems are affected by this limited filing      requirement. The bill does not amend the Sherman Act, other      antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Hatch-     Waxman Act or other generic drug laws, the Federal Food, Drug      and Cosmetic Act, or any patent or drug safety law.                          ____________________
