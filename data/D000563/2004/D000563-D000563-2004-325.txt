President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to cosponsor S. 1709, the Security and Freedom Ensured Act, the SAFE Act, which Senator Larry Craig and I have introduced with several of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle.  The SAFE Act is a narrowly tailored bill that would revise several provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. It would safeguard the rights of innocent Americans without impeding law enforcement's ability to fight terrorism. The SAFE Act is supported by a broad coalition of organizations and individuals from across the political spectrum.  I challenge any of my colleagues to find the broad base of political support for virtually any bill that we have found for the SAFE Act.  I voted for the PATRIOT Act. I believed then and I still believe that the act made many reasonable and necessary changes in the law. However, the PATRIOT Act contains several provisions that do not adequately protect innocent Americans from unwarranted Government surveillance. The FBI now has broad authority to obtain a ``John Doe'' roving wiretap which does not identify the person or place being tapped. The FBI has authority now to conduct sneak-and-peek searches and to seize personal records.  The PATRIOT Act was passed at a critical moment in the history of the United States. It was a moment of tragedy and fear. Now with more than 2 years of hindsight and experience, it is time to revisit this law.  I can recall--and I am sure all who followed this debate can remember--how we felt after September 11. Just a few steps away from this Chamber, I was meeting in a room with Senator Daschle and a group of Senators and we saw on television the images which every American has seared in their memory. Then someone suggested a bomb had gone off at the Pentagon. We gathered by the windows and looked down this beautiful Mall toward the Washington Monument and saw black smoke billowing across the Potomac, unaware at that moment another airplane had struck that building, killing many innocent Americans.  It was a time of great concern and great anxiety and great unity. The administration came to us and said to the Congress, Give us the tools to find the people responsible for this terrible American tragedy. Give us what we need to protect Americans and to fight the war on terrorism.  In a rare showing of bipartisan support, Democrats and Republicans came together and addressed some of the most difficult and complicated questions about Government authority andindividual freedom we have had to address in our history. I am proud to say in a short period of time there was a bipartisan consensus, a consensus which tried to work out the best way to meet the requirements of the administration and to make America safe.  Many of these provisions were worrisome. We were not certain whether we had gone too far in giving the Government more authority and Americans fewer freedoms than necessary. So we included in the PATRIOT Act sunset provisions. Basically, what that means is that over some period of time, a year or two, these provisions would expire and be subject to renewal and reapproval by Congress. Of course, at that point we would be forced to assess their impact.  Interestingly, since that day, from some quarters, the volume has grown in support of basically eliminating the sunset provisions and saying this will be permanent law and we will not revisit it. However, many have looked at the PATRIOT Act, including Senator Craig and myself, and feel there are four specific areas of the Act that should be amended by our SAFE Act. Senator Craig, a Republican, and myself, as a Democrat, reached across the partisan divide to work together on this bill. It is quite an unusual political marriage. Senator John Sununu, also a cosponsor, joked that when Senator Craig and Senator Durbin introduce a bill together, it proves one thing: One of them must not have read it.  Well, that is not true. We have both read the SAFE Act. Our cooperation on this piece of legislation speaks volumes about the need to make changes in the PATRIOT Act.  Some claim because we are at war, the American people want the Government to keep them safe, no matter what. I think they are wrong. The American people care very deeply about their freedoms. They are watching Congress carefully and they are concerned that perhaps in some areas we went too far in passing the PATRIOT Act. I have heard from a lot of my constituents. 275 communities in 39 states have passed resolutions expressing concern about the provisions of the PATRIOT Act. These communities represent close to 50 million Americans. Almost one out of every six Americans has, through their elected representatives in their communities, expressed some concern about the provisions of the PATRIOT Act.  Let me be very frank about the bill itself. The PATRIOT Act was over 130 pages long. It is very complicated. Most Americans have not read every word of it. Many Americans who may not be able to explain the exact details of the PATRIOT Act still are concerned it is restricting their freedoms unnecessarily.  Some argue this means we should not take the American people so seriously because they cannot cite specific sections of the bill. I disagree. There is no reason to dismiss these public concerns. And this is no excuse for inaction. The burden of proof is not on the American people when the Government seeks to take away their rights and liberties. The burden of proof is on the Government.  What is clear is the American people want us to strike a balance, give the FBI and law enforcement and intelligence agencies the powers they need to fight terrorism but also to protect American liberty. That is what the SAFE Act would do.  An unusual thing has occurred with the introduction of this bill. I have been on Capitol Hill for over two decades working in the House and in the Senate. I have never seen this happen before. The Bush administration announced with the introduction of the bill they would veto it. The bill has not been considered before a committee. It has not been subject to amendment in committee. It has not been debated in committee. It has not come to the floor of the House or the Senate, nor has it been subject to debate and amendment there. There is no final work product, only the initial offering by Senator Craig and myself.  Based on that and that alone, the Bush administration has said they are going to oppose this bill and they are going to veto this bill. I have never seen anything quite like that.  The Justice Department argues our bill would eliminate some PATRIOT Act powers and make it even more difficult to effectively fight terrorism. Frankly, these objections do not hold water. The SAFE Act neither repeals any provision of the PATRIOT Act nor amends pre-PATRIOT Act law. In fact, the SAFE Act retains the expanded powers created by the PATRIOT Act while placing important checks on these powers.  Senator Craig and I wrote a letter responding in detail to the Justice Department's objections to the bill and their threat to veto the bill, which has not even passed either the House or the Senate.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                Washington, DC, February 23, 2004.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Hart Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: We write to request that you schedule a      hearing in the Judiciary Committee as soon as possible on S.      1709, the Security and Freedom Ensured (SAFE) Act, a      narrowly-tailored, bipartisan bill that would amend several      provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act (P.L. 107-56). We would      also like to take this opportunity to respond to concerns the      Justice Department has raised regarding the SAFE Act.       We voted for the PATRIOT Act and believe now, as we did      then, that the PATRIOT Act made many reasonable and necessary      changes in the law. However, the PATRIOT Act contains several      provisions that create unnecessary risks that the activities      of innocent Americans may be monitored without adequate      judicial oversight.       This concern is shared by a broad coalition of      organizations and individuals from across the political      spectrum. In fact, 257 communities in 38 states--representing      approximately 43.5 million people--have passed resolutions      opposing or expressing concern about the PATRIOT Act. Groups      as politically diverse as the ACLU and the American      Conservation Union have also endorsed changes in the law.       In his State of the Union address, the President called for      reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. Given the bipartisan      concerns about the most controversial provisions of the law,      however, this will not happen unless these provisions are      revisited. Congress, in fact, made oversight of the PATRIOT      Act implicit by sunsetting over a dozen sections of the bill      at the time of its passage.       S. 1709, the SAFE Act, was drafted with this oversight in      mind. It was drafted to clarify and amend in a minor way the      PATRIOT Act's most troubling provisions so that whole or even      piecemeal repeal of the law would be unnecessary. It was      drafted to safeguard the liberties of law-abiding citizens      while preserving the law enforcement authorities essential to      a successful war on terror.       The Administration unfortunately has threatened to veto the      SAFE Act. The Justice Department argues that the SAFE Act      would ``eliminate'' some PATRIOT tools and ``make it even      more difficult to mount an effective anti-terror campaign      than it was before the PATRIOT Act was passed.''       We respectfully disagree with the Justice Department's      objections to our reasoned and measured effort to mend the      PATRIOT Act. The SAFE Act neither repeals any provision of      the PATRIOT Act, nor impedes law enforcement's ability to      investigate terrorism by amending pre-PATRIOT Act law.      Rather, the SAFE Act retains the expanded powers created by      the PATRIOT Act while restoring important checks and balances      on powers including roving wiretaps, ``sneak and peek''      warrants, compelled production of personal records, and      National Security Letters.                            Roving Wiretaps       The SAFE Act would place reasonable checks on the use of      roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes. Normally, when the      government seeks a warrant authorizing a wiretap, its      application must specify both the target (the individual) and      the facilities (the telephone or computer) that will be      tapped. Roving wiretaps, which do not require the government      to specify the facilities to be tapped, are designed to allow      law enforcement to tract targets who evade surveillance by      frequently changing facilities. Before the PATRIOT Act,      roving wiretaps were only permitted for criminal, not      intelligence, investigations. The PATRIOT Act authorized the      FBI to use roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes for the      first time.       Using roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes is      important. Unfortunately, the PATRIOT Act did not include      sufficient checks to protect innocent Americans from      unwarranted government surveillance. Under the PATRIOT Act,      the FBI is not required to determine whether the target of      the wiretap is present at the place being wiretapped, as it      is for criminal wiretaps.       The Intelligence Authorization Act of 2002 made another      dramatic change in the law. The FBI is now permitted to      obtain a ``John Doe'' roving wiretap for intelligence      purposes, an authority not authorized in any other context. A      ``John Doe'' roving wiretap does not specify the target of      the wiretap or     the place to be wiretapped. In other words, the FBI can      obtain a wiretap without saying whom they want to wiretap or      where they want to wiretap.       The Justice Department defends this authority by noting      that even if the target of the wiretap is not identified, a      description of the target is required. The law does not      require the description to include any specific level of      detail, however. It could be as broad as, for example,      ``white man'' or ``Hispanic woman.'' Such a general      description does not adequately protect innocent Americans      from unwarranted government surveillance.       The SAFE Act would retain the PATRIOT Act's authorization      of roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes but impose      reasonable limits on this authority. Law enforcement would      be required to ascertain the presence of the target before      beginning surveillance and identify either the target of      the wiretap or the place to be wiretapped. The FBI would      not be able to obtain ``John Doe'' roving wiretaps,      thereby ensuring that the government does not surveil      innocent Americans who are not the target of the wiretap.       The Justice Department argues that ``John Don'' roving      wiretaps are necessary because there may be circumstances      where the government knows a target's physical description      but not his identity. If the government is tracking a suspect      closely enough to utilize a wiretap, it is unlikely his or      her identity will be unknown to them. In this unusual      circumstance, the SAFE Act would permit the issuance of a      ``John Doe'' wiretap which would not identify the target but      rather the facilities to be wiretapped. If the government      wished to obtain a roving wiretap, they could do so by      identifying the target. It is important to note that the      government is not required to identify the target by his or      her actual name. The government, for example, could identify      the target by an alias. This level of detail should be      required to make clear who is being targeted to prevent      innocent people with no relationship to the target from being      spied upon.                      ``sneak and peek'' searches       The SAFE Act would impose reasonable limits on the issuance      of delayed notification (or ``sneak and peek'') search      warrants. A sneak and peek warrant permits law enforcement to      conduct a search without notifying the target until sometime      after the search has occurred. The Justice Department argues      that sneak and peek warrants for physical evidence ``had been      available for decades before the PATRIOT Act was passed,''      but such warrants were never statutorily authorized before      the passage of the PATRIOT Act. Too, though some courts have      permitted sneak and peek warrants in limited circumstances,      the Supreme Court has never ruled on their constitutionality.       In codifying sneak and peek warrants, Section 213 of the      PATRIOT Act did not adopt limitations on this authority that      courts had recognized. For example, courts have required a      presumptive seven-day limit on the delay of notice. Section      213 requires notice of the search within ``a reasonable      period,'' which is not defined. According to the Justice      Department, this has resulted in delays of up to 90 days, and      of ``unspecified duration lasting until the indictment was      unsealed.''       Section 213 authorizes issuance of a sneak and peek warrant      where it finds that providing immediate notice of the warrant      would have an ``adverse result,'' as defined by 18 U.S.C.      Section 2705. Section 2705, which allows delayed notice for      searches of stored wire and electronic communications,      defines adverse result very broadly, including any      circumstances ``otherwise seriously jeopardizing an      investigation or unduly delaying a trial.'' This catch-all      provision could arguably apply in almost every case. A sneak      and peek search of a home involves a much greater degree of      intrusiveness than a seizure of wire or electronic      communications, so this broad standard for delaying notice is      inappropriate. Section 213 also does not limit delayed      notification warrants to terrorism investigations, and unlike      many surveillance-related PATRIOT Act provisions, does not      sunset.       Last year, an overwhelming majority in the House of      Representatives voted to repeal Section 213. The SAFE Act      would not go nearly this far. It would place modest limits on      the government's ability to obtain sneak and peek warrants,      while still permitting broad use of this authority.       The SAFE Act would still authorize a sneak and peek warrant      in a broad set of specific circumstances: where notice of the      warrant would endanger the life or physical safety of an      individual, result in flight from prosecution, or result in      the destruction of or tampering with the evidence sought      under the warrant. Importantly, it would eliminate the catch-     all authorization of sneak and peek authority in any      circumstances ``otherwise seriously jeopardizing an      investigation or unduly delaying a trial.'' It would require      notification of a covert search within seven days, but would      authorize unlimited additional seven-day delays so long as      any circumstance that would justify a delay of notice      continues to exist. According to the Justice Department,      ``the most common period of delay'' under Section 213 is      seven days, so a seven-day limit with court-authorized      extensions is not overly onerous but would prevent abuse.       The Justice Department states that the SAFE Act imposes      restrictions on the issuance of sneak and peek warrants that      could tip off terrorists, and ``thus enable their associates      to go into hiding, flee, change their plans, or even      accelerate their plots.'' To the contrary, the SAFE Act would      authorize issuance of a sneak and peek warrant in all of      these circumstances. If notice of the warrant could lead      terrorists or their associates to hide or flee, a court could      delay notice to prevent flight from prosecution. If notice of      the warrant could lead terrorists or their associates to      change or accelerate their plots, a court could delay notice      to prevent the resulting danger to life or physical safety.      The Constitution protects the sanctity of our homes, and we      should only allow this sanctity to be breached in such      serious circumstances.                Compelled Production of Personal Records       The SAFE Act would place reasonable checks on the      government's authority to compel production of library and      other personal records. Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act      permits law enforcement to obtain such records without      individualized suspicion and with minimal judicial oversight.      Before the PATRIOT Act, FISA authorized the FBI to seek a      court order for the production of records from four types of      businesses: common carriers, public accommodations      facilities, physical storage facilities, and vehicle rental      facilities. In order to obtain such records, the FBI was      required to state specific and articulable facts showing      reason to believe that the person to whom the records relate      was a terrorist or a spy. If a court found that there were      such facts, it would issue the order.       Under FISA as modified by Section 215, the FBI is      authorized to compel production of ``any tangible things      (including books, records, papers, documents, and other      items)'' not just records, from any entity, not just the four      types of businesses previously covered. The FBI is only      required to certify that the records are ``sought for'' an      international terrorism or intelligence investigation, a      standard even lower than relevance. The FBI need not show      that the documents relate to a suspected terrorist or spy.      If the FBI makes the required certification, the court no      longer has the authority to examine the accuracy of the      certification or ask for more facts to support it; the      court ``shall'' issue the order. Defenders of Section 215      frequently assert that the issuance of an order for      records requires court approval, but this type of court      approval amounts to little more than a rubber stamp. The      PATRIOT Act gives the government too much power to seize      the personal records of innocent Americans who are not      suspected of involvement in terrorism or espionage.       The SAFE Act retains the PATRIOT Act's expansion of the      business records provision to cover ``any tangible things''      and any entity. It would reinstate the pre-PATRIOT Act      standard for compelling production of business records, which      requires individualized suspicion. The FBI would be required      to certify that there are specific and articulable facts      giving reason to believe that the person to whom the records      relate is a terrorist or a spy. A court would be required to      issue the order if it found that there are such facts. The      SAFE Act would thus prevent broad fishing expeditions which      waste scarce government resources, are unlikely to produce      useful information, and can infringe upon privacy rights.       The Justice Department argues that this standard is      inappropriate because it is higher than the relevance      standard under which federal grand juries can subpoena      records. This ignores some crucial distinctions. The      recipient of a grand jury subpoena can challenge the subpoena      in court and tell others, including those whose records are      sought, about the subpoena. In contrast, the recipient of a      Section 215 subpoena cannot challenge the subpoena in court      and is subject to a gag order. The scope of a federal grand      jury is limited to specific crimes, while an intelligence      investigation is not so limited.       Finally, it is very important to note that, in the more      than two years since the passage of the PATRIOT Act, Section      215 has never been used. If the authority has never been used      during this time of great national peril, it is difficult to      understand how imposing some reasonable checks on it could      cripple the war on terrorism. Indeed, the government offers      no examples, real or imagined, in which the SAFE Act's      revisions of Section 215 would hinder counterterrorism      efforts.                       national security letters       The SAFE Act would impose reasonable limits on the issuance      of National Security Letters (NSLs). Section 505 of the      PATRIOT Act allows the FBI to use NSLs to obtain personal      records without individualized suspicion. An NSL is a      document signed by an FBI agent requiring disclosure of      financial, credit and other personal information and      requiring the recipient not to disclose the request to the      individual whose records are being sought. It does not      require judicial or grand jury approval.       Before the PATRIOT Act, the FBI could issue an NSL to      obtain records from a wire or electronic communication      service provider by certifying that it had reason to believe      that the person to whom the records relate is a terrorist or      a spy. The approval of FBI headquarters was required.       Section 505 of the PATRIOT allows the FBI to issue an NSL      simply by certifying that the records are ``sought for'' a      terrorism or intelligence investigation, regardless of      whether the target is a suspect. Headquarters approval is no      longer required. Unlike many other surveillance-related      PATRIOT Act provisions, the expanded NSL authority does not      sunset.       The SAFE Act would retain the PATRIOT Act's lower standard      for the issuance of NSLs and its delegation of issuing      authority to field offices. It would simply clarify that a      library is not a ``wire or communication service provider,''      which from the plain meaning of the words, it is not. The FBI      could still obtain information regarding e-mails or other      communications that took place at libraries by issuing an NSL      to the library's wire or communication service provider.       The Justice Department states that the SAFE Act would      ``extend a greater degree of privacy to activities that occur      in a public place than to those taking place in the home.''      We disagree. The SAFE Act would simply ensure that the FBI      issues the NSL to the service provider, which is the      appropriate recipient, rather than a community library, which      is ill-equipped to respond to such a request.                      expanding the sunset clause       The SAFE Act would expand the sunset clause of the PATRIOT      Act to ensure Congress has an opportunity to review      provisions of the bill that greatly expand the government's      authority to conduct surveillance on Americans. Many of the      PATRIOT Act's surveillance provisions sunset on December 31,      2005. The SAFE Act would sunset four additional surveillance      provisions: Sections 213, 216, 219, and 505.       We have already discussed Sections 213 (sneak and peek      warrants) and 505 (national security letters). Section 216      allows the use of surveillance devices known as pen registers      and trap and trace devices to gather transactional      information about electronic communications (e.g., e-mail) if      the government certifies the information likely to be      gathered is ``relevant'' to an ongoing criminal      investigation. The information the government gathers is      ``not to include the contents'' of communications, but      content is not defined. Section 219 permits a federal judge      in any district in the country in which ``activities related      to terrorism may have occurred'' to issue a nationwide search      warrant in a terrorism investigation. The target of such a      search warrant has no ability to challenge the warrant in      their home district. The SAFE Act would simply give Congress      an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of these four      provisions before deciding whether or not to reauthorize      them.       The Justice Department argues that Congress should not      expand the sunset to these authorities because they will all      be needed by the FBI for ``the foreseeable future.'' Even if      this is true, it is no reason not to give Congress the chance      to review the usefulness of these powers. If they are needed      for the fight on terrorism, we will surely renew them.       Throughout American history, during times of war, civil      liberties have been restricted in the name of security. We      therefore have the responsibility to proceed cautiously.      During the Civil War, President Lincoln suspended habeas      corpus, and during World War II, President Roosevelt ordered      the detention of Japanese Americans in internment camps. We      must be vigilant in our defense of our freedoms. But we also      must ensure that law enforcement has sufficient authority to      combat the grave threat of terrorism. We must strike a      careful balance between the law enforcement power needed to      combat terrorism and the legal protections required to      safeguard American liberties. That is what the SAFE Act would      do.       While we are disappointed that the Administration has      expressed disagreement with the SAFE Act, we view this as an      opportunity for increased public discussion of one of the      most important issues of our day. Accordingly, we request      that you schedule a hearing on the SAFE Act as soon as      possible. Thank you for your time and consideration.           Sincerely,     Larry E. Craig,       U.S. Senator.     Richard J. Durbin       U.S. Senator.
