President, I thank Senators Stevens and Inouye, the chair and ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, for their efforts in incorporating my amendment into the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2005, S. 2012. My amendment makes Oregon's salmon fishermen eligible for disaster assistance. Their willingness to accommodate my concerns and help Oregon's salmon fishers means that I can withdraw the objection I issued 2 weeks ago to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to act on the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act. I also wish to thank Senator Smith and Senator Boxer for their important contributions and assistance. I look forward to swift passage of the legislation, as amended.  The inclusion of the disaster declaration in the Magnuson-Stevens authorization is an important first step in getting relief for our salmon fishers and coastal communities that depend on salmon for their livelihoods. After waiting months for a disaster declaration from the administration, our salmon fishers now finally have some movement to help address their immediate financial needs.  Even with this important language, the fight to help Oregon's salmon fishermen is far from over, and I will continue to press for congressional appropriations to fund the disaster assistance fishing families and the coastal fishing communities need.                          ____________________
