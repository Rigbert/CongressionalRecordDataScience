President, I last spoke to the Senate about the crisis being created by our failure to move forward expeditiously to fill longstanding judicial vacancies on June 26, the day before we left on our most recent recess. I pointed out then that we had the opportunity literally to double judicial confirmations for the year from 5 to 10 by taking up and approving the five judicial nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar. In spite of the noncontroversial nature of these nominees and their likely confirmation, the Republican leadership refused to consider them.  As the Senate returns from another extended recess we enter July having found time to confirm only 6 Federal judges of the 39 nominees the President has sent to us. That remains a confirmation rate of less than one judge per month. We continue to fall farther and farther behind the pace established by Senator Dole and Senator Hatch in the last Congress. By this time 2 years ago, Senator Hatch had held six confirmation hearings involving 26 judicial nominees and the Senate had proceeded to confirm 26 Federal judges by the end of June--during one of the busiest periods ever, during the first 100 days of the Republicans' ``Contract with America.''  I have spoken often about the crisis being created by the 100 vacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country, as has the Chief Justice of the United States. At the rate that we are currently going more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to the detriment of greater numbers of Americans and the national cause of prompt justice.  There are four highly-qualified judicial nominees on the Senate calendar, another five district court nominees who were the subject of a confirmation hearing on June 25 but who have yet to receive attention from the Judiciary Committee, and another 24 nominees for whom the committee has yet to schedule a hearing or consideration.  That judges were held hostage to the resolution of other nomination disputes was a shame. I had urged the Republican leadership not to use the judiciary as a political pressure point or toinvolve the judiciary in disagreement over other matters, but they chose to act otherwise.  I would hope that the Senate would move to confirm these four additional judges on its calendar without further delay this week. Three of them had their confirmation hearing back in early May and have been on the Senate calendar without action for more than 6 weeks. The other had a confirmation hearing back in March, and was reported for a second time almost 1 month ago.  The Republican leadership chose to single out only one judicial nominee for a unanimous consent request and approval before the most recent recess. Over the break I took the trouble to review the record on that nominee to see whether it held a clue regarding why that particular nominee, as opposed to the other qualified nominees, had been singled out for special attention.  Nominated by the President on February 12 of this year, Alan Gold is set to fill a vacancy that was created on the District Court for the Southern District of Florida on November 30, 1996, when Judge Gonzalez took senior status. His is the only vacancy remaining on that Court and it has existed for less than 7 months. He was included in a confirmation hearing on May 7 and reported by the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks later.  As I have said before, it should not take more than 4 months to consider a judicial nominee and the Gold nomination and its treatment should serve as the standard by which we measure the Senate's treatment of other nominees. Although it should represent the normal process, it is the exception this year.  He has a commendable background but so do the other nominees for judicial appointment. In reviewing the file, I see that Judge Gold was rated well qualified by the ABA. Given Senator Hatch's speech condemning the influence of the ABA and its ratings in our confirmation process, I doubt that explains his prompt confirmation. Eric Clay was also rated well qualified for his Sixth Circuit nomination and he was held back on the calendar. William Fletcher, James Beatty, Margaret MeKeown, Marjorie Rendell, Richard Lazzara, Margaret Morrow and others have likewise received the ABA's highest rating and have not seen their nominations expedited.  In reviewing his confirmation hearing and the answers to the written questions that followed, I see that he singled out for criticism the case of Griswold versus Connecticut, which affirmed a privacy right guaranteed by the Constitution, and listed as the book that has most influenced his view of the law ``The Tempting of America'' by Robert Bork. My fear is that this confirmation reflects a litmus test being imposed by the Republican majority and that is why they singled out this nomination for expedited treatment. I hope that is not so.  I hope that nominees are not being forced to swear allegiance to Robert Bork instead of the Constitution of the United States in order to be confirmed. I hope that a nominee can uphold the important privacy rights that the Supreme Court has recognized to be constitutionally based and still be confirmed. I would like to believe that there is a neutral, alternative explanation for the treatment of this nomination relative to the others and that no Senator is imposing an ideological litmus test on judicial nominations.                          ____________________
