President, I rise today to introduce a private bill for the relief of Marin Turcinovic of Croatia and his wife Corina DeChalup of France. My bill would grant permanent resident status to Marin and Corina, affording them the legal security they need to rebuild their lives in this country.  Marin Turcinovic first arrived in the United States from Croatia in January 1990. He was admitted on an H-1 visa as a member of the band Libertas. On February 8, 1990, during the period of his authorized stay, Marin was hit by a car in Fairview, New Jersey. Both his legs were shattered. His spinal cord was severed, leaving him paralyzed below the neck. He will probably never walk again. His then-fiancee, Corina DeChalup of France, immediately came to the United States. Both Marin and Corina have been in the United States since their initial entries, and neither now has legal status.  Marin requires 24-hour medical care for his survival. An insurance settlement from the car accident litigation provides Marin with lifetime medical and rehabilitative care, in a specially modified house located in the Beverly community of Chicago. According to Marin's lawyers, the insurance settlement that provides for Marin's lifetime shelter and medical care would not cover him at another location. A medical malpractice suit against the doctors who initially provided care to Marin is pending.  Corina and Marin married in February 1996, 6 years after his accident. Corina is an essential part of Marin's life. She has been with Marin throughout his ordeal and has been instrumental in coordinating his medical care. She has directly provided care for Marin, and he could never have reached the degree of recovery he now enjoys without her support.  Before arriving in the U.S., Corina, a university graduate, worked as a tour guide for a Yugoslavian tourist agency. Although her days are primarily devoted to Marin, she has the skills and desire to find part-time employment and would like to obtain authorization to work.  According to Marin and Corina's lawyer, Corina has no way to legally gain permanent resident status in the U.S. Because she entered the U.S. under the visa waiver pilot program, she was subject to an order of deportation, without the right to an administrative hearing, once she overstayed her 90-day authorized admission in February 1990. Since 1994, she has received a stay of deportation in 1-year increments. She cannot currently travel to see her family inFrance, and she has no assurance that her stay will be renewed from 1 year to the next.  Marin was placed in deportation proceedings in 1997 at his request. This allowed him to seek a suspension of deportation, a legal remedy that in the past has resulted in permanent resident status. Although Marin's application was granted, the grant is conditional. If Marin's grant does not fall within the annual quota set by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996, it is unclear to what status he will revert. There is a possibility that Marin would be issued an order of voluntary departure.  Corina's status depends on Marin. If granted permanent resident status, Marin will be able to petition for Corina, but she will face a 4- to 5-year wait before qualifying for resident status, herself.  Mr. President, 8 years ago, fate tragically changed forever the lives Marin Turcinovic of Croatia and Corina DeChalup of France. A terrible accident in the United States left Marin permanently injured, making his return home impossible. Fortunately for Marin, he had the love and support of Corina, without whom he may not have made it this far. Given the tremendous adversity that Marin and Corina already face on a day-to-day basis, I believe it appropriate for Congress to grant them permanent resident status. Such status would clear up much of the uncertainly that currently clouds their future, and would allow Marin and Corina to rebuild their lives in our country with confidence.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1916       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.),      Marin Turcinovic and his fiancee, Corina Dechalup, shall be      held and considered to have been lawfully admitted to the      United States for permanent residence as of the date of the      enactment of this Act upon payment of the required visa fees.     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Marin      Turcinovic and his fiancee, Corina Dechalup, as provided in      this Act, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper      officer to reduce by the appropriate number during the      current fiscal year the total number of immigrant visas      available to natives of the country of the aliens' birth      under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act      (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).                                 ______                                       By
