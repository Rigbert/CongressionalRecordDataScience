Chairman, I compliment the gentleman from Florida for proposing an excellent amendment. Let me say I am really puzzled that my friend the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) is opposing this amendment.  Back in 1992, there was a citizen of Los Angeles County named Rodney King that was beaten up by a bunch of police officers. Those police officers were tried and convicted of a civil rights violation in a Federal Court.  The judge there had a downward departure from the sentence that Police Officer Koon would have received, which would have been 70 to 87 months under the sentencing guidelines. The District Court said, as a result of the widespread publicity and emotional outrage which would have surrounded this case, the officers were particularly likely to be targets of abuse in prison, had they been burdened by having been subjected to successive State and Federal prosecutions. So Mr. Koon only got 30 months in prison, when the guidelines required 70 to 87 months in prison.  Now, the Congressional Black Caucus sent a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno; and that was reported in the August 13, 1993, edition of the Los Angeles Times. The Black Caucus, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), and 24 other members of the CBC wrote the Attorney General asking that this be appealed.  The government did appeal that sentence and won its case in the Appeals Court, and the Appeals Court held that there should be a de novo review of the sentence. Then there was an appeal to the United States Supreme Court which reversed the Appeals Court and said that the only time a district judge's departure from sentencing guidelines could be reviewed and reversed was if there was an abuse of discretion.  There is a provision in the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Feeney) that does precisely what the Congressional Black Caucus asked for almost 10 years ago, and that is to give appeals courts de novo review over sentencing guidelines.  So I am puzzled at the gentleman from Virginia's opposition. We are doing what he asked for, but maybe 10 years too late.  Now, I think it is outrageous that one out of every five cases of those convicted of sexually abusing a child or sexually exploiting a child through child pornography have received a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines. The law says this is supposed to be rare, but, instead, a 20 percent downward departure rate is not rare.  Mr. Chairman, I think that the amendment that has been offered by the gentleman from Florida plugs this loophole. It ought to be passed.  Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record the August 6, 1993, letter fromthe Congressional Black Caucus to the Attorney General of the United States.                                     House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, August 6, 1993.     Hon. Janet Reno,     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Reno: As members of the Congressional      Black Caucus, we are writing to you because of our concern      about the sentencing of Officer Laurence Powell and Sergeant      Stacey Koon by Judge John Davies in the Rodney King civil      rights case.       We are troubled that the sentence for the crime was reduced      to 30 months upon the court's consideration of mitigating      facts. Such a reduction for mitigation factors may be      appropriate in other circumstances. However, we feel that the      dependents' special status as police officers, with special      duties owned to the public, should have mitigated against      such a significant reduction.       As you well know, the maximum possible penalty was ten      years and fines of up to $250,000. Your federal prosecutors      were asking for seven to nine years. Our federal sentencing      guidelines recommended minimum sentences in a range of four      to seven years in prison.       Instead, Judge John Davies made broad use of subjective      factors. He stated that he read only letters addressed to him      from the friends and families of Officer Powell and Sergeant      Koon. He argued that much of the violence visited on Rodney      King was justified by King's own actions. However, these      officers were convicted on charges of violating Rodney King's      civil rights. We believe these mitigating factors did not      justify so large a reduction given the defendant's special      responsibilities as police officers.       In addition, Judge Davies did not afford proper weight to      the racist comments made over police radio by those convicted      on the night of the beating in discounting race as a      motivation for the beating. He similarly failed to take into      account the remarkable lack of remorse shown by Officer      Powell and Sergeant Koon since their conviction.       People of good will all over this country and of all races      were heartened when Officer Powell and Sergeant Koon were      convicted by a jury of their peers, a verdict made possible      by the Justice Department's resolve to file civil rights      charges and by the phenonemal performance of federal      prosecutors. With these severely reduced sentences, however,      we are sending a mixed message. Are police officers going to      be held responsible for excessive use of force or not?       We think what has been lost, in all this, is the police      officers have an enhanced responsibility to upheld the law.       Notwithstanding Judge Davies' authority to modify the      sentencing guidelines, most experts agreed that the minimum      four to seven years sentence should have been followed in      this case.       We realize that the trial judge is afforded sufficient      latitude in sentencing, but we urge the Department of Justice      to appeal these sentences. We need to reexamine these      sentences so that justice can finally be done in this      difficult, painful case. Only then can we begin to put this      behind us.           Sincerely,         Maxine Waters, Eva M. Clayton, Sanford Bishop, Major R.            Owens, Eddie Bernice Johnson, Walter Tucker, Floyd H.            Flake, William Clay, Albert R. Wynn, Charles B. Rangel,            Carrie P. Meek, William J. Jefferson, James E. Clyburn,            Donald M. Payne, Earl Hilliard, Alcee Hastings, Bennie            M.
