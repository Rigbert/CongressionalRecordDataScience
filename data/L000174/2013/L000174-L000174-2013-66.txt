President. I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to a Vermont woman who personifies inspirational. Carmen Tarleton's journey as a survivor of domestic violence began nearly 6 years ago, when her estranged husband broke into her home, attacked her with a baseball bat and doused her with industrial-strength lye. She suffered severe burns over 80 percent of her body.  I have followed Carmen's recovery with great interest and even greater awe. Despite the scars that left her blinded and severely disfigured, Carmen made no effort to hide the effects of that attack. She never sought pity, nor did she dwell on the past. Instead, Carmen wrote a book and went on television, talking bravely and candidly about her long road back. She learned how to play the banjo and piano, and through the many surgeries and long hospital stays, Carmen's determination and spirit remained unbroken.  Last February, Carmen underwent a miraculous face transplant at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, which was detailed in an October 26 front-page story in The New York Times. As that piece pointed out, ``There is evidence that Ms. Tarleton's new face is more than just donated tissue, (it) is becoming part of who she is.''  I ask unanimous consent to have The New York Times article inserted in the Record. I believe everyone will be as inspired by Carmen Tarleton as I have been.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Oct. 25, 2013]        For Victim of Ghastly Crime, a New Face, a New Beginning                          (By Abby Goodnough)       Thetford, Vt.--At 1:30 a.m. on Valentine's Day this year,      Carmen Tarleton left her rural home here and drove through      the frigid dark to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.      Her doctor had called hours earlier with the news she had      been waiting for: a suitable donor had been found. She would      get a new face.       Almost six years had passed since her estranged husband      broke into her house one spring night, beat her with a      baseball bat and soaked her with industrial lye that he      squirted from a dish-soap bottle. The attack nearly blinded      Ms. Tarleton, a nurse and mother of two, and burned her      beyond recognition. She lost her eyelids, upper lip and left      ear. What remained of her face and much of her body was a      knobby patchwork of scar tissue and skin grafts, painful to      look at and far more painful to live with.       Now, after overcoming some initial fears, she was ready to      receive someone else's features. After 15 hours of transplant      surgery, Ms. Tarleton, 45, emerged from the operating room      with what looked to her mother, Joan VanNorden, like a puffy,      surreal mask. At first she wanted to faint as she stared at      the new face, smooth and freckled, stitched to her daughter's      pale scalp. But when Ms. Tarleton started talking in her old      familiar voice--``Can't you just get in here?''--Mrs.      VanNorden relaxed.       ``I said, This is who Carmen is now,' and it really looked      beautiful,'' she recalled. ``Although it didn't look anything      like her, it was her face.''       Face transplants are still an experimental procedure, the      first having taken place just eight years ago in France. Some      two dozen full or partial transplants have been completed      worldwide, including five at Brigham and Women's, which used      nearly $4 million in research grants from the Department of      Defense to do four of the surgeries. Arteries, veins, nerves      and muscles from the donor face must be painstakingly      connected to the recipient's, in what Dr. Bohdan Pomahac, Ms.      Tarleton's chief transplant surgeon, called ``by far the most      complicated operation that I do.''       Yet the psychological impact of a face transplant is      perhaps as far-reaching as the surgical one. Unlike a kidney      or liver or heart, a donated face is visible to all,      challenging recipients and their loved ones to incorporate an      entirely new countenance into long-held perceptions of a      person's identity.       Ms. Tarleton's appearance is still evolving: her scalp was      so badly burned that hair will never return to parts of her      head, but her donor's hair, the same shade of brown as her      own, is growing around her forehead and temples. Her right      eye remains closed, and her left droops. Her face is      sometimes masklike, betraying little emotion, because the      muscles are still reconnecting and she cannot yet move them      well. And that mask, oddly enough, looks like neither her nor      the woman who donated it.       But eight months after the operation, there is evidence      that Ms. Tarleton's new face is more than just donated      tissue, and is becoming part of who she is.       When her family thinks, or even dreams, about her, they      imagine her new visage. ``When someone at work asks me, How's      Carmen?' the picture that comes up in my mind more and more      is that face,'' said Ms. Tarleton's sister, Kesstan Blandin.       Yet for Ms. Tarleton herself, the process of acceptance has      been trickier. For one thing,     her poor vision keeps her from seeing herself clearly unless      she holds a mirror up close. ``I don't yet feel it is my      face,'' she wrote in a recent blog post. ``I feel like I am      still borrowing it.''       Ms. Tarleton's former husband, Herbert Rodgers, 58, pleaded      guilty to a charge of maiming and is serving a prison      sentence of at least 30 years. Mr. Rodgers told the police      that he had been angry at Ms. Tarleton, believing she was      seeing another man after they separated.       Ms. Tarleton underwent a number of reconstructive      surgeries, but with little success. When Dr. Pomahac called      in May 2011 to propose a face transplant, Ms. Tarleton's mind      first leapt to a ``Twilight Zone'' episode that had jarred      her as a child, about a man who could change his appearance      to look like other people.       ``Initially I felt that it was very sci-fi,'' she said in a      recent interview while curled on the couch in the modest home      she shares with her two daughters. But she and her family      started researching, and after a few weeks of weighing the      pros and cons--for one thing, she is likely to be on      immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of her life, raising her      risk of infection and cancer--Ms. Tarleton decided to forge      ahead.       After a number of trips to Boston for physical and      psychological screening to determine if she was a good      candidate, she got on the donor list that fall. ``It was like      a big surprise, a big gift,'' she said. ``I'd already      accepted my disfigurement, fine. But I accepted it believing      there wasn't an alternative.''       The things Ms. Tarleton wanted from a new face were more      pragmatic than aesthetic. Tight bands of scars ringed her      neck, causing debilitating pain. She drooled constantly and      could not blink, jeopardizing a synthetic cornea in her left      eye. And with her face frozen from scarring, it was hard for      others to read her emotions.       For a time, she was devastated that she could not see ``the      old me,'' as she put it. But she moved on, writing a book      about her physical and emotional recovery from the attack and      speaking publicly about the experience. She seemed mostly      unconcerned about her appearance.       But in December 2012, she gained a more urgent desire for a      new face. She had started taking piano lessons at a music      shop not far from her home. Her teacher was Sheldon Stein, an      earthy, soft-spoken musician with whom she felt an instant      affinity. The feeling, it turned out, was mutual. The two say      they are in love.       ``I kept looking in the mirror all of a sudden when I met      Sheldon,'' she said. ``I wasn't insecure before. But now--now      you have feelings for somebody and now you have something to      lose, when before, one of the reasons I did so well is I had      nothing to lose anymore.''       After the operation, she went through a harrowing three      weeks when her immune system rejected the face. But      medications helped her accept the new tissue. And some of the      improvements she had hoped for came shortly after. Her neck      pain disappeared, and her left eyelid, immobile for years,      began to blink again. The drooling diminished, and is likely      to stop once she gets more feeling in her lips.       The transplant did not make Ms. Tarleton look like her      donor, Cheryl Denelli Righter of North Adams, Mass., who died      at 56 after a stroke. That is a typical outcome for face      transplant recipients, partly because their bone structures      are different from their donors'. Mysteriously, she now has a      cleft in her chin, something neither Ms. Denelli Righter nor      Ms. Tarleton's old face had.       Yet to Ms. Denelli Righter's daughter, something of her      mother lives on in Ms. Tarleton's new face. ``I get to feel      my mother's skin again, I get to see my mother's freckles,      and through you, I get to see my mother live on,'' the      daughter, Marinda Righter, told Ms. Tarleton in May. The two      have kept in touch, and Ms. Tarleton said she could feel Ms.      Righter's loss ``so strongly''--another complicating factor      as she adjusts.       One Tuesday in August, Ms. Tarleton made her way yet again      to Brigham and Women's, where doctors monitor the level of      anti-rejection medications in her blood and take biopsies of      the skin on her neck--which is the donor's--to look for any      sign of rejection.       Ms. Tarleton has undergone nearly 60 operations, mostly      skin grafts, at Brigham and Women's and has visited 21 times      since her latest release in March. On this day she was      exhausted, recovering from a bad headache the previous night      and a recent fall that had left her with an aching foot. But      she had a bit of good news for her doctors.       ``If I put my head on Sheldon's chest, I can feel his      hair,'' she said, ``and I couldn't before.''       Ms. Tarleton also met with Bridget Bowler, a speech      therapist who is helping her learn to move her new lips--     where nerve function typically takes the longest to return in      transplant recipients--and practice facial expressions. She      still has an air of the ventriloquist when she speaks, a      habit that Ms. Bowler is trying to help her shake.       ``One of these days in the near future,'' Ms. Tarleton      said, ``when I start to cry or I laugh, you're going to be      able to tell by looking at me how I feel.''       These days, Ms. Tarleton has returned to her hard-charging      self. Her summer included speaking engagements, weekend road      trips and late-night jam sessions with Mr. Stein and his      musician friends. She decided to take up the banjo in      addition to the piano, because she wanted to join in the      jams. ``Our whole lives,'' she said, ``are just about      experience.''       Ms. Blandin said Ms. Tarleton's new face has helped mute      the grief she still feels about the horrible damage done by      the lye attack. ``Now I just feel like a warm nostalgia: I      know you and I haven't forgotten you,'' she said of her      sister's original face. ``She's still Carmen in some ways,      but in other ways she's someone new and the face transplant      represents that.''       But Ms. Tarleton's daughters, Liza, 21, and Hannah, 19, who      live with her in a red barn that has been converted to      apartments, on a hill thick with wildflowers, were more      matter-of-fact when discussing her transformation, perhaps      intentionally.       ``Mom's going to do what she's going to do,'' Liza said.       Hannah chimed in. ``And we're going to get used to it,''      she said, laughing.       ``And we're going to support it,'' Liza added, ``for      sure.''       With that, Liza got up to make her mother a hot dog. Ms.      Tarleton took her spot on the couch, a barely perceptible      smile flickering across her face.                          ____________________
