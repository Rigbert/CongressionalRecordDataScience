Speaker, for those who cannot stay tuned to this expensive debate today, because of the Republican rule we have 3 hours to debate a $270 billion cut in Medicare. That is a billion and a half a minute. If people cannot stay tuned, I will tell them what will happen.  The Democrats who created Medicare will lose today. The Republicans, under the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich], will ram through a $270 billion cut that will increase premiums for seniors to the tune of $400 a year and it will end up giving the wealthiest 1 percent in America a $19,000 annual tax break.  But do not lose heart. Seniors may be glum tonight, the special interests will be dancing in Washington, but we are counting on the President of the United States to veto this monstrosity, to bring us back to the table for a bipartisan, common sense approach to really save Medicare.  Mr. Speaker, the real winners not only have to be seniors and their families, we have to tell the special interests to get out of the business of wrecking Medicare, get out of the business of tax breaks for the wealthy. Let us make Medicare a solid system. Let us not make it a piggy bank for the wealthy.
