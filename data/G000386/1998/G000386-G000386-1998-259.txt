 President, today I introduce the ``Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of 1998 with my colleagues, Senators Reid, Hollings, and D'Amato. This legislation will enable seniors to receive rehabilitative services based on their condition and not on arbitrary payment limits. A similar version was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Ensign earlier this year.  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is a very important accomplishment and one that I am proud to say I supported. However, in our rush to save the Medicare Trust Fund from bankruptcy, Congress neglected to thoroughly evaluate the impact the new payment limits on rehabilitative services would have on Medicare beneficiaries.  The BBA included a $1500 cap on occupational, physical and speech therapy services received outside a hospital setting. According to a recent study by Muse & Associates, these limitations on services would harm almost 13 percent (or 653,000) of Medicare beneficiaries because these individuals would exceed the cap. While many seniors will not need services that would cause them to exceed the $1500 cap, others, like stroke victims, will likely need services beyond what the arbitrary caps will cover. Unfortunately, it is those beneficiaries who need rehabilitative care the most who will be penalized by being forced to pay the entire cost for these services outside of a hospital setting.  The bill I am introducing would repeal the cap, which is scheduled to go into effect in January 1999. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services would be required to implement a prospective payment system that would recoup any savings lost from the repeal of this provision by January 2000. In essence, the bill attempts to accomplish the primary goal of the $1500 cap, budgetary savings, but without harming the Medicare beneficiary. Payment is based on the patient's condition and not on an arbitrary monetary amount. Help us repeal the $1,500 cap, establish a system that makes sense, and still achieve the budget savings sought from the BBA without reducing Medicare benefits.  Please join me and my colleagues in passing this legislation. I ask unanimous that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2222       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Reinstatement of the      Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of 1998''.     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF FINANCIAL LIMITATION ON REHABILITATION                    SERVICES.       (a) Repeal.--       (1) In general.--Section 1833 of the Social Security Act      (42 U.S.C. 1395l) is amended by striking subsection (g).       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1)      shall apply to services furnished on or after January 1,      1999.       (b) Offsetting Portion of Additional Expenditures Through      Payment Reform.--       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, for outpatient physical therapy services, outpatient      occupational therapy services, and outpatient speech-language      pathology services covered under title XVIII of the Social      Security Act and furnished on or after January 1, 2000, the      Secretary of Health and Human Services shall implement a new      payment methodology based on the classification of      individuals by diagnostic category, functional status, and      prior use of services in both inpatient and outpatient      settings.       (2) Budget neutrality in implementation.--Such payment      methodology shall be designed so that the methodology, taking      into account the increased expenditures resulting from the      amendment made by subsection (a), does not result in any      increase or decrease in the expenditures under title XVIII of      the Social Security Act on a fiscal year basis.
