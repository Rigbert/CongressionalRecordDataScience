 Madam Speaker, the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe has been living in portions of California and Nevada for hundreds of years. At the present time, the majority of the tribe's ancestral homeland is located within Death Valley National Park, which is ably represented by our colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis), and other areas currently under the Bureau of Land Management Control.  S. 2102 provides the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe with a land base within its aboriginal homeland on which the tribe can live permanently and govern its own affairs.                              {time}  1430  The legislation would also form a partnership between the National Park Service and the tribe to ensure that the resources of the park are protected and enhanced. It would formally recognize the contribution the tribe has made in the history and culture of the area, authorize the Secretary of Interior to purchase additional lands and water rights for the tribe's use, as well as help for further clarification of rights and obligations on these lands.  Madam Speaker, the interests of both the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe and the United States would be enhanced by recognizing their coexistence on the same land and by establishing partnerships for compatible land uses. This is a good piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support S. 2102.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
