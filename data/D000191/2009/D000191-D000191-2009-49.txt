More than 85 percent of the people choose to walk through the screening device. And as we've proposed it here, it has extraordinary privacy protections. The person monitoring the dumbed-down image of the person's body will be remote from the actual screening area, won't be able to see that person. It's dumbed down. It's not very revealing. And this is a step forward that will enhance our security.  There are ways now to smuggle devices onboard, and we've got to deal with them. And this is one of them.  We also have to deal better with liquids and explosives, a major threat. We need to get more equipment deployed--and this committee has pushed hard and there was money in the stimulus bill--and there will be more authorization here to get better equipment to our screeners so they can detect threats before they get on our planes.
