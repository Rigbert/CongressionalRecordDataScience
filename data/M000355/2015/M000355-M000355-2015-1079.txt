 President, on one final matter, Saturday, June 27, is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Day.  Sadly, post-traumatic stress disorder is an affliction that touches too many of our veterans. Raising awareness of PTSD and combatting the myths and misinformation that surround it are incredibly important. There are effective treatments for PTSD, and all of us can do a few simple things in honor of PTSD Awareness Day.  First, we can learn more about PTSD by getting the facts on the condition and its treatment. We can also reach out to somebody who might have PTSD or be at risk, particularly among the veterans community. And, finally, we can pass along what we learned to others to continue to raise awareness.  So I hope Americans will take action on this PTSD Awareness Day to shed some light on an often misunderstood condition and hopefully to reach out to someone in need.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
