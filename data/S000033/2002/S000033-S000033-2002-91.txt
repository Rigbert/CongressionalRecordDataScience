  If you are a member of a trade union in America, you make 30 percent more than workers who are not in a trade union. Frankly, I have never seen that discussion on television or radio in my life, an enormously important issue like that. The growing gap between the rich and the poor is discussed far, far too little.  I am not going to deny that there are different points of view that are heard. But I think the bottom line is, no question, that corporate ownership of this country is growing in terms of the media and that we are hearing fewer and fewer points of view that represent working people, middle-income people and minority people.                              {time}  1730
