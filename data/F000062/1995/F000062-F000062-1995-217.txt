 President, to a great extent, we are a Nation of immigrants. There are very few of us in this body who could claim not to have been a product, in some way, of immigrants.  My mother was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. She left that country hiding in a hay cart during the revolution. They crossed Siberia on their long journey to California. My grandmother was widowed shortly after arriving in this country, left with four small children. My uncle was a carpenter. My mother did not enjoy good health as a child and was hospitalized for many years. There was no widow's pension then, no AFDC. And I am not one that believes that immigrants should come to the United States to get on the dole. But we do have a naturalization process which, after the designated waiting period, and after meeting certain requirements, immigrants take an oath, they become citizens of the United States, with all of the privileges and benefits accorded to native-born citizens, save the one spelled out in the Constitution that I have read today.  This bill essentially says that even if naturalized--even if a naturalized citizen for 20 years, your sponsor's income will be deemed as yours, and you will not be eligible for Federal benefits.  Even if that sponsor is dying from cancer, and no matter what happens to the naturalized citizen, that naturalized citizen is exempted from coverage under this bill.  I believe that violates the equal protection clause of our Constitution and jeopardizes the fairness of the legislation. So the amendment that I am submitting is essentially equal treatment for naturalized and native-born citizens.
