LOTT. Mr. President, No. 1, we have an order of how amendments will go. On a separate track, we were debating the Reid amendment, and we were alternating back and forth, having speakers speak on the Reid amendment. That is where there seems be maybe a dichotomy. Senator Carper was going to speak next. Then Senator Inhofe would be able to speak next. That was my understanding.
