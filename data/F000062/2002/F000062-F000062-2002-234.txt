 President, students have fallen silent in schools all across the country today to bring attention to the discrimination and harassment of our gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender, GLBT, youth.  The voices that won't be heard today belong to the participants of a national project called the Day of Silence.  The Day of Silence was conceived more than 6 years ago by Maria Pulzetti, then a student at the University of Virginia, after she wrote a paper on nonviolent protest and grassroots organizing. It encourages students to take a nine-hour pledge of silence to represent the silence that GLBT students face because of harassment, discrimination and prejudice at their schools.  Since the first-ever Day of Silence at the University of Virginia in 1996, the event has grown in size each year. This year, thousands of students will be participating from more than 1,776 middle schools, high schools, colleges and universities in 49 States, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, including at least 136 schools in my State of California. This year's effort will easily be the largest in its history.  Instead of speaking, participants of the Day of Silence will hand out cards that explain why they have chosen not to talk. The cards read:       Please understand my reasons for not speaking today. I am      participating in the Day of Silence, a national youth      movement protesting the silence faced by lesbian, gay,      bisexual and transgender people and their allies. My      deliberate silence echoes that silence, which is caused by      harassment, prejudice, and discrimination. I believe that      ending the silence is the first step toward fighting these      injustices. Think about the voices you are not hearing today.      What are you going to do to end the silence?  Some participants will also be wearing t-shirts that spell out why they have chosen not to speak today. Others will wear buttons or stickers. And still others will offer ribbons to those who are not ready to take a vow of complete silence but who want to show their support.  In some cases, teachers will even join the effort by taping their lessons for the day, screening movies, or writing on the blackboard instead of speaking to their classes.  In fact, students who have organized the event in the past say that the broad participation of their friends and teachers has elevated the Day of Silence from ``a bunch of gay kids complaining about discrimination'' to a formidable student-led movement for civil rights.  But, regardless of which participant you ask, they all agree that they can speak loudest by not saying a word. And, even though they will be silent, their message will get across loud and clear.  I would also like to give special recognition to two California students that have helped organize this year's Day of Silence:  Sumiko Braun, 17, of Carson, CA, is the California State Organizer. She is currently a senior at the California Academy of Mathematics and Science, and is also the founder and president of her school's Gay-Straight Alliance. Although the Gay-Straight Alliance has faced much adversity, the group has remained one of the most active on the school's campus.  Nikira Hernandez, 15, of Santa Cruz, CA, is one of the National Team Co-Advisors. She currently attends Santa Cruz High School, and is a member of her school's Rainbow Alliance. Before organizing Santa Cruz High School's first Day of Silence last spring, Nikira said her school's Rainbow Alliance counted about half a dozen students as members--and they weren't very motivated. Then, when more than 200 people fell silent on their behalf last year, she couldn't believe how much her life changed. She said, ``Seeing how many allies we had made me feel much more accepted at my school.''  I am encouraged that these two talented and dedicated young ladies have taken the initiative to help end the silence of GLBT students that, unfortunately, has become the norm in our Nation's schools. These outstanding Californians are not only giving support to other young people who are participating in the Day of Silence effort, they are helping to make their schools and their communities more accepting in the process.  The effects of today's silence will last much longer than just one day. This experience will offer students an opportunity to think about how powerful silencing can be and to focus on how they can make their own voices stronger.  Long after this day has ended, I hope students will continue to speak out against discrimination and harassment so that everyone can feel accepted at their schools, and we can overcome the forces that impose silence on our youth.                          ____________________
