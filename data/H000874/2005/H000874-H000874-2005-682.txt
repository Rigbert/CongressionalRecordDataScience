Speaker, I would reclaim my time and certainly yield to the leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments by the gentleman who worked so hard on that bipartisan ethics reform taskforce that made recommendations to the House. And I appreciate that the gentleman is trying to protect those rules that he worked on.  But I remind the gentleman that when those rules were voted on, both gentlemen from Maryland voted against the rules they are trying to protect today. And then I might say your comments are well taken. The length of time is a problem. We have recognized that is a problem and I am told, I have not talked to the ethics chairman, but I am told through the Speaker that the ethics chairman has offered to negotiate the time problem with the ranking member. I do not know what the result of that has been, but I know that the Speaker has been informed by the chairman that he is more than willing to work on those issues, and I know the Speaker told me that he is open to fixing that time problem that the gentleman brings up and is concerned about.
