 President, as we begin the 116th Congress, I am glad to be welcoming back my friends and returning colleagues to what I hope will be a productive session. Before we get to work, I would like to note the arrival of eight new Members who were just sworn in.  The Senate welcomes Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Mike Braun of Indiana, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Martha McSally of Arizona, Mitt Romney of Utah, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, and in the coming days, Rick Scott of Florida will join our ranks.  I would like to welcome each of our incoming colleagues--as well as their families--to the Senate. Today you are forming the newest links in a historic chain and continuing the rich traditions of this body in which we are so fortunate to serve.  On a related note, I am pleased our new colleagues and the entire Senate will continue learning from the example of one of the most loyal stewards of our traditions, Senator Chuck Grassley, who has been elected today as our new President pro tempore.  So congratulations to the senior Senator from Iowa on this tremendous accomplishment.                          ____________________
