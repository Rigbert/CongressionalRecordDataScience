 I probably will not take that much time. But, Mr. President, I have been sitting here and listening and watching. And it has been really enlightening to me to see what is going on and how the debate has been going.  When I go back to Oklahoma and we have townhall meetings and I talk to people back there, the ones I have been chastised about for referring to as the ``real people of America,'' they ask the question over and over again, ``Senator, why don't you just do it? All this talk about balancing the budget. Why don't you just do it? We have to do it. We have to live with a balanced budget. Why not do it?'' Because every big spender around, every liberal in Congress says he or she wants to balance the budget, and yet when it comes down to getting the opportunity to actually do it, we do not do it.  I hope those people who ask that question at the townhall meetings are watching carefully tonight, because now you know why it is so difficult to do something that seems so easy back home.  The second thing is listening to some of these speeches--I do not mean this in a demeaning way or insulting way to anyone, but I really feel that so many people right now are trying to hold onto the past with white knuckles. Those individuals who rejoiced back in the 1960's when Government took greater control of our lives cannot believe that times are changing and that the people are no longer going to tolerate that.  If you stop and analyze the elections of 1994, it is an overwhelming revolution at the polls.  And who was defeated? All you have to do is get the ratings. You know, people know who the big spenders are and who they are not. The National Taxpayers Union, many others, have ratings. Those individuals who lost at the polls in 1994 were the ones who were the big spenders.  This revolution started, really, back in 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan. Of course, he did not have the support of Congress, so he could not get the things done he wanted to. I will always remember looking at television on the Wednesday morning after the election, that landslide election when Ronald Reagan won in 1980, and it was the defeated person who had run against him. He was on the ``Today Show,'' and he made a statement I will always remember. He said, this is a quote, ``I cannot believe the people of America have so overwhelmingly repudiated classic liberalism.''  And that is exactly what happened. But the problem is we never were able to carry out those programs, because we had a hostile and a liberal Congress.  That is changed now. That is all changed. For all those of you are who sitting around here wringing your hands saying all these bad things are going to happen, all these people are going to be cut when, in fact, they are not going to be cut, all these horrible things we have been listening to tonight, just stop and think of it in this context:  In 1993, we passed--at that time, President Clinton had control of both the House and the Senate--and we passed the largest single tax increase in the history of public finance in America or anyplace in the world. Those are not the words of conservative Republican Jim Inhofe; those are the words of the Democrat leader of the Senate Finance Committee, the chairman at that time.  So I suggest that if anyone was opposed to that great tax increase that even now President Bill Clinton says was too great of a tax increase, if you are opposed to it, then you should be for these tax reductions now. For all practical purposes, all we are doing is repealing part of the damage we did to the American people in 1993.  So I wind up--my colleague, who I respect so much, from Minnesota, Senator Grams, made a talk and he ended up quoting Winston Churchill, and I think I will do the same. I can tell you folks on the other side of the aisle that the people of America know better. They do not want the patterns of the past. They realize we have to do something. Winston Churchill said: ``Truth is incontrovertible, panic may resent it, ignorance may deride it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.'' And that is what we are going to learn tonight.
