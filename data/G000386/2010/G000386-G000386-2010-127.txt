 President, I have come to the floor to speak about a bill that Senator Baucus and I have introduced today. It's called the Haiti Economic Lift Program Act of 2010.  The purpose of our bill is to help Haiti recover from the devastation it suffered in the massive earthquake that struck the country in January.  How we respond to natural disasters says a lot about ourselves, whether it's flooding in Iowa or an earthquake in Haiti.  The idea behind the bill is simple. First, we extend current trade preferences for Haiti through fiscal year 2020, to provide more certainty for companies doing business either in Haiti or with Haitian partners.  Second, we grant additional duty-free access to the U.S. market for targetedcategories of textile and apparel products. That will help to draw more investment into Haiti's economy and thereby promote long-term job creation, economic development, and political stability.  Our bill is a bipartisan, bicameral compromise. It is the product of 3 months of collaborative negotiations among the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees and with representatives of the U.S. textile industry and the Haitians themselves.  We also reached out to members of Congress who have constituent textile and apparel interests, to ensure that their concerns were addressed.  Our ability to reach agreement on the bill is a testament to the good will and good faith of all those involved in our negotiations.  The result reflects a careful balancing of interests, including Haiti's interest in spurring more investment in its economy, the interests of our trading partners in Central America in maintaining existing trade relationships, and our own domestic textile interests.  We took special care to address the sensitivities of our domestic producers.  In fact, I have a letter here from the two leading U.S. textile industry organizations. Their letter expresses support for our bill and encourages the Senate to pass the bill in an expeditious manner by unanimous consent.  Finally, I want to make special mention of my colleagues from states with textile interests, and to thank them for their constructive input in developing this legislation.  Without their engagement and support, we would not have arrived at the compromise bill that is being introduced today in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.  This is a balanced bill that addresses an urgent priority in the Western Hemisphere.  I ask my colleagues to give the bill their unanimous support when it comes before the Senate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   April 26, 2010.     Hon. Max Baucus,     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley: As      representatives of the United States textile industry, we are      writing in regard to the Haiti Economic Lift Program Act of      2010, a bill to provide enhanced market access for apparel      products manufactured in Haiti.       After lengthy negotiations with your staffs, we are pleased      that we were able to reach an acceptable compromise on this      important legislation. While the bill provides Haiti with a      path forward for long-term economic recovery in the wake of      its devastating earthquake, it also takes into account      various sensitivities from the perspective of the U.S.      textile industry.       For example, the bill grants significant increases in duty      free treatment through a system of Tariff Preference Levels      (TPLs) but also institutes sub-limits on highly sensitive      products that can be exported under the TPLs. The sub-limits      were a key priority for the domestic industry and will      prevent over concentration of exports in one or two key areas      that could be particularly damaging to U.S. producers. In      addition, the bill extends the current Caribbean Basin Trade      Partnership Act (CBTPA) through 2020. This extension will      help to provide long-term certainty for a program that is of      significant value for U.S. and Western Hemispheric trading      partners.       Obviously, we take very seriously the impact that      additional duty free imports may have on U.S. producers and      workers as well as our Western Hemispheric customers. Noting      those concerns, we also recognize that the devastating      circumstances in Haiti produced an exceptional case that      motivated Congress to develop a quick response and have      worked with the Committee to develop a package that strikes      an acceptable balance. We must stress, however, that this      package does not set a precedent for Any future trade      preference legislation.       For all these reasons, we are encouraging our Congressional      members that represent the nearly 500,000 U.S. textile and      apparel workers to approve this legislation in an expeditious      manner under suspension of the rules in the House and by      unanimous consent in the Senate.           Sincerely,     Augustine D. Tantillo,       Executive Director, American Manufacturing Trade Action      Coalition (AMTAC).     Cass M. Johnson,       President, National Council of Textile Organizations      (NCTO).                                 ______
