Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and c6ntributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Dr. Larry Geraty is one of these individuals. On Wednesday, February 25, 2004,he will be honored at a surprise dinner for ten years of academic and community excellence.  Dr. Geraty grew up as a citizen of the world as part of a Seventh-day Adventist missionary family who lived and worked in China, Burma, Hong Kong, and Lebanon. Dr. Geraty received a rich educational experience from attending schools in China, Hong Kong, Lebanon, England, Germany, France, Israel, California, Maryland, Michigan, and Massachusetts. These experiences set him on a lifelong course committed to the values of diversity and education.  After completing his undergraduate degree at Pacific Union College, Dr. Geraty graduated from the Theological Seminary at Andrews University. He then served a short term as a pastor in Santa Ana, California. Later, Dr. Geraty joined the Andrews Theological Seminary faculty, he first went to Harvard University to study Hebrew Bible and biblical archaeology where he earned and received with distinction his Doctor of Philosophy degree.  Returning to Andrews Theological Seminary as Professor of Archaeology and History of Antiquity, Dr. Geraty distinguished himself as a teacher and scholar for the next 13 years, teaching also in Jamaica, Jordan, Trinidad, Costa Rica, Europe, and Australia, and directed a series of major archaeological expeditions to the Middle East. During this time he was also the curator of the Horn Archaeological Museum and founding Director of the Institute of Archaeology at Andrews University.  In his notable scholarly career, Dr. Geraty has received numerous honors, including a Fulbright Fellowship and served as advisor on archaeology to former Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan. Dr. Geraty also served as president of several scholarly societies; vice president of the American Center of Oriental Research in Amman, Jordan; lectured all over the world and contributed to numerous publications.  Adding to his teaching focus, in 1985 Dr. Geraty became president of Atlantic Union College in South Lancaster, Massachusetts where he earned the reputation as a progressive academic administrator. Since July 1993 Dr. Geraty has served as President and professor of archeology at La Sierra University in Riverside, California, where he has also become active in the community, serving currently on the boards of the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce, United Way of the Inland Valleys, The Employers Group, Metro Riverside International Cabinet, Mayor's Higher Education/Business Council, Raincross Club, Monday Morning Group, and the Riverside Youth Action Executive Policy Board.  In the year 2000, Dr. Geraty received the P. E. MacAllister Award for Excellence in Field Archeology from the American Schools of Oriental Research, and in 2001, the Charles Elliott Weniger Award for Excellence at Pacific Union College. On July 1, 2002, he began a three-year term as president of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), the premier organization for American archeologists working in the Middle East. From headquarters at Boston and Emory universities, he will supervise an annual scholarly convention, the publication of several scholarly books and journals, the accreditation of American archaeological projects in the Middle East and relate to research centers in Jerusalem, Amman, and Nicosia.  Dr. Geraty and his wife, Gillian, have a daughter in Colorado, a son in Michigan, and between them five grandchildren. Truly, one of Dr. Geraty's most impressive accomplishments has been his ability to remain active as an archaeologist and churchman while continuing to lead and direct a university which combines the religious values of a faith community, the educational ideals of a liberal arts college, and the research opportunities of a comprehensive university.                          ____________________
