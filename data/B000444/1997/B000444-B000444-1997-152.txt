 President, I rise to condemn in the strongest possible terms recent comments that have been attributed to Mr. Freih Abu Medein, the Justice Minister in the Palestinian authority.  In a May 17 article in the Washington Post, journalist Barton Gellman reported that Mr. Medein stated last month that ``five Zionist Jews'' are running the United States' Middle East policy and, in the words of the article, he ``added that it is implausible that anation the size of the United States can find no one else to maintain diplomatic contacts with Palestinians.''  This statement, if quoted correctly, is deeply offensive on two counts. First, it is patently anti-semitic, or more properly, anti-Jewish. Its conspiratorial overtones reflect the worst traditions of hate-mongering that characterizes classical anti-semitism.  Second, it is a thinly veiled attempt to manipulate our sovereign right as a country to choose whoever we wish to represent us diplomatically. It also evinces complete ignorance of the American system.  I am confident that the individuals to whom Mr. Medein refers were not chosen for their religious beliefs, but rather on the strength of their qualifications for the jobs for which they were selected. Anyone who thinks otherwise has great deal to learn about this country.  If Mr. Medein or anyone else in the Palestinian Authority has difficulty meeting with American representatives who happen to profess a particular religious faith, then that is their problem, not ours.  I would submit, Mr. President, that we have the right to choose a person of any faith, any gender, and any race to represent us in any place. Should we choose an American who happens to be a Muslim to represent us in Israel, a Hindu to represent us in Pakistan, a Jew in Syria, a Roman Catholic in Yugoslavia, a Greek Orthodox in Turkey, or a Buddhist in China, then that is our sovereign right as a nation. The only criterion should be that the person be qualified for the job for which he or she is selected. Religious affiliation should have absolutely nothing to do with it. Zero. Zilch.  That is what distinguishes us from the rest of the world. For unfortunately, Mr. Medein's views are not isolated ones. They reflect an all-to-common obsession with race, religion, and ethnicity that plagues much of the world.  We may not be perfect, but our guiding ideals are unassailable. And we have successfully put those ideals into practice, with the result that many others seek to emulate us.  Mr. President, the day we pause even for a fraction of a second to contemplate the possible validity of remarks such as Mr. Medein's is the day that we abandon our most fundamental beliefs.  Bigotry must be denounced, whether it is at home or abroad. American representatives who are the object of bigoted attacks deserve to know that their country stands four-square behind them.                          ____________________
