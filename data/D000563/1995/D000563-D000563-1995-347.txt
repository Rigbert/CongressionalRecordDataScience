Chairman, this amendment is part of the Republican campaign for the dumbing down of America. First, they killed the fairness doctrine so Americans no longer hear both sides of an issue. Then the Republicans invested heavily in right wing radio and TV, so that Americans get a steady diet of Rush Limbaugh and the world according to Professor Gingrich. Now they wanted to kill public broadcasting.  My Republican colleagues live in fear that Americans will hear more than their narrow side of the political debate. It is ironic that my Illinois colleague, who railed against the freedoms destroyed by communism, is anxious to silence the free exchange of ideas on public broadcasting.  The Republicans should not be afraid of information and balanced debate. In many foreign nations, this kind of exchange of ideas is called the American way of doing things.  Now, let me reinforce what the gentlewoman from California said. Voting against Mr. Crane's amendment does not make you a friend of public broadcasting. Keep in mind that the underlying bill, this rescission bill, cuts the heart out of public support for public broadcasting.  Those who are standing here opposing his amendment, to say that they are friends of public broadcasting I think a lot of us know better. The bottom line is this: If we are going to keep a free and open exchange of ideas in this country, we have to be subscribing to, supporting personally, and providing some Government support, yes, for public broadcasting, both radio and TV. Oppose the Crane amendment and oppose this bill.
