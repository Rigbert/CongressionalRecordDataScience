In it, they wrote:       Many climate science experts from Canada and around the      world, while still strongly supporting environmental      protection, equally strongly disagree with the scientific      rationale for the Kyoto Accord.  In their June 3 letter, the group wrote to Paul Martin, a Canadian member of Parliament, urging him to consider the consequences of a Kyoto ratification. This is the country of Canada. Quoting now from that letter:       Although ratification has already taken place, we believe      that the government of Canada needs a far more comprehensive      understanding of what climate science really says if      environmental policy is to be developed that will truly      benefit the environment while maintaining the economic      prosperity so essential to social progress.  Many scientists share the same view. I mentioned several other countries' leading climate scientists earlier in this speech. In addition, over 4,000 scientists, 70 of whom are Nobel Prize winners, signed the Heidelberg Appeal, which says that no compelling evidence exists to justify controls of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; that is, manmade emissions.  Let me repeat that. Over 4,000 scientists, 70 of whom are Nobel Prize winners, signed the Heidelberg Appeal which says that no compelling evidence exists to justify controls of greenhouse gas emissions, manmade greenhouse gas emissions. They agree it is a hoax.  Now, I also want to point to a 1998 survey of State climatologists, which reveals that a majority of respondents have serious doubts about whether anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases present a serious threat to climate stability.  Then there is Dr. Frederick Seitz, a past president of the National Academy of Sciences and a professor emeritus at Rockefeller University, who compiled the Oregon Petition, and it reads as follows:       We urge the United States Government to reject the global      warming agreement that was written in Kyoto, Japan, in      December, 1997, and any other similar proposals. The proposed      limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder      the advance of science and technology, and damage the health      and welfare of mankind.       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human      release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases      is causing or will, in the foreseeable future,      cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and      disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is      substantial scientific evidence that increases in      atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects      upon the natural plant and animal environments of the      earth.  That is Dr. Frederick Seitz, former president of the National Academy of Sciences.  The petition has 17,800 independently verified signatures, and for those signers who hold a Ph.D., 95 percent have now been independently verified. Environmental groups have attacked the credibility of this petition based on one false name sent in by some green pranksters. Several names are still on the list even though biased press reports have ridiculed their identity with the names of famous personalities. They are actual signers.  A guy named Perry Mason, for example, is a Ph.D. chemist. He was one of the signers.  The most significant thing that just recently came out is the Harvard Smithsonian 1,000-year climate study. Let me turn to an important new study by the researchers. The study entitled ``Proxy Climatic and Environmental Changes of the Past 1,000 Years'' offers a devastating critique of Mann's hypothesis calling into question the IPCC's Third Assessment, and indeed the entire intellectual foundation of the alarmists' views. It draws on extensive evidence showing that major changes in global temperatures result not from manmade emissions but from natural causes.  Smithsonian scientists, Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas, with coauthors Craig Idso, Sherwood Idso, and David Legates, compiled and examined results from more than 240 peer-reviewed papers published by thousands of researchers over the past four decades. In contrast to Mann's flawed, limited research, the Harvard-Smithsonian study covers a multitude of geophysical and biological climate indicators. While Mann's analysis relied mostly on tree-ring data from the Northern Hemisphere, the researchers offer a detailed look at climate changes that occurred in different regions around the world over the last 1,000 years.  The range of the climate proxies--now, keep in mind, we are talking about one of them that was just primarily looking at tree rings, but these 240 studies that were analyzed in the Smithsonian-Harvard report looked at borehole data, cultural data, glacier advances or retreats, geomorphology, isotopic analysis from lake sediments or ice cores, tree or peat celluloses, corals, stalagmite or biological fossils, net ice accumulation rate, including dust or chemical counts, lake fossils and sediments, river sediments, melt layers in ice cores, phenological and paleontological fossils, pollen, seafloor sediments, luminescent analysis, everything that fit every kind of proxy that could be known to science.  Based on this proxy data drawn from the 240 peer-reviewed studies, the authors offered highly convincing evidence to support the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period. As coauthor Dr. Sallie Baliunas explained:       For a long time, researchers have possessed anecdotal      evidence supporting the existence of these climate extremes.  What happened during these periods? We remember what happened during these periods. Baliunas notes that, during the Medieval Warm Period:       The Vikings established colonies in Greenland at the      beginning of the second millennium that died out several      hundred years later when the climate turned colder.  In England, she found that:       Vineyards had flourished during the medieval warmth.  In their study, the authors accumulated reams of objective data to back up these cultural indicators.  The Medieval Warm Period, or Medieval Optimum, occurred between 800 to 1300. Among the studies surveyed by the authors, 112 contained information about the warm period. Of these, 103 showed evidence for the Medieval Warm Period; two did not; seven had equivocal answers.  Looking just at the Southern Hemisphere, the authors found 22 studies, 21 of which confirmed the warm period and only one that did not.  The authors also looked at the 20th century and examined 102 studies to determine whether it was the warmest on record. Three studies said yes, 16 had equivocal answers, and of the remaining 83, 79 showed periods of at least 50 years that were warmer than any 50-year period in the 20th century.  I must say, to any reasonable person, these ratios appear very convincing and undoubtedly rest on a solid scientific foundation. Again, remember, the conclusions of this study are based on 240 peer-reviewed studies, and this chart shows what the Harvard-Smithsonian researchers concluded.  Peer review means they were rigorously reviewed and critiqued by other scientists before they were published. This climate study, published in March of 2003, is the most comprehensive of its kind in history. According to the authors, some of the global warming during the 20th century is attributable to the climate system recovering from the Little Ice Age. Global warming alarmists, however, vehemently disagree, and pull a scientific sleight of hand by pointing to the 140-year direct temperature record as evidence of warming caused by humans. But as the authors note:       The direct temperature measurement record is too short . .      . to provide good measures of natural variability in its full      dynamic range.  This research begs an obvious question: If the Earth was warmer during the Middle Ages than the age of coal-fired powerplants and SUVs, what role do manmade emissions play in influencing climate? I think any person with a modicum of common sense would say, not much and maybe none.  How did the media report on the Harvard-Smithsonian study? The big dailies, such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, basically ignored it. I was impressed by a fair and balanced piece in the Boston Globe. Unfortunately, some of the media could not resist playing politics of personal destruction.  Before I move on, I add another point about climate history. For the last several minutes, I have talked about natural climate variability over the past 1,000 years. We can go back even further in history to see dramatic changes in climate that had nothing to do with SUVs or powerplants. During the last few hundred thousand years, the Earth has seen multiple repeated periods of glaciation. Each ice age has ended because of dramatic increases in global temperatures which had nothing to do with fossil fuel emissions.  In fact, the last major glacier retreat, marking the end of the Wurm Glaciation, was only 12,000 years ago. At the end, the temperature was 14 degrees Celsius lower than today and climbed rapidly to present day temperature--and did so in as little as 50 years. Thus began our current Holocene Age of warm climates and glacier retreat.  These cycles of warming and cooling have been found so frequent and are so often so much more dramatic than the fractional degree changes measured over the last century that one wonders if the alarmists are simply ignorant of geological and meteorological history or simply ignoring it to advance their agenda.  What is the real story behind Kyoto? As I pointed out, the science underlying the Kyoto Protocol has been thoroughly discredited. But for some reason the drive to implement Kyoto continues apace in the United States and more fervently in Europe. What is going on here?  The Europeans continue to insist that the United States should honor its international responsibilities and ratify Kyoto. In June of 2001 Germany released a statement declaring the world needs Kyoto because its greenhouse gas reduction targets are indispensable.  Similarly, Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson, in June of 2001, said flatly and without explanation that ``Kyoto is necessary.'' The question is, indispensable and necessary for what?  Certainly not for further reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as Europe has proven. According to news reports earlier this year, the European Union has failed to meet its Kyoto targets. As we know, according to the best scientific evidence, Kyoto will do nothing to reduce global temperatures.  As it turns out, Kyoto's objective has nothing to do with saving the globe. In fact, it is purely political. The case in point, French President Jacques Chirac said during a speech at The Hague in November of 2002 that Kyoto represents ``the first component of an authentic global governance.'' Keep in mind who we are talking about--Jacques Chirac of France. He wants the authentic global governance. You have to ask if we are going to let the French dictate our United States policy.  Margot Wallstrom, EU environment commissioner, takes a different view but one instructive about the real motives of Kyoto proponents. She asserts that Kyoto is about ``the economy, about leveling the playing field for big businesses worldwide.'' In other words, we in this country should level the playing field so we are equal with the European Union. That is very significant in terms of what the real motives are.  Chirac and Wallstrom's comments mean two things: Kyoto represents an attempt by certain elements within the international community to restrain United States interests; second, Kyoto is an economic weapon designed to undermine the global competitiveness and economic superiority of the United States.  I am mystified that some in this body and in the media blithely assert that the science of global warming is settled; that is, fossil fuel emissions are the principal, driving cause of global warming.  In a letter to me concerning the next EPA administrator, two Senators wrote, ``The pressing problem of global warming'' is now ``established scientific fact,'' and demanded that the new administrator commit to addressing it.  With all due respect, this statement is baseless for several reasons, as I outlined in detail above. The evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of those who do not see global warming proposing harm to the planet and who do not think human beings have an insignificant influence on the climate system.  This leads to another question: Why would this body subject the United States to Kyoto-like measures that have no environmental benefits and cause serious harm to the economy? There are several pieces of legislation, including several that have been referred to my committee, that effectively implement Kyoto without ratifying the treaty. From a cursory read of the Senate politics, it is my understanding some of these bills enjoy more than a modicum of support.  I urge my colleagues to reject them and follow the science to the facts. Reject approaches designed not to solve an environmental problem but to satisfy the ever-growing demand of environmental groups for money and for power and other extremists who simply do not like capitalism, free markets, and freedom.  Climate alarmists see an opportunity here to tax the American people. Consider the July 11 Op-ed by J.W. Anderson of the Washington Post. Anderson, a former editorial writer of the Post and now a journalist in residence with Resources for the Future, concedes that climate science still confronts uncertainties, but his solution is a field tax to prepare for a potentially catastrophic future. Based on the case I have outlined today, such a course of action fits a particularly ideological agenda but is entirely unwarranted.  It is my fervent hope Congress will reject prophets of doom who peddle propaganda masquerading as science in the name of saving the planet. I urge my colleagues to put stock in scientists who rely on the best, most objective scientific data and reject fear as a motivating basis for making public policy decisions.  Let me be very clear: Alarmists are attempting to enact an agenda of energy suppression that is inconsistent with American values, freedom, prosperity, and environmental problems.  Over the past hour and a half I have offered compelling evidence that catastrophic global warming is a hoax. That conclusion is supported by painstaking work of the Nation's top planet scientists. We have those scientists who concluded that the Kyoto protocol has no environmental benefits; natural variability, not fossil fuel emissions, is an overwhelming factor influencing climate change; satellite data, confirmed by NOAA, confirms that no meaningful warming has occurred over the last century; and climate models predicting dramatic temperature increases over the next 100 years are flawed and highly imperfect.  These scientists include Dr. Fred Singer, from the University of Virginia; Dr. Tom Wigley, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research; Dr. Richard Lindzen from the National Academy of Science. Everyone listed is someone whose credentials cannot be questioned.  If you study that, you will come to the same conclusions. These are objective scientists, not fundraisers for some far-left environmental extremist groups.  Finally, I return to the words of Dr. Frederick Seitz, a past president of the National Academy of Sciences, a professor emeritus at Rockefeller University, who compiled the Oregon Petition. He said:       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human      release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse      gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause      catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption      of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial      scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon      dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural      plant and animal environments of the Earth.  These are sobering words which the extremists have chosen to ignore. So what could possibly be the motivation for global warming alarmism? Since I have become the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee,it has become pretty clear. It is fundraising. Environmental extremists rake in millions of dollars, not to solve environmental problems but to fuel their ever-growing fundraising machines, part of which are financed by the Federal taxpayers.  So what have we learned from the scientists and economists I talked about today? Five things, briefly:  No. 1, the claim that global warming is caused by manmade emissions is simply untrue and not based on sound science.  No. 2, CO2 does not cause catastrophic disasters. Actually, it would be beneficial to our environment and the economy.  No. 3, Kyoto would impose huge cost on Americans, especially the poor.  No. 4, the same environmentalists who are hysterical over global warming today were just as hysterical in the 1970s over global cooling.  And, No. 5, the motives for Kyoto are economic, not environmental; that is, proponents favor handicapping the American economy through carbon taxes and more regulations.  So I will just conclude by saying: Wake up, America. With all the hysteria, all the fear, all the phony science, could it be that manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people? I believe it is.  And if we allow these detractors of everything that has made America great, those ranging from the liberal Hollywood elitists to those who are in it for the money, if we allow them to destroy the foundation, the greatness of the most highly industrialized nation in the history of the world, then we don't deserve to live in this one nation under God. So I say to the real people: Wake up, make your voice heard. My 11 grandchildren and yours are depending on you.                               Exhibit 1                [From the Washington Post, July 7, 2003]               Climate Change: The Science Isn't Settled                         (By James Schlesinger)       Despite the certainty many seem to feel about the causes,      effects and extent of climate change, we are in fact making      only slow progress in our understanding of the underlying      science. My old professor at Harvard, the great economist      Joseph Schumpeter, used to insist that a principal tool of      economic science was history--which served to temper the      enthusiasms of the here and now. This must be even more so in      climatological science. In recent years the inclination has      been to attribute the warming we have lately experienced to a      single dominant cause--the increase in greenhouse gases. Yet      climate has always been changing--and sometimes the swings      have been rapid.       At the time the U.S. Department of Energy was created in      1977, there was widespread concern about the cooling trend      that had been observed for the previous quarter-century.      After 1940 the temperature, at least in the Northern      Hemisphere, had dropped about one-half degree Fahrenheit--and      more in the higher latitudes. In 1974 the National Science      Board, the governing body of the National Science Foundation,      stated: ``During the last 20 to 30 years, world temperature      has fallen, irregularly at first but more sharply over the      last decade.'' Two years earlier, the board had observed:      ``Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the      present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end      . . . leading into the next glacial age.'' And in 1975 the      National Academy of Sciences stated: ``The climates of the      earth have always been changing, and they will doubtless      continue to do so in the future. How large these future      changes will be, and where and how rapidly they will occur,      we do not know.''       These statements--just a quarter-century old--should      provide us with a dose of humility as we look into the more      distant future. A touch of that humility might help temper      the current raging controversies over global warming. What      has concerned me in recent years is that belief in the      greenhouse effect, persuasive as it is, has been transmuted      into the dominant forcing mechanism affecting climate      change--more or less to the exclusion of other forcing      mechanisms. The CO2/climate-change relationship      has hardened into orthodoxy--always a worrisome sign--an      orthodoxy that searches out heretics and seeks to punish      them.       We are in command of certain essential facts. First, since      the start of the 20th century, the mean temperature at the      earth's surface has risen about 1 degree Fahrenheit. Second,      the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has been      increasing for more than 150 years. Third, CO2 is      a greenhouse gas--and increases in it, other things being      equal, are likely to lead to further warming. Beyond these      few facts, science remains unable either to attribute past      climate changes to changes in CO2 or to forecast      with any degree of precision how climate will change in the      future.       Of the rise in temperature during the 20th century, the      bulk occurred from 1900 to 1940. It was followed by the      aforementioned cooling trend from 1940 to around 1975. Yet      the concentration of greenhouse gases was measurably higher      in that later period than in the former. That drop in      temperature came after what was described in the National      Geographic as ``six decades of abnormal warmth.''       In recent years much attention has been paid in the press      to longer growing seasons and shrinking glaciers. Yet in the      earlier period up to 1975, the annual growing season in      England had shrunk by some nine or 10 days, summer frosts in      the upper Midwest occasionally damaged crops, the glaciers in      Switzerland had begun to advance again, and sea ice had      returned to Iceland's coasts after more than 40 years of its      near absence.       When we look back over the past millennium, the questions      that arise are even more perplexing. The so-called Climatic      Optimum of the early Middle Ages, when the earth temperatures      were 1 to 2 degrees warmer than today and the Vikings      established their flourishing colonies in Greenland, was      succeeded by the Little Ice Age, lasting down to the early      19th century. Neither can be explained by concentrations of      greenhouse gases. Moreover, through much of the earth's      history, increases in CO2 have followed global      warming, rather than the other way around.       We cannot tell how much of the recent warming trend can be      attributed to the greenhouse effect and how much to other      factors. In climate change, we have only a limited grasp of      the overall forces at work. Uncertainties have continued to      abound--and must be reduced. Any approach to policy formation      under conditions of such uncertainty should be taken only on      an exploratory and sequential basis. A premature commitment      to a fixed policy can only proceed with fear and trembling.       In the Third Assessment by the International Panel on      Climate Change, recent climate change is attributed primarily      to human causes, with the usual caveats regarding      uncertainties. The record of the past 150 years is scanned,      and three forcing mechanisms are highlighted: anthropogenic      (human-caused) greenhouse gases, volcanoes and the 11-year      sunspot cycle. Other phenomena are represented poorly, if at      all, and generally are ignored in these models. Because only      the past 150 years are captured, the vast swings of the      previous thousand years are not analyzed. The upshot is that      any natural variations, other than volcanic eruptions, are      overshadowed by anthropogenic greenhouse gases.       Most significant: The possibility of long-term cycles in      solar activity is neglected because there is a scarcity of      direct measurement. Nonetheless, solar irradiance and its      variation seem highly likely to be a principal cause of long-     term climatic change. Their role in longer-term weather      cycles needs to be better understood.       There is an idea among the public that ``the science is      settled.'' Aside from the limited facts I cited earlier, that      remains far from the truth. Today we have far better      instruments, better measurements and better time series than      we have ever had. Still, we are in danger of prematurely      embracing certitudes and losing open-mindedness. We need to      be more modest.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2     The Hon. Paul Martin, P.C.,     Member of Parliament, House of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario.       Dear Mr. Martin: We understand from media reports that you      believe that more consultation with the provinces should have      taken place before moving forward with ratification of the      Kyoto Accord. We would like to alert you to the fact that the      current government neglected to conduct comprehensive science      consultations as well. The statements by current Minister of      the Environment David Anderson that Prime Minister Jean      Chretien's decision to ratify the Kyoto accord was based      merely on a ``gut feeling,'' not an understanding of the      issue, clearly illustrates that a more thorough examination      of the science should have taken place before a ratification      decision was made.       If you are to lead the next government, we believe that a      high priority should be placed on correcting this situation      and conducting wide ranging consultations with non-     governmental climate scientists as soon as possible in order      to properly consider the range of informed opinion pertaining      to the science of Kyoto.       Many of us made the same suggestion to the Prime Minister      in an open letter on Nov. 25, 2002, in which we alerted Mr.      Chretien to the fact that Kyoto was not justified from a      scientific perspective. That letter called on the government      of Canada ``to delay a decision on the ratification of the      Kyoto Accord until after a thorough and comprehensive      consultation is conducted with non-governmental climate      specialists.'' It was explained to the Prime Minister that,      ``Many climate science experts from Canada and around the      world, while still strongly supporting environmental      protection, equally strongly disagree with the scientific      rationale for the Kyoto Accord.''       Unfortunately, the Prime Minister took no action on the      issue and proceeded to ratify the accord without the      government and the public having had the benefit of hearing a      proper science debate on an issue that is sure to affect      Canadians for generations to come.       We strongly believe that important environmental policy      should be based on a strong     foundation of environmental science. Censoring credible      science out of the debate because it does not conform to a      pre-determined political agenda is clearly not a responsible      course of action for any government. Your openness to re-     examining the recent approach to the Kyoto file encourages us      to believe that you may also be open to reconsidering the way      in which the scientific debate was suppressed as well. We      certainly hope so. Although ratification has already taken      place, we believe that the government of Canada needs a far      more comprehensive understanding of what climate science      really says if environmental policy is to be developed that      will truly benefit the environment while maintaining the      economic prosperity so essential to social progress.       In the meantime, we would be happy to provide you with more      information on this important topic and, for those of us who      are able, we would like to offer to meet with you personally      to discuss the issue further in the near future.
