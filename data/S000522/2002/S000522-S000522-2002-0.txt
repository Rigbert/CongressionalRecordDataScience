Mr. Speaker, the bill which is before the House represents a compromise measure that has been worked out with the Senate on a number of benefit-related measures considered this year.  In May of this year, the House considered and passed H.R. 4085, the Veterans and Survivors Benefits Expansion Act. There were three major provisions in that bill: (1) the annual cost-of-living adjustment for disabled veterans and the survivors eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation; (2) a revision to the eligibility for survivor benefits so that surviving spouses of veterans who died of service-related causes could retain their eligibility for veterans' benefit even if they remarried after age 65; and (3) a reduction in the loan fees payable by reservists who use the VA home loan program.  The Senate stripped all but the COLA from H.R. 4085 at the end of September and returned it to the House. We agreed to the clean COLA bill, which was signed by President Bush and is Public Law 107-247.  The Senate also sent us a benefits bill, S. 2237, which has become the vehicle for the compromises worked out by the two committees for the provisions previously contained in H.R. 4085 and a number of provisions contained in the Senate bill passed last month.  Because of an evolving budget situation, the committees found themselves forced to offset virtually all of the PAYGO costs associated with the bill. The Senate bill had basically none of the provisions originally contained in H.R. 4085. Instead, it proposed to expand eligibility for service-connected hearing loss and allow veterans to obtain a ``hybrid'' adjustable rate mortgage using their VA home loan eligibility.  The compromise includes modified versions of these important Senate provisions. It does not include the DIC change proposed by the House, although it provides eligibility for CHAMPVA for surviving spouses who remarried after age 55. They must apply for this benefit within one year of the date the President signs this legislation. This and other changes were made in order to keep the bill within strict budget guidelines governing direct spending, or PAYGO.  The compromise includes a House-passed provision authorizing the placement of a memorial at Arlington National Cemetery honoring veterans of the Battle of the Bulge. It includes as well a provision which originated in the House to raise the Medal of Honor pension to $1,000 monthly and to make retroactive payments for those who were awarded this medal.  A provision is also included to extend coverage under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act to members of the National Guard who are called to active service for more than 30 consecutive days to respond to a national emergency. Many members expressed an interest in this particular provision, and I commend Mr. Evans for a similar proposal in H.R. 4017. Senator Wellstone was the author of a Senate proposal, and I am pleased that our compromise agreement on this is built upon their work.  For the benefit of my colleagues, I include at this point in the Record a joint explanatory statement describing the compromise agreement we have reached with the other body.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bipartisan measure for our Nation's veterans.    Explanatory Statement on House Amendment to Senate Bill, S. 2237       S. 2237, as amended, the ``Veterans Benefits Act of 2002,''      reflects a Compromise Agreement the Senate and House      Committees on Veterans' Affairs have reached on the following      bills considered in the House and Senate during the 107th      Congress: S. 2237 (``Senate Bill''), H.R. 2561, H.R. 3423,      H.R. 4085, H.R. 4940, and H.R. 5055 (``House Bills''). S.      2237, as amended, passed the Senate on September 26, 2002;      H.R. 2561 and H.R. 3423, as amended, passed the House on      December 20, 2001; H.R. 4085, as amended, passed the House on      May 21, 2002; and H.R. 4940, as amended, and H.R. 5055 passed      the House on July 22, 2002.       The Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs have      prepared the following explanation of S. 2237, as amended,      (``Compromise Agreement''). Differences between the      provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement and the      related provisions of S. 2237, H.R. 2561, H.R. 3423, H.R.      4085, H.R. 4940, H.R. 5055, are noted in this document,      except for clerical corrections, conforming changes made      necessary by the Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting,      technical, and clarifying changes.            TITLE I--COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS IMPROVEMENTS Retention of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of      Veterans Affairs for Surviving Spouses Remarrying After Age 55     Current law       Section 103(d) of title 38, United States Code, prohibits a      surviving spouse who has remarried from receiving dependency      and indemnity compensation (``DIC''), VA health insurance      under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the      Department of Veterans Affairs (``CHAMPVA''), home loan, and      education benefits. These benefits may be reinstated in the      event the subsequent remarriage is terminated.     House bill       Section 3 of H.R. 4085 would allow a surviving spouse who      remarries after attaining age 65 to retain DIC, CHAMPVA      health insurance, home loan, and education benefits. Spouses      who remarried at age 65 or older prior to enactment of the      bill would have one year from the date of enactment to apply      for reinstatement of DIC and related benefits. The amount of      DIC would be paid with no reduction of certain other benefits      to which the surviving spouse might be entitled.     Senate bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 101 of the Compromise Agreement would provide that      a surviving spouse, upon remarriage after attaining age 55,      would retain CHAMPVA eligibility. Surviving spouses who      remarried after attaining age 55 but prior to enactment of      this Act would have one year to apply for reinstatement of      this benefit. The Committees expect the Secretary will      maintain data concerning the number of surviving spouses who      become eligible or retain eligibility under this provision.       The Committees intend in the 108th Congress to consider      full restoration of benefits for surviving spouses who      remarry after attaining age 55.Clarification of Entitlement to Special Monthly Compensation for Women        Veterans Who Have Service-connected Loss of Breast Tissue     Current law       Section 1114(k) of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      the Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA'') to provide      special monthly compensation to any woman veteran who ``has      suffered the anatomical loss of one or     both breasts (including loss by mastectomy)'' as a result of      military service. Regulations published at section 4.116 of      title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, have limited this      compensation to ``Anatomical loss of a breast exists when      there is complete surgical removal of breast tissue (or the      equivalent loss of breast tissue due to injury). As defined      under this section, radical mastectomy, modified radical      mastectomy, and simple (or total) mastectomy result in      anatomical loss of a breast, but wide local excision, with or      without significant alteration of size or form, does not.''     Senate bill       Section 101 of S. 2237 would amend section 1114(k) of title      38, United States Code, to specify that women veterans who      have suffered the anatomical loss of half of the tissue of      one or both breasts in or as a result of military service may      be eligible for special monthly compensation.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language, and would amend it to extend eligibility to women      veterans who have suffered the anatomical loss of 25 percent      or more of tissue from one or both breasts (including loss by      mastectomy or partial mastectomy) or who received radiation      treatment of breast tissue. The Committees intend that this      change should extend eligibility for special monthly      compensation to women veterans whose medical treatments      (other than ``cosmetic surgery'') or injuries have resulted      in a significant change in size, form, function, or      appearance of one or both breasts.  Specification of Hearing Loss Required for Compensation For Hearing                          Loss in Paired Organs     Current Law       Under section 1160 of title 38, United States Code, special      consideration is extended to a veteran's service-connected      disabilities in ``paired organs or extremities,'' such as      kidneys, lungs, feet, or hands. For these paired organs or      extremities, VA is authorized when rating disability to      consider any degree of damage to both organs, even if only      one resulted from military service. Total impairment is not a      requirement for kidneys, hands, feet, or lungs. Proportional      impairment, such as ``the loss or loss of use of one kidney      as a result of service-connected disability and involvement      of the other kidney as a result of non-service-connected      disability,'' is specifically provided for in subsections      (2), (4), and (5) of section 1160(a) of title 38, United      States Code. However, total deafness in both ears is required      under section 1160(a)(3) of title 38, United States Code, for      special consideration of hearing loss.     Senate bill       Section 102 of S. 2237 would eliminate the word ``total''      from section 1160(a)(3) of title 38, United States Code, and      allow VA to consider partial non-service-connected hearing      loss in one ear when rating disability for veterans with      compensable service- connected hearing loss in the other ear.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.  Assessment of Acoustic Trauma Associated With Military Service From                         World War II to Present     Current law       There is no applicable current law.                              Senate bill       Section 103(a) of S. 2237 would authorize the Secretary to      establish a presumption of service connection for hearing      loss or tinnitus in veterans who served in certain military      occupational specialties during specific periods of time if      VA finds that evidence warrants such a presumption. Section      103(b) would extend presumption rebuttal provisions in title      38, United States Code, to cover service-connected hearing      loss, should such a presumption be established.       Section 103(c) of the Senate Bill would require VA to enter      into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences      (``NAS'') or an equivalent scientific organization to review      scientific evidence on forms of acoustic trauma that could      contribute to hearing disorders for personnel serving in      specific military occupational specialties. Section      103(c)(2)(B) of the Senate Bill would direct NAS to identify      forms of acoustic trauma likely to cause hearing damage in      servicemembers, and, in section 103(c)(2)(C), to determine      whether such damage would be immediate, cumulative, or      delayed. Section 103(c)(2)(D) of the Senate Bill would      require NAS to assess when audiometric data collected by the      military services became adequate to allow an objective      assessment of individual exposure by VA, examining a      representative sample of records from World War II to present      by period of service. Section 103(c)(2)(E) of the Senate Bill      would require NAS to identify military occupational      specialties in which servicemembers are likely to be exposed      to sufficient acoustic trauma to cause hearing disorders.       Section 103(d) of S. 2237 would require VA to report on      medical care provided to veterans for hearing disorders from      fiscal years 1999-2001; on the number of disability      compensation claims received and granted for hearing loss,      tinnitus, or both during those years; and an estimate of the      total cost to VA of adjudicating those claims in full-time      employee equivalents.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 104 of the Compromise Agreement would strike      sections 103(a) and 103(b) of the Senate Bill authorizing a      presumption of service connection. The Compromise Agreement      follows the Senate language requiring VA to enter into a      contract with NAS, but would change the focus of the study to      assessment of acoustic trauma associated with military      service from World War II to present.       The Compromise Agreement would strike sections      103(c)(2)(B), 103(c)(2)(D), 103(c)(2)(E), and all references      to military occupational specialties. The Compromise      Agreement follows the Senate language requiring NAS to      determine how much exposure to acoustic trauma or noise      damage during military service might cause or contribute to      hearing loss, hearing threshold shift, or tinnitus, and      whether this damage may be immediate- or delayed-onset,      cumulative, progressive, or a combination of these.       The Compromise Agreement would preserve provisions      requiring NAS to assess when audiometric measures became      adequate to assess individual hearing threshold shift      reliably and when sufficiently protective hearing      conservation measures became available. It would also add a      third provision requiring NAS to identify age, occupational      history, and other factors which could contribute to an      individual's noise-induced hearing loss.       In assessing when audiometric data collected by the      military became adequate for VA to evaluate if a veteran's      hearing threshold shift could be detected at or prior to      separation, the Committees intend for NAS to review and      report on a representative sample of individual records. This      should reflect not only an appropriate distribution of      individuals among the various Armed Forces, but within each      military service branch so that these records represent      servicemembers who might reasonably be expected to have      different levels of noise exposure in the course of their      duties. The representative sample should also include records      of servicemembers discharged during or after distinct periods      of war or conflict and consider the environment in which they      served in order to gauge how adequately each branch collected      audiometric data following World War II, the Korean conflict,      the Vietnam era, and during and following the Persian Gulf      War.       The Compromise Agreement would generally follow the Senate      language requiring VA to report on hearing loss claims and      medical treatment for hearing disorders. The Compromise      Agreement would amend this language to refer to the number of      decisions issued and their results, rather than claims      submitted in fiscal years 2000 through 2002, and would remove      references to military occupational specialties.                       TITLE II--MEMORIAL AFFAIRS   Prohibition on Certain Additional Benefits For Persons Committing                              Capital Crimes     Current law       Sections 2411 and 2408(d) of title 38, United States Code,      prohibit persons who are convicted of capital crimes from      interment or memorialization in National Cemetery      Administration cemeteries, Arlington National Cemetery      (``ANC''), or a State cemetery that receives VA grant      funding. Section 5313 of title 38, United States Code,      further limits VA benefits available to veterans who die      while fleeing prosecution or after being convicted of a      capital crime.     Senate bill       Section 402 of S. 2237 would prohibit the issuance of      Presidential Memorial Certificates, flags, and memorial      headstones or grave markers to veterans convicted of or      fleeing from prosecution for a State or Federal capital      crime.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 201 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language. Procedures for Disqualification of Persons Committing Capital Crimes         For Interment or Memorialization in National Cemeteries     Current law       Section 2411 of title 38, United States Code, prohibits      interment or memorialization in National Cemetery      Administration cemeteries or in Arlington National Cemetery      (``ANC'') of any person convicted of a capital crime. This      section further prohibits interment or memorialization of      persons found by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or the      Secretary of the Army to have committed capital crimes but      who avoided conviction of the crime through flight or death      preceding prosecution. In such cases, the Secretary of      Veterans Affairs or the Secretary of the Army must receive      notice from the Attorney General of the United States, or the      appropriate State official, of the Secretary's own finding      before the prohibition shall apply.     Senate bill       Section 403 of S. 2237 would eliminate the requirement that      the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or the Secretary of the      Army be notified of a finding by the Attorney General or     the appropriate State official in cases of persons who are      found to have committed capital crimes but who avoided      conviction of the crime through flight or death preceding      prosecution.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 202 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language. Application of Department of Veterans Affairs Benefit for Government Markers for Marked Graves of Veterans at Private Cemeteries to Veterans                   Dying on or After September 11, 2001     Current law       Section 2306(d)(1) provides that the Secretary shall      furnish a government marker to those families who request one      for the marked grave of a veteran buried at a private      cemetery, who died on or after December 27, 2001.     House Bill       Section 6 of H.R. 4940 would make section 2306(d)(1)      retroactive to veterans who died on or after September 11,      2001.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 203 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language. Authorization of Placement of Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery   Honoring World War II Veterans Who Fought in the Battle of the Bulge     Current law       Section 2409 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      the Secretary of Army to erect appropriate memorials or      markers in Arlington National Cemetery to honor the memory of      members of the Armed Forces.     House bill       H.R. 5055 would authorize the Secretary of the Army to      place in ANC a new memorial marker honoring veterans who      fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II. The      Secretary of the Army would have exclusive authority to      approve an appropriate design and site within ANC for the      memorial.     Senate bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 204 of the Compromise Agreement would authorize the      Secretary of the Army to place in ANC a new memorial marker      honoring veterans who fought in the Battle of the Bulge.                        TITLE III--OTHER MATTERS   Increase in Aggregate Annual Amount Available for State Approving Agencies for Administrative Expenses for Fiscal Years 2003, 2004, 2005,                              2006, and 2007     Current law       Section 3674(a)(4) of title 38, United States Code, funds      State approving agencies. From fiscal years 1995 to 2000,      State approving agency (``SAA'') funding was capped, with no      annual increase, at $13 million. Public Law 106-419 increased      SAA funding to $14 million for fiscal years 2001 and 2002.      Under current law, the authorization amount was reduced to      $13 million as of October 1, 2002. SAAs are the agencies that      determine which schools, courses, and training programs      qualify as eligible for veterans seeking to use their GI Bill      benefits.     Senate bill       Section 201 of S. 2237 would restore SAA funding to $14      million per year and would increase it to $18 million per      year during fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005.     House bill       Section 6 of H.R. 4085 contains an identical provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 301 of the Compromise Agreement would restore SAA      funding at $14 million for fiscal year 2003, $18 million for      fiscal year 2004, $18 million for fiscal year 2005, $19      million for fiscal year 2006, and $19 million for fiscal year      2007. Authority for Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance To Be Carried Beyond                                  Age 70     Current law       Section 2106(i)(2) of title 38, United States Code,      provides that Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance (``VMLI'')      shall be terminated on the veteran's seventieth birthday.      VMLI is designed to provide financial protection to cover      eligible veterans' home mortgages in the event of death. VMLI      is issued only to those severely disabled veterans who have      received grants for Specially Adapted Housing from the      Department of Veterans Affairs.     House bill       Section 5(b) of H.R. 4085 would permit veterans eligible      for specially-adapted housing grants to continue their VMLI      coverage beyond age 70. No new policies would be issued after      age 70.     Senate bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 302 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.        Authority To Guarantee Hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgages     Current law       There is no authorization in current law for VA to      guarantee adjustable rate mortgages (``ARMs'') and hybrid      adjustable rate mortgages (``hybrid ARMs''). A hybrid ARM      combines features of fixed rate mortgages and adjustable rate      mortgages. A hybrid ARM has a fixed rate of interest for at      least the first 3 years of the loan, with an annual interest      rate adjustment after the fixed rate has expired.     Senate bill       Section 301 of S. 2237 would authorize VA to establish a      three-year pilot program to guarantee hybrid ARMs and      reauthorize a fiscal year-1993 to 1995 pilot program to      guarantee conventional ARMs. This authority would begin in      fiscal year 2003 and expire at the end of fiscal year 2005.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 303 of the Compromise Agreement would authorize VA      to guarantee hybrid ARMs for a period of two years. The      effective date of this provision would be October 1, 2003.    Increase in the Amount Payable as Medal of Honor Special Pension     Current law       Section 1562 of title 38, United States Code, provides a      special pension of $600 per month to recipients of the Medal      of Honor. Eligibility to receive the Medal of Honor special      pension is contingent upon having first been awarded the      Medal of Honor.     Senate bill       Section 104 of S. 2237 would increase the Medal of Honor      special pension from $600 to $1,000 per month. Beginning in      January 2003, the pension amount would be adjusted annually      to maintain the value of the pension in the face of the      rising cost of living. The amount of this adjustment would      match the percentage of the cost-of-living adjustment paid to      Social Security recipients. The Senate Bill would also      provide for a one-time, lump-sum payment in the amount of      special pension the recipient would have received between the      date of the act of valor and the date that the recipient's      pension actually commenced.     House bill       H.R. 2561 would increase the special pension payable to      Medal of Honor recipients from $600 to $1,000 per month, and      provide a lump sum payment for existing Medal of Honor      recipients in an amount equal to the total amount of special      pension that the person would have received had the person      received special pension during the period beginning the      first day of the month that began after the act giving rise      to the receipt of the Medal of Honor, and ending with the      last day of the month preceding the month that such person's      special compensation commenced. H.R. 2561 also would provide      criminal penalties for the unauthorized purchase or      possession of the Medal and for making a false representation      as a Medal recipient.     Compromise agreement       Section 304 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language, but would modify the effective date of the      provision to September 1, 2003. It is the Committee's      understanding that the first month a Medal of Honor recipient      would receive special pension is October 2003.       It is the Committees' intent that the lump sum payment of      special pension be determined using the rates of special      pension and the laws of eligibility in effect (including      applicable age requirements) for months beginning after an      individual's act of gallantry. Excluded from this rule would      be the law of eligibility requiring an individual to have      been awarded a Medal of Honor.Extension of Protections Under Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 to National Guard Members Called to Active Duty Under Title 32,                            United States Code     Current law       The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940      (``SSCRA''), sections 510 et seq., of title 50, United States      Code Appendix, suspends enforcement of certain civil      liabilities and provides certain rights and legal protections      to servicemembers who have been called up to active duty      under title 10, United States Code. However, these      protections do not extend to National Guard members called to      duty under section 502(f) of title 32, United States Code,      ``to perform training or other duty.'' Certain homeland      security duties performed under title 32, United States Code,      such as protecting the nation's airports, have been carried      out at the request and expense of the Federal government with      National Guard members under the command of their state      governors.     Senate bill       Section 401 of S. 2237 would expand SSCRA protections to      include those National Guard members serving full-time, upon      an order of the Governor of a State at the request of the      head of a Federal law enforcement agency and with the      concurrence of the Secretary of Defense, under 502(f) of      title 32, United States Code for homeland security purposes.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement would provide that      when members of the National Guard are called to active      service for     more than 30 consecutive days under section 502(f) of title      32, United States Code, to respond to a national emergency      declared by the President, coverage under the provisions of      the SSCRA would be available. The Committees note that this      provision is intended to extend protections of the SSCRA to      members of the National Guard when called to duty under      circumstances similar to those following the terrorist      attacks of September 11, 2001.               Extension of Income Verification Authority     Current law       Section 6103(l)(7)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code gives      the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') authority to furnish      income information to the VA from IRS records so that VA      might determine eligibility for VA need-based pension,      parents dependency and indemnity compensation, and priority      for VA health-care services. This provision currently expires      on September 30, 2003, pursuant to Public Law 105-33.       Section 5317 of title 38, United States Code, provides      parallel authority for VA to use IRS information and requires      VA to notify applicants for needs-based benefits that income      information furnished by the applicant may be compared with      the information obtained from the Departments of Health and      Human Services and Treasury under section 6103(l)(7)(D). This      parallel authority is scheduled to expire on September 30,      2008, pursuant to Public Law 106-409.     Senate bill       Section 106(a) of S. 2237 would extend section      6103(l)(7)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code through September      30, 2011. Section 106(b) would extend section 5317 of title      38, United States Code, through September 30, 2011.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 306 of the Compromise Agreement would extend      section 6103(l)(7)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code through      September 30, 2008.                        Fee for Loan Assumption     Current law       Section 3729(b)(2)(1) of title 38, United States Code,      requires a 0.50 percent loan fee for active-duty      servicemembers, veterans, Reservists, and others      participating in loan assumptions under section 3714.     Senate bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable language.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable language.     Compromise agreement       Section 307 of the Compromise Agreement would increase the      loan fee for assumptions for loans closed more than 7 days      after enactment in fiscal year 2003 from 0.50 percent to 1.0      percent. The Committees intend this fee increase to expire at      the end of fiscal year 2003.                       TITLE IV--JUDICIAL MATTERS       The U.S Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (``CAVC'') is      an Article I Court of limited jurisdiction. It has come to      the Committees' attention that the Administration has      disregarded Congressional intent in interpreting the CAVC to      be part of the Executive Branch and subject to rescissions of      Executive Branch agency budgets, pursuant to section 1403 of      Public Law 107-206. The Committees note that while the budget      for the Court is included in the President's budget, the      Executive Branch has no authority to review it. Public Law      100-687, section 4082(a). It is the Committees' intent to      clarify that the CAVC is not part of the Executive Branch.      The Committees have so stated on other occasions, e.g., ``The      Court, established by the Congress under Article I of the      Constitution to exercise judicial power, has unusual status      as an independent tribunal that is not subject to the control      of the President or the executive branch.'' House of      Representatives Report 107-156, July 24, 2001, and Senate      Report 107-86, October 15, 2001.   Standard for Reversal by Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims of         Erroneous Finding of Fact by Board of Veterans' Appeals     Current law       Under section 7261(a)(4) of title 38, United States Code,      the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims applies a ``clearly      erroneous'' standard of review to findings of fact made by      the Board of Veterans' Appeals (``BVA''). The ``clearly      erroneous'' standard has been defined as requiring CAVC to      uphold BVA findings of fact if the findings are supported by      ``a plausible basis in the record . . . even if [CAVC] might      not have reached the same factual determinations.'' Wensch v.      Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 366-68 (2001). The recent U.S.      Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision of Hensley      v. West, 212 F.3d 1255 (Fed. Cir. 2000) emphasized that CAVC      should perform only limited, deferential review of BVA      decisions, and stated that BVA fact-finding ``is entitled on      review to substantial deference.'' Id. at 1263.       Section 5107(b) of title 38, United States Code, provides      that VA must find for the claimant when, in considering the      evidence of record, there is an approximate balance of      positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue      including the ultimate merits of the claim. This ``benefit of      the doubt'' standard applicable to proceedings before VA is      unique in administrative law. Under the benefit of the doubt      rule, unless the preponderance of the evidence is against the      claimant, the claim is granted. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.      App. 49 (1990) and Forshey v. Principi, 284 F.3d 1335      (Fed. Cir. 2002).     Senate bill       Section 501 of S. 2237 would amend section 7261(a)(4) of      title 38 to change the standard of review CAVC applies to BVA      findings of fact from ``clearly erroneous'' to ``unsupported      by substantial evidence.'' Section 502 would also cross-     reference section 5107(b) in order to emphasize that the      Secretary's application of the ``benefit of the doubt'' to an      appellant's claim would be considered by CAVC on appeal.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 401 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language with the following amendments.       The Compromise Agreement would modify the standard of      review in the Senate bill in subsection (a) by deleting the      change to a ``substantial evidence'' standard. It would      modify the requirements of the review the Court must perform      when it is making determinations under section 7261(a) of      title 38, United States Code. Since the Secretary is      precluded from seeking judicial review of decisions of the      Board of Veterans Appeals, the addition of the words      ``adverse to the claimant'' in subsection (a) is intended to      clarify that findings of fact favorable to the claimant may      not be reviewed by the Court. Further, the addition of the      words ``or reverse'' after ``and set aside'' is intended to      emphasize that the Committees expect the Court to reverse      clearly erroneous findings when appropriate, rather than      remand the case.       New subsection (b) would maintain language from the Senate      bill that would require the Court to examine the record of      proceedings before the Secretary and BVA and the special      emphasis during the judicial process on the benefit of the      doubt provisions of section 5107 (b) as it makes findings of      fact in reviewing BVA decisions. This would not alter the      formula of the standard of review on the Court, with the      uncertainty of interpretation of its application that would      accompany such a change. The combination of these changes is      intended to provide for more searching appellate review of      BVA decisions, and thus give full force to the ``benefit of      doubt'' provision.       The Compromise Agreement would also modify the effective      date of this provision to apply to cases that have not been      decided prior to the enactment of this Act. This provision      would not apply to cases in which a decision has been made,      but are not final because the time to request panel review or      to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal      Circuit (``Federal Circuit'') has not expired. Review by Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of Decisions of Law     Current law       Under section 7292(a) of title 38, United States Code, the      Federal Circuit may only review CAVC decisions involving      questions of law ``with respect to the validity of any      statute or regulation.'' It does not explicitly have the      authority to hear appeals of CAVC decisions that are not      clearly legal interpretations of statutes or regulations.     Senate bill       Section 502 of S. 2237 would amend sections 7292(a) and (c)      of title 38, United States Code, to specifically provide for      appellate review of a CAVC decision on any rule of law.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 402 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language. Authority of Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims to Award Fees Under        Equal Access to Justice Act to Non-Attorney Practitioners     Current law       Currently, section 2412(d) of title 28, United States Code,      the Equal Access to Justice Act (``EAJA''), shifts the burden      of attorney fees from the citizen to the government in cases      where the government's litigation position is not      substantially justified and the citizen qualifies under      certain income and asset criteria. Qualified non-attorneys      admitted to practice before the CAVC may only receive fees if      the EAJA application is signed by an attorney.     Senate bill       Section 503 of S. 2237 would allow qualified non-attorneys      admitted to practice before the CAVC to be awarded fees under      EAJA for representation provided to VA claimants without the      requirement that an attorney sign the EAJA application.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 403 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.       The Committees expect that in determining the amount of      reasonable fees payable to non-attorney practitioners, the      Court will apply the usual rules applicable to fees     for the work of other non-attorneys such as paralegals and      law students based upon prevailing market rates for the kind      and quality of the services furnished. 28 U.S.C.      Sec. 2412(d)(2)(A). See, Sandoval v. Brown, 9 Vet. App.      177, 181 (1996).                   Legislative Provisions Not Adopted                      ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY     Current law       Eligibility for burial at Arlington National Cemetery is      governed by federal regulations at section 553.15 of title      32, Code of Federal Regulations. The following categories of      persons are eligible for in-ground burial: active duty      members of the Armed Forces, except those members serving on      active duty for training; retired members of the Armed Forces      who have served on active duty, are on a retired list and are      entitled to receive retirement pay; former members of the      Armed Forces discharged for disability before October 1,      1949, who served on active duty and would have been eligible      for retirement under 10 U.S.C. 1202 had the statute been in      effect on the date of separation; honorably discharged      members of the Armed Forces awarded the Medal of Honor,      Distinguished Service Cross, Air Force Cross or Navy Cross,      Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, or Purple Heart;      former prisoners of war who served honorably and who died on      or after November 30, 1993; provided they were honorably      discharged from the Armed Forces, elected federal officials      (the President, Vice President, and Members of Congress),      federal cabinet secretaries and deputies, agency directors      and certain other high federal officials (level I and II      executives), Supreme Court Justices, and chiefs of certain      diplomatic missions; the spouse, widow or widower, minor      child (under 21 years of age) and, at the discretion of the      Secretary of the Army, certain unmarried adult children, and      certain surviving spouses.     House bill       H.R. 4940 would codify eligibility criteria for in-ground      burial at Arlington National Cemetery: members of the Armed      Forces who die on active duty; retired members of the Armed      Forces, including reservists who served on active duty;      members or former members of a reserve component who, but for      age, would have been eligible for retired pay; members of a      reserve component who die in the performance of duty while on      active duty training or inactive duty training; former      members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the Medal      of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross (Air Force Cross or      Navy Cross), Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, or      Purple Heart; former prisoners of war who die on or after      November 30, 1993; the President or any former President;      members of the Guard or Reserves who served on active duty,      who are eligible for retirement, but who have not yet      retired; the spouse, surviving spouse, minor child and at the      discretion of the Superintendent of Arlington, and certain      unmarried adult children. Veterans who do not meet these      requirements might qualify for the placement of their      cremated remains in Arlington's columbarium.       H.R. 4940 would also provide the President the authority to      grant a waiver for burial at Arlington in the case of an      individual not otherwise eligible for burial under the      criteria outlined above but whose acts, service, or      contributions to the Armed Forces were so extraordinary as to      justify burial at Arlington. The President would be allowed      to delegate the waiver authority only to the Secretary of the      Army.       H.R. 4940 would codify existing regulatory eligibility for      interment of cremated remains in the columbarium at Arlington      (generally, this includes all veterans with honorable service      and their dependents), clarify that only memorials honoring      military service may be placed at Arlington and set a 25-year      waiting period for such memorials, and clarify that in the      case of individuals buried in Arlington before the date of      enactment, the surviving spouse is deemed to be eligible if      buried in the same gravesite.     Senate bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision. Increase of Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance (``VMLI'') Coverage to                                 $150,000     Current law       Section 2106(b) of title 38, United States Code, provides      that VMLI may not exceed $90,000.     House bill       Section 5(a) of H.R. 4085 would increase the maximum amount      of coverage available under Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance      from $90,000 to $150,000. This would increase the amount of      the outstanding mortgage, which would be payable if the      veteran were to die before the mortgage is paid in full.     Senate bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.Uniform Home Loan Guaranty Fees for Qualifying Members of the Selected                     Reserve and Active Duty Veterans     Current law       Section 3729(b) of title 38, United States Code, provides      the amounts in fees to be collected from each person      participating in VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program. Currently,      members of the Selected Reserve pay a 0.75 percent higher      funding fee under the home loan program than other eligible      veterans.     House bill       Section 4 of H.R. 4085 would amend the Loan Fee Table in      section 3729(b) of title 38, United States Code, to provide      for uniformity in the funding fees charged to members of the      Selected Reserve and active duty veterans for VA home      loans. The fee would be reduced for the period beginning      on October 1, 2002, and ending on September 30, 2005.     Senate bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.    Prohibit Assignment of Monthly Veterans Benefits and Create an  Education and Outreach Campaign About Financial Services Available to                                 Veterans     Current law       Section 5301 of title 38, United States Code, currently      prohibits the assignment or attachment of a veteran's      disability compensation or pension benefits. In recent years,      private companies have offered contracts to veterans that      exchange up-front lump sums for future benefits.     Senate bill       Section 105 of S. 2237 would clarify the applicability of      the prohibition on assignment of veterans benefits through      agreements regarding future receipt of compensation, pension,      or dependency and indemnity compensation. This provision      would make violation of this prohibition punishable by a fine      and up to one year in jail.       This provision would also require VA to create a five-year      education and outreach campaign to inform veterans about      available financial services.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.Clarification of Retroactive Application of Provisions of the Veterans                          Claims Assistance Act     Current law       Public Law 106-475, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of      2000 (``VCAA''), restored and enhanced VA's duty to assist      claimants in developing their claims for veterans benefits.      Specifically, section 3(a) of the VCAA requires VA to take      certain steps to assist claimants.       Two recent decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the      Federal Circuit have found that the provisions in the VCAA      pertaining to VA's duty to assist cannot be applied      retroactively to claims pending at the time of its enactment.      In Dyment v. Principi, 287 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the      Federal Circuit stated: ``The Supreme Court has held that a      federal statute will not be given retroactive effect unless      Congress has made its contrary intention clear. There is      nothing in the VCAA to suggest that section 3(a) was intended      to applied [sic] retroactively.'' In Bernklau v. Principi,      291 F.3d 795, 806 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the Court again      concluded: ``[S]ection 3(a) of the VCAA does not apply      retroactively to require that proceedings that were complete      before the Department of Veterans Affairs and were on appeal      to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims or this court be      remanded for readjudication under the new statute.''     Senate bill       Section 504 of S. 2237 would apply section 3 of VCAA      retroactively to cases that were ongoing either at various      adjudication levels within VA or pending at the applicable      Federal courts prior to the date of VCAA's enactment. Section      505 of the Senate Bill would provide for claims decided      between the handing down of the Dyment case and enactment of      this provision to receive the full notice, assistance, and      protection afforded under the VCAA.     House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.
