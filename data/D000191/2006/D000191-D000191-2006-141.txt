  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, the view from the country club is great. We have heard a few Republicans waxing poetic about how good the economy is. Jobs, prosperity, happy days are here again. All due to the tax cuts.  There is a real result to the tax cuts. Last year we had the largest deficit in the history of the United States. We borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars and we are going to hand the bill only to people who work for wages and salary, who generally earn less than $100,000 a year, and to their kids and grandkids.  The wealthy should not pay any portion of that in their version of America because they are the wealth generators. The fourth increase in the national debt since George Bush took office; 60 percent increase in the national debt. That is the result of their tax cut policies.  And wages, they have not budged: 99 percent of the people in America working for wages and salaries saw their real incomes decline last year. One percent did well, those $300,000 and up, and $1.3 million and up, they did great. And those are the folks they were having lunch with when they heard how great the economy is in America. I wonder who picked up the tab.                          ____________________
