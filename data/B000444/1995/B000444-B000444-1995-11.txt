 President, today the Senate is holding a memorial service to remember Rev. Richard C. Halverson, our friend and our Chaplain from 1981 to March of this year, who passed away two weeks ago after a long illness. To each of us, whatever our individual religious beliefs, Reverend Halverson was someone special. To some of us, he was a confidant; to others, a counselor; and to still others, a pastor in the more traditional sense of the word. To each of us, he was a friend.  The Senate is, in many ways, a small community with many of the same dynamics inherent in small communities across our Nation. We work in close quarters and all know each other very well. Each of us have forged great friendships here, and each of us has seen great rivalries develop among colleagues. We are all public figures whose lives are all too often an open book. We come from widely different backgrounds, and each of us brings to the Senate a different set of values we hold dearly and ideals to which we are firmly and determinedly committed. And out of all of that, out of all the differing backgrounds and competing philosophies, out of the individual strengths and weaknesses, and out of the personal friendships and political rivalries, this community of one hundred men and women must produce public policy that ensures the well-being of more than two hundred and fifty million of our fellow Americans. That is an awesome responsibility.  As much as any of us, Reverend Halverson understood both the sense of community and the awesome responsibility of the Senate. Each morning, in his opening prayer, he would try to remind us that the sense of community, collegiality, and comity that has always been the trademark of this body is vitally important to carrying out the tasks that are demanded of us. He would remind us that the Senator on the other side of a heated debate is just as committed a public servant as we are. That no political party has a monopoly on compassion, or patriotism, or integrity. That the American Dream is neither conservative nor liberal. And that at the end of the day that sense of community, as Senators and as Americans, must prevail if we are to meet the responsibilities that have been entrusted to us.  Reverend Halverson understood that as Senators, our lives--official and often personal--are open to more scrutiny than most Americans would tolerate. He understood that not only our votes and our speeches, but our families and our lifestyles are often open to public review. As public officials we have accepted that. Nonetheless, Reverend Halverson understood that that scrutiny does take a human toll, reminding us that as we would like to be treated with understanding, so we must be understanding ourselves. And reminding us that for all of the public scrutiny of our lives and our conduct, for all of the public criticism that we sometimes receive for our votes and our political and philosophical beliefs, for all of the questioning of our motives that we must sometimes endure, the work that we do is so important to so many people that we must persevere.  Reverend Halverson always understood that election to public office does not take away the pressures that face every other American man and woman; work-related stress, family concerns, health concerns, or the self-questioning that every individual faces from time to time throughout their lives. Similarly, he understood that election to public office does not bestow skills or talents that we did not possess before; nor does it eradicate any personal weaknesses we possessed before our election. But Reverend Halverson was always there to remind us that deep within each of us is the ability to meet every challenge that our careers and our lives present.  A few years ago, I was quite ill. I left here one February night with a headache and did not return until late in the summer. During those months, as he was during all of his 14 years here, Reverend Halverson was there for me. I have never forgotten that, and my family has never forgotten that.  Throughout his 14 years as the Senate Chaplain Rev. Richard C. Halverson was a committed public servant and a friend to each of us. We shall miss him.                          ____________________
