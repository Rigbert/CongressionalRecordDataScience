President, for about 20 years now, I have viewed the development and deployment of a layered ballistic missile defense shield as probably singularly the most vital thing we could be doing around here. People are aware of that now. Adversaries, like North Korea and others, have ballistic missiles, and they are increasing their range capability. Iran is getting almost everything. One of the problems you have is that you get countries like North Korea developing missile capabilities, and if they have it, then other adversaries have it. I am talking about Yemen and all the rest of them.  It is important for us to communicate to the American people that thethreat we face is probably the most imminent threat we have had in the history of this country. Today, it is the greatest threat we have had certainly in my lifetime.  I have come to the floor and spoken on this issue in 2001, 2009, 2012, and this will be the fourth time this year. Over the last 30 years, we have witnessed the missile defense programs go through dramatic investment periods, followed by extreme starvation and cancellations--I am talking about in the United States--depending on who happens to be President at the time.  Remember, of course, when Reagan came in and people made fun of him with ``Star Wars'' and tried to defame him in any way they could. Yet he was able to be persistent and start a program, and we should be very thankful we have it today. That was followed in 1989 by President Bush. He continued that program.  However, in 1993, when President Clinton was in office, the first thing he did was to cut $2.5 billion out of the Bush missile defense budget request for fiscal year 1994. He also terminated the Reagan-Bush Strategic Defense Initiative and downgraded the National Missile Defense Program to a research and development program. He cut 5-year missile defense funding by 54 percent, from $39 billion to $18 billion.  I say this because these times are changing. Continuing with his administration in 1996, he cut the funding and slowed down the development of THAAD and the Navy Theater Wide Systems. To remind ourselves of how important that was at that time and the cuts he made to that and how critical that was, THAAD right now is the only thing we have to join forces with South Korea to be able to knock down something coming from North Korea to South Korea. The Aegis system is a defensive system that we could share with Japan. Without these systems, they would be wide open. That was 1996.  In 1999, the last of the Clinton years, he delayed by at least 2 years the Space Based Infrared System, which is a very complicated system that knocks down incoming missiles. Then, in 2000, Bush came in. By the end of 2008, President Bush had succeeded in fielding a missile defense system capable of defending all 50 States. One of the things he did that was most significant--and this is in the final years of his administration--was to recognize the fact that we have had ground-based interceptors in our country for a number of years. In fact, there are 44 ground-based interceptor systems. Unfortunately, they are all on the west coast because that is where we thought the threat would be. We discovered at that time, during the Bush administration, that the threat was from both sides because we recognized that Iran was developing the capabilities, as well as North Korea and others. So in order to protect Eastern United States as well as Central Europe, we had the system that was set up. It was kind of funny because I remember being there with one of our strongest allies. The system they set up was one where they had a radar system in the Czech Republic, and they had a rocket system--a ground-based interceptor--in Poland, right next door. I remember when Vaclav Klaus was the President of the Czech Republic, one of our strongest supporters, and he said to me at that time: Now, if we go ahead and put our system in the Czech Republic and in Poland, can you assure me that if we incur the wrath of Russia, we are not going to end up being embarrassed and have the rug pulled out from under us?  I said: There is not a chance in the world that would happen.  Well, that did happen. In fact, it was a total of 44 ground-based interceptors that were fielded. That was in Alaska and California, on the west coast. We went through this where they pulled the rug out from under Poland, as well as the Czech Republic. Then, in April, came our first Obama defense cuts, which began disarming America and dismantling our layered missile defense system. This is critical because we put this in for the reason that we perceived the threat to be coming in from the east as opposed to the west coast, and the very system that would have protected us was taken down by President Obama.  I would say, due to his overall reduced budget requests in defense, there were not enough Aegis ships. I already mentioned how we are using those today in defense of many of our allies, including Japan. Since Kim Jong Un took power in 2009, he has already conducted more than 80 ballistic missile tests. That is far more than his father and his grandfather conducted.  North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests of increasingly powerful weapons. The latest test was in September of last year. The major test actually came after that, and that was on November 28. On November 28, he demonstrated that he had the range of the United States and the central part of our country. In other words, it was stated by others who observed that he now has the capability of reaching any target in mainland United States.  There were some scientists who did an analysis of what they did on November 28. They made it very clear. David Wright, an analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote that--this is something that happened on November 29--that yesterday's test indicates that North Korea can now hold the United States well within missile range. He said: ``Such a missile would have been more than enough range to reach Washington, DC, and in fact any other part of the continental United States.''  Here is the scary part of this. Those who are not wanting to believe that the threat is real and the threat is there are saying: Well, we don't know that the missile he demonstrated on November 28 could have reached that range if it had a full payload, a load of a nuclear warhead.  We don't know if they had one or not, but that doesn't give me much comfort. They also questioned whether or not it could sustain the reentry back into the atmosphere.  The point is that they now have that capability, and that is something we have to keep in mind as we are making decisions, because we have decisions to make, and that is what we are doing right now in trying to decide how we are going to keep the government from shutting down and develop some kind of a budget plan that is going to serve us well.                               Tax Reform  Mr. President, let me mention something else that I think is very significant because I heard today a lot of people criticizing and not really understanding what happened with the tax plan that was passed. We are already getting the results of it. It is kind of exciting. I don't recall anything in my career where we got the results as quickly as we got and we are getting right now. We heard Minority Leader Schumer call the tax plan ``a punch in the gut to the middle class.'' In an op-ed piece in the New York Times, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders said: ``The Republican agenda on health care and taxes is . . . widely disliked by the American people'' and a ``tax giveaway to the wealthy.''  I think it is important that people understand that not only is middle-class America going to benefit from this, but they already have. One million Americans are counting on receiving raises and bonuses from this tax reform. In my State of Oklahoma, thousands of employees will be receiving and have already received large compensation increases, bonuses--Express Employment Professionals in Oklahoma City, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and AT&T. In fact, Senator Roy Blunt was coming back on a plane, the same one I was on, and the flight attendant was talking about how she had already received a $1,000 bonus. Then, the rest of them chimed in and said: We have too.  That is already happening. Right now we have a list of 123 major corporations that have already given an average of $1,000 for every employee they have, predicated on the assumption that the tax plan is going to increase the economy, and that is exactly what is going to happen.  I am confident that this is actually happening today. I have to say this, though, because more people still try to say: Well, we can't give tax reductions to people and still increase revenue to do all of these things we need to do with our national defense and with our infrastructure programs.  That is not true.  I am going to repeat one that I have done before on this, but people seem to not understand. It is easy to say: Well, if you reduce taxes, you are going to reduce revenue.  That is not the way it works. I remember very well what happened. I was not in this position, of course, but in 1991, when Ronald Reagan was President, at that time he had the most far-reaching reduction in taxes. Remember, the top rate was reduced from 70 percent to 30 percent, and the other brackets came down proportionately. Yet at the time he did that, in 1981, the total amount of revenue coming into the United States was $469 billion. As a result of that, it increased revenue to $750 billion. That is huge, and it shows that it really happens. The reason it happens is that for each 1-percent increase in the economy, it produces increased revenue of some $3 trillion. That is what happened then, and that is what is going to happen now. People are rejoicing today.  I ask unanimous consent that a sheet that outlines all of these companies that are giving large bonuses as a result of the tax bill be printed in the Record.

Zions Bancorp                    tax relief pays american workers       Almost immediately after Congress passed the Tax Cuts and      Jobs Act, American workers at dozens of firms began to see      the effects in the form of bonuses and raises. For supporters      of tax relief this was good news, though not altogether a      surprise. During debate over the law, economists cited      research that workers bear most of the burden of the      corporate income tax via reduced wages. The remainder is      borne by consumers and investors. A significant cut in the      corporate rate would provide real benefits to workers.       One study by scholars at the American Enterprise Institute      concluded that a 1 percent increase in the corporate tax rate      is associated with a 0.5 percent decrease in real wages. A      2007 Treasury Department survey of economic studies found      that workers ``bear a substantial burden'' of the corporate      income tax. The Congressional Budget Office concluded in 2006      that workers pay more than 70 percent of the cost of      corporate taxes.       Opponents of tax relief countered that a corporate rate cut      would help only the wealthy--a claim being knocked down more      each day. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that ``history      shows tax cuts like these benefit the wealthy and the      powerful to the exclusion of the middle class.'' As a wave of      companies across the country began announcing bonuses and      giving raises to workers, it became clear that tax relief is      putting more money in the pockets of the hard-working      Americans who Republicans said would win because of the law.       The same day the House and Senate passed the bill, December      20, AT&T Inc. issued a press release saying: ``Once tax      reform is signed into law, AT&T plans to invest an additional      $1 billion in the United States in 2018 and pay a special      $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 AT&T U.S. employees--all      union-represented, non-management and front-line managers. If      the President signs the bill before Christmas, employees will      receive the bonus over the holidays.''       So far, at least 123 companies have announced they are      giving employees bonuses or otherwise increasing compensation      due to the tax cut legislation. Notable examples include:       American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and JetBlue      announced $1,000 bonuses for their employees (a total of more      than 200,000 people). American's bonuses will exclude      officers; Southwest's and JetBlue's include all employees.      American said it would pay bonuses ``in light of this new tax      structure.'' JetBlue said that ``our Crewmembers should be      the first to benefit.'' Southwest said it would put the      savings from tax relief ``to work . . . to reward our hard-     working Employees.''       AT&T announced $1,000 bonuses to its 200,000 employees. It      also said that it will increase capital expenditures by $1      billion in 2018.       Comcast announced a $1,000 bonus for more than 100,000      employees. In addition, it plans to invest $50 billion in its      infrastructure in the next five years. Comcast said the      bonuses are ``[b]ased on the passage of tax reform and the      FCC's action on broadband.''       Nationwide Insurance announced a $1,000 bonus for 29,000      employees and increased 401(k) matching. The company told its      employees: ``The combination of the new tax legislation,      including a reduced corporate tax rate, and our associates'      ongoing commitment to our members, community and On Your Side      promise are the reasons we're making this investment that      further enhances the already robust benefits we offer to      attract and retain the best talent.''       PNC Financial Services announced $1,000 bonuses for 47,500      employees as well as $1,500 to be added to existing pension      accounts. The company also will raise its base pay rate to      $15 per hour. PNC's CEO said: ``The tax reform law creates an      opportunity to reward our employees who are working hard each      day to serve our customers, build strong relationships in our      communities and create long-term value for our      shareholders.''       U.S. Bank announced a $1,000 bonus for nearly 60,000      employees and enhanced health care offerings in the 2019      enrollment period. It will also raise base pay rate to $15      per hour. The bank said that these decisions were ``a result      of the tax reform package.''
