President, I rise today to introduce the Fisheries Management Fairness Act in order to provide New England fishermen with a guarantee that the fisheries management decisions that affect their lives will not be made without the benefit of sound, reliable data.  Fishing is more than just a profession in New England. Fishing is a way of life. This way of life is being threatened, however, by excessive regulations and unnecessary litigation. Despite scientific evidence of a rebound in fish stocks, fishermen are suffering under ever more burdensome restrictions. As a result of recent litigation, fishermen have seen their days at sea slashed, struggle to implement new gear changes, and are squeezed into ever smaller fishing areas.  Everyday, I hear from fishermen who struggle to support their families because they have been deprived of their right to make an honest living on the seas. The ``working waterfronts'' of our communities are in danger of disappearing, likely to be replaced by tourism and development. Once the culture of fishing is lost, it will be all but impossible ti replace.  On September 11, 2002, the National Marine Fisheries Service announced that the trawler gear used on the NOAA research vessel Albatross IV had been calibrated incorrectly, casting suspicion over the data it had collected since February of 2000. The miscalibrated gear had been used to conduct the last eight stock abundance surveys, which measure long-term increases and decreases in stock populations.  Data gathered by these surveys are the basis for regulations in fisheries management plans governing the rebuilding of overfished stocks. These regulations take the form of ``amendments'' to the New England's overall groundfish management plan, covering a complex of thirteen groundfish species. Amendment 13, the next set of regulations, is supposed to be ready for implementation by August 22, 2003.  Although the National Marine Fisheries Service has conducted an observation cruise and a performance review workshop with industry to examine the extent of the damage in the survey, the agency has concluded that additional research is required to determine the full extent of the damage caused by the flawed gear. The Service has pledged to conduct a ``short-term experiment'' to determine the extent of the damage to the survey. This short-term experiment will rely on video and sensor equipment to gather data, and a subsequent workshop to examine the data and produce a report that can be used in updating groundfish assessments.  It is unlikely that this experiment will provide the quality of data necessary to develop Amendment 13 by its court-ordered deadline. The type of data necessary to develop fisheries management plans can be produced only after years of research that demonstrate long-term stock trends. Theoretical modeling of past data of questionable quality is simply not good enough to develop the regulations of a plan that will affect the survival of our fishermen.  When fishermen's livelihoods depend on the quality of survey data, we owe it to them to get the data collection right. There is no room for second-rate science and faulty data.  My bill addresses these problems by preventing Amendment 13 from being implemented for two years, enough time to allow the Northeast Fishery Science Center and the National Marine Fishery Center to determine the reliability of the data collected by the Albatross IV and to collect accurate data on which to base future amendments.  I will not stand idly by and let New England's fishing community die without a fight. I pledge to work with my colleagues in the Senate to work to pass this legislation. If we cannot pass it as a rider to another bill during this session, then I plan to reintroduce it and fight for its passage when we reconvene next year.                          ____________________
