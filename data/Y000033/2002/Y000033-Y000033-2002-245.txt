Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation to expand AlaskaNative contracting of Federal land management functions and activities and to promote hiring of Alaska Natives by the Federal Government within the State of Alaska.  The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) was enacted on December 2, 1980 as Public Law 96-487. Since then, Congress has passed several public laws which have amended ANILCA. The 1980 ANILCA amendments expanded the federal refuge and park systems in Alaska for the purposes of protecting habitat for fish and wildlife, to conserve fish and wildlife populations, and to provide the continued opportunity for subsistence uses by local Alaska Native residents and to protect archaeological sites associated with Alaska Native cultures.  Many rural Alaska native communities are located within close proximity of the refuges and serve an important part of the culture and ways of Alaska natives and other residents in rural Alaska. Congress, through sections 1307 and 1308 of the 1980 ANILCA amendments, directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish programs whereby Alaska natives were to be given preference in hiring, and to establish programs whereby Native lands were given preference for siting of conservation service unit facilities. The provisions also recognized that the Natives whose front and back yards were now part of the federal parks and preserves systems were the best individuals to be involved in the administering of the lands because of their special knowledge or expertise concerning the natural or cultural resources of such areas.  Public Law 106-488 authorized demonstration projects in four areas in northwest Alaska: (1) Bering Land Bridge National Preserve (2) Cape Krusentern National Monument (3) Kobuk Valley National Park and (4) Noatak National Preserve in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. No demonstration project has been entered in either fiscal years 2000 or 2001 with the above named four areas at the Department of the Interior.  It has been twenty two (22) years since the 1980 ANILCA amendments were enacted, and the contracting and native hires provisions remain unfulfilled by the Department of the Interior. This bill would remedy this by directing the Department of the Interior to enter into demonstration projects with no less than six eligible Alaska Native tribes or tribal organizations in fiscal years 2003 and 2004.  This bill is a result of the legislative council of the Alaska Federation of Natives to address the contracting and hiring preference for Alaska native entities pursuant to the 1980 ANILCA amendments.                          ____________________
