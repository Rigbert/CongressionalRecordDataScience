President, first, let me say how refreshing it is to hear the Senator from Alabama, as scary as it is, to tell the truth about the problem we have. When I tell people back in my State of Oklahoma--I refresh their memories. I remember in 1996 standing at this podium--right here--when the Clinton budget came out for fiscal year 1996. It was a $1.5 trillion budget. I said a $1.5 trillion budget is impossible to sustain. And yet the budget the Senator from Alabama was talking about was the budget of this President--and, of course, with a majority in the House and the Senate--that actually has a deficit that is greater than the entire budgets around the entire United States of America in 1996. That is the deficit. That is what my 20 kids and grandkids are going to have to pay for.  When you use statements that are real and cannot be denied--and that is, that this President in the 2 years he has been here has increased the debt more than all the Presidents before him, from George Washington to George W. Bush--it is not believable. That is what makes it so difficult because people think: How can this possibly be? And yet, it is. That is the reality.                          ____________________
