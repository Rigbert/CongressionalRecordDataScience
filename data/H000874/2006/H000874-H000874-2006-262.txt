Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleagues, Representatives Inslee, Jones and Van Hollen, which would prohibit the use of funds in this bill to be expended on specific elements of the National Security Personnel System.  In February, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ruled that the Department of Defense, in establishing a rule to execute the National Security Personnel System, had failed to ensure the rights of the approximately 700,000 civilian employees of the Department of Defense.  Specifically, the judge determined that the rule:  Fails to ensure that employees can bargain collectively.  Does not meet Congress's requirement for ``Independent Third Party Review'' of labor relations decisions.  And that the process for appealing adverse actions fails to provide employees with the ``Fair Treatment'' required by the Congress.  Yet, despite the decision, the department has proceeded with the implementation of the rule.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply ensures that the Department of Defense will not continue to pursue a policy that is clearly against the law and against the best interests of our national security.  I commend the gentlemen for their continued efforts on behalf of our Federal employees and urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.
