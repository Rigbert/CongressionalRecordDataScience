King and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) to end racism and bigotry across this country.  We had nearly 20 Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle that traveled to Selma and Birmingham and Montgomery. What I would like to do is ask all of my colleagues who are here to take various stations and we could have a conversation on the floor without the formal proceeding of yielding to other Members.  Madam Speaker, I guess I should first recognize my good friend and brother, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), elected the same year as I, who helped lead us on that march, as we didlast year as well, giving so many of us the experience of walking in the shoes of those that had gone before. It was an experience that I have to say I will never forget.
