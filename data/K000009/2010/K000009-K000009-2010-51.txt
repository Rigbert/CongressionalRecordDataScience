 I think it's important to state that at the beginning of the financial crisis, these large institutions, the six of them that are the most culpable--JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley,HSBC, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs--had one-third of the capital in this country, one-third of the assets in those institutions. And while they were taking all those bonuses and while this Nation has gone through this terrible washout, they now command 66 percent. They doubled the size and their importance inside this economy.  So while they're taking those horrendous bonuses, they've also been gobbling up institutions. States like my own are losing their money center banks. The fees that banks that didn't do anything wrong are having to pay have gone up extraordinarily. We don't know if some of them will make it. But they are just huge leviathans that are taking over this economy, and look at what they've done.
