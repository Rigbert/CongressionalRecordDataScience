 President, I will be very, very brief. This is a rerun of the amendment by my distinguished friend from Virginia, Senator Warner. This isa means by which to artificially delay any new decision relative to new entrants. We already have the strategic concept that contemplated and reflected the changes that took place in 1991. You all voted 90 to 6 last night on the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, laying out in detail what must be taken into consideration by the United States of America to sign on any new strategic concept. This is, in fact, not necessary. It is not needed, and it is an unnecessary delay. So I am prepared--if my colleague will yield the remainder of his time, I will yield the remainder of mine and I am ready to vote.  I urge you all to vote no.
