 President, today the Senate will vote on cloture on the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. I will again oppose invoking cloture on the nomination, and I will explain why.  In short, Ms. Halligan's record of advocacy and her activist view of the judiciary lead me to conclude she would bring that activism right to the court. As I have said many times before, the role of a judge in our system is to determine what the law says, not what they or anybody else wants it to be. That is not Ms. Halligan's view of the courts. She views them as a means to ``enable enviable social progress and mobility''--to ``enable enviable social progress and mobility'' with the judges, not the American people, using their office to determine what ``progress'' is ``enviable.'' That is the view of Ms. Halligan.  When she was in a position of authority, she put that activist view into practice time and time again. On the subject of second amendment rights, Ms. Halligan, as solicitor general of New York, advanced the dubious legal theory that those who make firearms should be liable for the criminal acts of third parties who misuse them.  Imposing potentially massive tort liability against the makers of a lawful product because of the criminal acts of someone else did not seem much like ``enviable social progress'' to Randall Casseday, who is with Kahr Arms, which sells firearms to the New York City Police Department. Here is what he said:       I can't see how Kahr Arms can be responsible for misuse of      its product. I don't see how you can do that. One lawsuit      would put us out of business.  Fortunately, the State court in New York followed the law and rejected Ms. Halligan's entreaty that it make up new law in order to achieve the so-called social progress she envisioned.
