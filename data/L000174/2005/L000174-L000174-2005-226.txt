President, first, I note my dear friend of over 30 years, the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, is in the chair, the President pro tempore of the Senate. I note that the President pro tempore showed his usual courtesy, instead of taking the chair initially to open the session, as he would, to allow me to do so to introduce my brother-in-law, Father Claude Pomerleau.  I also note that our distinguished Chaplain, Dr. Barry Black, is here. I thank the Chaplain for his cooperation in making sure that Father Pomerleau could open the session.  Of course, I thank the distinguished majority leader, Senator Frist, and the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Reid.  Mr. President, I note that Father Pomerleau is a very close member of our family. He is probably not used to hearing me call him Father Pomerleau; it has always been Claude. He was on the altar--not yet a priest but in the seminary--when my wife Marcelle and I were married slightly over 43 years ago. And 40 years ago this December, the two of us were able to be with hiswonderful parents, Phil and Cecile Pomerleau, at his ordination in Rome--a very proud time for his parents, certainly a proud time for Claude, but also a very proud time for Marcelle and me.  He has been, in many ways, our spiritual light and friend all these years. He is very much a brother to me, as he is to Marcelle. I have had the privilege one other time to have him as visiting Chaplain. And in my 31 years in the Senate, those two times stand out as highlights in my career.  So again I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska for showing his usual courtesy, and, of course, I cherish our friendship of over three decades.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.
