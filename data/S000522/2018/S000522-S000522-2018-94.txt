Mr. Speaker, yesterday we marked up H.R. 5129, the Global Food Security Reauthorization Act of 2018. I'd like to thank Chairman Royce, for his leadership on global food security, including in particular for his original cosponsorship of this reauthorization as well as the original Global Food Security Act, and his agreeing to move this bill to markup so rapidly.  The original Global Food Security Act promoted food security, resilience and nutrition in developing countries in keeping with U.S. national security interests. Through agriculture-led economic development, GFSA has strengthened partner countries' capacity and lessened their dependence on emergency food assistance. It has also improved efficiency among federal departments and agencies and leveraged the participation of other non-U.S. governmental partners.  I should be restated that GFSA's legacy as a bipartisan success story--legislation which solidified in law a policy that had its roots in the Bush Administration, was amplified by President Obama and is now being implemented by President Trump.  Now is the time to reauthorize this landmark legislation. H.R. 5129 builds upon the Global Food Security Act of 2016, which formally codified the Feed the Future Initiative and was signed into law with overwhelming bipartisan support in July 2016, by reauthorizing the program for two years--per the Amendment you have before you--through 2020.  Crucially, this reauthorization bill emphasizes the importance of deworming initiatives. Among the neglected tropical diseases, intestinal worms account for nearly eighty percent of NTD prevalence, affecting close to one billion people the world over. These worms undercut our nutrition interventions, and can lead to death by malnutrition or lifelong stunting. We need to combine our nutrition interventions not only with a coordinated deworming campaign, but also with Water Sanitation Health interventions that change people's behavior. WaSH training helps ensure people limit exposure to worms, such as by washing and peeling vegetables or something as simple as giving children shoes to wear so if they trod on worm-infected soil they don't get sick again. We are trying to feed the future, not feed the worms.  We will also rectify an oversight by including the Inter-American Foundation in the interagency initiative on Food Security. IAF does development right, in particular working with small holder farmers while keeping bureaucratic overhead low.  That we are here reauthorizing the Global Food Security Act is a testament to the dedication of numerous committed groups outside Congress that have made food security and nutrition their priority, from advocates to implementers--especially and including faith-based organizations who perhaps work the closest to the small-holder farmers and women who benefit in particular from our food security efforts. I thank them for their support and look forward to working with them more in this process.  I'd also like to compliment our federal agencies tasked with implementing the GFSA--in particular USAID under the leadership of Beth Dunford. The professionalism and dedication of Beth and many others is critical to the overall success of the program.  Finally, I would like to thank Rep. Betty McCollum for again being the lead cosponsor on this critical, bipartisan legislation, as well as to thank original cosponsor Ranking Member Engel and the Ranking member of our subcommittee, Karen Bass and others.                          ____________________
