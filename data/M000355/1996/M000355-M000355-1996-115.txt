  Let me read the quote. I have not shown her the language. She said that ``Foreign investment currently benefits only Burma's military.'' These are direct words from Aung San Suu Kyi. ``Foreign investment currently benefits only Burma's military rulers and some local interests but would not help improve the lot of the Burmese in general.'' She says, ``Investment made now is very much against the interests of the people of Burma.'' She said further, these are direct quotes in May 1996, this year: ``Burma is not developing in any way. Some people are getting very rich. That is not economic development.'' All of those are direct recent quotes.  I think it is safe to say that she hopes that we will begin these kinds of sanctions.  A further direct quote from the New York Times of July 19, 1996, direct quote: ``What we want are the kind of sanctions that will make it quite clear that economic change in Burma is not possible without political change.''  So I would say to my friend from Louisiana, the answer is no. I have not shown her the actual language. I am totally confident that she supports the approach that I have recommended.
