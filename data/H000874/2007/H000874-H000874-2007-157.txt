We don't intend to shut down government. I know that a number of Members on your side have indicated it's not their intention to shut down government. We, therefore, need to provide for an alternative which will provide for government to continue because, again, we are experiencing the same frustration you had, as you know, that while we have passed all 12 appropriation bills, that has not been the case in the Senate. The Senate has passed four of their appropriations bills. We haven't conferenced them yet, so that we are going to need a CR to continue government in operations, and I expect to have that on the floor next week.
