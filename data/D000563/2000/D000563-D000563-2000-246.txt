President, there are 44 million Americans without health insurance. Among uninsured workers, most of them work for small businesses. This amendment creates a tax credit for small businesses which will offer health insurance for their employees. The tax credits especially favor those businesses which have not offered it in the past. I think it is a good investment to help small businesses take care of their No. 1 concern: health insurance for the owners of the business, health insurance for the employees of the small business.  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this amendment.
