 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time to me.  Mr. Speaker, the most important economic issue facing this country is that the people on top, the wealthiest people, are becoming richer, the middle class is shrinking, and more and more of the new jobs that we are creating in this country are low-wage jobs paying people $4.25 an hour, $4.50 an hour, $5 an hour. The minimum wage today in terms of purchasing power is at its lowest point in 40 years.  Mr. Speaker, the American people want and the working people want to see a situation in which every working person in this country can work 40 hours a week and not live in poverty. It is incumbent upon this body to have an opportunity to vote for a clean up-or-down increase in the minimum wage.  Our Republican friends say the Democrats should have raised the minimum wage 2 years ago. They are right; they should have, and I had a bill in the hopper to do just that. But 2 years later means more and more people are living in poverty. Two years later means that today finally we should increase the minimum wage.
