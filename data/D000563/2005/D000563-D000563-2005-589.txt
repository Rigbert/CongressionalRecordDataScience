(2) The budget for fiscal year 2006 submitted to Congress      by the President on February 7, 2005, requests no funds for      fiscal year 2006 for ongoing military operations in Iraq or      Afghanistan.       (3) According to the Congressional Research Service, there      exists historical precedent for including the cost of ongoing      military operations in the annual budget requests of the      President following initial funding for such operations by      emergency or supplemental appropriations Acts, including--       (A) funds for Operation Noble Eagle, beginning in the      budget request of President George W. Bush for fiscal year      2005;       (B) funds for operations in Kosovo, beginning in the budget      request of President George W. Bush for fiscal year 2001;       (C) funds for operations in Bosnia, beginning in budget      request of President Clinton for fiscal year 1997;       (D) funds for operations in Southwest Asia, beginning in      the budget request of President Clinton for fiscal year 1997;       (E) funds for operations in Vietnam, beginning in the      budget request of President Johnson for fiscal year 1966; and       (F) funds for World War II, beginning in the budget request      of President Roosevelt for fiscal year 1943.       (4) In section 1024(b) of Emergency Supplemental      Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and      Tsunami Relief, 2005 (119 Stat. 252), the Senate requested      that the President submit to Congress, not later than      September 1, 2005, an amendment to the budget of the      President for fiscal year 2006 setting forth detailed cost      estimates for ongoing military operations overseas during      such fiscal year.       (5) The President has yet to submit such an amendment.       (6) The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006, as      reported to the Senate by the Committee on Appropriations of      the Senate on September 28, 2005, contains a bridge fund of      $50,000,000,000 for overseas contingency operations, but the      determination of that amount could not take into account any      Administration estimate on the projected cost of such      operations in fiscal year 2006.       (7) In February 2005, the Congressional Budget Office      estimated that fiscal year 2006 cost of ongoing military      operations in Iraq and Afghanistan could total      $85,000,000,000.       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) any request for funds for a fiscal year after fiscal      year 2006 for an ongoing military operation overseas,      including operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, should be      included in the annual budget of the President for such      fiscal year as submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of      title 31, United States Code;       (2) the amendment to the budget of the President for fiscal      year 2006, requested by the Senate to be submitted to      Congress not later than September 1, 2005, by section 1024(b)      of Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the      Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005, is necessary      to describe the anticipated use of the $50,000,000,000 bridge      fund appropriated in this Act and set forth all additional      appropriations that will be required for the fiscal year; and       (3) any funds provided for a fiscal year for ongoing      military operations overseas should be provided in      appropriations Acts for such fiscal year through      appropriations to specific accounts set forth in such      appropriations Acts.       Sec. 8127.

(2) The cost of the increase in such end strengths is      foreseeable and should be included in the annual budget of      the President for each fiscal year, as submitted to Congress      pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, in      order to provide a full and honest accounting to the American      people of the personnel costs of the Army and the Marine      Corps.

This clause      shall be subject to the availability of appropriations.       (ii) Youth organizations that cease to exist.--Clause (i)      shall not apply to any youth organization that ceases to      exist.       (iii) Waivers.--The head of a Federal agency may waive the      application of clause (i) to any youth organization with      respect to each conviction or investigation described under      subclause (I) or (II) for a period of not more than 2 fiscal      years if--       (I) any senior officer (including any member of the board      of directors) of the youth organization is convicted of a      criminal offense relating to the official duties of that      officer or the youth organization is convicted of a criminal      offense; or       (II) the youth organization is the subject of a criminal      investigation relating to fraudulent use or waste of Federal      funds.

(c) Support for Scout Jamborees.--       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (A) Section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the      United States commits exclusively to Congress the powers to      raise and support armies, provide and maintain a Navy, and      make rules for the government and regulation of the land and      naval forces.       (B) Under those powers conferred by section 8 of article I      of the Constitution of the United States to provide, support,      and maintain the Armed Forces, it lies within the discretion      of Congress to provide opportunities to train the Armed      Forces.       (C) The primary purpose of the Armed Forces is to defend      our national security and prepare for combat should the need      arise.       (D) One of the most critical elements in defending the      Nation and preparing for combat is training in conditions      that simulate the preparation, logistics, and leadership      required for defense and combat.       (E) Support for youth organization events simulates the      preparation, logistics, and leadership required for defending      our national security and preparing for combat.       (F) For example, Boy Scouts of America's National Scout      Jamboree is a unique training event for the Armed Forces, as      it requires the construction, maintenance, and disassembly of      a ``tent city'' capable of supporting tens of thousands of      people for a week or longer. Camporees at the United States      Military Academy for Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts provide      similar training opportunities on a smaller scale.       (2) Support.--Section 2554 of title 10, United States Code,      is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(i)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide at least      the same level of support under this section for a national      or world Boy Scout Jamboree as was provided under this      section for the preceding national or world Boy Scout      Jamboree.       ``(2) The Secretary of Defense may waive paragraph (1), if      the Secretary--       ``(A) determines that providing the support subject to      paragraph (1) would be detrimental to the national security      of the United States; and       ``(B) reports such a determination to the Congress in a      timely manner, and before such support is not provided.''.
