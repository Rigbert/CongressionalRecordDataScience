President, as National Immunization Week approaches, I rise today to introduce legislation addressing childhood immunizations. National Immunization Week (April 17-21) recognizes one of the most powerful health care and public health achievements in this century. Remarkable advances in the science of vaccine development and widespread immunization efforts have led to a substantial reduction in the incidence of infectious disease. Today, vaccination coverage is at record high levels. Smallpox has been eradicated; polio has been eliminated from the Western Hemisphere; and measles and Hib invasive disease, the leading cause of childhood meningitis and postnatal retardation, have been reduced to record lows.  The two bills I introduce today build on these successes. One proposal, ``The State Immunization Funding and Infrastructure Act of 2000,'' ensures that state and local health departments are adequately funded to continue successful efforts to immunize children and improve their ability to reach pockets of underimmunized populations. The other, ``The Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act of 2000,'' requires all health plans to cover recommended childhood and adolescent immunizations.  In spite of our successes, we must remain vigilant. Every day, nearly 11,000 infants are born and each baby will need up to 19 doses of vaccine by age two. New vaccines continue to enter the market. Although a significant proportion of the general population may be fully immunized at a given time, coverage rates in the United States are uneven and life-threatening disease outbreaks do occur. In fact, in many of the Nation's urban and rural areas, rates are unacceptably low and are actually declining.  Unfortunately, one of the areas most in need of attention is in my own home State of Illinois. Childhood immunization coverage rates in Chicago have dropped each year since 1996 when they peaked at 76 percent. The most recent National Immunization Survey indicates that Chicago's coverage rate is now 66.7 percent--one of the lowest rates in the United States. Coverage rates for African American children in Chicago are the worst in the Nation.  It is notable, however, that during this same period when Chicago has struggled to improve vaccination rates, Federal financial assistance to state and local health departments for immunization outreach activities has been significantly reduced. In 1999, Chicago received a 38 percent reduction in Federal funds for the operation of their immunization program. In 2000, Chicago suffered another 37.5 percent reduction. The State of Illinois suffered a 58 percent reduction in 1999 and a further 16 percent reduction in the year 2000. And the story in my State is not that different from other areas of the country. Federal support for vaccine delivery activities has declined by more than 30 percent since 1995.  Purchasing vaccines is not enough. The Section 317 immunization program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides grants to state and local public health departments for ``operations and infrastructure'' activities. These grants are a critical source of support, indeed the sole source of Federal support, for essential efforts to get children immunized. They fund immunization registries, provider education programs, outreach initiatives to parents, outbreak control, and linkages with other public health and welfare services. These grants get the vaccine from the warehouse to our children.  The State Immunization Funding And Infrastructure Act of 2000 authorizes an increase in Federal support for Section 317 grants to states by $75 million for a total of $214 in FY2001. This restores funding to the levels States and localities received in the mid-1990's and will help to stabilize many of the key functions that have been cut back in the face of steep funding reductions. In the past few years, many states have already had to reduce clinic hours, cancel contracts with providers, suspend registry development and implementation, limit outreach efforts and discontinue performance monitoring. The bill also provides a $20 million increase over last year's funding level ($10 million over the President's budget) for vaccine purchase. This will ensure that States are able to purchase adequate amounts of all currently licensed and recommended vaccines.  The other proposal I am introducing today, The Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act of 2000, will require that all health plans cover all immunizations in accordance with the most recent version of the Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These vaccinations must be provided without deductibles, coinsurance or other cost-sharing for all children and adolescents under the age of 19.  I was shocked to learn that, according to a recent survey of employer-sponsored health plans conducted by William M. Mercer, Inc. and Partnership for Prevention, one out of five employer-sponsored plans do not cover childhood immunizations and one out of four fail to cover adolescent immunizations. Not only is this a significant gap in our health system, but it is simply financially illogical. Childhood and adolescent immunizations have been proven to save money. They decrease the direct medical costs due to vaccine-preventable illnesses and reduce the time parents spend off the job, tending sick children.  I invite my colleagues to join me in these efforts to maintain and improve our nation's national immunization record and to ensure that all areas of the country and all populations benefit from the advances we have made over the last century. Despite remarkable progress, many challenges still face the U.S. vaccine delivery system. Approximately one million children are still not adequately immunized. Our infrastructure must be capable of successfully implementing an increasingly complex vaccination schedule. Pocketsof underserved children still leave us vulnerable to deadly disease outbreaks.                                 ______                                       By
