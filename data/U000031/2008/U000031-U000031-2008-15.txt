And let me just say one quick thing. When you look at oil shale and you look at tar sands, it takes a little bit of energy to then derive that oil from those bodies, the shale, the tar or the sand. Basically you have to heat it up. And for tar sands, the Canadians are producing literally one million barrels a day up in Alberta. And they are going to make that whether we are the buyer or not. To use the analogy of the Clampetts, and maybe they still have that technique back in Oklahoma and Texas, I see some of my colleagues, and I'll be careful, but the Clampetts, they put that pipe down and the oil came up. And it didn't take any energy to get it out of the ground.  Well it is different today. That easy energy is gone for the most part. So we have to do a lot of things. We have to inject carbon to bring it up. But in essence in Canada they have to have the heat to separate the oil from the sand, and then you have to refine it. And that takes a little bit more energy than the Clampetts, just to use that analogy.
