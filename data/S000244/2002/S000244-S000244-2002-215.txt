Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3988) to amend title 36, United States Code, to clarify the requirements for eligibility in the American Legion.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 3988       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY IN                    THE AMERICAN LEGION.       Section 21703(2) of title 36, United States Code, is      amended by inserting ``during or'' after ``continues to serve      honorably''.
