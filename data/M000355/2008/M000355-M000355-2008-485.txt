 President, reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent that the consent be modified so that if cloture is not invoked on the Finance amendment, that amendment be withdrawn and the Senate proceed to a vote on the McConnell-Stevens amendment regarding seniors, veterans, and illegal immigrants, and that following the disposition of these amendments, the bill, as amended, if amended, be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage.
