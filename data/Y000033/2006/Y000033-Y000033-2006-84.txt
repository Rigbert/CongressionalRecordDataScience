Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5689 amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Act: A Legacy for Users, or SAFETEA-LU, to make technical corrections. This bill was introduced by myself, Mr. Jim Oberstar of Minnesota, Mr. Peter DeFazio of Oregon and Mr. Petri from Wisconsin, who worked together on the development and passage of SAFETEA-LU authorization bill last year.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is necessary because the technical corrections included in this bill have been identified by the Department of Transportation and are mostly of a conforming nature, or correct drafting errors. The most important correction we are making is the strengthening of the Federal highway research program by ensuring the continuation of legacy research programs carried out by the Department of Transportation. This bill has been scored by CBO and has no budgetary impact.  Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
