 Senator Frist has said it very well. Mr. President, and colleagues, all we want to do under Ed-Flex is to make sure that these dollars get into the classroom to help poor kids and not get chewed up by bureaucratic redtape.  Ed-Flex is not a block grant program. It is not a voucher kind of scheme. The people who are advocating Ed-Flex in my home State of Oregon do not want a Federal education program to go away. Quite the contrary, they want those programs. They know that we need those dollars to serve low-income students. What we want is, we want some freedom from some of the Federal water torture and bureaucratic redtape that so often keeps us from using those dollars to better serve the poor.  I would just hope, Mr. President, and colleagues, that during the course of the afternoon colleagues look at the requirements that protect the poor families and the poor children that cannot be waived under the Ed-Flex statute. Specifically, it is not possible to get a waiver if you are trying to waive the underlying programs of each of the critical services that is made possible under title I. You cannot do it. And as I stated earlier, you can only use those dollars in a low-income school district; you cannot move those dollars out of a low-income school district and take them somewhere else.  So there is a reason for the Governors and all of the Democratic Governors supporting this legislation. I happen to have some sympathy for the Senator from Minnesota about the need for additional dollars for a variety of human services. But the best way to win support for that additional funding is to show that you are using existing dollars well and effectively. That is what Ed-Flex does.  I am very pleased to have had a chance to team up with Senator Frist of Tennessee who has worked very hard to bring both parties together. And I thank the Senator from Vermont for the time.  I yield the floor, Mr. President.
