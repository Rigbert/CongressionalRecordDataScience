We did nothing for 34 years, and now we have 16 more applications on file which would be for 26 nuclear reactors. Some applications cover more than one reactor. These efforts to develop new plants are critical to meeting our energy needs, and I am committed to doing what I can to help build these new plants.  One of the most significant factors contributing to this revitalization is the NRC's transformation over the last 12 years. In 1997, Republicans were the majority. I was the chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which had jurisdiction over nuclear energy. At that time, we had not had an oversight hearing in some 12 years, and I tell you, you cannot let a bureaucracy continue to operate without any oversight, so we started having oversight hearings. We gave targets that they had to do certain things by certain dates. As a result of that, they are now coming along and doing a good job.  This chart shows where the 16 applications are, so people can find their own State and see what it would do to the economy of their own State. Unfortunately, we don't have any in my State of Oklahoma. I wish we did and perhaps we will be able to in the future.  The next chart is the ``Applications Under Review By NRC.'' It is a little bit complicated, so I am not going to be using this chart. If anyone wants to know where the status is and what the companies are that have made the applications, certainly we have that information for them.  Despite significant efforts on the part of the NRC staff, this process has not unfolded as smoothly as it should. Schedules are not as detailed or transparent as they should be, and detailed schedules are a critical tool for managing such a large and complex process and to ensure it is thorough, efficient, and timely. Schedules are publicly available for safety evaluation reports and environmental impact statements but not for hearings or Commission consideration, which will ultimately determine when the license is actually issued.  At this time, there appears to be no information readily available regarding any of the actual dates that any of the new plant licenses will be issued. The absence of any specific schedules for issuing licenses seems to indicate a failure of the agency to properly plan and schedule its work, a failure to share such information, or both. This situation is troubling. How could a utility prepare for construction without a firm date when it can expect--be expected to receive their license?  These are huge investments we are talking about. There has to be predictability. How can an investor judge the risk of a project without being able to evaluate progress in the regulatory process? Both licensees and their potential investors would greatly benefit from the increased certainty.  I commend the Commission and staff for the level of effort that is reflected in existing schedules. However, I believe the Commission should pursue these remaining steps. It should require hearing boards to produce and to follow detailed schedules that reflect lessons learned during the review of the LES National Enrichment Facility in New Mexico. We would consider the recommendations we have there.  I firmly believe proper planning, detailed schedules, and the Commission engagement will foster more thorough, consistent, organized, and efficient efforts to issue new plants licenses.  I take my oversight role as the ranking member of the EPW Committee very seriously and will work to ensure that the NRC continues to build on the improvements made since I initiated oversight back in 1997. I intend to increase my focus on this and other licensing issues, including monthly progress reports on licensing activity and regular meetings with Chairman Jaczko. In our committee, we have Democrats and Republicans very supportive of this effort to expand our capability in nuclear energy.  My hope is to see that the NRC issues the first new license before the end of 2011 and eight more by 2013. Given construction estimates of 4 to 5 years, the first 2 reactors could be operational in 2016, with 14 more potentially in operation by the year 2018. Sixteen new reactors would be a good start to rejuvenating an industry that has been stagnant for 34 years. I believe these reactors can revitalize our economy and meet the growing demand for energy. I also agree with labor unions that are excited about the prospect of new jobs and what it will do for low-cost energy for America.  I look forward to the future. I plan to host a roundtable to highlight progress toward advanced design and to stay on board. Back in 1997, we hadn't had an oversight hearing in 12 years at that time, and we will make sure we don't repeat that mistake.  A lot has been done to prepare for nuclear construction, but a lot remains to be done. Whether the industry will succeed in building new plants will greatly depend upon President Obama's leadership. I am disappointed that the administration seems to send mixed signals regarding its support for nuclear energy. Last month in Prague, the President said:       We must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of      our efforts to combat climate change and to advance peace and      opportunity for all people.  Yet just this month his budget contained language terminating the Yucca Mountain program before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could even do its review--30 years of research and $7.7 billion down the drain, purely for political reasons. It is unthinkable that could happen, but it has happened.  In addition, President Obama recently appointed, as Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Joe Wellinghoff, who stated his belief that we won't need any more nuclear plants ever. This isn't right, and it is totally inconsistent.  These mixed messages will soon become clear. President Obama has recently designated a new Chairman of the NRC and is expected to propose two additional nominees soon. Time will tell whether the NRC is an effective and efficient regulator.  In his Senate confirmation hearing, DOE Secretary Steven Chu said:       Nuclear power . . . is going to be an important part of the      energy mix. It is 20 percent of our electricity generated      today, but it is 70 percent of the carbon-free portion of      electricity today. And it is baseload. So I think it is very      important that we push ahead.  For that reason and every other reason, for the economy and for the environment and for our ability to provide our own energy in this country and lower our reliance upon foreign countries, I believe we need to move forward rapidly. We intend to do so with nuclear energy.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
