President, I would like to call the Senate's attention to the work of the Washington Electric Cooperative, which provides power and electricity to thousands of Vermonters, including to Marcelle and me at our home in Middlesex. This year the co-op, as it is better known to Vermonters, celebrates its 75th anniversary. The co-op formed in the midst of the rural electrification movement of the 1930s. On December 2, 1939, my predecessor in the Senate, then-Vermont Governor George Aiken, flipped the switch that brought electricity to 150 farms. I doubt that anyone could have imagined back then that the co-op would grow to serve the 11,000 members it serves today, covering about 2800 square miles in parts of 41 towns in north-central Vermont.  The Washington Electric Co-Op has indeed grown, from the setting of the first poles on the McKnight Farm in East Montpelier, to operating 1200 miles of distribution lines with eight substations today. I am proud of the Washington Electric Co-Op, both as a customer and as a Vermonter.  In honor of this important occasion, I ask that the article ``How the Washington Electric Co-op Began'' from the 1964 Washington Electric Co-op annual meeting be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                How the Washington Electric Co-Op Began (Reminiscence by a Co-op member printed in the 1964 WEC Annual Report)       One July day Harmon Kelly called on Lorie and Elizabeth      Tarshis to suggest their writing to Washington to ask about      rural electricity. Raymond Ebbett and Lyle Young met with      them. They decided to try to form an REA Co-op. Meetings      followed in people's living rooms. On July 14th the first      public meeting, conducted by Harmon Kelly, was held in the      Grange Hall, Maple Corner. It had been hard to get people to      come. Meetings had been held before about getting Green      Mountain Power and had always ended in disappointment. As Mr.      Kelly talked, people became optimistic and began to suggest      sources of water power. We even considered the radical idea      of a diesel engine. Several strangers sat listening in the      dark shadows at the back of the lamp lit hall. One made a      long rambling speech against socialistic schemes ending:      ``And you'll have to admit I told you.''       We found out who our visitors were when they went to the      owners of the best farms and promised them Green Mountain      Power within three weeks if they would ``give up this      nonsense.'' Harmon Kelly was told to give it up or lose his      job. Neither bribes nor threats worked. On July 29th the REA      Co-op was formed with Harmon Kelly, Lyle Young, and Elizabeth      Kent Tarshis as incorporators.       My diary for October 7th 1939 reads: ``Autumn color      splendid. Electricity booming. Stakes set to mark where poles      will be.'' On October 12th, the first pole was set on the      McKnight farm in East Montpelier. I remember it, well braced,      standing black against a cold sky with bright leaves whirling      in the wind and a man from Washington saying: ``You folks      don't know what you've started. I wouldn't be surprised if      you had a thousand members some day.'' The first hundred      looked at each other in disbelief. No one imagined there      would be more than three thousand in 1964.       On a May night in 1940, for the first time since the power      was turned on, I drove along the County Road. In houses, dark      last year or with lamps dimly burning, every window was a      blaze of light. There was music everywhere--cows listening to      records, housewives to radios. I stopped, found one friend      happily running a new vacuum cleaner over an already      immaculate rug. I hurried on to my own dark house and turned      on every one of our new 100 watt bulbs. The miracle had come.                          ____________________
