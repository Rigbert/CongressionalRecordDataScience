President, I want to thank Senator Gregg for his important statement.  As we all know, Charles Taylor was the brutal dictator of Liberia, responsible for numerous atrocities in West Africa. His loyalists raped, killed and hacked the limbs off of innocent civilians. To bring Mr. Taylor--and others responsible for these crimes--to justice, the United States and United Nations Security Council established an international tribunal--the Special Court for Sierra Leone.  Congress has consistently supported the Special Court by appropriating $20 million for it. The Prosecutor for the Special Court is an American, a former lawyer in the Defense Department. He moved quickly to indict Mr. Taylor for his crimes. To back up this indictment,INTERPOL issued a Red Notice asking member states to help bring him to justice.  Today, Mr. Taylor remains beyond the reach of the court. He is in Nigeria--shielded by that government. To make matters worse, Taylor continues to work to destabilize parts of West Africa. The State Department says it will not pressure Nigeria to turn Taylor over to the court.  This is completely unacceptable. Taylor is under indictment by a UN-backed court. He continues to destabilize parts of West Africa. We know where he is. The United States needs to act and it needs to act now.  Yesterday, Senator Gregg and I--along with 5 other Senators--sent a letter to the State Department urging immediate action to get Taylor to the court. It is time for the United States to do the right thing. It is time for Taylor to come before the court.                          ____________________
