President, yesterday the U.S. Senate voted on two measures, one by the Senator from Massachusetts and one by the Senator from Nebraska relating to home health benefits. I was unable to attend yesterday's session of the Senate but had I voted, I would have voted for both measures.  Home health and hospice benefits are very important to Oklahomans. In fact, the National Association for Home Care and Hospice reported that Oklahomans alone may receive a cut of over $1 billion in home health and hospice benefits under this bill. I understand the value of home health and hospice very well. In March 2007, I introduced legislation with Senators Thad Cochran, Roger Wicker, Pete Domenici, and Richard Shelby, the Preserving Access to Hospice Act, to ensure America's terminally ill seniors have access to hospice care, by providing immediate relief for hospices impacted by the Medicare hospice cap and authorizing a MedPAC study on the cap issue. Identical legislation was introduced in the House led by Congressman John Sullivan with many cosponsors. I introduced this legislation because of a flawed provision in Federal law which required hospices to repay the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, for serving eligible patients in prior years. Many small, family, and community-owned hospices faced closure, and patients faced losing access to hospice care. In Oklahoma especially, hospice care companies of all sizes service a large number of Oklahomans. However, in 2005, 41 percent of the hospices providing care in Oklahoma received letters from CMS demanding repayment. Since then, I have been working to help small, community hospices in Oklahoma as they face repayment letters from CMS for millions of dollars. Without help, hospices face closure and the discharge of significant numbers of terminally ill patients, possibly into more expensive care. In fact, during last summer's contentious debate on physician Medicare reimbursements, I argued at the very least for a MedPAC study on payment methodology for hospice care to evaluate if there is a problem with payments and whether cap amount revisions are needed.  I understand and greatly appreciate the value of good home health care and hospice benefits.  Admittedly, one of the measures considered yesterday would have been better than the other. The amendment from the Senator from Massachusetts simply said that nothing in the bill should result in the reduction of guaranteed home health benefits. The problem is that access to home health isnot a ``guaranteed'' Medicare benefit. So even though the amendment from the Senator from Massachusetts passed 96 to 0, will it have a real impact on protecting seniors from the loss of access to home health care? No. The better approach was offered by the Senator from Nebraska. Unfortunately, the better approaches are failing by party line votes. However, I compliment the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, for his support of the motion by the Senator from Nebraska. This motion would have recommitted this entire legislation to the appropriate Senate committee to remove the cuts to home health benefits. I think that is the best and most direct approach. I think that is the most honest approach. Simply remove the cuts. For the past several days we have been discussing the cuts to Medicare and especially the cuts to Medicare Advantage. In each case, the Republicans have offered motions and amendments to recommit this massive 2,000-page health bill back to committee to improve it, namely, to remove the cuts to programs seniors and the disabled use. I was disappointed to see this most recent attempt to send this massive bill back to committee to improve it fail 41 to 53.  I look forward to today's debate. One scheduled for a vote is on medical malpractice reform. It will be very interesting to see just how serious the Democrats are about health care reform. Currently, the bill only has a ``sense of the Senate'' recognizing medical malpractice costs are a problem. We'll see if they think it is important to really do anything about it.                          ____________________
