President, I rise today to offer a bill to authorize funding for abrupt climate change research. I am pleased to be joined on this bill by Senator Cantwell as lead cosponsor and by our colleagues, Senators Snowe, Kerry, and Gillibrand.  Abrupt climate change is defined as a large-scale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists, or is anticipated to persist, for at least a few decades, and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems.  Our bill authorizes $10 million per year for the next 6 years for a comprehensive and integrated competitive, peer-reviewed, research program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to understand, assess, and predict abrupt climate change.  Abrupt climate change is not necessarily a result of increased amounts of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. It can be caused by natural phenomena, such massive volcanic eruptions, or natural climate variability.  However it comes about, abrupt climate change can pose significant risks and challenges to our society. For us to uphold our responsibility as stewards of the Nation's environmental and economic security, it is crucial that we better understand abrupt climate change so that we can recognize it early and respond to it effectively.  Understanding and predicting climate change are enormous scientific challenges. The challenges are made even more difficult with the recognition that the climate system is capable of dramatic and abrupt changes. Past global temperatures have swung as much as 20 degrees fahrenheit within a decade, accompanied by drought in some places and catastrophic floods in others. An abrupt climate change triggered by the ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would also likely result in the redistribution of atmospheric moisture and rainfall, with substantial impact on the world's food supplies. Unfortunately, we have no satisfactory understanding of what triggers abrupt climate changes.  The National Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Climate Change Science Program have identified abrupt climate change as a key priority for additional research. The National Academy of Sciences stated that ``Large, abrupt climate changes have repeatedly affected much or all of the Earth.'' Furthermore, the Academy went on to state that ``abrupt climate changes are not only possible but likely in the future, potentially with large impacts on ecosystems and societies,'' and noted that we're not doing nearly enough to identify the threat of abrupt climate change. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program last reported to the President and Congress on abrupt climate change in December 2008. The overarching recommendation of this report is the urgent need for committed and sustained monitoring of components of the climate system particularly vulnerable to abrupt climate change. Our bill provides a framework and funds for the U.S. to better understand and address abrupt climate change.  One reason this funding is so urgent is that we are rapidly losing one of the greatest sources of information: ice cores from glaciers. The University of Maine's Climate Change Institute has one of the best abrupt climate change research programs in the world. The Climate Change Institute uses ice cores from glaciers and ice sheets around the world to make discoveries that change the way we think about climate change. Unfortunately, numerous glaciers around the world are melting, and when they go, we lose the very record that has given us so much of this critical climatic history.  I have had several opportunities to see how scientists are able to use glaciers and ice sheets to understand climate change. In 2006, I joined Senators McCain and Sununu in traveling to the South Pole to see groundbreaking research taking place on ice more than 2 miles deep. Along the way we toured some of the University of Maine research sites in New Zealand with distinguished Professor George Denton, who was the first scientist from the University of Maine to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences. According to Professor Denton, 50 percent of the glaciers in New Zealand have melted since 1860, and this melting is unprecedented in the last 5,000 years. We stood with the professor on sites that had been buried by massive glaciers at the beginning of the 20th century, but are now ice free.  I also traveled with Senators McCain, Sununu, and others to Ny-Alesund, the northernmost community in the world. The scientists we met with told us that the global climate is changing more rapidly now than at any time since the beginning of civilization. They further stated that the region of the globe changing most rapidly is the Arctic. The changes are remarkable and disturbing.  In the last 30 years, the Arctic has lost sea-ice cover over an area 10 times as large as the State of Maine. In the summer, the change is even more dramatic, with twice as much ice loss. The ice that remains is as much as 40 percent thinner than it was just a few decades ago. In Ny-Alesund, Senator McCain and I witnessed massive blocks of ice falling off glaciers that had already retreated well back from the shores where they once rested.  The melting of glaciers and sea ice, the thawing of permafrost, and the increases in sea levels resulting from warming are already beginning to cause environmental, social, and economic changes. If these changes were to be compounded with an abrupt climate change on the scale seen in our climatic history, the result could be devastating.  Mr. President, this measure has passed the Senate many times, as part of the 2001, 2003, and 2007 energy bills. I hope this is the year that we finally pass this important provision into law. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1667       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Abrupt Climate Change      Research Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE DEFINED.       In this Act, the term ``abrupt climate change'' means a      change in the climate that occurs so rapidly or unexpectedly      that human or natural systems have difficulty adapting to the      climate as changed.     SEC. 3. ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM.       (a) Establishment of Program.--The Secretary of Commerce      shall establish within the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric      Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric      Administration, and carry out, a program of extramural      awards, made on a peer-reviewed and competitive basis, to      conduct scientific research on abrupt climate change.       (b) Purposes of Program.--The purposes of the program      established under subsection (a) shall be as follows:       (1) To develop a global array of terrestrial and      oceanographic indicators of paleoclimate in order to      sufficiently identify and describe past instances of abrupt      climate change.       (2) To improve understanding of thresholds and      nonlinearities in geophysical systems related to the      mechanisms of abrupt climate change.       (3) To incorporate such mechanisms into advanced      geophysical models of climate change.       (4) To test the simulation of climate change by such models      against an improved global array of records of past abrupt      climate changes.     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized      to be appropriated to the Secretary of Commerce for each of      fiscal years 2010 through 2016, $10,000,000 to carry out the      research program established under section 3(a).       (b) Availability of Funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant      to the authorization of appropriations in subsection (a) are      authorized to remain available until expended.                          ____________________
