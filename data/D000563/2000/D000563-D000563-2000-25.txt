President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today, December 5, 1999:  Trennell Alston, 26, Baltimore, MD; Georges Ronnell Barnes, 29, Baltimore, MD; Mary Collien, 51, Baltimore, MD; Gilbert Gallegos, 76, Salt Lake City, UT; Donta Henson, 18, Chicago, IL; Nathan Hornes, 36, Oakland, CA; Makisha Jenkins, 18, Baltimore, MD; Christopher Jones, 17, Washington, DC; Greg Karavites, 38, Denver, CO; JillLundstrom, 25, Miami-Dade County, FL; Johnny Manning, 29, Minneapolis, MN; Mary Matthews, 39, Baltimore, MD; Bertess Montgomery, 87, Memphis, TN; Ramiro Peredez, 34, Atlanta, GA; Lionel Robinson, 23, Baltimore, MD; Patrick Michael Smith, 21, Washington, DC; Levanna Spearman, 23, Baltimore, MD; Alan Villarreal, 23, Houston, TX; Unidentified Male, Newark, NJ; and Unidentified Male, Newark, NJ.  Five of the people I mentioned were the victims of what has been described as one of the worst mass killings in Baltimore history. Mary McNeil Matthews; her mother, Mary Helen Collien; her daughter, Makisha Jenkins; and two family friends, Trennell Alston and Lavanna Spearman; were killed one year ago today by four men who burst into Mary McNeil Matthews' home and shot all five women.  We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.                          ____________________
