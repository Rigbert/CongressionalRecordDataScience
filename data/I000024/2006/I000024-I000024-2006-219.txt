President, I ask unanimous consent to have the attached letter printed in the Record in support of my amendment No. 4064, to S. 261l.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            American Federation of                             Government Employees, Local 1812,                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2006.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: As President of AFGE Local 1812, which      represents employees at the Voice of America, I want to thank      you for your support of making the English language the      official language of the United States. Along with 86 percent      of the general public, I agree with you on this issue. In      this regard, I would also like to bring to your attention      another issue that deals with the English language: as a      result of the President's 2007 budget request process, the      Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) plans to eliminate the      Voice of America's global English radio broadcasts, VOA News      Now.       Since you realize the importance of the English language to      this country, I believe you will agree that it is critically      important that we communicate with the rest of the world in      our de facto national language, in particular because English      is the language of business, higher education, youth,      international diplomacy, aviation, the Internet, science,      popular music, entertainment, and international travel. Other      countries realize the importance of broadcasting in English.      In fact, China, Russia, and France had all recently increased      their international broadcasts in English.       I have attached an article by Georgie Anne Geyer regarding      the proposed elimination of the VOA's global English      broadcasts. I am hoping you can help stop this decision,      which will negatively impact U.S. public diplomacy and      America's position in the world.           Sincerely,                                                      Tim Shamble,     President.                          ____________________[Page S6411]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE UNITED STATES
