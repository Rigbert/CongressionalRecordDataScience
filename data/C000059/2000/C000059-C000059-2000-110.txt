Speaker, it is no secret that methamphetamine has reached epidemic proportions in our Nation. Last year alone, we saw almost 6,000 lab seizures affecting nearly every State in the Nation.  It is time we declare war against meth. This deadly drug has thousands of innocent victims. Ordinary families find their property ruined or health at risk by the deadly chemicals used to make meth. These chemicals destroy soil and plants, contaminate drinking water, and poison the air we breathe.  We know we have reached a crisis situation with meth. The statistics are there. Forty-four States reported nearly 6,000 meth lab seizures in 1999 alone. And most disturbing, over 1,200 children were found during these lab seizures.  We must face the problem head on. My legislation does just that. The War Against Meth Act ensures that we stop meth production but punish those who would put innocent victims and the environment in danger. Today we introduce this bipartisan legislation with over 60 cosponsors.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to finally thank all the law enforcement men and women that are fighting this battle ona daily basis as we declare, once again, war on meth.                          ____________________
