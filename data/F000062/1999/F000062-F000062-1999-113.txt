 President, I would like to inquire of my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, about funding in this measure for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, popularly known as the SCAAP.  As the Senator knows, states and localities, especially those such as California with high immigrant populations, face extraordinary costs in incarcerating illegal aliens who have committed serious crimes in the United States and sentenced for their felony offenses.  The burden on states and localities which incarcerate criminal aliens continues to grow. In California, for example, during February 1997, there were 17,904 criminal alien inmates with INS holds on them. This rose to 19,355 in 1998. At the end of February, 1999, there were 21,792 alien inmates in the California state correctional system who have INS holds.  Congress appropriated $585 million for SCAAP in fiscal year 1999 to help reimburse state and local governments for the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens.  Given the increasing numbers of illegal aliens that California and other states must incarcerate, one would reasonably expect that funding for this important program would be increased in fiscal year 2000.  But it is my understanding, Mr. President, that the bill reported by the committee actually makes dramatic cuts in federal funding for SCAAP, reducing the level of funding by more than 80 percent to only $100 million.  Given the urgency of the need and the fact that all 50 states, the District of Columbia, two territories and 244 localities received SCAAP funding in the most recent reimbursement period, I would like to inquire of my friend from New Hampshire if there is something that can be done to increase funding in this bill for SCAAP to a more appropriate level.
