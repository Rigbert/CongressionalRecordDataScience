I thank the gentleman so very much for his kind remarks, but also his very eloquent concern for post-abortive women and those who may be contemplating abortion. You know, the Pregnancy Care Network, 4,000 strong throughout the United States, is there as a front line to say: We love you both, mother and baby.  So I thank the gentleman for bringing attention to that as well.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice), a member of the Oversight and Government Reform, and the Natural Resources Committees.
