 This places many undue obstacles in front of the woman who is serving in the military overseas such as asking through her supervisor for permission to leave. This is not something anyone here has to ask for who is serving here or who is not serving here. It means that a woman would have to fly home--sometimes hours of travel, sometimes weeks of delay in getting a flight out of some of the countries which we are asking our young women to serve in. It means a delay in the medical procedure, and it puts an undue burden on these women which is not faced by any other woman in this country.
