Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1.  I want to at the outset congratulate the gentleman from Connecticut [Chris Shays] and Dick Swett from New Hampshire. Dick is no longer with us. Chris is obviously here. They worked very hard on this issue in the last Congress. They raised the visibility of this issue, but more importantly than that, they worked with all the Members of this House on both sides of the aisle to try to reach agreement on the very difficult question as to how we include the House and the Senate and the instrumentalities of Congress under the provisions of 10 specific bills which we have passed over the last six decades and apply those so that our employees will enjoy the same protection as the employees of other entities in this country.  It is important that we are moving forward on this bill. It has been blocked frankly for too long. The House passed this bill essentially twice in the last Congress, only to see our efforts thwarted by Republican-led efforts in the Senate, unfortunately. The Democratic and Republican Members of this House want this bill and as has been said earlier in the day voted to approve it 427-4 back in August of last year.  We have gone a long way toward making sure that the Congress lives under the same laws as any other Americans. Most pieces of legislation we have passed apply to Congress. The Americans with Disabilities Act which I proudly cosponsored specifically applies to Congress, as did the Civil Rights Act, the Minimum Wage Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act, all apply now. The House has also had in place since 1988 prohibitions against employment discrimination.  H.R. 1 will ensure that all Members of the Congress, not just House Members, live under all the laws we pass and do so permanently, not just as internal House rules which are now on the books adopted by this House in October of last year, but as a statute, a part of statutory law.  I cannot tell you how many times I have had business men and women, men and women in every walk of life complain that Congress passes laws [[Page H95]] and then simply exempts itself. Every one of us on this House floor has heard that criticism, which was legitimate, by our publics. Most of my constituents did not know frankly that the Congressional Accountability Act passed the House last year by that vote of 427-4. In fact the discussions that I have heard in debates sometimes on this floor and during the course of this election, you would not know that the House had acted. You would not know that it was in our rules. That perhaps served the purposes of some, but the fact is we did act. But the other body did not. And the instrumentalities are not covered. Furthermore, the mechanisms for appeal and hearing process are not provided for adequately in the rules because they could not be provided for adequately in the rules.  The American people deserve something more than the internal House rule that we have. But as importantly our employees deserve better than that. That really is the crux of this issue, so that we can protect them as we have protected others throughout this country.  I want to go home and tell those constituents that have talked to me and to all of you that we have answered their plea. I want to tell them that we meet the same requirements that they do, that we follow the same laws that we ask them to, from OSHA to Fair Labor Standards. I want to tell them that our employees have the same protections theirs do, from anti-age discrimination to family and medical leave. Perhaps the shared experience will help us, as some of you believe, write better, more careful laws.                              {time}  0040  This is about common sense, trust and accountability. That is why we are all here late into the evening finishing the work which began the last Congress. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in moving forward on H.R. 1.  Again I want to congratulate the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Shays and Mr. Swett for their leadership and their tenacious support of this very important piece of legislation.
