President, I have come to the floor of the Senate many times to speak about my native State of Vermont and to say how very special it is. One of the reasons that it is so special is not only the people who are born there but some of the extraordinary people who come to Vermont and have made Vermont their home and have improved Vermont while there.  One person who we revere in Vermont is Arthur Gibb. Art Gibb served as a leader in the State legislature, one of the strongest voices in the Republican Party for environmental concerns in Vermont, and he is well respected by Republicans and Democrats alike for all he has given to the State.  Recently, Christopher Graff, chief of the Vermont Associated Press Bureau, wrote an article about Art Gibb as he turned 90. Mr. Graff says things about Art Gibb far better than I. But it is such a good profile of such a special Vermonter that I ask unanimous consent the article about my good friend, Art Gibb, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 12, 1998]              Art Gibb: A Special State Leader, Law Maker                         (By Christopher Graff)       Take a stroll through the Statehouse and peek at the      portraits lining the walls. Governors, lieutenant governors,      military leaders.       Among all the paintings in the Statehouse collection are      just three portraits of legislators.       One is of Edna Beard of Orange, the first woman to serve in      the House. She was also the first to serve in the Senate.       The second is of Reid LeFevre of Manchester, a House member      starting in the 1940s who was the most colorful lawmaker of      all times. LeFevre was chairman of the House Ways and Means      Committee and in his off time ran King Reid Shows, a      traveling carnival that he once brought to the House chamber.       The third portrait is of Art Gibb, a legend in his own      time.       Gibb's large portrait fills part of a wall off the House      chamber. He is shown sitting outside and most of the painting      is a wonderful, colorful landscape, with flowers, fields and      mountains.       It is revealing that the portrait is more about Vermont's      beauty than about Gibb.       The Weybridge Republican turns 90 this week, still bustling      with energy and a passion for keeping Vermont special.       Gibb sits on the state Environmental Board, settling the      sticky questions of who gets to build what where.       It is a fitting place for him. He fathered the pioneering      state law that created the Environmental Board and the      process of keeping development in check.       It is a great story, one that serves as a reminder of the      special breed of leaders Vermont has enjoyed and the state's      ability to meet head-on the problems that destroy others.       Gibb was elected to the House in 1962. He was serving on      the tax-writing committee of the House when a vacancy opened      in the chairmanship of the House Natural Resources Committee.       Gibb asked House Speaker Richard Mallary if he could have      it--and Mallary agreed.       The outdoors enthusiast was placed in a critical role at a      critical time.       A few years later newly elected Gov. Deane Davis realized      southern Vermont was under siege from eager developers who      cared solely about profit.       Davis turned to Gibb--the governor later described Gibb as      ``a man of great personal charm . . . (who) was well-known      for his judicial and fair-minded temperament''--and asked him      to lead a special commission to examine the problem. Out of      the Gibb Commission came the framework for Act 250, passed in      1970 and still a vital part of Vermont.       Gibb says the issues that come to the board these days are      ones no one imagined when Act 250 was drawn up, like      snowmaking for ski areas and the siting of communications      towers.       Gibb says he has seen and done a lot in his years, but of      one thing he has never had any doubts. Act 250 has played a      crucial role in saving what makes Vermont special.       ``It leads to responsible development,'' he says. ``When      you think of the irresponsible development we had in 1969 . .      . Thank God for Act 250.''       As Art Gibb turns 90, we thank him for Act 250 and thank      God for Art Gibb.                          ____________________
