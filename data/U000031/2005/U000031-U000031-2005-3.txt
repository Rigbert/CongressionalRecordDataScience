He had three stents put in this morning.  I talked with him at length a little bit earlier this morning. He is doing quite well. He has a good sense of humor. Some of you might remember that our committee had a BCS hearing earlier this week on a playoff schedule, and I told him it had been resolved: Michigan would not be playing Nebraska, Michigan would be playing Southern California for the National Championship on January 4.  But he is in good humor, and he is doing well. His wife made it early this morning. He is expected to make a full recovery. In fact, he may be here later in the weekend to cast a vote or two if it is required.  He very much appreciates all the Members on both sides of the aisle inquiring about his health and wanted us to assure everyone that in fact he is the same Joe Barton that he was before; he is expected to make a full recovery, and we may see him again later on this weekend.                          ____________________
