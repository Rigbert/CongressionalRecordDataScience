President, included in the farm bill that the Senate will consider today is a provision for $200 million to be used by the Secretary of the Department of the Interior to move forward with restoration of the Everglades ecosystem. Some of my colleagues may wonder why the farm bill contains such a provision, and I would like to take a few minutes to explain the importance of restoring this unique ecosystem.  The Everglades is one of the most unique wetland ecosystems in the world. It is a national treasure that is in peril and deserves the immediate attention of Congress.  Prior to the 1940's the Everglades ecosystem covered most of south Florida, from its headwaters in the Kissimmee River basin to the coral reefs of Florida Bay. Because of man's alterations, the once ``river of grass'' is now fragmented and deteriorating, threatening not only the wildlife of the esosystem, but also the water supplies, economy and quality of life for the people who live in Florida.  The central and south Florida project, authorized by Congress to control flooding and reclaim land in the area, has had unintended and disastrous results. While flood protection in many areas has improved, south Florida's ecosystem has suffered greatly.  On average, more than 500,000 acre feet of water are sent to tide each year from Lake Okeechobee. In addition, another 1 million acre feet from the Everglades agricultural area is discharged to tide each year through east coast canals. This water once remained in the system and was a primary source of fresh water for wildlife and served to replenish the ground water supplies.  Now the water that flows south in the Everglades marshes is diverted by canals and polluted by agricultural runoff, primarily from sugarcane fields. Water entering the Everglades often has 20-30 times the phosphorous levels that are found in unpolluted parts of the Everglades. This has led to an explosion of plants that are dramatically altering the landscape and the habitat of threatened and endangered species. Cattails are overwhelming periphyton, the very base of life in the ecosystem, destroying the unique balance of the Everglades.  Throughout the system, clear, fresh water has been replaced by murky, nutrient laden water that does not support native plant and animal species.  The years of water diversion and pollutants affect not only the Everglades, but also Florida Bay. The Bay is suffering from a lack of fresh water that has led to algal blooms and contributed to the extinction of North America's only native coral reef. As a consequence, this once teeming estuary now is closed to commercial fishing, and the tourism industry of the region is threatened.  We must not let the Everglades die. Although the decline of the ecosystem continues, it is reversible.  Current efforts by Federal, State and local governments to restore the system are moving forward. Restoration will involve not only protection of the natural system, but also continued flood protection and provisions for adequate water supplies for wildlife and humans. This comprehensive effort could be derailed if sufficient acreage in the southern Everglades agricultural area is not acquired to provide storage and delivery of adequate, fresh water supplies to the natural system.  As explained by the Everglades coalition, a diverse group of more than 30 citizens, environmental and conservation organizations, restoration of the Everglades requires a ``dike to dike'' approach to restore the natural flow of water into the Everglades, preserve and clean up polluted waters, reduce flooding and provide more water to a growing Florida. A ``dike to dike'' water storage and management area of approximately 230,000 acres in the southern Everglades agricultural area would be used to restore water quality and a more natural hydroperiod in the Everglades. Portions of this land are already state owned, and are available for Everglades restoration purposes. About 130,000 additional acres of land currently used for sugarcane production will need to be acquired in order to complete the necessary water management area.  According to the Everglades coalition, significantly increasing water storage will provide a wide array of benefits to all of south Florida including: The recovery of water now wasted to the ocean; more water for all water users, including the natural Everglades; restoration of the natural timing, distribution and flow into the Everglades; more areas to clean polluted water; the amelioration of flooding; and the protection of the Lake Okeechobee, St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuary ecosystems.  This is an ambitious project, which will cost billions of dollars. Today, we are making a small down payment--$200 million for Everglades restoration.  Specifically, this provision directs the Secretary of the Treasury to provide $200 million to be used toward the acquisition and modification of approximately 130,000 acres in the Everglades agricultural area identified by the agencies to be used for water storage and delivery. This would include the remaining private acreage in townships 46, 47, and 48 of the Everglades agricultural area, approximately 52,000 acres referred to as the ``Talisman Tract'' and other restoration activities in the ecosystem. When enacted, no further action by Congress will be necessary to authorize the administration to spend these funds. In addition, the funds shall not be provided for this program from the Conservation Reserve, Wetlands Reserve or any other conservation programs.  This small down payment will be insufficient for total restoration. It is only part of the Federal Government's share of this coordinated restoration effort. More important, it in no way relieves others--particularly the sugarcane industry that has benefited from the alteration of the system and continues to pollute it--of its obligation to contribute to restoration costs.  These growers benefit from the Federal Sugar Program that guarantees them significant earnings. In the next 5 years alone, some 139 Florida sugar producers and processors will make more than $1 billion in profits because Washington inflates the price of sugar, at the expense of the consumer  Forida sugar producers must contribute their fair share--a 2-cent per pound assessment on new sugar grown in the Everglades--to pay for both past water quality degradation caused by cane farming, and for land acquisition vital to Everglades restoration. This would raise $350 million over 5 years.  This proposal has wide spread support in Florida. Poll after poll shows that voters there believe polluters should pay and favor the 2-cent assessment.  I will pursue every effort until Congress or the voters in Florida impose a 2 cent assessment on every new pound of sugar grown in the Everglades agricultural area.  In addition, today's action should help the Clinton Administration which is taking significant leadership on restoring the Everglades. In a January 11, 1996 directive, Vice President Gore ordered key Cabinet departments to prepare a thorough plan for the President . . . for the restoration of the Everglades and the south Florida ecosystem.  The Vice President wrote that ``the Florida sugarcane producing industry must pay their fair share'' of restoration costs. He further directed senior administration officials to develop a plan that: ``assures that sufficient land now involved in agricultural production is returned to its natural function to allow for storage and purification of water.''  I will do all I can to work with the administration in this effort.  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of Vice President Gore's January 11, 1996, directive and administration's guiding principles be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 Office of the Vice President,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 1996.     Memorandum For: Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of Interior,     Dan Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture,     Carol Browner, Administrator EPA,     Alice Rivlin, Director OMB,     Katie McGinty, Chair CBQ,     Togo West, Secretary of the Army.     From: The Vice President.     Subject: Everglades and South Florida Ecosystem Restoration.       Recently, the President and I again discussed the issue of      restoring the Everglades. We both continue to be deeply      concerned about the problems there, and believe that the      Administration must continue to provide strong leadership and      aggressively build on your collective efforts to date to      restore and manage wisely the South Florida ecosystem.       During a recent trip to South Florida I pledge to expedite      our work. Through this memorandum I am therefore requesting      OMB and CBQ to work with the departments and agencies to      prepare a thorough plan for the President that builds on our      work and the set of principles adopted by the Administration      to ensure fairness in funding the restoration of the      Everglades and South Florida ecosystem. (A copy of the      principles is attached).       This plan should accomplish the following objectives:       Assure that sufficient land now involved in agricultural      production is returned to its natural function to allow for      storage and purification of water. I understand that a number      of scientists have recommended that 100,000 acres or more      will be necessary to achieve a thorough restoration. I would      like the Army Corps of Engineers to complete, as quickly as      possible, its assessment of this acreage and whether      additional acreage will be necessary to accomplish this      objective;            Ensure a long-term, reliable reverse stream to be put      toward land acquisition and other essential activities.      Please specifically note continued federal, state, and local      government contributions, and economic incentives, and      identify and assess mechanisms that can ensure that these      responsible for the pollution harming the South Florida      ecosystem and those who benefit from the federal flood      control and water supply projects, including the Florida      sugarcane producing industry, pay their fair share;       Identify those measures that must be undertaken in short      order, such as, for example, preserving a buffer around the      Everglades and increasing water flows to Florida Bay; and       Expedite and coordinate the various federal efforts now      ongoing for ecosystem restoration including the Army Corps of      Engineers ``restudy''.       In developing this plan, please work with our state, local      and tribal governmental partners. In addition, I would also      ask you to consider all potential sources of revenues for      such an effort, and to review any mechanisms including, for      example, land trades; sales of surplus federal lands; or      conservation easements, for acquisition of the necessary      properties or development rights.       Your timely attention to this matter is very much      appreciated. The Administration's continued leadership on      this matter is vital and I anticipate with great interest      your report on the best means for the Administration to      assure the future of the precious natural treasure--the      Florida Everglades and Florida Bay--and the health and      economic prosperity of the citizens of South Florida. Thank      you.                                                                    ____     Funding Tax Restoration of the Everglades, Guiding Principles                             December 1995       The restoration and protection of the Everglades and      Florida Bay is one of the Clinton Administration's highest      environmental priorities. The Everglades is a unique national      natural treasure. With Florida Bay, it undergirds the quality      of life and the tourism and fishing industries in South      Florida.       The substantial costs of restoration over decades should be      borne by those who have benefitted from activities that      profoundly altered the Everglades acosystem, and by those who      will potentially benefit by its restoration. Florida      sugarcane producers should pay their fair share of the costs.      Federal State and local governments also should share in the      costs of restoration.       Congress should adopt legislation that provides funding to      assist in making a substantial down payment on the      significant restoration needs that immediately face the      Everglades--such as enhancing more natural water deliveries      to the Everglades and Florida Bay, acquisition of the      Talisman tract, and acquisition and engineering of an East      Everglades water preserve buffer zone.       Funding proposals should meet clearly defined objectives      and be integrated into technical plans for the overall, long-     term effort to restore the South Florida ecosystem.      Restoration and funding proposals should be evaluated for      their effect on the South Florida ecosystem, rather than on      any single component of that ecosystem.       The proposals should be developed and implemented in      consultation with State and local communities and officials.
