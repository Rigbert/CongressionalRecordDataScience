 President, today I wish to pay tribute to Robert H. Harris, who passed away in his home on Thursday, August 2, 2012, at the age of 82. Bob was a highly respected attorney for whom I had the deepest respect. I am grateful that I was able to call Bob a friend and mourn his passing.  Born on June 9, 1930, in Columbus, GA, Bob spent the majority of his childhood in Goodwater, AL. He graduated from Auburn University in 1951 and from the University of Alabama Law School where he was an outstanding student. Bob was first in his class and was a member of the Law Review, Farrah Order of Jurisprudence, and the Order of the Coif.  Bob went on to graduate from the University of Virginia Judge Advocate General School in 1955. He began practicing law when he was discharged as a captain after serving for 3 years in the U.S. Army from 1954 to 1957. He made significant contributions to the Decatur, AL, legal community and was admired for his diligence in his profession.  I had the great privilege of serving with him in the Alabama Senate. Not only was he a well-respected and talented attorney, but he was an excellent legislator as well. Bob served two terms in the State senate and was named Outstanding Freshman Senator, Hardest Working Senator, and Most Outstanding Senator. He was appointed as the chairman of the committee that revised the Code of Alabama in 1975 for the first time since 1940.  Beyond his contributions to the legal community, he was an active member of the First United Methodist Church where he taught the men's Bible class. He was also extremely dedicated to academia and served as a member of the Auburn University Board of Trustees for a decade. Additionally, he served as the Founding Director of the First American Bank.  Bob was an inspiration to me, a caring father and husband, and a valuable asset to his community, his church, and to Auburn University. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends, especially his wife Betty Sue Harris and his children, Laurie, Amanda, Bobbie, Robert, and Parks, as they mourn the loss of this admirable man.  I am honored to have called Bob a friend and colleague for more than 40 years. His contributions to the Decatur legal community, his church, and the State of Alabama will forever be remembered.                          ____________________
