President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2215       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing American Jobs      Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2012''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Export growth helps United States business grow and      create American jobs. In 2010, 60 percent of American exports      came from small- and medium-sized businesses.       (2) On January 31, 2011, the President mandated an      executive review across agencies to determine where the      United States Government could become more competitive and      helpful to business, including help with promoting exports.       (3) Several United States Government agencies are involved      in export promotion. Coordination of the efforts of these      agencies through the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee      lacks sufficient strategic implementation and accountability.       (4) Many other countries have trade promotion programs that      aggressively compete against United States exports in Africa      and around the world. For example, in 2010, medium- and long-     term official export credit general volumes from the Group of      7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the      United Kingdom, and the United States) totaled      $65,400,000,000. Germany provided the largest level of      support at $22,500,000,000, followed by France at      $17,400,000,000 and the United States at $13,000,000,000.      Official export credit support by emerging market economies      such as Brazil, China, and India are significant as well.       (5) Between 2008 and 2010, China alone provided more than      $110,000,000,000 in loans to the developing world, and, in      2009, China surpassed the United States as the leading trade      partner of African countries. The Export-Import Bank of the      United States substantially increased lending to United      States businesses focused on Africa from $400,000,000 in 2009      to an anticipated $1,000,000,000 in 2011, but the Export-     Import Bank of China dwarfed this effort with an estimated      $12,000,000,000 worth of financing.       (6) Other countries such as India, Turkey, Russia, and      Brazil are also aggressively seeking markets in Africa using      their national export banks to provide concessional      assistance.       (7) The Chinese practice of concessional financing runs      contrary to the principles of the Organization of Economic      Co-operation and Development related to open market rates,      undermines naturally competitive rates, and can allow      governments in Africa to overlook the troubling record on      labor practices, human rights, and environmental impact.       (8) The African continent is undergoing a period of rapid      growth and middle class development, as seen from major      indicators such as Internet use and clean water access. In      2000, only 6.7 percent of the population of Africa had access      to the Internet. In 2009, 27.1 percent of the population had      Internet access. Seventy-eight percent of Africa's rural      population now has access to clean water.       (9) Economists have designated Africa as the ``next      frontier market'', with profitability and growth rates among      many African firms exceeding global averages in recent years.      Countries in Africa have a collective spending power of      almost $9,000,000,000 and a gross domestic product of      $1,600,000,000,000, which are projected to double in the next      10 years.       (10) Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to have the fastest      growing economies in the world over the next 5 years, with 7      of the 10 fastest growing economies located in sub-Saharan      Africa.       (11) When countries such as China assist with large-scale      government projects, they     also gain an upper hand in relations with African leaders and      access to valuable commodities such as oil and copper,      typically without regard to environmental, human rights,      labor, or governance standards.       (12) Unless the United States can offer competitive      financing for its firms in Africa, it will be deprived of      opportunities to participate in African efforts to close the      continent's significant infrastructure gap that amounts to an      estimated $100,000,000,000.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create jobs in      the United States by expanding programs that will result in      increasing United States exports to Africa by 200 percent in      real dollar value within 10 years.

SEC. 12. BILATERAL, SUBREGIONAL AND REGIONAL, AND                    MULTILATERAL AGREEMENTS.       Where applicable, the United States Trade Representative      and officials of the Export-Import Bank shall explore      opportunities to negotiate bilateral, subregional, and      regional agreements that encourage trade and eliminate      nontariff barriers to trade between countries, such as      negotiating investor friendly double-taxation treaties and      investment promotion agreements. United States negotiators in      multilateral forum should take into account the objectives of      this Act.
