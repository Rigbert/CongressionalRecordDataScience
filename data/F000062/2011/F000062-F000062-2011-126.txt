 President, I rise to introduce, together with Senator Kerry, the Veteran Voting Support Act of 2011. We are joined by Senators Reid, Leahy, and Durbin.  This bill would take important steps to improve veterans' access to voter registration services. Our veterans have served our Nation at great risk and sacrifice. I believe we should do everything in our power to ensure that they play a central role in our democratic process, that their votes are cast and their voices heard.  Almost 4 years ago, during the previous administration, I learned that a Department of Veterans Affairs facility in California had been barring voter registration groups from accessing veterans in the facility. Similar reports emerged in Connecticut and other parts of the country.  Since that time, Senator Kerry and I have been working, together with our cosponsors, to make sure that our Government works to provide veterans with voter registration services, not to prevent them from receiving election-related materials.  We have written letters and our staffs have held meetings with the VA to establish a fair, nonpartisan policy to facilitate voter registration for veterans who receive services from VA facilities.  We have made significant progress.  After much negotiation, in 2008, the VA established a new and substantially improved policy that allows state and local election officials, as well as nonpartisan groups, to access VA facilities for voter registration under terms and conditions set by the facility. This is an improvement, and we have not heard serious complaints in recent years.  However, legislation remains necessary. First, this voluntary policy could be rescinded or rolled back in the future; Federal law cannot. Second, more should be done to ensure not only that outside groups can register voters in a nonpartisan manner in VA facilities but also that veterans who live in and use these facilities have easy access to voter registration and absentee ballot forms, even when no group or official comes by.  The Veteran Voting Support Act of 2011 would require the VA to provide voter registration forms to veterans when they enroll in the VA health care system, or change their status or address in that system.  The bill would also ensure that veterans who live in VA facilities have access to absentee ballots when they want to cast votes, and that VA employees assist veterans with election-related forms if necessary, in the same way that these employees assist veterans with other forms.  It would allow nonpartisan voter groups and election officials to provide voter information and registration services to veterans in a time, place, and manner that makes sense for the facilities.  It would give the Attorney General authority to enforce these provisions.  It is a cornerstone of our democracy that every eligible citizen is able to register and cast their vote. These rights should never be denied, by fiat or as a matter of practicality, to those who have given the very most for our country.  I believe it is time that the VA provides veterans with the support they need and deserve to register, cast their votes, and have those votes counted.  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Veteran Voting Support Act of 2011.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1264       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Veterans have performed a great service to, and risked      the greatest sacrifice in the name of, our country, and      should be supported by the people and the Government of the      United States.       (2) Veterans are especially qualified to understand issues      of war, foreign policy, and government support for veterans,      and they should have the opportunity to voice that      understanding through voting.
