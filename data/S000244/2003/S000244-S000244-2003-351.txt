Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I have the letter that the members of the Congressional Black Caucus sent to Attorney General Janet Reno on August 6, and while they did not ask for a change in the law, what they did ask was for the Justice Department to appeal the sentence.  Now, what happened in the Stacey Koon case is that the Court of Appeals agreed with the Justice Department and established de novo review. Mr. Koon's lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and established the abuse of discretion standard.  Now, what this legislation does is to establish the de novo review standard for all crimes should there be a review of the sentence on appeal.  Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record the letter dated August 6, 1993 from members of the Congressional Black Caucus.                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, August 6, 1993.     Hon. Janet Reno,     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Reno: As members of the Congressional      Black Caucus, we are writing to you because of our concern      about the sentencing of Officer Laurence Powell and Sergeant      Stacey Koon by Judge John Davies in the Rodney King civil      rights case.       We are troubled that the sentence for the crime was reduced      to 30 months upon the court's consideration of mitigating      facts. Such a reduction for mitigating factors may be      appropriate in other circumstances. However, we feel that the      defendants' special status as police officers, with special      duties owed to the public, should have militated against such      a significant reduction.       As you well know, the maximum possible penalty was ten      years and fines of up to $250,000. Your federal prosecutors      were asking for seven to nine years. Our federal sentencing      guidelines recommended minimum sentences in a range of four      to seven years in prison.       Instead, Judge John Davies made broad use of subjective      factors. He stated that he read only letters addressed to him      from the friends and families of Officer Powell and Sergeant      Koon. He argued that much of the violence visited on Rodney      King was justified by King's own actions. However, these      officers were convicted on charges of violating Rodney King's      civil rights. We believe these mitigating factors did not      justify so large a reduction given the defendants' special      responsibilities as police officers.       In addition, Judge Davies did not afford proper weight to      the racist comments made over police radio by those convicted      on the night of the beating in discounting race as a      motivation for the beating. He similarly failed to take into      account the remarkable lack of remorse shown by Officer      Powell and Sergeant Koon since their conviction.       People of good will all over this country and of all races      were heartened when Officer Powell and Sergeant Koon were      convicted by a jury of their peers, a verdict made possible      by the Justice Department's resolve to file civil rights      charges and by the phenomenal performance of federal      prosecutors. With these severely reduced sentences, however,      we are sending a mixed message. Are police officers going to      be held responsible for excessive use of force or not?       We think what has been lost, in all this, is that police      officers have an enhanced responsibility to uphold the law.       Notwithstanding Judge Davies' authority to modify the      sentencing guidelines, most experts agreed that the minimum      four to seven years sentence should have been followed in      this case.       We realize that the trial judge is afforded sufficient      latitude in sentencing, but we urge the Department of Justice      to appeal these sentences. We need to reexamine these      sentences so that justice can finally be done in this      difficult, painful case. Only then can we begin to put this      behind us.           Sincerely,         Maxine Waters; Sanford Bishop; Eddie Bernice Johnson;            Floyd H. Flake; Albert R. Wynn; Carrie P. Meek; Eva M.            Clayton; Major R. Owens; Walter Tucker; William Clay;            Charles B. Rangel; William J. Jefferson.         James E. Clyburn; Earl Hilliard; Bennie M.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1200
