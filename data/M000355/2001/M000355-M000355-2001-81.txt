 Walker Johnson. On July 24, 2001, Walker celebrated his 90th birthday. I urge my colleagues to join me in wishing him the very best.  Walker Johnson is a loving family man and a great friend. Born to Robert and Sanny Johnson, he enjoys small-town living and is a life-long resident of Adair County, KY. Walker is the father of four children, Billy, Doris, James, and Delois. In fact, it is through Delois and her husband, Rich, that I have heard so many wonderful stories about Walker. He is a special friend to many, and is always willing to help others.  Walker is a unique individual who is known for his wit and sense of humor. Throughout his life, Walker has pursued a wide range of activities including music, horse shoeing, and dog trading. He is a talented musician and spent much time in his early years traveling and playing the fiddle with performers such as String Bean and Uncle Henry's Mountaineers. In the 1940s, he put the fiddle aside and began shoeing horses and trading dogs. Walker was one of the most skilled and hardest working farrier's in the business. In fact, at the age of 68, he managed to shoe 18 horses in one day. What a feat!  Walker has also stayed busy trading dogs, which he's done for more than 50 years. He has sold dogs all over Kentucky as well as in several other States. Today, at the age of 90, he still enjoys trading and sitting down with friends for good conversation.  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the U.S. Senate, I want to pay tribute to Walker Johnson and sincerely wish him and his family the very best. I ask that an article which ran in the Adair Progress on Sunday August 24, 2000, appear in the Record.  The article follows:                [From the Adair Progress, Aug. 24, 2000]         An Old-Time Fiddler Now an Honorable Kentucky Colonel                           (By Paul B. Hayes)       For around three-quarters of a century, Walker Johnson has      traveled around the countryside--playing a fiddle, shoeing      horses or trading dogs and various other items.       Johnson, a life-long resident of the county who has resided      in the Millerfield community for the past 50-plus years, is      known far and wide for his activities throughout the years,      along with wit and humor.       A few weeks ago, the 89-year-old Johnson began having some      health problems, but doctors installed a pacemaker in his      heart about a month ago, and he appears to be on the mend.      Last week, his spirits got a little boost when State Senator      Vernie McGaha paid him a visit, and made him a Kentucky      Colonel on behalf of Gov. Paul Patton.       While visiting with Sen. McGaha, his son Bobby, and another      friend, Johnson took a little while to reminisce about his      years as a musician, farrier and trader--and even play a tune      or two on his fiddle.       ``I've been playing a fiddle over 80 years,'' Johnson said      while sitting on the porch of his home, ``When I was six      years old, Daddy made me a little cigar box fiddle.       ``I started playing it, and that's all I wanted to do,'' he      continued, ``I got so where I wouldn't help Momma pack in the      water or wood, and she got mad and threw it out the window.       ``Eight days later, Daddy went to town and bought me a      three-quarter size fiddle. He brought it home, give it to      me, and told Momma ``This don't go out the window.' ''       Johnson kept playing his fiddle and before too many years      had passed, was traveling quite a bit to play music (In an      article about Johnson that appeared a few years ago in the      Russell Register, he was quoted as saying ``I found out it      was a lot easier to earn money by playing a fiddle at night      than it was to hoe in the fields all day long.'')       He played for a long time with String Bean, who later went      on to the Grand Ole Opry and also made many appearances on      Hee Haw.       He also played for a good while with Uncle Henry's Kentucky      Mountaineers. The group played weekly on a Lexington radio      station for three years, then got a chance to audition for      the Grand Ole Opry.       ``We went down there and played, and they offered to hire      us,'' he recalled. ``But, we decided not to go because it was      too far.       Uncle Henry's group also went to Chicago to perform for a      while, Johnson didn't go. ``Casey Jones took my place when      the band went to Chicago,'' he said.       Johnson also played at a weekly square dance that was held      in Columbia for two years, but in the 1940s, he gave up      playing his fiddle on a regular basis, and took up his other      two professions--shoeing horses and trading dogs.       Johnson shoed horses for many years--including many race      horses that raced at the country fairs in Russell and Adair      counties. He shoed so many Russell County Derby winners      (along with several Adair County Derby winners) that he was      given special recognition at the Russell County Fair one      year.       He kept on shoeing horses way past the time most people      would have retired, even shoeing 18 horses in one day when he      was 68 years old.       ``They always said it took a strong back and a weak mind to      shoe horses,'' he said, ``and I guess I was well qualified,      for I had them both.''       While he's played music and shoed horses for years,      Johnson's main reputation has been gained as a dog trader. In      dog trading circles, he's known all over Kentucky and several      other states.       ``I've been trading dogs for 55 years,'' he said ``I've      sold a many a load of dogs in North Carolina, Virginia,      Georgia and other states. I've owned a many a good dog, and a      lot that weren't no count at all.''       Johnson said that he traded fox hounds for 43 years, then      12 years ago switched to beagles. A few weeks ago, when he      was sick, he sold all the beagles he had.       ``I had six, and sold them all,'' he said. ``This is the      first time in 35 years that I haven't had a dog, but I'm      going to get me some more when I get able.''       On his being made a Kentucky Colonel at the age of 89,      Johnson admitted he was quite pleased to receive the      commission.       ``I'm proud to be a Kentucky Colonel, it's about the only      thing I've got now that I ain't got no dogs,'' he said. And,      referring to the Kentucky Colonel certificate, which lists      him as the Honorable Walker Johnson, he added, ``I've been a      long time finding out I was honorable--I was always called      something else.''                          ____________________
