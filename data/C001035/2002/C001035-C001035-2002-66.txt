President, I join Senator Levin in submitting a resolution that will designate the week of August 25, 2002, as National Fraud Against Senior Citizens Awareness Week. This designation of this week will increase public awareness of mail, Internet and telemarketing schemes that target elderly Americans. It is through increased awareness on the part of seniors, their families, and their caregivers that such schemes, which rob seniors not only of their hard-earned savings but of their dignity and self respect, can best be prevented.  This kind of fraud, unfortunately, is pervasive. Last year alone, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service responded to 66,000 mail fraud complaints, arrested nearly 1,700 mail fraud offenders, and secured nearly 1,500 convictions.  The elderly are often especially vulnerable, and they are frequently among the least able to afford being defrauded. The AARP, the National Association of Attorneys General, and the Federal Trade Commission have estimated that 85 percent of the victims of telemarketing fraud are age 65 or older.During hearings of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that I chaired last June on mail, Internet and telemarketing fraud, several elderly witnesses testified about how they had been defrauded of thousands of dollars and the resulting hardships caused by the loss of their life savings.  Mrs. Ann Hersom of Acton, for example, testified that her 80-year-old husband, formerly a successful businessman, had fallen prey to devious telemarketers and clever mail solicitations. She estimated that he lost $20,000 to these schemes, and described how devastating these losses had been to their family.  The telemarketing fraud industry is a highly mobile, sophisticated racket that very often involves ``boiler rooms'' in which hundreds of people make high pressure calls, sometimes 16 hours a day, seven days a week. These fraudulent telemarketers often gear their pitches to elderly citizens living alone and fearful of not having sufficient funds for their remaining years. In fact, it appears that some unscrupulous telemarketers may select their elderly victims by using lists to target those who have recently placed a spouse in a nursing home. Thus, the friendship and compassion these telemarketers appear to offer come when the elderly are particularly vulnerable to such enticements.  Foreign countries have unfortunately become a source of entry for lottery, sweepstakes and advance-fee-for-loan scams that prey upon Americans through direct mail and telemarketing. According to Federal Trade Commission figures, U.S. consumers filed nearly 13,000 complaints against foreign companies during calendar year 2001. Similarly, the dollar value of losses reported by consumers against these companies is nearly $25 million. In the first quarter of 2002, U.S. consumers have filed nearly 7,000 complaints against foreign companies.  How do we fight such fraud? The first line of defense against mail, Internet and telemarketing fraud is to promote public awareness of the dangers of such crimes, the types of schemes in which criminals are likely to engage, and what consumers can do to report fraudulent overtures and help law enforcement officials catch up with the con artists.  National Fraud Against Senior Citizens Week is designed to do just that. During the week of August 25, 2002, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, together with the Senior Action Coalition, a grassroots multi-agency organization based in Pittsburgh, will launch a national multi-media fraud prevention campaign. The campaign will be kicked off with events in Washington, DC, Maine, and elsewhere.  The campaign will include radio and television public service announcements by national spokesperson Betty White. On Sunday, August 25, announcements in newspapers will run in the 13 states that recorded the most complaints of fraud by seniors, including Maine. Poster displays highlighting the problem and what seniors and their caregivers can do to protect themselves and report fraud will be displayed in post office lobbies and other public areas, and mailers are planned to be sent to seniors. Designating National Fraud Against Senior Citizens Awareness Week will help reach a wide segment of America's elderly and those who care for them with the time-honored advice of: ``If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true.''                          ____________________
