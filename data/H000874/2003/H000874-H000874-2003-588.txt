Speaker, I rise today to recognize Thomas Stone High School in Charles County Maryland, for its ranking among the nation's top 700 most demanding public schools as reported in Newsweek. I would like to commend Thomas Stone High School on incorporating a curriculum that challenges and advances the abilities of all students who attend this public school.  The 2003 Challenge Index rated each school by analyzing the number of advanced placement or International Baccalaureate tests taken by students in the high school and the number of graduating seniors from that school in a given year. Those schools who received a rating of 1.0, which meant that the number of students graduating was less than the number of tests given, were considered above average and included in the index. Based on this ratings scale, Thomas Stone High School achieved the ranking of 364th in schools across the nation who met this 1.0 rating.  The Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB), a European based program, are courses students can take which have a more challenging curriculum and prepare the students for their endeavors at the collegiate level. In addition to this, these exams also allow the individual students to earn college credit depending on the score they receive on the exam.  Thomas Stone High School includes 1916 students with 392 of those graduating this year. Out of those 392 students graduating, the school expects 72 percent to attend a college or university. To aid students in continuing their education the school estimates that nearly 4.2 million dollars has been spent on scholarships. Students are allowed to participate in nineteen Advanced Placement courses, as well as scholar's courses and the JROTC. Thomas Stone High School has a student who sits on the State Board of Education as well as the County Board of Education. The school has Board Certified teachers and the Principal, Mr. Heath Morrison, was named the Maryland Association of Student Council's Principal of the Year. It is easy tosee how such remarkable students can thrive at Thomas Stone High School.  The faculty and staff, along with the students, are responsible for this honor. Principal Heath Morrison as well as the five Vice Principals: Janice Johnson, Ellen Linton, Curry Werkheiser, Wendell Martin, and Frazier Nelson all helped to encourage the students to strive for and achieve their goals.  Mr. Speaker, Thomas Stone High School has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to its entire student body by offering numerous courses that provoke the minds of each and every student. I would like to congratulate Thomas Stone High School on achieving such an honor and wish the faculty, staff, and students continued success in the future.                          ____________________
