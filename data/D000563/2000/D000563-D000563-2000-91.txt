President, I rise today to recognize Tony Romolo, in whose honor the Anthony C. Romolo Training Center in Mt. Sterling, Illinois, is being dedicated this month.  Tony Romolo was the Center's founding administrator and is now the longest-serving training administrator within the Laborers' International Union of North America.  As administrator, Tony has been responsible for creating policies that have guided the procedures and management of the training center, including the development of training goals and priorities. His leadership has resulted in the training of thousands of laborers throughout Illinois.  The Laborers' Training Program was one of the first within the State of Illinois to receive accreditation from the Illinois Department of Public Health for teaching environmentally beneficial courses in asbestos abatement. Mr. Romolo also oversaw the creation of the Construction Craft Laborers' Apprenticeship Program that was approved February 3, 1997.  Tony Romolo's work has been diverse but unwavering in its commitment to improving the skills of our nation's workers. We are fortunate to have dedicated, hard-working men like Tony in our society today. Illinois is a better place because of his commitment to the working men and women of our state and country.                          ____________________
