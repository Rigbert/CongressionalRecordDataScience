 President, I wish to pay tribute to a native son of Iowa as he prepares to leave the nest he has diligently feathered for more than three decades. A journalist who has earned his keep for 34 years at the Des Moines Register, David Yepsen honed his skills as a fair and balanced reporter upon whom his readers grew to depend to separate the wheat from the chaff.  With a few strokes of the keyboard, David Yepsen cut through layers of political posturing to identify stalemates at the statehouse or expose stonewalling from Terrace Hill. A no-nonsense newspaperman, David built a reputation for his astute understanding of Iowa politics and policymaking on the local, State, and Federal levels of government. From local boards of education to county seats of government, statehouse politics, and the Presidential campaign trail, David Yepsen knew how to boil down an issue and size up a candidate's prospects.  Like most Iowans, pomp and circumstance isn't his style. The genius of his political commentary is his ability to cut off grandstanding and get down to brass tacks. If the political leadership got bogged down in partisan gridlock, David would simply explain to voters in his next column how their elected representatives were baling political hay on the public's dime instead of ironing out the looming State budget deficit.  A shrewd journalist, David Yepsen understood how to cultivate contacts and build a reputation built on trust and truth. Cut from the gold standard cloth of journalism, David exercised independence and discovered that loyalty, like representative government, is a two-way street. No doubt the mutual agreement or lively disagreement with his subjects, readers, and publishers made his job all the more satisfying.  Although schooled decades before the Internet, blogs, and other tools delivered news to our laptops and cell phones, this seasoned reporter embraced the 24-hours news cycle. His profession bears the responsibility and privileges granted by the freedom of the press in American society. He upheld his end of the bargain by holding officeholders, public officials, and candidates accountable to the people. But he didn't fall victim to the ``gotcha'' style of ambush journalism that adds to public cynicism about the media and politics.  Instead, David fell back on his commitment to fairness and evenhandedness. That is the legacy David Yepsen will leave behind as he pursues the next chapter in his professional career. Next month, he will hang up his press credentials to assume leadership of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.  As I mentioned earlier, David Yepsen for more than 30 years has earned his paycheck and served the public as a reporter and political columnist at the Des Moines Register. For more than three decades, he immersed himself whole hog into politics, issues, and campaigns that have colored Iowa's landscape from the Missouri to the Mississippi Rivers. David earned a scholarly grasp of public policy that will prepare him well for his new position. Hot-button issues in recent times have included regulating hog lots; legalizing gambling; preparing for natural disasters and flood control; consolidating government from the courthouse to the schoolhouse; harmonizing Iowa's production agriculture heritage with sustainable stewardship of our natural resources; investing in renewable energy; bringing 21st century technology to rural areas; developing tourism, parks, and trails; balancing needs of an aging society; addressing Iowa's ``brain drain'', handling immigration; and juggling interests of labor and business or rural and urban. Instead of treating these issues as lightning rods that polarize people, David took the opportunity to challenge Iowans, whether newcomers or oldtimers, to find common ground that would make our State an even better place to work, raise a family, enjoy a vacation, earn a world-class education, and retire.  David could slice through the debate with a lucid and logical reminder about just why it matters to taxpayers if the gas tax is raised during a recession or why Iowa lawmakers should seize the opportunity to take bold steps to restore and improve crumbling infrastructure projects. He provoked Iowans to think outside the box, choosing flattery or insult when necessary.  David faced the relentless scrutiny of his readers and also enjoyed many personal and professional rewards. Iowa's David Yepsen was often called upon by national news organizations for his respected analysis of Presidential politics. His departure leaves behind a big set of footprints in the fields of Iowa journalism and politics. I will really miss seeing ``what Yepsen had to say in the Register'' but wish him all the best.                          ____________________
