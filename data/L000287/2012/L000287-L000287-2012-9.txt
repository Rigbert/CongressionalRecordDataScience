Madam Speaker, again this year, the Republican budget would end Medicare's guarantee to our seniors. The Republican budget takes aim at the very heart of our moral obligation to our seniors.  Medicare has been both a blessing and a lifeline for our seniors and the disabled. Our seniors have worked alifetime to make our country great, and we will not break our promise that Medicare will be there for them in their retirements. Medicare is at the core of our social compact. It is at the heart of what has made our Nation strong. We must not turn Medicare into a voucher program. We will not--we must not--balance our budget on the backs of our seniors.                          ____________________
