They want to keep doing, in fact, more of the same thing, but they want to pretend they are doing something else. And then they come up with all sorts of words. Like I said, they banned the word outsourcing at the White House. Mr. Mankiw was taken to the woodshed and beaten severely for having been so truthful about what they are doing. He is an academic; and he thought, well, I should put up the theory to show why it is what we are doing what we are doing. So they want to keep exporting America and our jobs and outsourcing, but they are going to call it something else.  I think it is particularly bizarre that their new manufacturing czar, who it took 6 months to find, is over in China and unavailable for comment because he is building a plant over there. That kind of goes to the issue too.
