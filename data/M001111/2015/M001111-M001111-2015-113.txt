 President, again, I really want to thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Tennessee, for working with me on this bipartisan bill. Senator Alexander and I are both committed to fixing the current law known as No Child Left Behind.  I am glad we are having this very important debate on the Senate Floor. Nearly everyone agrees that No Child Left Behind is badly broken. As I have traveled around my home State of Washington over the past decade, I have heard from so many of my constituents--from teachers in the classroom to moms in the grocery store to tech company CEOs--that we have to fix this law.  Our bipartisan bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, is a good step in the right direction. It gives our States more flexibility while also including Federal guardrails to make sure all students do have access to a quality public education. I am looking forward to improving and strengthening this bill throughout the process on the Senate floor and beyond. I am going to continue working on helping our struggling schools get the resources they need, and I will be focused on making sure all our kids, especially our most vulnerable students, are able to learn and grow and thrive in the classroom.  This bill could not be more important for students across the country, and it is critical for the future of our Nation. When all students have the chance to learn, we strengthen our future workforce, our country grows stronger, and we empower the next generation of Americans to lead the world. So I am looking forward to getting to work and hopefully moving forward on fixing No Child Left Behind and making sure all of our students can learn regardless of where they live or how they learn or how much money their parents earn.  I join with Senator Alexander in encouraging our colleagues to file their amendments so that we can continue making progress on this very important piece of legislation.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
