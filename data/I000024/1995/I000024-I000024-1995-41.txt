 Let me just conclude and speak only for myself. I have listened to the President. I thought the President would come out with something new that has not already been part of the debate. There was not one new argument or element introduced into the debate in the President's statement last night.  In the absence of that, knowing that each hour that goes by the President is deploying more Americans into that hostile area, I have to get on record right here in this body, Mr. President, as saying I will fight with every fiber of my being to stop the President from sending troops in on the ground into Bosnia.                          ____________________
