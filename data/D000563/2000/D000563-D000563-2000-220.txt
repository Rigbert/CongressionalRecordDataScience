In fact, what we have done is present a proposal that says if you are in a situation where two wage earners get married and their joint income raises them to a higher tax rate, we protect them. Basically, we voted, if I am not mistaken, to say to those taxpayers: Take your pick. You can file a joint return. You can file a single return. We have a proposal that will protect you from being penalized for your marriage. The Republicans, unfortunately, go one step beyond solving the problem and create a problem. They create a problem because they not only remove what they consider to be the marriage penalty, although their approach is only half hearted--they provide a marriage bonus. In other words, those couples who get married and don't pay higher taxes because of combined joint income receive a tax break under the Republican plan. So it goes far beyond solving the additional problem that was identified. It creates a new problem because it creates a new expense, a new drain on the Treasury, a new expenditure of our surplus.
