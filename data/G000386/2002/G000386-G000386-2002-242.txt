 President, today I rise in recognition of the steadfast service and commitment of a principled man of God, Reverend Kenneth Dykstra of Pella, IA. Reverend Dykstra served in the capacity as Senior Pastor of Third Reformed Church in Pella from 1969 to 1979. During this period he was involved and actively participated in two extremely consequential missionary trips, one to India and the other to Mexico--both with the Reformed Churches of America.  Kenneth Dykstra devoted the next 8 years of his admirable career to prison inmates through a Bible study ministry as the Senior Pastor with the Worthington Reformed Church in Worthington, MN.  Reverend Dykstra returned home to the beautiful state of Iowa in 1987 to retire in the Dutch community of historic Pella. Knowing ``true'' retirement for a pastor is rarely an option, he served in a variety of roles including mentor for a church's new pastor and as a Minister of Calling with focused attention on visitations to shut-ins and nursing home residents.  Kenneth Dykstra's significant contribution to not only those his ministry touched, but also the entire State of Iowa, in no way goes unnoticed. I thank and commend him today for all of his dedication, commitment and positive influence on those fortunate enough to know him.                          ____________________
