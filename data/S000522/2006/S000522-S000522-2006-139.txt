Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 365) urging the Government of China to reinstate all licenses of Gao Zhisheng and his law firm, remove all legal and political obstacles for lawyers attempting to defend criminal cases in China, including politically sensitive cases, and revise law and practice in China so that it conforms to international standards.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 365       Whereas, since November 2005, the Beijing Judicial Bureau      has shut down the law firm and suspended the license of Mr.      Gao Zhisheng, one of China's best known lawyers and legal      rights defenders;       Whereas Mr. Gao has represented citizens of China in      lawsuits against various local and administrative      governmental bodies of the People's Republic of China over      corruption, land seizures, police abuse, and violations of      religious freedom;       Whereas Mr. Gao wrote 3 open letters to President Hu Jintao      and Premier Wen Jiabao condemning the methods employed by the      Government of China in implementing its ban on ``evil      cults'', such as the Falun Gong and an additional letter      documenting severe persecution of Christians in Xinjiang      Uighur Autonomous Region;       Whereas Mr. Gao's law practice filed a petition to appeal      the verdict against Cai Zhuohua, who was found guilty of      ``illegal business practices'' based upon his distribution of      Bibles and religious material;       Whereas Mr. Gao's home has been constantly monitored by      agents from the Ministry of State Security and Mr. Gao was      prevented by the Public Security Ministry from meeting with      the representatives of the United Nations Special Rapporteur      on Torture during his November 2005 visit to Beijing;       Whereas agents of the Public Security Bureau of China,      numbering between 10 and 20, have consistently monitored the      activities and whereabouts of Mr. Gao, his wife, and his      daughter since late November 2005;       Whereas, on November 10, 2005, an open letter, signed by      138 organizations worldwide, was submitted to President Bush      calling on him to voice support of Mr. Gao and his legal      practice during the President's November 2005 visit to China;       Whereas other human rights lawyers, collectively known as      ``rights defenders'', or Wei Quan, have also faced      harassment, arrest, and detention for their consistent and      vigorous activities to defend the fundamental rights of the      people of China, contrary to measures within the law of China      protecting human rights and rights of lawyers;       Whereas Mr. Chen Guangcheng, a blind human rights lawyer      who has exposed cases of violence against women, including      forced abortion and forced sterilization perpetrated by      authorities of China under the 1-child policy, was beaten on      October 10, 2005, and currently remains under house arrest;       Whereas law professor and People's Political Consultative      Congress Delegate, Xu Zhiyong, who advocates on behalf of      petitioners filing grievances with the Central government in      Beijing, was also beaten on October 10, 2005, when meeting      with Chen Guangcheng;       Whereas Mr. Yang Maodong (also known as Guo Feixiong), a      lawyer representing villagers in Taishi village who attempted      to oust their village head in peaceful elections, has been      arbitrarily detained repeatedly and remains under consistent      surveillance by security agents;       Whereas Mr. Tang Jingling, a Guangdong based lawyer also      working on the Taishi village elections case, has been fired      from his law firm and was beaten on February 2, 2006, after      attempting to meet with Yang Maodong;       Whereas, on February 28, 2006, the Joint United Nations      Programme on HIV and AIDS (also known as ``UNAIDS'') office      in China expressed concern regarding the disappearance of Mr.      Hu Jia, an activist who worked to organize the legal defense      of AIDS patients in Henan Province, and who has been placed      in detention and has not been permitted to contact his      friends and family since February 16, 2006;       Whereas, according to the Department of State 2005 Country      Reports on Human Rights Practices, lawyers who aggressively      tried to defend their clients continued to face serious      intimidation and abuse by police and prosecutors, and some of      these lawyers were detained;       Whereas the Constitution of China states that the courts      shall, in accordance with the law, exercise judicial power      independently, without interference from administrative      organs, social organizations, and individuals, but in      practice, the judiciary is not independent and it receives      policy guidance from both the Government of China and the      Communist Party, whose leaders use a variety of means to      direct courts on verdicts and sentences, particularly in      politically sensitive cases;       Whereas the Criminal Procedure Law of China gives suspects      the right to seek legal counsel, but defendants in      politically sensitive cases frequently find it difficult to      find an attorney;       Whereas the Lawyers Law of the People's Republic of China      states that a lawyer may ``accept engagement by a criminal      suspect in a criminal case to provide him with legal advice      and represent him in filing a petition or charge or obtaining      a guarantor pending trial'';       Whereas according to Article 306 of the Criminal Law of      China, defense attorneys can be held responsible if their      clients commit perjury, and prosecutors and judges in such      cases have wide discretion in determining what constitutes      perjury;       Whereas according to the All-China Lawyers Association,      since 1997 more than 500 defense attorneys have been detained      on similar charges, and such cases continued during the last      year despite promises made by the Government of China to      amend Article 306;       Whereas the State Department's 2005 Annual Report on Human      Rights states that China's human rights record ``remained      poor'', that authorities of China quickly moved to suppress      those who openly expressed dissenting political views, and      that writers, religious activists, dissidents, lawyers, and      petitioners to the Central Government were particularly      targeted;       Whereas directly following their August 2005 visit to      China, the United States Commission on International      Religious Freedom found that--       (1) the Government of China actively seeks to control and      suppress the activities of unregistered religious      organizations;       (2) China has outlawed unregistered religious organizations      and provides severe penalties for engaging in unregistered      religious activities;       (3) leaders of unregistered Protestant organizations have      come under increased pressure to register their churches and      affiliate with one of the government approved organizations,      and those who refuse, for theological or other reasons, are      subject to harassment, detention, arrest, and closing of      their religious facilities;       (4) groups determined by the Government of China to be      ``evil cults'', such as Falun Gong, are brutally suppressed;      and       (5) practitioners of Falun Gong have experienced severe      persecution, including arrests, numerous detentions, torture,      irregular trials, imprisonment, and subjection to the      reeducation through labor system, whereby accused criminals      are subject to up to 3 years detention;       Whereas despite questions raised by the Government of the      United States and others about the charges made against      Pastor Cai Zhuohua, the Government of China sentenced Pastor      Cai and other members of his family to 3 years in prison for      ``illegal business practices'' for their printing and      distribution of religious materials;       Whereas, according to China's Regulations on Religious      Affairs, promulgated in March 2005, any religious      organization that carries out activities without registering      with the government is subject to civil punishment and to      criminal prosecution;       Whereas since the promulgation of the Regulations on      Religious Affairs, the Government of China has stepped up its      efforts to eliminate unregistered religious activity, with      raids on ``house church'' Christian groups in several      provinces, resulting in detention of hundreds of leaders of      the house church, dozens of whom remain in custody; and       Whereas the Government of China has, on several occasions,      stated a commitment to ratify the International Covenant on      Civil and Political Rights, but has delayed ratification      since signing the document in 1998: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That --       (1) Congress--       (A) commends ``rights defense'' lawyers and activists of      China for their courage and integrity, and expresses moral      support for this grass-roots ``rights defense'' movement in      China;       (B) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China,      at all levels, to cease its harassment of Mr. Gao Zhisheng,      overturn the suspension of his license to practice law, and      restore his legal right to represent the clients of his      choosing as protected by China's own Constitution, its      Criminal Procedure Law, and its Lawyers Law;       (C) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to repeal Article 306 of the Criminal Code of China, which      provides penalties for lawyers whose clients are accused of      perjury and has been used to curtail the active legal defense      of individuals accused of political crimes;       (D) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to undertake measures to further amend the Lawyers Law to      ensure lawyers' rights to investigate charges brought against      their clients, to provide a vigorous defense of their      clients, and to remain free of harassment and intimidation      throughout the course of representing clients, including      clients who are charged with offenses related to political or      religious activities;       (E) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to respect fully the universality of the right to freedom of      religion or belief and other human rights;       (F) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to ratify and implement in law the International Covenant on      Civil and Political Rights, and to adopt such legislative or      other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the      rights recognized in the Covenant;       (G) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to amend or repeal Article 300 of the Criminal Code of China      so it is consistent with international law, and to halt its      crackdown on spiritual movements;       (H) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to halt arrests, harassment, and intimidation of leaders of      unregistered religious organizations on the basis that their      organizations violated the law by not registering with the      Government of China;       (I) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to Amend the Regulations on Religious Affairs to conform more      closely with the internationally recognized freedom of      thought, conscience, religion or belief and allow all      religious believers in China to practice their religion      without interference from the government or from government      sponsored ``patriotic religious associations'';       (J) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to release Pastor Cai Zhuohua, his wife, and others      imprisoned with him, and to allow Pastor Cai to resume      religious activities and to resume leadership of his      congregation in Beijing; and       (K) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to invite the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human      Rights on freedom of religion or belief to China as promised      according to an agreement between the Ministry of Foreign      Affairs of China and the Department of State of China in      March 2005; and       (2) it is the sense of Congress that--       (A) the Government of the United States should support      democracy and human rights programs that strengthen      protection of basic rights and freedoms, and should initiate      programs to train lawyers, judges, academics, and students in      China about international human rights law, to inform      citizens of China about international human rights norms, and      to build organizations and associations to promote these      priorities;       (B) the Government of the United States should seek grant      proposals and fund programs to promote legal protections and      cultural awareness of the right to the freedom of religion or      belief commensurate to ongoing rule of law programs funded by      the Human Rights and Democracy Fund for Chinese workers,      women, and public interest law training; and       (C) the President should raise the issue of the Government      of China's harassment, arrest, detention, and persecution of      rights defense lawyers and activists and the need for the      Government of China to respect the basic human rights of its      citizens and the rule of law during his planned meeting with      Chinese President Hu Jintao in April 2006.
