Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  I deeply regret my friend from Washington has not read the bill. This bill has nothing to do with Enron, and it specifically states that claims like the Enron claim are not covered by the differing jurisdictional provisions of this. The Enron claim involves tax law, Federal tax law where the jurisdiction is in the Federal courts. It involves securities law, Federal securities law where the jurisdiction is in the Federal courts.  On page 14 of the amendment in the nature of a substitute, this bill's jurisdictional aspect is exempt from the internal affairs or governance of a corporation that arises under or by virtue of the laws of a State in which such corporation or business enterprise is incorporated or organized. So everything that the gentleman from Washington has said relating to Enron is simply not true under the terms of the bill.  Now, finally, that would be the case if Enron were not in bankruptcy. Because they are in bankruptcy, all claims are presented to the Federal bankruptcy court.  Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gentleman from Washington, please read the bill.
