 President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the William E. Bivin Forensic Society--the debate team at Western Kentucky University, located in Bowling Green, Kentucky--for their recent victories at the national collegiate debate championships.  In mid-March, Western won the Delta Sigma Rho--Tau Kappa Alpha Lincoln-Douglas Debate Championships at Miami University in Ohio. Two members of the team, Mike McDonner and Aaron Whaley--were co-national champions in the individual competition.  Then, in April, Western also won at the National Forensics Association tournament at Western Illinois University, defeating Ohio State University by a 5-0 decision. Mike McDonner again captured the individual title, and teammate Kerri Richardson was a semifinalist. In addition, Kristin Pamperin and Doug Morey were quarterfinalists. Other varsity members of the victorious Western Kentucky team were Amanda Gibson and Aaron Whaley. Novice debaters Mitchell Bailey, Jennifer Cloyd and Brian Sisk also contributed to the team title.  These two debates comprise the national championships in college debating circles, and it is extremely rare that one team wins both events. Amazingly, this is second time in three years that Western Kentucky has claimed both debates. The winning tradition being built in Bowling Green is a testament to the strong leadership of the team's coach, Judy Woodring.  Mr. President, Western Kentucky University's debate team is building quite a tradition. I offer my congratulations to Coach Woodring and to all the members of the Bivin Forensics Society for another great year. With two national championships in three years, I expect that we may be seeing the beginning of a dynasty in Bowling Green.                          ____________________
