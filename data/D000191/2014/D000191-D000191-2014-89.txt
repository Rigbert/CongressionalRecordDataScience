Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for his advocacy on this issue. It is critical that we recognize the sacrifice of law enforcement officers on an ongoing day-to-day basis here in the United States of America, those who have sacrificed and given their lives in the past and those who will continue to serve selflessly into the future.  In 1984, Congress authorized the Memorial Fund for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Nine years later, Congress passed the National Law Enforcement Museum Act to establish a National Law Enforcement Museum adjacent to the existing memorial in Judiciary Square.  Raising money, even for the most meritorious of causes, in developing a design acceptable to all of the affected parties, is laborious and time consuming. Tremendous effort has been expended on this. They are making great progress, but they need a little bit more time.  This legislation brought to us by the gentleman from Maryland would extend the deadline by 3 years, which most parties feel will be adequate to see the museum to completion.  With that, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).
