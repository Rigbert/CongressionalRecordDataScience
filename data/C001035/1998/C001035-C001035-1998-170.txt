I believe that is one of the purposes of this bill. For example, am I correct in believing that parents whose children attend public schools could use the money set aside in these savings accounts to purchase a computer, for example, or to hire a tutor to help their children, or perhaps to pay for a school trip--again, all related to the public schools? Is my understanding correct?
