 President, I rise today to praise the Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Obama's illegal recess appointments. Article II, section 2 of the Constitution provides for only two ways in which Presidents may appoint certain officers:  First, it provides that the President nominates and, by and with the advice of the Senate, appoints various officers.  Second, it permits the President to make temporary appointments when a vacancy in one of those offices happens when the Senate is in recess.  On January 4, 2012, the President made four appointments.
