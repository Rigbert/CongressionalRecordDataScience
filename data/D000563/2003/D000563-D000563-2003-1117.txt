President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning this bill I am introducing today with my colleague from Ohio, which will help many Medicare beneficiaries who have had organ transplants.  Last year over 4,400 people died while waiting for an organ transplant, including 257 in my home State of Illinois. Currently, over 80,000 Americans are waiting for a donor organ with 4,349 waiting in Illinois. It is this scarcity that has fueled the controversy over organ allocation.  Given that organs are extremely scarce, Federal law should not compromise the success of organ transplantation. Yet that is exactly what current Medicare policy does, because Medicare denies certain transplant patients coverage for the drugs needed to prevent rejection.  Medicare does this in several different ways. First, Medicare does not pay for anti-rejection drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, who received their transplants prior to becoming a Medicare beneficiary. So for instance, if a person received a transplant at aged 64 through their health insurance plan, when they retire and rely on Medicare for their health care they will no longer have immunosuppressive drug coverage. Transplanation is the only medical condition that Medicare treats as a pre-existing condition so as to deny a Medicare beneficiary a health care service that would otherwise be covered.  Second, Medicare only pays for anti-rejection drugs for transplants performed in a Medicare approved transplant facility. However, many beneficiaries are completely unaware of this fact and how it can jeopardize their future coverage of immunosuppressive drugs. To receive an organ transplant, a person must be very ill and many are far too ill at the time of transplantation to be researching the intricate nuances of Medicare coverage policy.  Finally, Medicare has a special program for End Stage Renal Disease, ESRD, patients. Medicare pays for their dialysis at a cost of over $100,000 per year and provides for all their health care costs. However, it a transplant becomes available to an ESRD patient, Medicare only provides them with health care for three years post-transplantation. The fact is, however, that they will need to use immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their life to maintain their transplant. But after the three years are up, their entire Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage is terminated. If that person's transplant is rejected because they can no longer afford their immunosuppressive drugs, then Medicare will again pay for their dialysis and all of their health care costs. This is ludicrous. It would make more sense for Medicare to continue to provide them with the lifesaving immunosuppressive drugs that they need.  The bill that I am introducing today, the ``Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients of 2000 Act'' would remove these short-sighted limitations. The bill sets up a new, easy to follow policy: All Medicare beneficiaries who have had a transplant and need immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of their transplant, would be covered as long as such anti-rejection drugs were needed.  I am introducing this bill on behalf of some of the constituents that I have met who are unfortunately very adversely affected by the current gaps in Medicare coverage.  Richard Hevrdejs was a Chicago attorney in private practice until 1993. Unfortunately, he suffered a debilitating heart attack that year, which left him unable to work and on disability. In 1997 suffering from congestive heart failure, he was placed on a Heart-Mate machine at the University of Illinois Medical Center, UIC. In April of 1998, he received a heart transplant at UIC but because UIC was not at the time a Medicare approved facility for heart transplants, Medicare will not cover his immunosuppressive drugs. Richard was near death when he had his transplant and was in no condition to research the intricacies of Medicare coverage policies. His drug costs are now around $25,000 per year. He gets some assistance from the drug company medical assistance plans and he has a Medigap policy that provides a little assistance. But for the most part, he is forced to watch all his savings dwindle because of Medicare's coverage gaps.  Anita Milton was from Morris, Illinois. In 1995, she became so disabled that she was no longer able to work and was forced onto disability. The following year, he lungs gave up and she had to have a bilateral lung transplant. Because Medicare is not available for 2 years after a person becomes eligible for disability, Anita was not on Medicare when she had the transplant. The huge bills for the transplant remained at collection agencies till her death several years ago. Because Anita was not on Medicare when she received her transplant, she did not receive Medicare coverage for the anti-rejection drugs that she needs. She received $940 in disability payments per month. She than went on Medicaid but due to the spend down requirements in Illinois, she had to spend $689 on drug costs to get Medicare coverage for her drugs. In effect she got coverage every second month. Anita couldn't afford her anti-rejection drugs and she tried to scale back on them. This caused her to nearly reject the transplant. Consequently, she lost a third of her lung capacity permanently. As Anita said at a Town Hall meeting in Chicago in January 1998 ``these Medicare and Medicaid rules make no sense.''  I am introducing this bill on the same day that another bill the ``Living Donor Access Act of 2003'', which I am an original cosponsor, is also being introduced by my colleague Senator DeWine. The ``Living Donor Access Act'' also seeks to improve the lives of transplant patients. The ``Living Donor Access Act'' would prohibit insurers in the group market from imposing additional premiums or preexisting condition exclusions on living organ donors. There are currently more than 25,000 living organ donors, but no law protects these individuals against discrimination in the group health insurance market. The two bills are good companions. It is important that we root out all discrimination against both those who have received transplants and those who are so generous as to donate.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, the ``Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients of 2003'', be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 178       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
