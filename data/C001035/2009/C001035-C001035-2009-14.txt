President, I rise today to discuss the conference report before us, which contains six of the seven remaining appropriations bills. Division D of the conference report contains the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill. As ranking member of the subcommittee responsible for writing this division, I want to thank Senator Durbin for his leadership and collegiality throughout the past year. Since joining this subcommittee, I have seen Senator Durbin demonstrate the kind of bipartisan cooperation that is the hallmark of the Appropriations Committee. He and I worked in a collaborative fashion to produce a bipartisan bill.
