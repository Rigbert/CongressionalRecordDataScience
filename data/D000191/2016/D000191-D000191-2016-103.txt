Speaker, I rise today as one who served from the creation of the Homeland Security Committee until just a couple of years ago.  I am concerned about what I am hearing here today on the floor, and I am surprised. Perhaps we should insert the word ``some,'' combating some terrorist recruitment in 2016.  Now, the chairman said that DHS certainly has the flexibility to address domestic terrorism. Well, that is true. But why leave out explicit mention of domestic terrorism?                              {time}  1645  Are you afraid of offending some rightwing nuts out there? What is the deal?  Seriously, I just went through this in Oregon. I have been on the Department of Justice and the FBI for about 2 years: Go get Cliven Bundy, get his cattle off the land, put the guy in jail.  They didn't do it. And what happened?  He taught his kids the way it was done. You show the government a gun, and they will run away, and you keep doing what you want, and you can deny that the Federal Government has the right to own any public lands in this country and try and take them over for private individuals.  Now, this is a serious threat. The Murrah building, there were no foreign terrorists involved, 168 dead, hundreds injured, and we can't explicitly put into this bill all terrorism, including domestic terrorism.  I really fear that some are worried that some of these rightwing extremist groups out there might be offended if we were to say that they are a threat to our Nation. Well, they are very much a threat, and this bill omitting that should have this bill denied passage on this floor and bring it back in a comprehensive way next week.  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan).
