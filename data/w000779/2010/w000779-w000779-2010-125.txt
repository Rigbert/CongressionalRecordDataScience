President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objeciton, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3301       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Online Voter Registration      Act of 2010''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Americans have become increasingly comfortable with      using the Internet for a wide range of purposes, including      gathering information, purchasing items, performing financial      transactions, and obtaining information and services from the      Government.       (2) In 2008, 74 percent of adults in the United States      reported using the Internet, according to the Pew Internet      and American Life Project. Of those adults, 89 percent      reported using the Internet to find information, 71 percent      made purchases over the Internet, 70 percent read news      online, 56 percent looked up campaign or political      information, 55 percent utilized online banking, and 59      percent visited Government Internet websites.       (3) The Internet is well-suited to allow individuals to      provide and update personal information. Completing such      tasks online saves time, reduces paper, increases efficiency,      and lowers costs.       (4) Many States already allow citizens to access Government      services online, including renewing driver's licenses and      registering cars.       (5) Two States, Arizona and Washington, have already      implemented online voter registration systems, and a number      of other States are in the process of adopting online voter      registration systems.       (6) Although 2008 was the first election cycle that the      online voter registration system was in place in Washington      State, in the month prior to the general election, voter use      of the online voter registration system exceeded that of      mail-in registration cards by more than 20 percent.       (7) Younger adults who are registering to vote for the      first time are the most adept Internet users and expect to be      able to accomplish most tasks online. In 2008, 87 percent of      adults age 18 to 29 used the Internet. In Washington State,      voters age 18 to 24 had the highest rate of use of its online      voter registration system.       (8) During the 2008 election cycle, Washington State      processed about 130,000 online voter registration      transactions.       (9) Implementing an online voter registration requires an      initial investment to purchase the needed technology and to      input existing voter information into the registration      database. Washington State, for example, spent $278,000 to      establish its online voter registration system.       (10) Once in place, online voter registration systems allow      the processing of new voter registrations, changes of address      or party, and requests for absentee ballots.       (11) Washington State reports that it costs approximately      25 cents to process paper voter registration cards and 43      cents to process those submitted via the department of motor      vehicles in compliance with the National Voter Registration      Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.). Voters must also pay      postage costs for registration cards sent through the mail.      Once in place, the online voter registration system requires      no processing by staff in order to complete a transaction,      and therefore has no per transaction cost. For the 2008      general election, the online voter registration system saved      Washington State $32,500, and saved consumers $54,600 in      postage costs, which resulted in total savings to the State      and consumers of over $87,000.
