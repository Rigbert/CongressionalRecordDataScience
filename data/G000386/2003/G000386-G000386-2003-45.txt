 President, there is an issue that my colleague from Iowa brought up that I don't want to take exception to or argue with him about. He finds fault with something on page 53 of this bill called noninterference. That is perfectly legitimate for him to take that point of view. But I want to point out something that Senator Santorum had pointed out earlier in the day's debate, in which a very similar noninterference provision was in a Democrat prescription drug proposal introduced May 10, 2000.  I don't mind intellectual arguments against this, but when Republicans take a Democrat idea and put it in our bill, I don't think it is fair for colleagues on the other side of the aisle to find fault with what we are doing. I only want to make that point. I don't want to argue with my friend from Iowa. I think everybody ought to know that this is something that has had broad bipartisan support.  I yield the floor.
