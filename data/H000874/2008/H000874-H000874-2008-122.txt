Hoekstra. Wouldn't it be true that if he would use ``forthwith,'' what he wants to do could be accomplished right now? We would all support it. It is a worthy objective.  Unfortunately, Mr. Hoekstra, in the same motion where he says I want to do something says but I don't want to do it now; I am not sure when I want to do it.  I asked for unanimous consent, and I didn't get to do exactly what I think everybody in this House thinks is a good thing to do, and I will tell my friend we're going to do this. It's a good idea. But the advice you're getting is not good advice.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, ladies and gentlemen on my side of the aisle, this continues to be a political game. If you want to take my words down on that, you can do it. This is not accomplishing the objective.  This continues to be a pattern, and the American voters are pretty smart, and they understand when somebody says I want to do something, but by the way, I want to kill the vehicle at least temporarily that accomplishes my objective, at the same time, they think to themselves something is not right.  So, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you. We're hopefully going to reject this motion, which sidetracks this important intelligence authorization bill, which everybody has said is an important bill, but I will tell you further, we're going to accomplish the objective of Mr. Hoekstra next week because it's a good objective.  But the fact of the matter is we could accomplish it right now if you didn't want to try to make some political point out of it on this intelligence bill, and you can say ``oh'' all you want. You can say ``oh'' all you want, but that is the truth and you know it. You know it in your heart, and you know it in your mind.  I urge my colleagues: reject this killing motion.                         Parliamentary Inquiry
