 President, before I yield the floor to my friend from Washington State, we are trying to work out a unanimous-consent agreement on the total 10 hours. I am not propounding such an agreement. But we are hoping we can work out an agreement, whereby in the closed session tomorrow, the so-called secret session that will take place tomorrow, which will be a 2-hour session, that that time not be counted against the 10 hours in the UC for debate on chemical weapons.  Again, I will leave it in the able hands of my friend from Arizona to determine whether the Republican leader is amenable to that, but colleagues who may be listening hopefully were able to do that. The reason I stand up to say that, if they are not, each of us only have about 55 minutes left tomorrow in this process. So for the colleagues who wish to speak, I want them to understand that I am not going to have the time to give them if in fact this doesn't happen. This is by way of disclaimer this evening, so tomorrow morning my colleagues won't come in and say: Joe, you promised me time.  I think we can work it out.  Mr. President, we now yield a total of 7 minutes, 3\1/2\ from each side, to the distinguished Senator from the State of Washington.
