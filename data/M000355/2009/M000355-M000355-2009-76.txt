 President, today I would like to reflect on the life of a dear friend, the late A. Robert Doll. Bob, as he was affectionately known, was a well-known lawyer, leader, and volunteer in his beloved Louisville community. His passing is a great loss, but his legacy lives on in the business and organizations he so dearly loved.  Mr. Doll was a founding member of the law firm Greenebaum, Doll & McDonald in Louisville. He joined the firm in the 1950s after receiving his law degree from the College of William and Mary. During his 50-plus years with Greenebaum, Doll & McDonald, Bob helped the firm grow from a mere 20 lawyers to a firm with multiple offices and 120 lawyers. When Bob was just 30 years old, he argued and won a case before the U.S. Supreme Court.  Mr. Doll showed his respect for his customers with the motto, ``I believe that a successful law firm must emphasize and create the delivery of prompt and exceptional legal service to the client--we must remember that the client is king.'' One of the great successes of his career was helping to bring the Toyota plant to Scott County. He also served as the president of the Louisville Bar Foundation. In 1986, Mr. Doll was named Lawyer of the Year by the Louisville Bar Association.  Bob was also active in his community, as he served as president of the Greater Louisville YMCA board of directors and maintained a leading role in the Boy Scouts of America. Phillip Scott, the current firm chairman of Greenebaum, Doll & McDonald, stated that ``Mr. Doll was not just a great lawyer, but a great man and great leader. He was a progressive leader who made Greenebaum the firm it is today. We deeply value the friendship, ideals and character he bestowed upon on us, and we'll miss him greatly.''  As a leader in his community, Bob Doll was a man of integrity who made a real positive impact in the Commonwealth. His devotion for creating and maintaining a client-focused business shows he always cared about serving the community first. He will be missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing him, and I ask that my colleagues join me in paying tribute to the wonderful life of Mr. A. Bob Doll.                          ____________________
