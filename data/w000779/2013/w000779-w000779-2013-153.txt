 As I discussed earlier this morning, yesterday's new report from the Congressional Budget Office highlights why it would be so important to have a conference committee between the House and the Senate go to work on the budget. What the Congressional Budget Office reported yesterday was a 24-percent reduction in the budget deficit--quite a remarkable projection. That, coupled with the improving jobs and housing numbers, we now have economic experts across the political spectrum--for example, people such as Glenn Hubbard, a leading Republican economist--saying it is important for the Congress to look at these long-term economic challenges. In fact, we have economic experts of both political parties saying Washington ought to be doing more about the long-term economic challenges and not just have the day-to-day battling.  Going to a budget conference will give us that opportunity. It will give us the opportunity to look at the 10-year budget window and particularly issues such as health care and taxes.  So in the name of dealing with the long-term economic challenges highlighted by yesterday's projections, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to; the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses; and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; all with no intervening action or debate.
