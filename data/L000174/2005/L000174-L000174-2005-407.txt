President, I would concur completely with the Senator from Kentucky on the people he has praised. He has left out one, himself. I praise the work he has done. We worked very closely together on this. I know that Tim Rieser on my side worked so closely with Paul Grove, and I appreciate the bipartisan nature of that. I thank Kate Eltrich; the newest member on our side, Jennifer Park; of course, Paul Grove, Tom Hawkins, Harry Christy, and LaShawnda Smith on the chairman's side. It has been very good. I think we could probably go on to final passage.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me reiterate what a pleasure it is to work with Senator Leahy. I have enjoyed our relationship over the years.  There is a request for a vote on final passage. I believe we are ready for that. I assume the yeas and nays need to be required.
