Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come to this side of the Chamber because I wanted to speak especially to my Republican colleagues.  Later today, the House will consider a privileged resolution regarding the conduct of a former Member of this House. I do not want to get into the particulars of what the former Member said and did during his visit on the House floor yesterday. What I want to do is to appeal to my Republican friends to stand up for the integrity, order, and decorum of this House when a vote is taken on this resolution.  No Member of this House should be subjected to verbal abuse, harassment, or intimidation by anyone, not on the floor of the House of Representatives. This vote goes to the heart of this beloved democratic institution. I appeal to my Republican colleagues to stand up and later vote for the privileged resolution. Send a message that offensive language, threats, and intimidation will not be tolerated on the floor of the House of Representatives.                          ____________________
