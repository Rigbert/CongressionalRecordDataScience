President, I must oppose this budget because it is an irresponsible gamble with our economic future.  This resolution sets aside trillions of projected budget surpluses for tax cuts proposed by President Bush that are steeply tilted to the wealthy. It pays for the Bush tax plan at the expense of needed investments in Social Security, Medicare, education, law enforcement and the environment. In addition, the cost of the Bush tax plan imperils our ability to pay off the national debt so that this nation can finally be debt free by the end of the decade.  We should remember that the nation still carries the burden of a national debt of $3.4 trillion. Like someone who had finally paid off his or her credit card balance but still has a home mortgage, the federal government has finally balanced its annual budget, but we still have a national debt to pay off. In the meantime, the Federal government has to pay almost $900 million in interest every working day on this national debt.  Paying off our national debt will help to sustain our sound economy by keeping interest rates low. Vermonters gain ground with lower mortgage costs, car payments and credit card charges with low interest rates. In addition, small business owners in Vermont can invest, expand and create jobs with low interest rates.  I want to leave a legacy for our children and grandchildren of a debt-free nation by 2010. We can achieve that legacy if the Congress maintains its fiscal discipline. But this budget resolution tosses out fiscal responsibility for voodoo economics. It is based on a house of cards made up of rosy budget scenarios for the next ten years. Any downturn in the economy, are of which we are now beginning to experience, threatens to topple this house of cards.
