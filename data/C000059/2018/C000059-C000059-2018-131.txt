Speaker, I rise today in proud recognition of the Operation Recognition Class of 2018. Operation Recognition is a program organized by the Riverside County Office of Education, with assistance from the Riverside County Department of Veteran's Services, that presents diplomas to residents of Riverside County who missed completing high school due to military service in World War II, the Korean War, or the Vietnam War, or due to internment in WWII Japanese-American relocation camps.  Riverside County's Operation Recognition is modeled after programs implemented in other states. Numerous county offices of education and school districts throughout California operate similar programs. The programs are yet another way to express our appreciation and gratitude for the significant contributions and sacrifices made by our veterans.  The Operation Recognition Class of 2018 includes: Raymond Guzman Casares, U.S. Marine Corps, Korean War; Jerry Kenneth Arnold, U.S. Marine Corps, Korean War; Steve P. Stone, U.S. Army, Vietnam War; ``Ron'' Robert Jackson, U.S. Coast Guard, Korean War; Jack Stanley Griner, U.S. Navy, World War II; Charles John Whatley, U.S. Army, World War II; Pat S. Baca (posthumously), U.S. Army, World War II; Kenneth Bruce Weiner, U.S. Army, Vietnam War.  On behalf of all Riverside County residents and a grateful nation, I want to thank these veterans for their service to our country and congratulate them on being part of the Operation Recognition Class of 2018.                          ____________________
