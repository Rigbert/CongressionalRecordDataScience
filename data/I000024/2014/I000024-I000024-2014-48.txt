Scripsick who, along with three other Marines, succumbed to injuries sustained after a suicide bomber attacked their position in Anbar province north of Baghdad, Iraq on September 6, 2007.  Bryan was born August 21, 1985. Although the family home is in Wayne, OK, he graduated in 2004 from Pauls Valley High School, where he played safety and wide receiver on the football team.  Rather than pursuing his dream of playing college football, Bryan chose to join the Marine Corps right after his 19th birthday in August 2004. He was assigned to 3rd Assault amphibian Battalion, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Pendleton, CA and was on his second tour to Iraq.  More than 100 people filled the First United Methodist Church for a memorial service held on September 13, 2007. Burial took place at the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Pauls Valley, OK. At the cemetery, members of the Marine honor guard carried the casket to the gravesite where the flag was folded above the casket and presented to Bryan's parents and his brother. He was then honored with three volleys from a rifle party and the playing of taps.  Bryan is survived by his parents Jon and Jan Scripsick, and his brother Brett Scripsick of Pauls Valley, OK.  Today we remember Marine Corps Cpl Bryan J. Scripsick, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                          ____________________
