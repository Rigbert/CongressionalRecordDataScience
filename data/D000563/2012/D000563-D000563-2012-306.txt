Last month, the Criminal Courts Building was renamed the Honorable George N. Leighton Criminal Court Building in tribute to a remarkable man.  Judge George Leighton, who turns 100 years old this October, has excelled as a lawyer and judge and has embodied the ideals of the American dream.  George Leighton was born in 1912 in New Bedford, MA, to African immigrants. As a young boy, Judge Leighton picked fruit for several months each year to help support his family. Then just before he should have started seventh grade, he left school to take a job on an oil tanker in the Dutch West Indies.  George Leighton never finished grade school or high school, but he heard that a scholarship fund was offering a $200 scholarship for the winner of an essay contest, and he submitted the winning essay. In 1936, with his $200 scholarship, he hitchhiked to Washington, D.C., to attend college. He was granted conditional admittance to Howard University, where he graduated magna cum laude 4 years later.  In 1940, George Leighton joined the United States Army's 93rd Infantry Division. When he returned to the United States after the war, he was accepted at Harvard Law School. He graduated from Harvard and passed the Illinois State Bar Examination.  He then moved to Chicago because he was impressed that Chicago had elected an African American congressman, William Dawson. He set up a law practice next to the old Comiskey Park onChicago's South Side. And he began fighting courageously to break down barriers of racial discrimination in voting, housing and education.  In 1949, George Leighton became an Assistant Illinois Attorney General. When he advised one group of African-Americans that the law did not prohibit them from moving to the Cicero neighborhood, an all-white neighborhood at the time, race riots erupted. Judge Leighton was indicted for inciting the riot. An up-and-coming lawyer named Thurgood Marshall came to the defense of Judge Leighton, argued the case, and the indictment was dismissed.  In 1964, Mayor Daley asked Leighton to run for circuit court judge, and he won the election in a landslide. He then moved into his office at 26th and Cal, the Cook County Criminal Courts Building.  In 1969, Judge Leighton was appointed to the First District Appellate Court of Illinois, where he served as the first African-American judge on the Illinois Court of Appeals. Six years later, he was nominated by President Gerald Ford to serve as U.S. District court judge for the Northern District of Illinois.  George Leighton has been a life-long champion of civil rights and equality. There is no more fitting a tribute than to name the building in which Judge Leighton first began practicing law some 66 years ago in his honor.  Judge Leighton contributed to our understanding of justice. He stood up to powerful interests in defense of the truth and did not bend to pressure or prejudice in his pursuit of justice. He served the people of Illinois and the citizens of the United States proudly throughout his tenure on the bench.  I thank Judge George Leighton for his service and join the Chicago community in congratulating him on this new honor.                          ____________________
