Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of H.D. ``Dill'' Mullis, a truly great Alaskan and a good friend.  Dill Mullis was born on March 13, 1935 in Jacksonville, FL to H.D. and Sara A. Mullis. He graduated from Andrew Jackson High School and the University of Florida.  Following his undergraduate education, Dill courageously joined the armed forces. He was an Air Force pilot and Vietnam veteran. His military decorations include: The Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star; Air Medals, Meritorious Service Medal, RVN Cross of Gallantry and RVN Air medals.  After his honorable and courageous service to his country, Dill joined the ITT Company in 1971, where he was assigned to Anchorage in the military contracts and commercial operations division. Subsequently, he was involved in the construction, operations, and maintenance in support of the exploratory drilling program in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and various projects throughout Alaska.  Dill was a quintessential Alaskan and he will be dearly missed. His courage, tenacity and independence helped to show everyone around him, and the rest of the Lower 48, what it really meant to be an Alaskan.  He is survived by his wife, Beverly; daughters, Patricia Hopkins of Anchorage and Kathleen Matson of Eugene, Oregon; daughter in law, Cindie Mullis of Anchorage; sons, Stephen Mullis of Portage, Wisconsin, and Mark Mullis of Hong Kong, China. He is also survived by 12 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.                          ____________________
