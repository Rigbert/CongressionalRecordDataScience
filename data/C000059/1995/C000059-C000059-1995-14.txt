Speaker, on opening day of the new Republican Congress we voted to have an independent audit of all House financial records. This week we fulfilled our promise.  Republicans are committed to having regular future audits. We will continue to monitor our progress and instill faith in the American people.  This audit is a symbol of the new Republican Congress and our commitment to openness and reform.  The auditors found that the Democratic controlled 103d Congress had gross disregard for financial controls, business-like practices and frequently waived congressional rules.  We Republicans have already implemented a number of reforms suggested by the auditors. This audit is a road map for future management improvements and for the sake of the American taxpayer we must stay on this course.  The American people deserve this type of government. That is what they voted for on November 8, and that is what the Republican Congress will deliver.                          ____________________
