I hope they will reconsider and join with us in a constructive way to enact comprehensive immigration reform. We do not need more divisiveness and derision. This bill is not the bill I would have designed. It includes many features I do not support and fails to include many that I do. Nonetheless, I will support cloture and will continue to work to enact bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2006.     Hon. George W. Bush,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear President Bush: Last week over my objection the Senate      adopted an amendment to the comprehensive immigration bill      that seeks to place restrictions on the Government and its      communications in languages other than English. I was      extremely disappointed that your Administration did not speak      out against the divisive amendment and help us work to defeat      it.       Attorney General Gonzales said after the fact that you have      ``never been supportive of English only or English as the      official language.'' The Attorney General indicated over the      weekend that his reading of the Inhofe amendment ``would not      have an effect on any existing rights, currently provided      under federal law.'' I note that you continue to use Spanish      on the official White House website, indeed you include a      translation into Spanish of the radio address you gave last      Saturday on immigration.       I write to ask whether you intend to continue to adhere to      Executive Order 13166 if the Inhofe amendment is enacted into      law. This Executive Order was adopted by President Clinton in      August 2000 to improve access to federal programs and      activities. In 2002, your Assistant Attorney General for      Civil Right reaffirmed support for the Executive Order and      indicated that your ``Administration does not plan to repeal      Executive Order 13166.'' What would be the effect, if any, on      Executive Order 13166 and its implementation if the Inhofe      language adopted by the Senate were to become law?           Respectfully,     Patrick Leahy,     Senator.     Ken Salazar,     Senator.                             Cloture Motion
