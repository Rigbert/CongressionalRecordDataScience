  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me say that if we get this unanimous consent agreement, all those Members who have asked to have amendments considered will have them considered. All of the votes on those amendments will take place tomorrow, or tonight by voice. So what I am saying is there will be no further rollcall votes. And all of the debate, with the exception of, I believe, 7 minutes for one Member, and the intervening times, will take place this evening. I am going to propound that request.                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only remaining first degree amendments in order, other than the committee-reported substitute, that no second-degree amendments be in order and that all amendments must be offered and debated this evening: The Biden amendment; the Bingaman amendment; the D'Amato-Sarbanes managers amendment; the Boxer amendment, re: insider trading; the Specter amendment, re: fraudulent intent; the Specter amendment, re: rule 11B; the Specter amendment, re: stay of discovery.
