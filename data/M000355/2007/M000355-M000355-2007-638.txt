 President, just briefly, I got the Warner resolution language about 7 o'clock. There are others on our side of the aisle, including Senator McCain, Senator Graham,Senator Cornyn, and others, who are deeply involved in this issue and interested in how it is going to be disposed of. Senator Warner has done his usual thoughtful job. He is probably the Senate expert on our side of the aisle in these matters, and his views of which way the Senate should proceed carry a lot of weight in the Senate. But I cannot at this late hour agree to this proposal tonight.  Having said that--and these will be my last thoughts, I believe, for the evening--I do think there ought to be a way to work this out. We have made considerable progress on our side of the aisle in narrowing down the proposals that we might want to offer. And I still think the preferred way to do it--and I think the majority leader believes this as well--is to have a number of different concurrent resolutions in the queue. The distinguished Senator from Virginia has made it clear that he is very uncomfortable, as he just expressed himself a moment ago, with taking the bill approach to this. The majority leader has indicated that is not his preference either. I think the message is: Let's see if we can't craft a unanimous consent agreement that is fair to both sides so that we can have this important debate on this exceedingly important issue next week.
