Speaker, he went to the insurance industry and what does Bill Gradison say, a Republican, not a Democrat, a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, retired, what does he say? A member representing the insurance agency, he says this bill will not work. That is what Bill Gradison says, and the shame on this democratic body is that an issue that all of us agree is so critically important will not be fully debated consistent with the principle that Mr. Solomon enunciated in 1995 when the reformers took over this House.  How sad it is, how sad it is that we come here at this hour to debate one of America's most important issues, affecting millions and millions and millions of people. All of us, all of us have heard the lament of those individuals, be they female or male, who cannot pay their prescription drugs. It is our duty to reject this rule and to have a full and fair debate, consistent with the Solomon principles.
