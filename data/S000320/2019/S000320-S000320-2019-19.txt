 President, today I wish to honor the remarkable career of Ann Richardson McNair, who dedicated over 51 years of service to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Redstone Arsenal, both located in Huntsville, AL.

Mrs. Ann McNair has earned many recognitions and made history throughout her career, among them being the first female supervisor in engineering at Marshall. She was awarded the Team Redstone Women's History Award and the Technology Award for Women Honoring Women from the Women's Economic Development Council.
