The vote is going to take place in 1 minute and we all appreciate that.  I will repeat what I think is most significant: We have to pass this bill. The House is going to go home. There is no way of making any changes at this point. It has to pass. If it doesn't pass, when December 31 gets here, there will be 1.8 million enlisted personnel throughout the country at all of our establishments who are going to lose their benefits. I am talking about pilots' pay, flight pay. I am talking about the SEALS who have extraordinary duties and all the rest of them. These benefits will be taken away from our enlisted personnel if we don't pass this bill. In order to pass this bill, we have to pass this procedural vote that will take place right now.  So I encourage everyone to keep in mind, if my colleagues truly want to help our enlisted personnel, they have to have this bill and this bill has to pass now.
