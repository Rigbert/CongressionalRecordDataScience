We have so many unmet needs in my own community that spans a river called the Maumee River, the largest river that flows into the Great Lakes.  We built a new bridge, but the challenge there today is with the weather. Ice is forming on the tensile spans, and they have had to close the bridge for 3 or 4 days at a time, for fear that these ice plates will fall on trucks and cars. We have to fix this problem.  All these issues are all over the country, so the transportation and infrastructure bill is essential. I thought in discussing this tonight that I would put a couple of really important figures on the Record.  Congresswoman Hahn talked about ports and her championing the PORTSCaucus here and how much gets imported into our country and what gets exported. Well, here is a chart that gives you a sense of how many more imports come in here than exports go out.  Since the mid-1970s and then the passage of NAFTA here, this represents the growing share of imports over exports into our country. Since about 1975, our country has amassed $9.5 trillion in red ink with the world.  That is hard to imagine for most people, but that translates into 47.5 million lost jobs in our country just due to trade--not technology, but more imports coming in than exports going out. We have lost two-thirds of our manufacturing jobs.                              {time}  1715  So when the gentleman champions development in America which yields jobs in America, these are just the figures relating to one country with which we have held a massive deficit since the passage of NAFTA. NAFTA passed back in 1993. Our country moved into a gigantic deficit with Mexico.  Recently, I don't know if the--and this means lost American jobs, to other places, and our people struggling, wages not rising, more part-time work, fewer benefits.  I don't know if the gentleman was able to see what happened with the recent Department of Transportation ruling. They gave a green light to long-haul, cross-border trucking by Mexican-based carriers, despite lingering safety concerns.  It is the jobs, but it is also the safety that you talk about. The Department of Transportation simply looked the other way when the inspector general found serious flaws in the pilot program meant to test this new authority.  Once again, NAFTA led to the lowest common denominator for the continent. Foreign corporate interests trump the safety of the American people. And we know that flawed trade deals cost us jobs. They harm our economy, and they put people at risk on both sides of the border.  So it is time to start fixing the damage, not creating more. I thank the gentleman for allowing us the time to express our views this evening.
