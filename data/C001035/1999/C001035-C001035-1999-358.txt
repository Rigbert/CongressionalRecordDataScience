Washington County, for example, is a large rural area in which chronic poverty, unemployment, substance abuse and domestic violence result in far too many children being exposed to violence. Currently there is no program in these counties that offers adequate intervention and treatment to address the harmful aftereffects of exposure to violence. The Alliance will develop a system through which existing resources can be coordinated to provide appropriate and timely responses to the emotionally and physically damaging situations children often face. There is strong evidence that a rapid response team, intervening on behalf of children in crisis situations, can mitigate the long term consequences of trauma.
