There has been discussion about who benefits here, huge corporations and the like. The people who benefit here are the 100,000 home-based businesses in my State, the hardware store that the Senator from Connecticut is talking about.  The reason why that is the case is that the Internet is a great equalizer for those small businesses. The small businesses now that we are seeing in the State of the Senator from Connecticut and rural Oregon are having great difficulty today competing against the Wal-Marts of the world. They do not have huge advertising budgets like Wal-Mart. They don't have batteries of lawyers and accountants. These are small, entrepreneurial operations that now look at the Internet as a tool that can trampoline them into extraordinary economic opportunities they have never had.  Without this legislation and the good work that has been done by the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from New Hampshire, if you are a small, home-based business in Oregon or Connecticut, you may well face a good chunk of the thousands of taxing jurisdictions in our country looking at your business as a cash cow.  One of our colleagues said the threat here is the World Wide Web would become the ``World Wide Wallet'' if that kind of approach went forward.  So what the Senator was talking about with respect to that hardware store account is why I introduced this legislation early in 1997. That is the very kind of operation that I think we ought to be looking to grow in the 21st century.  I thank the Senator for yielding me this time. I heard his account of the hardware store from the Cloakroom, and I think some have said--in fact, I heard it again today--that this was about Amazon.com or someone like that. Those people are not going to be in need of this kind of approach. This is going to benefit the small entrepreneurs, the home-based business, the kind of person the Senator from Connecticut is talking about. I thank him for yielding me this time.
