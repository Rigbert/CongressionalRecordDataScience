President, I wish to remember the life and sacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army 2LT Jered W. Ewy. Along with one other soldier, Jered died July 29, 2011, of injuries he sustained when his unit was attacked with improvised explosive devices in the town of Janak Kheyl, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  After graduating from Putnam City North High School, Jered enlisted in the Army Rangers in 1998 and was one of the first on the ground in Afghanistan after the tragic events of September 11, 2001. He served three tours of duty and then joined the Oklahoma National Guard in 2003 and served as an instructor.  While serving in the National Guard, Jered attended the University of Central Oklahoma pursuing a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. ``What I wanted him to do was take the degree and get into law enforcement with the Department of Justice,'' his father, John Ewy said. ``He turned it down because he missed the camaraderie.''  While attending school he taught gymnastics in Edmond, OK. Although he was very involved in the community and truly enjoyed coaching the kids, ``Gym was just kind of a side job while he could finish up school,'' added Dena Edwards. ``I think the military was pretty much where his heart lies.''  In January 2011 he graduated from Officer Candidate School and was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma Army National Guard. He deployed to Afghanistan in June 2011.  ``This loss of life has shaken every member of the Oklahoma National Guard to their core,'' said MG Myles L. Deering, Adjutant General for Oklahoma. ``We have lost two very brave men who once raised their hands and took an oath to defend our nation. They courageously gave everything they had to ensure our freedom and safety and their sacrifice will not be forgotten.''  ``Jered was a man of integrity, discipline and honor who put everyone else first,'' family members wrote in his obituary. ``He cared deeply about the men he served with but his true passion in his life was his wife Megan and infant daughter Kyla.''  On August 11, 2011, the family held church services at Henderson Hills Baptist Church in Edmond, OK.  He is survived by his wife Megan of Edmond, daughter Kyla, mother Martha Nelson of Edmond, father and stepmother John and Ann Ewy of Moore, grandmother Harriet Ewy, siblings, Penny Clark and her husband Rob of Moore, Michelle Davis and her children Hayden, Colton and Cody, and Chad Nelson of Edmond, and many uncles and cousins.  Today we remember Army 2LT Jered W. Ewy, a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                   Sergeant Anthony Del Mar Peterson  Mr. President, it is my honor to also honor the life and sacrifice of Army SGT Anthony Del Mar Peterson, of Chelsea, OK who died on August 4, 2011, serving our nation in Paktya province, Afghanistan. Sergeant Peterson was assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry, 45th Brigade Combat Team, OK Army National Guard.  Sergeant Peterson died of wounds suffered during a dismounted patrol when a group of insurgents attacked his unit with small arms fire in the Zurmat district of Paktya province, Afghanistan. Anthony had previously been deployed to Afghanistan in 2006-2007.  My heartfelt prayers go out to Dakota Justice Peterson, the young son Sergeant Peterson left behind. I remain confident he will grow to learn of his father's heroism; and pray the honor of his father may be carried with pride and cultivate in him, the character of his father.  Upon hearing of Sergeant Peterson's death, MG Myles Deering, the Adjutant General for Oklahoma stated, ``Oklahoma has lost another brave son. Sergeant Peterson was an exceptional Soldier who worked tirelessly to protect the values that we as Americans hold close to our hearts.''  Sergeant Peterson has also been described as an excellent non-commissioned officer and a committed soldier. Another friend has said that he will remember his zest for life, and his passion to lead others to Christ.  Born December 8, 1986 in Sacramento, CA, Anthony graduated from Chelsea High School in 2005 and Rogers State University in Claremore, OK in 2008. He was active in Campus Crusade for Christ, Baptist Collegiate, Rescue (Outreach Program), and Stop Child Trafficking, OATH.  He enjoyed hiking, camping, canoeing, hunting, and spending time with his family and friends. The most important things in his life were: God, family, and his country. Anthony's favorite quote was, ``Come home with your shield--or on it.''  Anthony is survived by his son, Dakota Justice Peterson of Owasso, parents, Garth and Terra Peterson of Owasso, siblings: Robert Edward Peterson, and Brittany Nicole Louise Peterson both of Owasso, grandparents: Ed and Gail Peterson of Chelsea, Paula and Richard Jones of Post Falls, ID, Les Marubashi of Chelsea, and Toni and Frank Trejo of Coquille, OR, nephew, Carter Myles Thomas of Owasso, and numerous extended family members who loved him.  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Anthony's family. He lived a life of love for his son, family, friends, and our country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his life for our freedom.                     ARMY SERGEANT MYCAL L. PRINCE  Mr. President, I am also honored to remember Army SGT Mycal L. Prince. Sergeant Prince was tragically killed in action on September 15, 2011, in Saygal Valley, Laghman Province, Afghanistan when enemy forces attacked his unit with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.  Mycal was born July 16, 1983, in Chickasha, OK, to Harold and Arnetta--Schoolfield--Prince. After graduating from Ninnekah High School in 2001, he completed cleet training and served as a police officer in Rush Springs for 3 years. On October 25, 2001, he married Surana Smith in Chickasha, and they later moved to Minco in May 2009 where he served as a police officer with the K-9 Unit for 2 years.  Minco Police Chief Phil Blevins said, ``He was one of the most professional and squared away young men I've ever met. He had things together in his family life, in his professional life. It's unbelievable for a man who is 28 how mature he was in all areas of his life.''  Mycal was a member of Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry, Oklahoma National Guard. He deployed to Afghanistan for his third tour on July 29, 2011.  ``Sgt. Prince served his nation and this great state for more than a decade with honor and distinction,'' MG Myles L. Deering, Oklahoma's Adjutant General, said in a statement. ``He joined the Guard five days after his 17th birthday. I think that says a lot about the kind of man Sgt. Prince was. He deployed to help the people of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and went to Iraq in 2008. He could have gotten out of the service, but he chose to stay and serve his country.''  Mycal was preceded in death by his father, Harold Prince, one child, and his paternal and maternal grandparents. He is survived by his wife Surana of Minco, two daughters, Raelynn and Mycaela of Minco, mother, Arnetta Prince of Stonewall, sister, Leslie Dickenson and husband Wade of Stonewall, sister, Kathy Prince of Stonewall, and Cody Prince as well as many nieces, nephews, relatives, and friends.  Funeral services with full military honors were held on September 26, 2011, at Bridge Assembly of God Church in Mustang, OK. Mycal was laid to rest in Bradley Cemetery in Bradley, OK.  Today we remember Army SGT Mycal L. Prince, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                          ____________________
