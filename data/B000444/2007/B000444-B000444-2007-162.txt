 President, I would like to take the opportunity today to introduce an important piece of legislation to improve the ability of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide medical care for our Nation's Armed Forces and veterans. We are currently finishing up a debate in the Senate on additional war time funding for Iraq. As in past years, we are trying to mitigate the damage caused by the failure to properly plan for and manage the aftermath of Saddam Hussein's fall. I have spoken many times about how damaging this lack of planning has been to our efforts in Iraq and to our standing in the world.  For the past two months, the spotlight has shone on another administration failure in this war: the shameful conditions our wounded soldiers face as outpatients navigating the military health system when they return from Iraq or Afghanistan. This is another example of gross mismanagement and a strained system. To alleviate the strain on this system, I am offering legislation today--the Effective Care for the Armed Forces and Veterans Act--to improve the care that members of the Armed Forces and veterans receive at Walter Reed and other military medical facilities.  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that some of the reasons for concern at Walter Reed do not occur in the future. As the living conditions for outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center indicate, moving to private contracts for maintenance at military medical facilities can cause problems. After a private contract was awarded for maintenance and upkeep of buildings on the campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, a maintenance crew of approximately 300 was whittled down to 50 by the time the contract went in to effect. Many of the terrible living conditions in Building 18 that we read about in the Washington Post were a direct result of delays in building repair and maintenance because of a shortage in manpower. To prevent this situation from occurring again, this legislation calls for public-private competitions of maintenance services at military medical complexes to stop while our country is engaged in military conflicts. It also calls for a General Accountability Office review of contracting-out decisions for basic maintenance work at military facilities.  Other problems discovered at Walter Reed are directly attributable to shortages resulting from pressures to cut budgets for military medical services. These cuts cannot be tolerated at a time when military medical services are needed to treat servicemembers who have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. As such, this legislation would require medical command budgets to be equal to or exceed the prior year amount while the nation is involved in a major military conflict or war.  Another issue that the conditions at Walter Reed brought up is whether or not the facility should be closed as the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended. The Commission recommended building new, modern facilities at the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and at Fort Belvoir to improve the overall quality of care and access to care in this region. Military leaders have indicated that the planned closure has limited their ability to attract needed professionals to jobs at Walter Reed and there have been concerns raised whether adequate housing for the families of the wounded has been properly planned. To deal with that, this legislation requires the Department of Defense to submit to Congress within one year a detailed plan that includes an evaluation of the following: the desirability of being able to guarantee professional jobs in the D.C. area for two years or more following the closure in order to foster a stable workforce; detailed construction plans for the new facilities and for new family housing; and the costs and benefits of building all of the needed medical treatment, rehabilitation, and housing before a single unit is moved.  Another major problem and source of frustration for injured soldiers is the length of time it takes to receive a disability determination. In order to hasten the disability determination process, we need to ensure that the Department of Defense has information systems capable of communicating with those in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA has been a leader in implementing electronic medical record keeping, but we have to improve the capability of the Department of Defense to send electronic medical records to the VA to speed up the disability determination process. Making the disability determination system more efficient can reduce the stress on the soldiers and their families going through the determination process.  Caseworkers are also critical. They schedule appointments and make sure wounded servicemembers get the rehabilitative and follow-up care they need. As more and more soldiers and marines come home wounded, many military caseworkers are overwhelmed. To improve the care given to servicemembers, this legislation requires a minimum ratio of case managers to patients of 1 to 20, that case managers have contact with recovering servicemembers at least once a week, and that case managers be properly trained on the military's disability and discharge systems so they can better assist patients with their paperwork.  Currently, many combat veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have service-related mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Many have labeled TBI the ``signature injury'' of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. It is estimated that as many as 10 percent of those serving or who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan have brain injuries. Thatwould mean about 150,000 of the 1.5 million soldiers and marines who have served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom have suffered a brain injury. In many cases, these injuries are not diagnosed because there is not an external wound. Depending on the severity of these injuries, returning soldiers can require immediate treatment or not have symptoms show up until several years later. This legislation calls for every returning soldier to be screened for TBI. While the VA has announced plans to do this, it needs to happen in active-duty military medical facilities too. In addition, the legislation calls for a study on the advisability of treating TBI as a presumptive condition in every service's disability evaluation system, as well as the VA disability evaluation system.  We often hear about the 25,000 soldiers and marines who have been wounded in these wars--but that figure grossly underestimates the demand that the VA health care system faces. Since our country was attacked on September 11, 2001, more than 1.5 million soldiers have been deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and other locations. Of these, 630,000 are now veterans and, according to the Department of Defense, more than 205,000 have already received medical treatment through the Department of Veterans Affairs. A recent Harvard study on the long-term costs of treating these new veterans estimates that by 2012 more than 643,000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan will be using the VA system, an almost three-fold increase of what the system faces now. With a significant backlog of claims currently existing, the system is in desperate need of an upgrade. To address this concern, my legislation directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress a plan for the long-term care needs for veterans for the next 50 years.  It is our highest obligation to heal the hundreds of thousands of brave men and women who will bear the physical and emotional scars of these wars for the rest of their lives. Those of us who have the privilege of serving in Congress must act now to improve the medical care we provide to our Armed Forces and veterans.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1044       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Effective Care for the Armed      Forces and Veterans Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON COMPETITIVE SOURCING OF CERTAIN                    ACTIVITIES AT MEDICAL FACILITIES OF THE                    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) The health and recovery of wounded members of the Armed      Forces may be risked by competitive sourcing of services at      military medical facilities.       (2) The provision of medical services to members and former      members of the Armed Forces who were injured while serving in      Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom is a      basic service that is the responsibility of the Government      and any disruption is unacceptable when it risks the health      of veterans and members of the Armed Forces.       (3) The Department of Defense has attempted to implement      competitive sourcing of services at military medical      facilities despite the fact that doing so provides no      improvement in the efficiency or effectiveness of such      services.       (b) Prohibition on Initiation of Competitive Sourcing      Activities at Medical Facilities of Department of Defense      During Period of Major Military Conflict.--       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2),      during a period in which the Armed Forces are involved in a      major military conflict, the Secretary of Defense shall not      take any action under the Office of Management and Budget      Circular A-76 or any other similar administrative regulation,      directive, or policy--       (A) to subject work performed by an employee of a medical      facility of the Department of Defense or employee of a      private contractor of such a medical facility to public-     private competition; or       (B) to convert such employee or the work performed by such      employee to private contractor performance.       (2) Exception to prevent negative impact on provision of      services.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any action at a      medical facility of the Department of Defense if the      Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that not      initiating such action during such period would have a      negative impact on the provision of services at such military      medical facility.       (c) Study on Competitive Sourcing Activities at Medical      Facilities of Department of Defense.--The Comptroller General      of the United States shall assess the efficiency and      advisability of subjecting work performed by an employee of a      medical facility of the Department of Defense or a private      contractor of such a medical facility to public-private      competition, or converting such employee or the work      performed by such employee to private contractor performance,      under the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 or      any other similar administrative regulation, directive, or      policy.     SEC. 3. MINIMUM BUDGET FOR MEDICAL SERVICES OF THE ARMED                    FORCES DURING PERIOD OF MAJOR MILITARY                    CONFLICT.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Pressure to reduce the budget for the medical services      of the Department of Defense has contributed to many of the      current problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.       (2) It is inappropriate to reduce the budget for medical      services of the Department of Defense or the Department of      Veterans Affairs while such services are needed to treat      members of the Armed Forces or veterans who were wounded in      Iraq and Afghanistan.       (b) Minimum Budget for Medical Services.--       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), if      the Armed Forces are involved in a major military conflict at      the time the President submits the budget for a fiscal year      to Congress, the President shall not include in that budget a      total aggregate amount allocated for medical services for the      Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs      that is less than the total aggregate amount allocated for      such purposes in the budget submitted by the President to      Congress for the previous fiscal year.       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply if the      President--       (A) certifies to Congress that submitting a total aggregate      amount allocated for medical services for the Department of      Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs that is less      than that required under paragraph (1) is in the national      interest; and       (B) submits to Congress a report on the reasons for the      reduction described by subparagraph (A).     SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATION TO                    CLOSE WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) The final recommendations of the Defense Base Closure      and Realignment Commission under the 2005 round of defense      base closure and realignment include recommendations to close      Walter Reed Army Medical Center and to build new, modern      facilities at the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda      and at Fort Belvoir to improve the overall quality of and      access to health care for members of the Armed Forces.       (2) These recommendations include the transfer of medical      services from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the      National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and at Fort      Belvoir, but they do not adequately provide for housing for      the families of wounded members of the Armed Forces who will      receive treatment at such new facilities.       (3) The recommended closure of the Walter Reed Army Medical      Center has impaired the ability of the Secretary of Defense      to attract the personnel required to provide proper medical      services at such medical center.       (b) Limitation on Implementation of Recommendations.--The      Secretary of Defense shall not take any action to implement      the recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and      Realignment Commission under the 2005 round of defense base      closure and realignment relating to the transfer of medical      services from Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the National      Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and at Fort Belvoir during      the period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act      and ending on the date that is 60 days after the date on      which Congress receives the plan required under subsection      (c).       (c) Plan Required.--Not later than one year after the date      of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall      submit to Congress a plan that includes an assessment of the      following:       (1) The feasibility and advisability of providing current      or prospective employees at Walter Reed Army Medical Center a      guarantee that their employment will continue in the      Washington, DC, metropolitan area for more than two years      after the date on which Walter Reed Army Medical Center is      closed.       (2) Detailed construction plans for new medical facilities      and family housing at the National Naval Medical Center at      Bethesda and at Fort Belvoir to accommodate the transfer of      medical services from Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the      National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and at Fort      Belvoir.       (3) The costs, feasibility, and advisability of completing      all of the construction planned for the transfer of medical      services from Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the National      Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and at Fort Belvoir before      any patients are transferred to such new facilities from      Walter Reed Army Medical Center as a result of the      recommendations of the Defense Base     Closure and Realignment Commission under the 2005 round of      defense base closure and realignment.     SEC. 5. IMPROVING CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR MEMBERS OF THE                    ARMED FORCES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Case managers are important for scheduling appointments      and making sure recovering servicemembers get the care they      need.       (2) Many case managers are overwhelmed by the large number      of wounded members of the Armed Forces returning from      deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan.       (3) Regular contact between health care providers and      members of the Armed Forces returning from deployment is      important for the diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder      in such members.       (4) It is inappropriate to require a wounded member of the      Armed Forces or a family member of such member to provide a      photo or a medal from deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan to      prove that such member served in and was injured from such      deployment.       (5) Case managers are well qualified to assist recovering      servicemembers and their families with the disability      evaluation system and discharge procedures of the Department      of Defense.       (b) Case Managers.--       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall assign at      least one case manager for every 20 recovering servicemembers      to assist in the recovery of such recovering servicemember.       (2) Minimum contact.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure      that case managers contact each of their assigned recovering      servicemembers not less than once per week.       (3) Training.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that      case managers of the Department of Defense are familiar with      the disability and discharge system of the Department of      Defense and that such case managers are able to assist      recovering servicemembers complete necessary and related      forms.       (c) Recovering Servicemember.--In this section, the term      ``recovering servicemember'' means a member of the Armed      Forces, including a member of the National Guard or a      Reserve, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation,      or therapy, or is otherwise in medical hold or holdover      status, for an injury, illness, or disease incurred or      aggravated while on active duty in the Armed Forces.     SEC. 6. SCREENING FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Many of the members of the Armed Forces deployed in      Iraq and Afghanistan have brain injuries.       (2) In many cases, such injuries are not diagnosed because      there is no external indication of such injury.       (3) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs carries out programs      to screen all recent combat veterans for traumatic brain      injury; the Secretary of Defense does not do so.       (b) Screening Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall      screen every member of the Armed Forces returning from      deployment in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring      Freedom for traumatic brain injury upon the return of each      such member.       (c) Studies on Treating Traumatic Brain Injury as      Presumptive Condition for Disability Compensation.--       (1) Study by secretary of defense.--       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a      study on the feasability and advisability of treating      traumatic brain injury as a presumptive condition for members      of the Armed Forces who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or      Operation Enduring Freedom for the qualification for      disability compensation under laws administered by the      Secretary of Defense.       (B) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit      to Congress a report on the results of the study required by      subparagraph (A).       (2) Study by secretary of veterans affairs.--       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall      conduct a study on the feasability and advisability of      treating traumatic brain injury as a presumptive condition      for veterans who served as members of the Armed Forces in      Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom for the      qualification for disability compensation under laws      administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.       (B) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs      shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the study      required by subparagraph (A).       (3) Study by director of national institutes of health.--       (A) In general.--The Director of the National Institutes of      Health shall conduct a study on traumatic brain injury,      including the detection of traumatic brain injury and the      measurement and classification of the severity of traumatic      brain injury.       (B) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Director of the National      Institutes of Health shall submit to Congress a report on the      results of the study required by subparagraph (A).     SEC. 7. REQUIRING MEDICAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OF                    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO COMMUNICATE WITH                    MEDICAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OF                    DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The electronic transfer of medical records of members      of the Armed Forces from the medical records management      systems of the Department of Defense to the medical records      management systems of the Department of Veterans Affairs      would be prudent.       (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs has been a leader in      the implementation of electronic medical records management      systems.       (b) Electronic Communication Between Medical Records      Management Systems Required.--       (1) In general.--Not later than two years after the date of      the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall      ensure that the medical records management systems of the      Department of Defense are capable of transmitting medical      records to and receiving medical records from the medical      records management systems of the Department of Veterans      Affairs electronically.       (2) Initiation of activities.--Not later than one year      after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of      Defense shall begin any activities required to meet the      requirements of paragraph (1).     SEC. 8. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ASSESSMENT OF LONG-                   TERM CARE NEEDS OF VETERANS.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Multiple studies show that, in the next five years, the      Department of Veterans Affairs will add hundreds of thousands      of new veterans to the medical records management systems of      the Department of Veterans Affairs.       (2) During such period, many veterans will have multiple      medical care needs caused by complex medical conditions.       (b) Assessment of Long-Term Care Needs.--The Secretary of      Veterans Affairs shall assess the current ability of the      Department of Veterans Affairs to meet long-term care needs      of veterans during the 50-year period that begins on the date      of the enactment of this Act.       (c) Determination of Actions Required to Meet Long-Term      Care Needs.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall      determine what actions are required to ensure that the needs      described in subsection (b) are satisfied.       (d) Report Required.--Not later than one year after the      date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans      Affairs shall submit to Congress a report on the assessment      required in subsection (b) and the determination required in      subsection (c).                                 ______                                       By
