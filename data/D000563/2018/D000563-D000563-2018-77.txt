President, today I want to honor my friend Frank Libby for his extraordinary service to my home State of Illinois. Last month, after 42 years of service to the brothers and sisters of the Union Brotherhood of Carpenters, Frank Libby retired.  A decade after the Great Chicago Fire, in 1881, a group of 35 carpenter leaders met in a Chicago warehouse and hammered out an agreement to form a single, unified union. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters was born. Ever since, the Carpenters union has been a leader, building and growing communities by bringing countless skilled women and men to the construction industry.  Frank Libby is an outstanding part of that rich history. Throughout his career, Frank held a variety of positions. As a member of Local 10, he has served as warden, recording secretary, business representative, financial secretary-treasurer, and president for the past 24 years. In 2008, Frank became the 24th president/executive secretary-treasurer of the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters, representing working families across 72 counties throughout Illinois and eastern Iowa.  Under Frank's leadership, the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters flourished, becoming the largest building trades union in the State of Illinois with a membership in the tens of thousands. He fearlessly confronted the unprecedented challenges facing the union and had the courage to make the necessary decisions enabling the union to not only survive the great recession, but actually thrive.  If that wasn't enough, Frank Libby also served as a member of the executive board of the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters and the Chicago Federation of Labor and as a trustee on the Carpenters' Welfare and Pension Fund and the Carpenters' Apprenticeship Training Fund. Frank also served on the Illinois State Council of Carpenters' executive board and as a past board member to the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, but his legacy will be realized by the generations of carpenters who, because of his leadership and vision, will receive fair wages and healthcare for their family. Frank Libby has given the gift of peace of mind to countless future carpenters and their families, who can retire with dignity because of the benefits Frank fought to secure. They will know that Frank's hard work earned and ensured a safe work environment where carpenters return to their families at the end of each workday.  I want to congratulate Frank Libby on his distinguished career and thank him for his outstanding service to the people of Chicago. I especially want to thank Frank's wife Gail and their daughter Cynthia for sharing so much of their husband and father with our community. I wish him and his family all the best in their next chapter.                          ____________________
