 We obviously want to have all 12 of the appropriation bills signed. They all passed with an average of 285 votes in this House. There has not been less than 81 votes for any one of the Senate-passed appropriation bills to date. These bills have enjoyed broad bipartisan support.  Very frankly, the MILCON Quality of Life bill is $4 billion over what the President requested. We believe, and obviously the vote reflected, that it is at an appropriate level to ensure that our veterans and our active-duty military have the medical care that was promised to them. So we were pleased that that passed overwhelmingly, notwithstanding the fact that is over what the President has asked for, and he indicated he was going to veto bills if it was over what he asked for. What he really meant, apparently, was if they were over what he wanted.  These bills passed very substantially in both Houses. We would hope the President would come to the table. Mr. Obey and Mr. Nussle have had some discussions. I will tell you, those discussions have not indicated any movement at this point in time. They hope that will not be the case.  We want to see the MILCON bill signed. Frankly, we want to see the Labor-Health bill signed, which provides for a billion dollars more in basic biomedical health research on cancer, heart, lung, blood, diabetes and other diseases that inflict our citizens, and Pell Grant increases.  I appreciate the gentleman's observation regarding the MILCON bill, and I share his view. But I hope he also shares our view. Not all of the bills have passed with as big a margin, but an average of 285, indicating pretty good bipartisan support on all of these bills. And the case has been in the Senate, the ones that they have passed, that the President would discuss with us how we can get this process completed at levels that we can agree on and not be told to do.
