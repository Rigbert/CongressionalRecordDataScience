 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 12. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business for up to 60 minutes, with the first half hour under the control of the majority leader or his designee, and the second half hour under the control of the minority leader or his designee; provided that following morning business, the Senate begin consideration of S. 1248, the IDEA reauthorization bill as provided under the previous order.
