Speaker, unfortunately I was unable to record my vote on H.R. 267, the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act. I was detained by a very important meeting with Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber about issues critical to my rural communities and State.  I am a strong supporter of renewable energy and agree there's enormous untapped potential for hydropower. Reducing red tape, process, and cost to approve small, non-controversial hydropower projects is a no-brainer. I am pleased the bill passed 422-0 and would have voted ``yea'' had I been available. I look forward to supporting H.R. 267 in the future if the bill is amended and comes back to the House from the Senate.                          ____________________
