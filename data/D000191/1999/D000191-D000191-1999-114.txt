Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this is very important legislation for this body. As the chairman of the full committee has pointed out, it is supported strongly in a bipartisan manner. That is because almost all of the Members of this Congress and certainly the Members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure share a common concern in the Coast Guard's activities and giving them adequate resources to fulfill the burdens that we put on them.  The chairman has already gone on at some length, but I think it should be restated just so people remember, the Coast Guard does everything from local boating safety courses to search and rescue. If one is in trouble out on the water, they are the ones who respond. Sometimes in very hazardous situations, sometimes to loss of life to members of the Coast Guard, they are attempting to save mariners in distress.  They safeguard our borders by watching for smugglers and people attempting both to enter the country illegally or to enter drugs and other substances illegally into our country. They are our first line of protection for our coastal resources and the environment.  That leads me to some comments that are very close to home for me. The Coast Guard has been involved now for more than a month in the wreck of the New Carrisa which went aground in stormy weather outside the largest port in my district, very close to the mouth of the harbor.  The Coast Guard is still working on its own internal investigation and summary of the events that led up to this tragedy. I think there will be much to be learned from that critical review, perhaps some further changes in authority for the Coast Guard, changes of law regarding insurance of these freighters and other ships.  Today a freighter carries as much oil, these larger freighters, as did a small tanker 20, 25 years ago. They often carry more fuel than they need to accomplish their mission, as did this ship in this case, for ballast.  So the potential for oil spill no longer just extends to tankers and tanker safety, but now the potential for catastrophic oil spills extends to large freighters. Yet, they do not have the same insurance requirements that we put on tankers, nor do they have the same hull safety requirements we put on tankers; and those are critical issues that we will need to look at in the future to safeguard our precious coastal resources here in the United States.                              {time}  1345  I am very pleased that this bill, with unanimous vote in the committee, and hopefully a similar vote here on the floor of the House, includes some modest initial amendments for changes in the law that I have proposed as I became educated as to what happens when a foreign ship is headed towards the United States. And in this case, had these provisions of law which are in this bill today by my amendment been in effect, we might not have had the New Carrisa tragedy on the coast of Oregon; we might not have despoiled our precious coastal waters.  The Coast Guard, under this bill, will now be notified 24 hours in advance before a ship crosses into our 12-mile territorial limit. The Coast Guard will have the authority to hold a ship at that 12-mile limit if they have questions about the safety of the ship, the competence of its crew, or other extraordinary circumstances are intervening that could jeopardize safety.  In this case, the New Carrisa was on a list the Coast Guard keeps called the ``Watch List''. The ``Watch List'' is composed of ships that are known to the Coast Guard to have problems or to be registered in countries that are known to abide or to basically not fully enforce, rigorously enforce, international maritime rules. Panama, in this case. Liberia and other countries are also in question.  This ship was on the ``Watch List'', and it would have been boarded once it reached the harbor. Unfortunately, it never reached the harbor because it went aground, I believe due to the misconduct of the captain, and it caused an ongoing and unfolding tragedy on the Oregon coast. This could happen anywhere in the United States of America.  Under my legislation, the Coast Guard would be able to hold a ship on the ``Watch List'', ask them a number of questions about the condition of the vessel, the crew, etcetera, out at 12 miles. And if the Coast Guard was concerned about their capabilities or conduct or their navigational capabilities, they could require a pilot be put on board. They could require other actions be followed by that ship once it has entered into our territorial waters.  In this case they may have well have told the ship to hold off out 12 miles, where it was safer, because there was a huge storm brewing and the pilot could not get out to them.  These are tools that the Coast Guard, I believe, will be able to prudently employ and, hopefully, avoid this happening again in Oregon or anywhere else in the United States. There may well be other measures we need to take, and next week, when we hold a hearing to review the oil spill liability legislation on the 10-year anniversary of the Exxon Valdez tragedy, I believe we will see a path to other changes in law that are necessary.  Beyond that, the money in this bill is a good amount of money. Personally, if I had license, I would give the Coast Guard more money to conduct their mission. I believe that, in fact, they are operating in a very frugal manner, particularly compared to the other uniformed services, and they are spending our taxpayer dollars wisely and in a way that most all Americans are grateful on a daily basis.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
