Speaker, I am constrained to say that the gentlewoman mentioned the progrowth administration. We had some 98 months of growth following the worst recession she and I have experienced in our lifetimes under the policies of the Bush administration.  Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the worst financial collapse since the Great Depression, the Congress enacted, over the opposition of our friends in the Republican Party, mostly, the Dodd-Frank reforms to safeguard our economy and safeguard consumers.  When we passed Dodd-Frank in 2010, no one believed it was perfect. No legislation is ever perfect. There is nothing wrong with evaluating Dodd-Frank 8 years after it was enacted to determine what is working well and where we might improve.  Many Democrats, myself included, support providing regulatory relief to community banks, and we ought to do that in a bipartisan fashion--not just a few bipartisan participants, but in a bipartisan fashion.  I have talked to the ranking member. She has indicated that that is something that she supports as well. However, the bill on the floor today goes much further and would weaken the rules that Dodd-Frank put in place.  It would undermine the regulatory framework for all banks. This would roll back parts of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, stress tests for large banks, and bank capital requirements.  It would also, as has been noted, raise the threshold for the automatic designation of systemically important financial institutions from $50 billion to $250 billion.  The changes that are proposed risk making our Nation's financial system vulnerable to another crisis that would require yet another taxpayer bailout.
