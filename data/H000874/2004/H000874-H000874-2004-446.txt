Speaker, this June 22nd, a courageous young man was taken from our midst. Thirteen-year-old Matthew Stepanek was full of life, happiness, and brilliance.  Mattie, as he liked to be called, had a lifelong struggle with muscular dystrophy, but never let the disease curb his enthusiasm, nor hinder his creativity. In 2001, Mattie courageously stated, ``My life mission is to spread peace to the world.'' Despite losing his battle with muscular dystrophy at such a young age, Mattie managed to spread happiness to the world through his poems.  Mattie began writing poetry at age three to cope with the death of a brother. In his short life, this tireless young man wrote five volumes of poetry that sold millions of copies. Three of the volumes reached the New York Times' best-seller list.  Mattie is survived by his loving mother Jeni, who first recognized Mattie's talent and wrote down his poems for him. Unfortunately, Jeni also suffers from the adult-onset form of the disease. The disease also took the lives of his two brothers and sister.  Mr. Speaker, today, I ask this House to celebrate and remember the life of Mattie Stepanek. He was a brave young man whose genius impacted everyone who encountered him. His selflessness, courage, and talent are something we can all honor and admire.                          ____________________
