Speaker, I rise to honor the life of the Imam Abdelmoneim Mahmoud Khattab, Imam Emeritus of the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo. Imam Khattab passed from this life on September 15, 2001 after courageously battling cancer.  The Imam was born in a village near Cairo and eventually attended Al-Azhar University in Egypt. He received both undergraduate and graduate degrees in that ancient institution of learning. After graduating he worked briefly for the Egyptian consulate in Calcutta, then returned to Al-Azhar to lead the Institute of Foreign Languages. In 1964, the university appointed him to direct the Canadian Islamic Center in Edmonton, Alberta. While there, he received a second graduate degree, in Sociology, from the University of Alberta and completed work toward a doctoral degree from the University of Waterloo.  Prior to his arrival in Northwest Ohio in 1980, Imam Khattab was the director of London, Ontario's Islamic Center. His arrival in Toledo preceded the groundbreaking of our own community's Islamic Center, and he guided its construction and philosophy. A decade later, he led the effort to establish a chair of Islamic Studies at the University of Toledo and he established a training center at the Islamic Center for students of Al-Azhur to train to become Imams for American Muslim communities.  Imam Khattab was truly a man of enlightenment. His wise and thoughtful counsel could be counted on even in the most troubling of times, and he was both friend and mentor to many. Quietly persistent, combining his senseof humor and powers of persuasion, he led the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo on a path of prominence not only in our community but our country. Imam Khattab's successor, Imam Farouq Aboelzahab, described his theology: ``When he talked about Islam, he talked about Islam as a religion of love and humanity. He represented Islam as a religion that cares about human beings, regardless ethnicity, national background, or religion. He committed himself to that goal.'' Noted as an original thinker, Imam Khattab was a true religious scholar whose teachings put him on the cutting edge of Islam in North America. Years ahead of many of his contemporaries in terms of interpretation of Islam, The Islamic Center's President noted, ``He's done so much for Islam. He never had any barriers. Nobody was ever categorized. He didn't differentiate between men and women. . . . He wasn't just the religious leader. He was in our homes. He was our friend, our father, our brother, our uncle.''  Able to make religion both global and personal, Imam Khattab earned an international reputation for bringing disparate groups together. Not only did he bring together the 22 ethnic groups that made up the families of his mosque, but also he promoted unity among all religions, focusing on the common themes between Islam, Christianity, and Judaism.  Although he retired and returned to Ontario in 1998, Imam Khattab remained an integral part of the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo, returning to the mosque weekly. He also served on many regional and national organizations including the Council of Imams of North America, the World Call council, and Michigan's Interfaith Roundtable.  Our deep condolences to Imam Khattab's wife Fauzia, children Khalid and Huda, brother and sisters Muhamad, Soad, and Zuhrah, as well as the entire community of the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo. The Imam may be gone in body, but his spirit lives on through the millions of lives he touched and his legacy is carried through our own work now and in the future as we build on his foundation of faith.                          ____________________
