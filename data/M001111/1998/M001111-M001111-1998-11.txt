 President, yesterday the Senate passed the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Conference Report. I seek clarification from the Chairman on two matters related to flood control measures along the Cowlitz River in Washington state necessary to mitigate impacts from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. That eruption reduced the Cowlitz River channel capacity to one tenth of its pre-eruption level. In 1985, Congress enacted Public Law 99-88 which authorized and directed the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) to construct, operate, and maintain a sediment retention structure with such design features and associated downstream actions as are necessary. An October 1985 Decision Document identified specific levels of protection for Cowlitz River communities, consistent with risk assessments and NED criteria.
