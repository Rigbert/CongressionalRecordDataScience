 President, if I might comment through the Chair, what I learned from our caucus is that what my colleague has just stated is true in general, but there is some higher commitment in the Sarajevo area. I am not certain of this, but I believe I understood the Secretary to say that they would defend against the shelling of Sarajevo. I am sure someone will straighten this out for certain later in the debate, but that is what I understood today.
