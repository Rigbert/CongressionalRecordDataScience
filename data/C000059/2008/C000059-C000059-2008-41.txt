Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Becky Gunnoe is one of these individuals. On January 19, 2008, Becky received the city of Corona's top honor when the Corona Chamber of Commerce named her Citizen of the Year for 2007 at the organization's 93rd annual awards and installation dinner at the Eagle Glen Golf Club.  Becky Gunnoe exemplifies the word ``volunteer.'' For more than 20 years, Becky has touched the lives of many people through her volunteer work in many programs and services in Corona. As a founding member in 1996, Becky was the catalyst for the Trauma Intervention Program (TIP) coming to Corona, including funding, training, and attracting volunteers. TIP is a group of specially trained citizen volunteers who provide ``emotional first aid'' to victims of traumatic events and their families in the first few hours following a tragedy. The volunteers are called to a crisis scene or to a local hospital by authorized police officers, firefighters or hospital personnel. Now in its 11th successful year, the program has a close working relationship with all the local emergency agencies because of Becky's continued efforts. She is responsible for training not only the volunteers, but also the emergency personnel.  Becky has also served on the Corona Fire Safety Foundation Board, CFSF, for the past 5 years, and currently is its president. She has also been with the Community Police Community Partnership, CPCP, since October 1997 and served as president from 1999 to 2001. A joint fundraiser of these two organizations called the Great Taste has enabled these partnerships between the community and the city to enhance and expand public safety for the benefit of residents.  Becky was one of the first volunteers trained and has been a trainer for the past five years for the City of Corona Fire Department Community Emergency Response Team program, CERT, which supplements city resources in the event of a disaster or other major emergency. CERT volunteers are trained in emergency procedures and are duly registered as disaster service workers in accordance with the California Government Code and the City of Corona Municipal Code. Becky has also been actively involved with the Advisory Board of Alternatives to Domestic Violence, ADV, and the Coalition of Family Preservation for almost 10 years. She has also served on the Riverside County Board of Alternatives to Domestic Violence, ADV, for 2 years and served as president in 2005. In addition to all her community activities, Becky also takes care of her husband, Dr. Charles E. Gunnoe, a former Chamber president and winner of the Citizen of the Year award in 1997.  In light of all Becky Gunnoe has done for the community of Corona, the City of Corona named Becky their Citizen of the Year. Becky's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. She has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
