Leader, this bill is over 1,000 pages long. It was marked up just shortly after it was introduced and finalized. Is the gentleman concerned by the length of that bill and the short time that Members have to review it? And the very short time that the public, which will essentially have almost no opportunity to review it, is the gentleman concerned about that?                              {time}  1110
