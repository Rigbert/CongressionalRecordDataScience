. 3082, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 2010.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R. 3082  Account: Military Construction, Air Force Reserve  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: March Air Reserve Base, Riverside, CA  Address of Requesting Entity: March Air Reserve Base, 610 Meyer Drive, Riverside, California 92518-2166  Description of Request: I have secured $9,800,000 for the Small Arms Firing Range, March Air Reserve Base. It is my understanding that the funds will be used to construct an adequately sized and configured small arms firing range which is required for training and maintaining the standard of current Air Force preparedness. The project also includes office space, classrooms, and equipment with fire protection and security alarm, lightning protection and explosion proof electrical which would bring the facility up to current force protection standards. The existing firing range was built in 1942 and is sub standard as a training facility. It is located approximately 5 miles away from March ARB and creates security, safety, and health and maintenance problems. Without funding the current facility will deteriorate further and will not be able to meet the training and readiness requirements of the base. Security, health and safety will be a concern and may cause the existing firing range to shut down. The range closure will seriously impact the small arm training, Force Protection and Personnel Combat Arms requirement for Reserve and National Guard units.                          ____________________
