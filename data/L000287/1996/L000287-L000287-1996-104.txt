Mr. Speaker, I take this time to pay tribute to the 1996 Olympic and Paralympic games, and to thank all the people who made these games a tremendous success.  The 1996 Olympic games were the largest athletic event ever. For the first time in history, athletes from every country in the world came to Atlanta to participate in the games. Two weeks after the close of the Olympic games, Atlanta hosted the 1996 Paralympic games, the second largest athletic event in history. Each was a great success.  Over 3 billion people, from throughout the globe, watched the Centennial Olympics in Atlanta. I would like to thank three individuals, three Atlantans, for bringing these Games to Atlanta and helping making the 1996 Olympics the greatest Olympics ever: Billy Payne, Andy Young, and A.D. Frazier. Through their dedication and hard work, they gave Atlanta the opportunity to host the Olympics and show the world what the Atlanta, capital of the New South, could accomplish.  These three individuals could not put on the Olympics by themselves. I would like to thank the staff of ACOG, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, and the hundreds and thousand of volunteers who gave their time to make sure the games were a success.  In addition, the Federal, State, and local governments all contributed to these Olympic games. President Clinton, and especially Vice President Gore, ensured that the Federal Government did all it could to help the Olympic games. I would like to thank two people in the Clinton administration in particular for their contributions to the Atlanta Games: Mack McLarty, Chairman of the White House task force on the Olympics and Paralympics; and Carol Roscoe, Special Assistant to the President on Domestic Policy. Georgia Governor Zell Miller and Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell both dedicated much time and effort to help ACOG prepare for and stage the Olympics.  Federal Transit Administrator Gordon Linton, working with cities throughout the United States, helped provide the buses that were essential for transporting the athletes, the press, and other Olympic guests. MARTA, the Metropolitan Atlanta Regional Transportation Authority, not only provided 24-hour transportation service to spectators, but coordinated most of the Olympic's transportation system.  I also would like to thank all the law enforcement personnel that provided for the safety of the athletes and the spectators. Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard and the entire Atlanta Police Department, the Georgia National Guard, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the State Patrol, the Secret Service, the FBI, emergency management personnel, and the Department of Defense all contributed in this effort.  Members of the business community also came together to promote the Atlanta Olympic games. In particular, I would like to recognize several local businesses which played a particularly important role in helping finance these Olympic Games. Delta Airlines, Coca-Cola, BellSouth, Home Depot, UPS, and NationsBank all stepped up to help the home town stage this great event.  However, the Olympic games were not the only great event to come to Atlanta this summer. The opening ceremonies of the 10th Paralympic games followed less than 2 weeks after the closing ceremonies of the Centennial Olympic games. Under the guidance of Andy Fleming, the Paralympic games were as much a success as the Olympic games and an inspiration to us all.  I would like to thank all the staff and volunteers of APOC, the Atlanta Paralympic Organizing Committee, for their work. In fact, APOC and Atlanta did such an excellent job of promoting athletics among the disabled that the Paralympic Organizing Committee is considering moving to Atlanta.  Several local businesses generously contributed to the Paralympics. NationsBank sponsored the torch relay, and Shepherd Spinal Cord Center and Delta were major corporate sponsors.  With the help of these people and organizations--and many others--Atlanta staged the greatest Olympic games ever, and the greatest Paralympic games ever. Congratulations to Atlanta on hosting the greatest athletic events in history. Congratulations and thanks to all those who helped make these games a tremendous success.                          ____________________
