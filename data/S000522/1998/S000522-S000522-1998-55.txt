Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  I am very proud to be one of the cosponsors of H. Con. Res. 254, which condemns the government of Cuba for harboring Joanne Chesimard and other fugitives who have committed brutal crimes in the United States. I want to thank my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Franks) for introducing this important resolution and working for its passage.  As most of us here know, Joanne Chesimard was convicted in 1977 of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison for her brutal execution style murder of trooper Foerster. She escaped from jail in 1979 and subsequently fled to Cuba where she was given political asylum. This escaped murderer now lives a very comfortable life in Cuba and has launched a public relations campaign in which she attempts to portray herself as an innocent victim rather than a cold-blooded murderer.  The protection Chesimard and others enjoy in Cuba is yet another example of the lawlessness of the Castro dictatorship. The only truly satisfactory solution is democracy and self-determination for the people of Cuba. In the meantime, however, I believe it is shameful that the Clinton administration has made deal after deal with the Castro government, giving concession after concession, while Chesimard and other felons are living the high life in Havana.  I would like to thank members of the Committee on International Relations. They backed some amendments that I had offered during markup which changed some of the wording. The bottom line is we need to make sure that we bring these murderers and felons, and there are many of them, to justice. For the family, the Foerster family, that lost its loved one, we will not rest until she is behind bars where she belongs for the rest of her life.  I want to thank, again, my good friend, the gentleman from Jersey (Mr. Franks) for offering this. I hope that it will get the full support of the body.
