President, obviously I am distressed for many reasons about this nomination, not the least of which is everything Judge Alito said indicated he would not be a check and balance. I so wish--and I have said this to President Bush personally--I so wish he had been a uniter and not a divider. We could be here with a Senate unanimously approving a nominee, instead of this divisive battle.  I yield the floor.
