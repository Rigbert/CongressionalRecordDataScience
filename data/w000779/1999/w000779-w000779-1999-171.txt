 The Senator raised the question of whether or not plaintiffs ought to be able to circumvent the provisions of State contract law by repackaging suits as tort claims. That has not been allowed by the courts.  If the Senator is talking about something else, we are happy to look at this. What we have in our legal analysis, and I have cited the specific cases that back up our particular point, is an indication that we believe we are protecting plaintiffs and plaintiffs' rights to recover in line with State contract law on economic losses.  If the Senator is not trying to ``tortify'' contracts, I am certainly willing to work with him on any kind of language.
