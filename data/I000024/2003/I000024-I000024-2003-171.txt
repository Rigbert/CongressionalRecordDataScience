President, today I join my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, in introducing by request a bill to reauthorize the Economic Development Administration.  EDA works with partners in local communities to create wealth and minimize poverty by promoting favorable business environments to attract private investment. Studies show that EDA uses Federal dollars efficiently and effectively. EDA's average cost of creating and retaining long-term jobs is among the lowest in government.  In my home State of Oklahoma, we have some communities that struggle with economic distress, and EDA has worked long and hard with those communities to bring in private capital investment and jobs. In fact, over the last ten years, EDA projects have resulted in more than 15,000 jobs being created or saved. With an investment of about $53 million, we have leveraged another 50 million in State and local dollars and more than 1.1 billion in private sector dollars. I would call that a wonderful success story.  I am pleased that the President has chosen to send to Congress a reauthorization bill for this agency. His bill promotes coordination, flexibility and performance--all excellent goals. The EDA's authorization is set to expire on September 30, 2003, and I look forward to working with the Administration, as well as my colleagues here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, to try to reauthorize it before then.                                 ______                                       By
