 President, I rise today to introduce the ``Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act.'' This important legislation will update Federal law to address critical security issues at seaports in the United States and, in concert with recent efforts by my good friend Senator Hollings and others, will help keep America safe and secure.  Last October, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs on ``Defending America's Transportation Infrastructure.'' At the hearing, we heard testimony from experts that confirmed what many of us have known and preached for years: this Nation's transportation infrastructure, our railways, our highways, our seaports, is especially vulnerable to terrorist threats and other nefarious activity. Our trains, trucks and sea vessels, and the systems that carry them, are ripe targets and, if compromised, could jeopardize American lives and devastate the American economy.  The U.S. Government has known of this tremendous vulnerability but, until the tragic events of September 11, assessed the risk of an actual attack, at least with respect to seaports, as relatively low. Well, we all know how mistaken that assessment is now. While no one can predict with certainty where the next attack might be, most clear thinkers agree that there will be another attempt. The real question before us is will we cower in a web of fear and bureaucratic inaction, or will we focus on creative problem-solving, building partnerships, and collaboratively fighting the well-funded and well-organized network of criminals that seek to topple us. The choice, my friends, is clear.  In the aftermath of September 11, Congress moved expeditiously to bridge the gaps in homeland security, passing landmark anti-terrorism legislation, strengthening security at airports, and providing additional funding for emergency law enforcement and domestic preparedness. Despite our early efforts, however, there is much that remains to be done. We have tackled the obvious and the easy. We must now move as swiftly to resolve the more difficult, but no less pressing, problems. And, as gateways to our largest cities and industries, the protection of U.S. seaports must be at the top of our priority list.  Failing to protect our Nation's ports will jeopardize American lives, as well as property. It threatens to undermine national security, especially where terrorists and other criminals illegally traffic weapons, munitions and critical technology. And it will significantly disrupt the free and steady flow of commerce.  Let me say a word about the threat to commerce. Ports connect American consumers with global products, and U.S. farmers and manufacturers with overseas markets. The U.S. marine transportation system moves more than 2 billion tons of domestic and international freight and imports 3.3 billion tons of oil. By some estimates, the port industry generates more than 13 million jobs and $494 billion in personal income; it contributes nearly $743 billion to the Nation's gross domestic product, and $200 billion in Federal, State and local taxes. These extraordinary numbers underscore the critical role that seaports play in fueling economic growth. More importantly, they make the point, more forcefully than any number of speeches or platitudes, that port security will be a key element to building and sustaining a stable national economy.  With that in mind, I introduce legislation today that would substantially improve the inadequate protections currently contained in the Federal code: first, the effectiveness of Federal, State and local efforts to secure ports is compromised in part by criminals' ability to evade detection by underreporting and misreporting the content of cargo, with little more than a slap on the wrist, if that. The existing statutes simply do not provide adequate sanctions to deter criminal or civil violations. As a consequence, vessel manifest information is often wrong or incomplete, and our ability to assess risks, make decisions about which containers to inspect more closely, or simply control the movement of cargo is made virtually impossible. This bill would substantially increase the penalties for non-compliance with these reporting requirements.  Second, we know that cargo is especially vulnerable to theft once it arrives at shore and is transported between facilities within a seaport. To deter such larceny, this bill would significantly increase penalties for theft of goods from Customs' custody.  Third, there currently exists no standard system for safeguarding cargo; no requirement that all containers be sealed; and no consistent guidance or protocol to direct action in the event that a container's seal is compromised. This legislation would require the U.S. Customs Service to develop a uniform system of securing or sealing at loading all containers originating in or destined for the U.S.  Fourth, my friends at the Customs Service tell me that their ability to conduct ``sting'' operations to detect illicit arms trafficking is significantly curtailed by onerous pre-certification requirements. This bill would give Customs agents the flexibility they need to conduct these investigations where American lives and property are threatened.  Fifth, the bill would impose strict criminal penalties for the use of a dangerous weapon or explosive with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury at a seaport. Notably, such a provision already exists with respect to international airports and other mass transportation systems. If my bill is enacted, we would take the common-sense step of extending that same coverage to seaports.  Finally, while by all accounts the amount of crime at U.S. seaports is great, there exists no national data collection and reporting systems that capture the magnitude of serious crime at seaports. Indeed, the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports concluded that it was unable to determine the full extent of serious crime at the nation's 361 seaports, primarily because there is no consolidated database. This legislation would help correct this dearth of reliable information by authorizing pilot programs at several seaports that would enable victims to report cargo theft and direct the Attorney General to create a database of these crimes, which would be available to appropriate Federal, State and local agencies.  Let me be clear: my legislation is not a cure-all. Comprehensive and effective port security will require an interagency, intergovernmental strategy that works to prevent and deter criminal and terrorist activity, and, where those efforts fail, detect any wrongdoing before harm or destruction results. The Federal Government, with my support and oftentimes at my insistence, has established formal strategies and protocols to address drug trafficking, domestic and international crime, and airport security. But seaport security remains largelyunaddressed. If we are to win this new war and truly secure the homeland, not just in word, but also in deed, we must focus the attention of both the public and private sectors on safeguarding America's seaports. We must do it now, and we must do it without sacrificing the country's economic health.  My friends, September 11 was our clarion call. How we respond to that call to action will be the real challenge of leadership, and citizenship, in the 21st century.                                 ______                                       By
