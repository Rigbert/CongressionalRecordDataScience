 Mr. Chairman, I am puzzled why anybody would oppose this amendment. The amendment simply states that if you cannot be admitted to the United States because you are affiliated with a terrorist organization, then you can be deported if you get in through one way or another. We have a big problem with illegal aliens crossing both the northern and the southern border. If you do not go through the passport check and enter the United States illegally and you could not enter the United States legally because you were a part of a terrorist organization, then if this amendment goes down, you cannot kick them out. So it seems to me that if you cannot get in and it is illegal for you to get in and you do get in, anyhow, illegally, or by fooling an immigration inspector, then the government ought to have the power to be able to deport these people.  The amendment is as simple as that, meaning if they do get in when they should not, they should be able to be removed and sent out of the country and make America safer.  I urge support of the amendment.
