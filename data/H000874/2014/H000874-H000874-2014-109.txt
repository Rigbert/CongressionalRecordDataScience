Chair, first I want to say to Mr. Latham, with whom I had the opportunity of serving on the Appropriations Committee for some years, thank you for your service. We obviously didn't always agree, but I always found you to be a gentleman and conscientious and honest in your leadership and willing to work together where we could work together, and I want to thank you for that.                              {time}  1845  Mr. Chairman, not only is Mr. Latham retiring, but his partner, the ranking member, Mr. Pastor, who is standing at the back of the Chamber, is also retiring.  Mr. Chairman, let me simply say about Ed Pastor, Ed Pastor is a quiet man, a little bit like John Wayne in ``The Quiet Man,'' but a very effective man who worked very hard not only for his constituents, but for the citizens of our country.  I also had the opportunity to serve many years with Mr. Pastor on subcommittees together and on the full committee together. We owe a debt of gratitude to both of these gentlemen who worked together to produce products that America could be proud of and work forward on. Perhaps we didn't always get there, any of us, but they worked as a team trying to get the best job possible within the constraints on which they were operating, and we thank them both for that.  Thank you, Mr. Pastor. We are proud of you.                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Schiff  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, 2-minute voting will continue.  There was no objection.
