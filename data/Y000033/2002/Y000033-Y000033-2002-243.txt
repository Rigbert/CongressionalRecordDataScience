Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the Emergency Directed Rail Service Act. This legislation is intended to prepare the nation for the possibility that Amtrak will follow through on its threat to shut down. This bill is part of my effort to make sure the country is as prepared as possible should that shutdown occur.  Members are no doubt aware that Amtrak is in an extremely desperate financial situation. Amtrak contends it needs $200 million in additional cash or it will cease operations on or about July 1, 2002. Although the Administration is currently considering an Amtrak application to use the Railroad Rehabilitation and Infrastructure Financing (RRIF) loan and loan guarantee program, it is doubtful Amtrak qualifies under the statute, under the formal regulations that govern the program, or under the informal rules imposed by the Department of Transportation and the Office of Management and Budget.  Similarly, although I would support an appropriation under the right conditions to help Amtrak in the short-term while the Congress and the Administration address Amtrak for the long-term, it is unclear whether the appropriations process will be able to provide Amtrak any funds before July 1, 2002.  I am particularly concerned about the effect on freight movements in the Northeast and on commuter operations around the country and consequently on our national economy. An Amtrak shutdown could adversely affect the economy in the Northeast United States because considerable freight would not be able to get to its destination, especially plants where the Northeast Corridor is the only rail access. Moreover, commuters in the Northeast and around the country may not be able to get to work either because the commuter authority operates on Amtrak infrastructure or because the commuter authority uses Amtrak employees to operate or maintain its trains.  Accordingly, on Monday I wrote Linda Morgan, the Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, and asked whether the Board had the power to direct freight and commuter service that would be adversely affected by an Amtrak shutdown.  Ms. Morgan responded yesterday that the STB was unclear whether it would have the power to direct freight and commuter service in the event of an Amtrak shutdown and that its emergency powers have ``never been tested before in this context . . . and . . . could be challenged in court.''  This country needs someone to have the power to address the fallout on freight railroads and commuters if Amtrak shuts down. The legislation I introduce today does just that. It makes it clear that the STB has the authority it needs to act in the event Amtrak ceases service.  In particular, the bill would give the STB the authority to order the continued maintenance, signaling, and dispatching of the Northeast Corridor.  It would give the STB the authority to use federal funds to compensate the entity that conducts these services and to indemnify it with respect to any increased liability exposure.  It would also authorize the STB to direct service and to provide interim financial assistance to commuter operations around the country affected by an Amtrak shutdown.  Further, current law requires that to the extent possible the Amtrak employees who already perform the work should do the work required by the directed service.  A final word of caution. I realize this bill addresses provisions of law relating to the STB and that there are interests out there who will want to attach other STB-related amendments to it. I call on them not to do so. This bill addresses a potential national transportation disaster and is limited solely to the STB's emergency directed service powers. In this case, we must put the national interest above all others.                          ____________________
