Mr. Chairman, 34,000 lives lost, not in the Far East, not in Eastern Europe, not in Africa, but right here in America on our streets, in our neighborhoods, on our playgrounds; 34,000 lives lost, lost to gun violence last year.  What would it take before we act, another Littleton, another Paducah, another Conyers, another Jonesboro? Thirteen children a day lost, lost togun violence. We need courage, nothing but raw courage, to protect the lives of our children.  I am sick and tired of going to funerals of young children. How many more times must I hold a weeping mother in my arms? How long, how long before we act to stop this senseless violence?  During another period in our history we have sung, where have all the children gone, in some graveyard one by one?                              {time}  2340  Thirty-four thousand lives gone; lost; dead; buried because of gun violence.  Joshua of old says, ``Choose you this day whom you will serve.''  Will we serve the NRA or will we serve our people, our Nation, our children? As for me and my house, I will cast my lot and my vote with the children. Close the gun show loophole. Defeat the Dingell amendment. Vote for the McCarthy amendment.
