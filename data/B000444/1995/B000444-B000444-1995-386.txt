 President, I say to the majority leader that I think when we dispose of the Brown amendment and we dispose of the Nunn-Biden amendment, that other than habeas amendments, there is nothing left.  It is my understanding that the leader, at an appropriate time this evening, if we complete action on Nunn-Biden and Brown, would move to vitiate the cloture vote tomorrow.  I would assure the Senator, as well, we would withdraw all 5 amendments relating to firearms or ammunition. They would not be considered on this bill.
