 That is job loss. The other half of the story is what our trade policy with China means in terms of driving wages down in this country.  Every worker in this country knows that if we stand up and fight for decent wages, decent benefits, we have a boss there to say, ``Hey, you are lucky that you have this job because I could go to Mexico, I could go to China. Look at that factory down the road, what they did last year.''  So the presence of a huge labor market in China where people are forced to work for horrendous wages has not only resulted in the loss of huge numbers of jobs, but has certainly had an impact in lowering the real wages of American workers.  The fact is, one of the things that we hear in the media, and I want to say a word about the media, because I have found media coverage of this whole issue very, very interesting.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Very interesting, or nonexistent?
