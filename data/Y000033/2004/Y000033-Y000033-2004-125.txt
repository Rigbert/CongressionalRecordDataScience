Mr. Chairman, I simply wanted to complimentthe gentleman and the gentleman from Oregon for their presentations. As I told the gentleman from New Jersey, I did support the concept of this amendment.  I also agree with my ranking member that, as we go through it, we will do it the right way and do it correctly so we can actually solve a serious problem. His story is a very telling story.  So with that, I guess we will have a voice vote; is that correct?
