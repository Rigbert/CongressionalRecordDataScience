 The Public Lands Highway Program was indeed created to fulfill the long-neglected infrastructure needs of our nations vast holdings of federal lands. I share the Senator's commitment to ensuring that public lands states, such as Nevada, continue to receive the lion's share of funding under this program. I will also seek to address the Senator's concerns about earmarking of this program both in Conference this year and when drafting next year's Transportation Appropriation's bill.
