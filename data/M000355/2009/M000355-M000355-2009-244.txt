 Situated just steps away from the Liberty Bell and historic Independence Hall, it is the only museum in America solely dedicated to honoring America's Constitution.  Our Constitution was signed on this day--this very day--in 1787 by 39 brave, outstanding Americans. Now, 222 years later, we thank them for devising the finest system of government mankind has ever produced. By recognizing that rights flow from the people to their government and not the other way around, our Constitution is firmly dedicated to the preservation of liberty. That is why we celebrate every September 17 as Constitution Day. It is a day for all Americans to learn more about the Constitution, to understand how it works, and to appreciate how it has guided our Nation through growth and through change.  I thank the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, for sponsoring this legislation 5 years ago to observe this historic day. We all know the love Senator Byrd has for his country and his country's history. He knows that you cannot truly understand how liberty is preserved in America without understanding the Constitution. Thank you, Senator, for your efforts to ensure that future generations also learn this important lesson.  On this day, we recognize citizens across the Nation who are honoring our Constitution by honoring its values and passing them along to our children and grandchildren. And we say a special thanks for the men and women in uniform who defend it. Thanks to them, the Constitution's promise will be there for the next generations of Americans.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
