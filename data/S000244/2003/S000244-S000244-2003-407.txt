Speaker, this motion is offered by people who have historically been in opposition to bankruptcy reform. What this bill does is it increases the priority for unpaid child support from seventh priority to first priority, and if the other side of the aisle gets their way and this bill goes down, unpaid child support stays at seventh priority, and that ought to be one reason and one reason alone to vote down this motion to recommit.  The National Child Support Enforcement Association says that these reforms are crucial to the collection of child support during bankruptcy. The motion to recommit creates a major loophole with respect to antifraud provisions. Section 310, which this motion modifies, deals with debtors who are on the eve of filing for bankruptcy who acquire luxury goods and cash advances.  Under this proposal, a debtor could avoid section 310 by asserting that it would impair the debtor's ability to pay a domestic support obligation. The President of the National Child Support Enforcement Association, in dealing with an identical provision in last year's bankruptcy bill, said, ``H.R. 333 would provide these children with first priority in the collection of support debt, allow the enforcement of medical support obligations, prevent any interruption in the otherwise efficient process of withholding earnings in the payment of child support, and ensure that during the course of a consumer bankruptcy, all support owed to the family would be paid and would be paid timely, and would allow State court actions involving custody and visitation, dissolution of marriage and domestic violence to proceed without interference from bankruptcy court litigation.''  Vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit. A ``no'' vote is for the protection of children. A ``no'' vote is for better enforcement of support obligations, and vote ``yes'' on the bill which increases the priority for unpaid support in bankruptcy to go from seventh priority to first priority.
