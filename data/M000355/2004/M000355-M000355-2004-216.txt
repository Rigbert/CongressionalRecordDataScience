 President, for the information of all Senators, on Monday, following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the Intelligence Reform bill. As I announced earlier, there will be no rollcall votes on Monday. However, I will alert all Senators that amendments will be offered and debated during Monday's session. The chairman and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee will be here to begin working through amendments to the bill. Any votes ordered with respect to amendments will be set to occur on Tuesday morning. So I encourage Senators who wish to have their amendments considered on Monday to contact the bill managers.                          ____________________
