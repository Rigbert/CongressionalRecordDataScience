President, paying for college is harder than it used to be. Over the last 5 years, the combined cost of tuition, fees, room and board at 4-year public colleges and universities increased by 42 percent, and more students are leaving college saddled with debt. More than two-thirds of 4-year college students now borrow to pay for school, and their average debt more than doubled between 1993 and 2004.  Unfortunately, we have learned that some lenders and some universities are engaging in practices that are not always based on what is in the best interests of the students.
