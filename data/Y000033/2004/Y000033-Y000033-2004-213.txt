Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce H. Res. 618, a resolution commemorating the 101st anniversary of Jack London's inspirational novel, The Call of the Wild. Originally published in installments from June 20th to July 18th 1903, The Call of the Wild is considered a uniquely American narrative, recounting the trials and tribulations surrounding the Klondike Gold Rush of the Yukon Territory in Canada, which impacted the District of Alaska and Washington State during the 1890s. This classic of world literature contributed to the spirit of exploration and discovery that swept the United States in the early part of the last century and led many others to explore what is now the great State of Alaska. One of the most widely translated and published works by an American author; The Call of the Wild has not been out-of-print in the past century.  Born John Griffith London in 1876 in San Francisco, California, the author began working during his adolescent years at various labor-intensive jobs, which included pirating for oysters on the San Francisco Bay, and serving on a fish patrol to capture poachers. It was his strong desire to escape the prospect of adult life as a factory worker that motivated him to begin his career as a writer. A restless spirit and strong sense of adventure led Jack to leave his native California in 1897, with his brother-in-law, James Shepard, to join the Klondike Gold Rush. His experiences that winter spent in a cabin by the Klondike river provided much of the rich material for his most well renowned novels, The Call of the Wild and White Fang, both of which became inspirations for full-length feature films. He went on to produce over fifty volumes of work in his lifetime, which included novels, short stories, and political essays. His literary portrayals of adventure and frontier life, unparalleled in their time, helped mark him as a truly great American author and seminal figure in turn-of-the century social history.  The Call of the Wild, which remains London's most celebrated work, tells a story through the eyes of Buck the dog, half St. Bernard, half Scotch Shepard. Captured from his comfortable life on an estate in California's Santa Clara Valley, he is sold to dog traders who ship him north to the Klondike to serve as a sled puller. Surrounded by inexperienced and cruel masters, Buck must learn to survive the realities of the harsh winter. The Call of the Wild is a tale of travel, transformation, and adaptation, filled with Darwinian undertones of survival and written in a naturalistic style that London is so often praised for.  As a young child, my father read this moving novel to me on many occasions. Filled with recollections of adventure and exploration, I too, as a young man left my home in California to explore a world full of budding possibilities. These notions led me to a land less discovered, the Last Frontier, the State of Alaska. What I found when I arrived there was an untold potential for greatness for the land and its people, an inspiring setting for leadership and representation. Had it not been for the spirit of Jack London's experiences that he eloquently shared with the world--and me--in The Call of the Wild, I might never have journeyed to this great state that I have called home for more than 47 years and have had the great honor to represent, here in Washington, for the past 31 years.                          ____________________
