President, if the Senator from Arizona will yield. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the distinguished Senator from Arizona, who had worked with this amendment last night and could have asked for a vote last night. I asked him if he might be willing to withhold while we discussed it further with him. I know there have been some discussions. I note that because the Senator from Arizona showed his usual courtesy and cooperation, I wish to thank him here on the Senate floor.  With that, I yield the floor.  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Arizona is recognized.                         Privilege of the Floor  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Greg Suchan, a fellow on my staff, be granted the privilege of the floor during the discussion of H.R. 3540.
