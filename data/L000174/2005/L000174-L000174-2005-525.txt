President, I oppose the nomination of Thomas Griffith to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Mr. Griffith's decision to practice law without a license for a good part of his career should be disqualifying. Mr. Griffith has foregone at least 10 opportunities to take the bar in Utah, and has continued to refuse during the pendency of his nomination. In this regard he appears to think he is above the law. That is not the kind of person who should be entrusted with a lifetime appointment to a Federal court and, least of all, to such an important court as the DC Circuit, which is entrusted with protecting the rights of all Americans. This is the wrong nomination for this court and I will vote against it.
