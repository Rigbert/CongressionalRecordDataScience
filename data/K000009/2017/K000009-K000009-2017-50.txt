Speaker, they directly know the negative impacts of NAFTA. Amy stressed the changing nature of manufacturing in Ohio, making up one of eight jobs. Donnie discussed how Ohio has lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs as well as the imperative for a new NAFTA transparent agreement. Mark Payne spoke about the need for a continental living wage and investment in American job growth. All three emphasized a deal that works for jobs here in America, America's workers, and Buy American provisions.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and the administration to take heed of their testimony. We need to create jobs here in America and across this continent that are living wage jobs.                          ____________________
