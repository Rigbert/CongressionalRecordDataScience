 President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would designate the existing United States Federal Courthouse for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, Washington, as the ``William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse.'' William Nakamura was born in 1922, and grew up in Seattle, Washington. He attended public schools and was a student at the University of Washington when he and 110,000 other Japanese Americans were removed from their communities and forced into internment camps.  For many, the disgrace of the internment camps and the injustice of that American policy fostered resentment and anger. Rather than succumb to hate, William Kenzo Nakamura chose to fight for the very country that had treated him unjustly. He enlisted in the 442d Regimental Combat Team, which went on to become the most decorated military team in U.S. history. While fighting in Italy, Pfc. William Nakamura was killed on July 4, 1944. At the time of his death, he was providing cover for his retreating platoon. Earlier that day, he had also gone beyond the call of duty and single-handedly destroyed a machine-gun nest.  Following his death, Nakamura's commanding officer nominated him for the Medal of Honor. According to Army policy at the time, Japanese Americans could not receive the Medal of Honor. Instead, Pfc. Nakamura was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the military's second highest honor. This past June, Pfc. Nakamura and 21 other Asian-American veterans of World War II were finally honored with the Congressional Medal of Honor. Senator Inouye, who served in the same unit as Mr. Nakamura, was one of those who received the Congressional Medal of Honor that day. I was proud to be present at the White House for the ceremony.  I am pleased that both of the Medal of Honor recipients in Congress are original cosponsors of the bill: Senators Inouye and Kerry. I am also honored to have my Washington state colleague, Senator Gorton, as an original cosponsor. Congressman McDermott is sponsoring this legislation in the House, and I thank him for his efforts. Like many Asian-American veterans, Nakamura didn't hesitate when his country called. He and many others went to war and gave their lives for freedoms which they and their families were denied at home.  Mr. President, we can't undo the injustice suffered by Japanese-Americans during World War II, but we can give these noble Americans the recognition they deserve. The William Kenzo Nakamura Courthouse will serve as a permanent reminder that justice must serve all Americans equally. I urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation.                                 ______                                       By
