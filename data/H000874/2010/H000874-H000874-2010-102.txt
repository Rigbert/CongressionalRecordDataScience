 This bill builds on Democrats' strong defense record. Under President Obama, we have killed or captured some of the highest ranking leaders in al Qaeda--many more than we did under the last administration--and the Taliban; laid out a clear way forward in Afghanistan; disrupted terrorism with the full resources of our intelligence community and justice system; and increased funding for human intelligence collection, cybersecurity, and security for our skies, our ports, and our borders.  This bill offers us a chance to improve on the flawed record of the Bush administration, and I urge my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________
