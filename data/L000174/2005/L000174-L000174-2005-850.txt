President, the reason for this amendment--and I realize we will not vote on it today and we may vote on it tomorrow, although it may well be accepted--is one of the facts we have today.  The bankruptcy process requires the submission of many documents containing highly personal information. But we must be careful that our efforts to require documentation for accuracy and accountability do not inadvertently create problems for privacy and security.  We are in an age where personal information can be easily digitized and shared, and when it falls into the wrong hands, easily abused.  Identity theft is one danger. We have only to look to the recent debacle of Choicepoint selling the personal data of 145,000 individuals to scam artists. Many of these individuals have already become victims of identity theft, and they are not alone. Last year alone, 9.3 million people were victimized by identity theft. Another danger is tracking or harassing a former battered spouse. We need to minimize these possibilities, while still allowing for accountability.  We took an important first step by ensuring privacy protections for databases of personal information that become assets in bankruptcy. I was pleased to work closely with my colleagues in providing this protection.  But our responsibilities didn't end there. We also need to ensure reasonable privacy protection for personal information that is submitted by the debtors. I am submitting an amendment that will do just that by enhancing the court's discretion to protect personal information, and by requiring truncation of social security numbers in publicly filed documents. The Judicial Conference supports this amendment and I will ask unanimous consent that the Judicial Conference letter supporting the amendment be printed in the Record.  I am pleased that my colleagues Senator Snowe and Senator Cantwell have agreed to co-sponsor this amendment. They have been leaders on privacy issues, and I appreciate their support.  First, the amendment addresses court discretion in several ways. It allows the court, for cause, to protect personal identifiers, including the debtor's or other person's name, social security account number, date of birth, driver's license number, passport number, employee or taxpayer identification number, and unique biometric data. The personal identifiers protected under this provision are the same ones defined as ``means of identification'' under the Identity Theft Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998. This definition is codified as Section 1028(d) of Title 18 of the criminal code.  The amendment also allows the court, for cause, to seal or redact ``information that could cause undue annoyance, embarrassment, oppression or risk of injury to person or property.'' This standard is drawn from the current civil procedure discovery rules--Fed. Rule of Civ. Procedure 26--and would replace the existing standard in bankruptcy court, which only protects individuals against ``scandalous or defamatory matter.'' This change would allow the court to protect information, such as the home or employment address of a debtor, because of a personal security risk, including fear of injury by a former spouse or stalker. It would also allow the court to protect other information normally considered private, such as medical information.  The amendment would also provide persons the opportunity to request protection of sensitive information not only after it is filed with the court, but prior to filing as well. This protection is particularly important in an electronic filing environment, where information once filed is immediately available to the public.  In addition to enhancing court discretion, the amendment also protects social security numbers. Currently, the bankruptcy code requires debtors to include their tax payer identification numbers, which for individuals is almost uniformly his or her social security number, on any notice the debtor gives to creditors.  Because these notices are also filed with the court, the court's files routinely include unredacted social security numbers, creating the potential for abuse by those accessing public court records.  The amendment would simply allow debtors to limit disclosure to only a part of his or her social security number in notices that it files with the court. Specifically the notice to the court would include only the last four digits. The amendment still protects creditors where necessary, and specifies that creditors who are on theschedule of assets and liabilities should receive the full tax payer identification number in the notices sent specifically to the creditor.  The idea of truncation isn't new. Just last year, we passed the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, and that Act required truncation of credit card and debit card numbers on receipts given to cardholders. Under that law, only the last 5 digits of credit card and debit card numbers can be printed.  Requiring truncation for social security numbers is similarly reasonable. It provides protection against abuse, but still allows for important information sharing to take place.  The bankruptcy process requires submission of many documents containing highly personal information. I spoke about this on the floor yesterday. We must be careful that our efforts to require documentation for accuracy and accountability do not inadvertently create problems for privacy and security.  We are in an age where personal information can be easily digitized and shared, and when it falls into the wrong hands, easily abused. We know what happens with identity theft. Look at the totally irresponsible, outrageous, unbelievable debacle of Choicepoint, selling the personal data of 145,000 individuals to scam artists. It is hard to think of anything being done more irresponsibly than the executives at Choicepoint, unless it is the executives of Bank of America, who ship the data of their customers by commercial airplane--the same kind of flight we have all taken, and all of us have lost luggage. I said yesterday maybe their executives fly by private planes and they don't know what it is like to fly commercial. The point is their irresponsibility.  Many of the individuals who have had data stolen become victims of identity theft. There were 145,000 individuals whose data was compromised with Choicepoint that we know of now. Some have already become victims of identity theft. Last year alone, 9.3 million people were victimized by identity theft. Another danger is tracking or harassing a former battered spouse. I want to make sure we keep accurate information and that people have to say who they are, but we don't want to allow somebody to go into electronic court files and get Social Security numbers and names and addresses and everything else, and then use that information for identity theft or worse. We need to minimize these possibilities, while still allowing for accountability.  We took an important first step by ensuring privacy protections for databases of personal information that become assets in bankruptcy. I was please to work with my colleagues in providing this protection. But our responsibilities did not end there. We also need to ensure reasonable privacy protection for personal information submitted by the debtors. This amendment will do that by enhancing the court's discretion to protect personal information, and by requiring truncation of social security numbers in publicly filed documents.  I have a letter from the Judicial Conference of the United States, Chief Justice Rehnquist presiding, in which they support this amendment. They strongly support this amendment. These are the courts that are going to have to enforce this.  I ask unanimous consent that the Judicial Conference letter supporting the amendment be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Judicial Conference                                         of the United States,                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2005.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Democrat, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing today to express the      Judicial Conference's support of two proposed amendments to      the ``Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act      of 2005'' (S. 256). Both amendments to the bill would amend      the Bankruptcy Code to effect the Judicial Conference's      privacy policy and protect confidential or sensitive      information from public disclosure. Your support of these      amendments to pending bankruptcy reform legislation would be      greatly appreciated.                   Section 107 of the Bankruptcy Code       This amendment would implement Judicial Conference policy      regarding protection of certain information contained in      bankruptcy case files from public disclosure by means of four      revisions to section 107 of the Bankruptcy Code. First, the      amendment would transform former subsection (b)(1) regarding      protection of trade secret or confidential research,      development, or commercial information into a new subsection      (b). No substantive change would be made to this provision.       Second, the amendment would create a new subsection (c) to      allow the court for cause to authorize the redaction of      personal identifiers to protect a debtor, creditor, or other      person from identity theft or other harm. The amendment      incorporates by reference section 1028(d)(7) of title 18,      United States Code, a provision of the ``Identity Theft and      Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998,'' with regard to the types      of personal identifiers that may be redacted. These include      the debtor's or other person's name, social security account      number, date of birth, driver's license number, alien      registration number, government passport number, employee or      taxpayer identification number, unique biometric data, unique      electronic identification number, electronic address or      routing code, and telecommunication identifying information      or access device. The amendment would also permit the court      to exercise its discretion to protect personal identifiers by      means other than redaction where appropriate in the      circumstances of the case.       Third, this provision would allow the protection of      information under subsection ( c) ``contained in a paper      filed, or to be filed,'' in a bankruptcy case. This provision      is intended to provide persons the opportunity to request      protection of the information not only after it is filed with      the court, but prior to filing as well. This authority would      be especially useful in an electronic filing environment,      where information once filed is immediately available to the      public.       Finally, this new subsection (c) would have the effect of      striking from the current provision ``scandalous or      defamatory matter'' as a basis for protection of a person and      instead allow the court for cause to seal or redact      ``information that could cause undue annoyance,      embarrassment, oppression or risk of injury to person or      property.'' This language is drawn from Federal Rule of Civil      Procedure 26 regarding the issuance of protective orders in      the course of discovery. This new provision would expand the      authority of the bankruptcy court to allow the court to      protect information, such as the home or employment address      of a debtor, because of a personal security risk, including      fear of injury by a former spouse or stalker. It would also      allow the court to protect other information normally      considered private, such as medical information which, if      publicly) disclosed, could result in untoward consequences to      the debtor or others.                 Section 342(c) of the Bankruptcy Code       This amendment to the bill would amend section 342(c) of      the Bankruptcy Code to implement Judicial Conference policy      that social security account numbers be protected from public      disclosure in court documents.       Section 342(c) of title 11, United States Code, currently      requires a debtor to include his or her taxpayer      identification number, which for an individual is almost      uniformly his or her social security account number, on any      notice the debtor gives to his or her creditors. Debtors are      required to give such notice in various contexts, including      the filing of adversary proceedings, such as a complaint to      determine the dischargeability of a debt, or contested      matters, such as a motion to avoid a lien impairing an      exemption.       As a copy of such notice is required to be filed with the      court, court files routine include unredacted social security      account numbers of debtors. By requiring only the last four      digits of a taxpayer identification number to appear an the      notice, the debtor's fun social security account number will      no longer appear in the court file and thus be protected from      public disclosure.       The amendment also adds a provision to section 342(c) to      require that adequate notice of the bankruptcy filing is      given to a creditor who is added to the case after the      initial notice of the case has been sent. The taxpayer      identification number would be treated in the same manner in      the notice to a newly added creditor as the number was      treated in the initial notice to the original creditors. The      debtor is directed to send to the newly added creditors a      notice of the bankruptcy filing containing the debtor's full      taxpayer identification number, but to include only the last      four digits of the number in the copy of the notice filed      with the court.

Blommer, Assistant      Director, at (202) 502-1700.                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,                                                        Secretary.
