  Mr. DeFAZIO. The Republican do-nothing-of-substance Congress is unwilling to tackle issues of importance to the American people because they might upset their wealthy special interest campaign contributors in an election year. There is so much they could do and so little being done.  We could take care of the 7 million seniors who are about to fall in the doughnut hole of the so-called Medicare prescription drug benefit, getting no coverage, having to pay 2,600 bucks out of pocket. But that would upset the pharmaceutical industry.  We could increase the Federal minimum wage for the first time in 7 years. But tax cuts for millionaires take precedence.  And this week as every oil company announces record-breaking profits exceeding last year's record-breaking profits, what action is being taken to rein in the price gouging? None, because that would offend Big Oil.  Mr. Speaker, there is a lot the United States Congress can do. The problem is the Republican-run Congress is tied down by special interests.  It is time we take America in a new direction.                          ____________________[Page H5687]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     IT IS TIME FOR A NEW DIRECTION  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
