 President, today I wish to pay tribute to a respected historian of my hometown of Louisville, KY, who has sadly passed away. Samuel Wilson Thomas died on Thursday, October 4, of this year, at his home at the age of 74.  Louisville is a wonderful city, and I am always pleased to sing its praises. This is much easier to do thanks to the work of Mr. Thomas. He wrote 18 books touching on every corner of Louisville history, from the famous Churchill Downs to the legendary Cave Hill Cemetery, from Oxmoor Farm to Crescent Hill.  Sam Thomas received his bachelor's degree and Ph.D. from the University of Louisville. He is best known for serving as the first director and curator of Locust Grove, a National Historic Landmark that was the home to George Rogers Clark, the founder of Louisville. Locust Grove also hosted three U.S. Presidents--Monroe, Jackson, and Taylor--and was a stopping point for famed explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark upon their return from their expedition to the Pacific.  The log cabin at Locust Grove was Sam Thomas's home for two decades. In his role as director and curator, he oversaw Locust Grove's restoration with careful attention paid to the preservation of its history.  Mr. Thomas also taught at the University of Louisville, edited numerous local publications, and published a host of articles. His role in preserving the history of Louisville and the legacy of its famous inhabitants was tremendous and will not be forgotten.  I know my colleagues join me in expressing gratitude for Sam Thomas's body of work and in extending sympathies to his family, including his wife, Debbie; his brother and sister-in-law, Jim and Susanna; his niece, Sheena McGuffey; his nephews, Ian Thomas, Mason Thomas, and Cas McGuffey; and many other beloved friends and family members.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an obituary for Mr. Samuel Wilson Thomas printed in the Louisville Courier-Journal be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Oct. 6, 2012] Samuel Wilson Thomas, 74, Died Thursday, October 4, 2012, at His Home       Born on January 21, 1938, in Chestnut Hill, Penn., Sam      moved to Louisville shortly after his graduation from      Chestnut Hill Academy. He received his B.A. (1960) and Ph.D.      (1964) in chemistry from the University of Louisville.       Although Sam taught for a short time at UofL, his life and      career were forever changed when he began his long      association with Locust Grove, overseeing its restoration and      serving as its first director and curator. The log house      there was his home for nearly two decades.       Sam is the author of 18 seminal books on Kentucky topics,      all meticulously researched and primarily focused on      Louisville: its neighborhoods, landmarks, and corporations.       His most recent work includes histories of St. Matthews,      Anchorage, the Cherokee Triangle, Crescent Hill, Oxmoor Farm,      Cave Hill Cemetery, and Churchill Downs, but the project      closest to his heart was an overview of early Louisville      architecture.       He edited numerous publications for the Courier-Journal's      book division and published many articles on a host of      Kentucky subjects. He also co-authored with his brother Jim      ``The Simple Spirit,'' a pictorial history of Shaker Village      of Pleasant Hill.       He was also involved in the restoration of the Jefferson      County Courthouse, the Ferguson Mansion headquarters of The      Filson Historical Society, and the 1785 log house at Oxmoor.      He was a founder of Preservation Alliance and the George      Rogers Clark Press, a member of the Louisville Landmarks and      Preservation Districts Commission, and archivist of Jefferson      County.       Sam is survived by his wife, Debbie; brother, Jim      (Susanna); niece, Sheena McGuffey; and nephews, Ian Thomas,      Mason Thomas and Cas McGuffey.       Sam chose cremation and requested that no funeral or      memorial service be held. The family will receive friends      from 4 to 7 p.m. Monday, October 8, 2012, in the Audubon Room      at Locust Grove, 561 Blankenbaker Lane.       Memorial gifts may be directed to Locust Grove or to the      University of Louisville Photographic Archives, to which Sam      gave his collection of photographs and research materials.                          ____________________
