 Madam Speaker, the House originally passed H.R. 1444 by a voice vote on November 9, 1999. The bill authorized the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to plan, design, and construct fish screens, fish passage devices, and related features to mitigate impacts on fisheries related to irrigation system water diversions by local government entities in the Pacific Ocean drainage of the States of Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Idaho.  On April 13, 2000, the Senate amended H.R. 1444 by substituting H.R. 1444 with the text of S. 1723 and passed the bill by unanimous consent. The substance of S. 1723 is virtually identical to H.R. 1444. However, there are some technical changes which are being made today to clarify that fishery restoration is a priority.  In the Northwest, valuable salmon populations travel through various river basins as juvenile and adult fish. It has been demonstrated that fish screens and passages are an effective way to protect migrating fish from the deadly effects of water diversion projects. H.R. 1444 will encourage the construction of these fish-saving devices.  I compliment the authors, especially our colleague, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), for their leadership in this matter. This is a sound conservation bill, and I urge Members to vote aye.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
