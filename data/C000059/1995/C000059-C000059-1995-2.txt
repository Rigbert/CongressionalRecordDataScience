Speaker, I rise in strong support on the conference report on H.R. 2491, Balanced Budget Act of 1995. I wish to take my limited time to speak to the importance of the title V, Energy and Natural Resources Provisions, chapter 4--Federal Oil and Gas Royalties as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.  This chapter is the only legislative initiative taken during the last 13 years to cost effectively increase the Nation's third largest source of revenue--oil and gas royalties. This chapter establishes a comprehensive statutory plan to increase, not decrease, collection of royalty receipts due the United States. In short, it reduces the deficit. Without this chapter as part of the Seven Year Balanced Budget Act of 1995, an ineffective and costly royalty collection system will prevail, perpetuating long delays and uncollected royalties.  To increase royalty collections to reduce the deficit, the chapter:  First, requires the Secretary and delegated States to collect and protect all royalty claims within 6 years. To ensure full and complete collection of all receipts, extension of the 6-year period is permitted and lessees are required to provide records necessary for proper collection;  Second, requires the Secretary to increase the value of disputed claims by deciding appeals within 30 months that will result in additional royalty collections. Today, over $450 million of disputed claims languish in a bureaucratic appeal process and continue to lose value;  Third, allows States which receive one-half of royalties collected to protect their interests by performing royalty collection activities in partnership with the Secretary. This partnership increases receipts to both the U.S. Treasury and the States;   Fourth, requires more aggressive and cost-effective royalty collection by the Secretary and the delegated States which will increase the amount of collections within the 6-year period; and,  Fifth, increases oil and gas production on Federal lands by creating economic efficiencies to make Federal leases more competitive with private leases.  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that these changes increase royalty income over 7 years to the U.S. Treasury by $51 million and another $33 million to the States. Additional royalty collections will continue to occur for each fiscal year after the 7-year period. Collections well in excess of $51 million are likely to occur as the Secretary and States more aggressively collect royalties. Furthermore, net receipts are maximized through increased efficiencies, and production is stimulated under this chapter.  The truth is, the Federal oil and gas royalty chapter makes money, because it makes everybody, lessee and lessor alike, work to collect and pay royalties payments right the first time. And, it empowers the States to do the job on leases within their boundaries to ensure that royalty bills are fully paid on time, and for lower collection costs. The Governors of the two States with the most at stake--Wyoming and New Mexico--support this legislation because it will allow them to do their jobs better, fairer, and less expensively and ensure that this significant source of revenue to the U.S. Treasury and Western States will increase.  Some Democrats oppose this chapter because they would rather promote the status quo to allow bureaucrats an indefinite period of time to pursue money due the taxpayers. In spite of the positive CBO score, these same opponents claim royalties will be lost, but in truth, royalty collections will increase. States will have a more direct role, thereby increasing collections to use to for funding schools, highways, and social programs.  There has been many allegations about chapter four which are false and been used in attempt to divert attention from the provisions of this chapter which increase royalty collections, eliminate ineffective and costly administrative actions and allows States to form a partnership with the Secretary to participate in activities that directly impact the royalties they received from Federal leases. As part of the record, I would like to clarify the intent of various provisions of this chapter. This chapter in no way affects Indian lands or alters how the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 applies to Indian lands.  The intent of specific section of this chapter includes:                         SEC. 5361. DEFINITIONS  Definitions are contained in this section to provide guidance and clarity. Many of the definitions are critical to the underlying concepts. Under the provisions of the chapter, the definitions apply to Federal lands and Outer Continental Shelf lands, and in no way shall be applied to Indian lands.  The term ``obligation'' includes all of the duties which arise under a lease issued by the Government. A ``lessee'' is the person having a contractual relationship with the Federal Government. A ``delegated State'' defines activities, unless prohibited by the Constitution, a State may chose to perform pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement between the State and the Secretary to promote production and increase royalties received by the State and the U.S. Treasury. A ``State concerned'' is a State that receives a portion of the Federal royalties for Federal lands lying within the boundaries of the State and shall have a equal role with the Secretary in deciding the applicable provisions of the chapter. The term ``order to pay'' has been expressly defined. The committee believes that the information contained in this definition is necessary information for the tolling of the 6-year period.          SEC. 5362 maximizing receipts through state efforts  This entire chapter establishes a partnership between the Secretary and the States for the purpose of increasing royalty collections. This section is necessary to expand existing authority for States to perform all or a part of the activities under this chapter to ensure additional collections to the States and the U.S. Treasury within 6-year period. By expanding the States' role, States are provided the economic incentive to be more aggressive under the net receipts sharing provision of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act to collect new receipts to the States and U.S. Treasury. States receive 50 percent of all royalties received under Federal onshore oil and gas leases.  States currently may perform certain royalty audit activities if they enter into an agreement with the Secretary. This section allows a State to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Secretary to perform legally delegable royalty and lease management activities. If a Federal activity is not deemed to be inherently Federal and can be performed in a manner with the efficient and timely collections of royalty requirements of this section, an interested State may pursue an agreement with the Secretary to perform such activity and funding shall be consistent with current delegation of authority agreements. If an activity is determined to not be constitutionally delegable to a State, it shall not impact any other delegable activity or provision of this chapter. A State's compensation to perform delegated activities shall be subject to net receipt sharing, and the State shall receive compensation for State costs allocated to a State's net receipts during the following fiscal year. As of the date of enactment, existing State delegation agreements to perform audits or inspections, nothing under this chapter shall impair those agreements. All State actions must conform with the provisions of this chapter.  SEC. 5363. SECRETARIAL AND DELEGATED STATES' ACTIONS AND LIMITATION                                 PERIODS  This section requires collection of royalties and enforcement of royalty claims within 6 years. This 6-year period is the key component of this chapter because it is the driving mechanism to increase revenues to the U.S. Treasury and the States. To determine the amount owing, this section requires companies to provide records during the 6-year period and provides the Secretary and States a mechanism to toll the statute and protect collections if records are not made available. To ensure timely collections, the Debt Collection Act applies to obligations that are enforced during the 6-year period.  The Secretary and the delegated States are required to perform cost-effective collections in order to have sufficient resources to increase collections during the 6-year period. The Secretary and the State concerned are required to determine what Federal accounting and collection activities cannot be performed cost effectively and eliminate redundant auditing efforts.  This section also requires the Secretary to decide and initiate collection of royalties from appealed claims within 2\1/2\ years and provides a framework for settlement of litigated cases. All appeals decided by the Secretary shall be binding on the State. The requirement is a necessary part of this section's purpose, which is to ensure collection of all disputed royalty amounts due the United States, thereby increasing revenues to the U.S. Treasury within the 6-year period. It eliminates losses associated with stale and uncollectible claims.                   SEC. 5364. ADJUSTMENT AND REFUNDS  In order to ensure that additional royalties are collected within the 6-year period, all adjustments to royalty payments are required to be made within 5 years. A key component of additional royalties being cost-effectively collected within the 6 years is the requirement that interest be calculated and paid at the time of any adjustment.    SEC. 5365. ROYALTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INTEREST, AND PENALTIES  This section creates an analogous system to the IRS for interest on overpaid and underpaid royalties, thereby encouraging royalties to be paid accurately the month following the month of production. The interest rate for under payments will be short term rate plus three points and for overpayments the interest rate will be the short term rate plus two points, regardless of the amounts of the underpayment or overpayment. Increased receipts to the U.S. Treasury and the States are achieved by the establishment of a more efficient and cost-effective accounting system which is necessary so that royalties paid can be verified within the limitation period. This section also imposes a new statutory assessment on lessees who chronically submit erroneous reports, thereby encouraging proper payment and increasing revenues. These are the only type of assessments that can be imposed by the Secretary.  If the Secretary determines that a lessee has paid in excess of 10 percent of its total royalty obligation for all of its leases subject to this act and further determines that such excessive payment was made for the sole purpose of receiving interest, the Secretary shall not pay interest on the amounts paid in excess of 10 percent. The committee expects lessees to place excess cash in other interest-bearing accounts rather than with the Minerals Management Service and hence a determination by the Secretary that an overpayment was made for the sole purpose of receiving interest shall be the exception.  Lessees will be allowed to submit an appropriate amount of royalties to avoid underpayment or nonpayment interest charges. When an estimated payment is made, the royalty payment becomes due at the end of the month following the period covered by the estimated payment. The committee does not intend to restrict the period of time covered by an estimate to 30 days.  This section provides that the lessee clarify who is responsible for the payment of royalties and notify the Secretary. The committee intends to eliminate the delay in collection of these royalties because the Secretary will contact only those parties that are liable, or designated to be liable, to remit royalty. The Interior Board of Land Appeals Mesa decision demonstrates that the Secretary's current royalty collection practices must be altered to comply with the law. This section does not reduce the Secretary's ability to accept payment from any party or their ability to pursue parties who are secondarily liable.  To ensure proper collections, this provision clarifies which party is primarily liable for the underlying royalty obligation, which is consistent with lease terms. The provision does not alter or restrict a lessee designation of who may report and pay royalties on their behalf.            SEC. 5366. ALTERNATIVES FOR MARGINAL PROPERTIES  Regulatory relief and other options to conventional and costly royalty accounting are established for marginal wells to increase royalties and provide the Secretary and States additional resources to aggressively collect royalties from more prolific properties within the 6-year period. This reform for marginal (low production) properties results in additional receipts from oil and gas production that would otherwise be abandoned. This section increases oil and gas production on Federal lands by creating economic efficiencies to make Federal leases more competitive with private leases.  This section requires the Secretary and the State concerned to determine the amount of what marginal production from a lease or leases or well or wells will be subject to a prepayment or regulatory relief. If a State concerned does not consent, the prepayments or regulatory relief cannot be made.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Seven Year Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The Federal oil and gas royalty chapter is sound.
