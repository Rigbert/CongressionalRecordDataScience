 President, I only want to clarify two things. One, if I said there were no complaints at my town meetings about the program, there were, but I found a great deal of people who had enrolled very satisfied and also satisfied with the process.  The second thing is, it has to be a policy decision by Congress to do what I want to do, so it is still up to Congress to make this decision. I would be willing to make this decision if it was made first, but your amendment is up today. So it is still a choice we are making.  I yield the floor.
