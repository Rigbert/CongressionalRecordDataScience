I mentioned Cesar Vargas, who is here, but Gaby Pacheco, and so many others who have worked so hard for this chance, for this day, and my promise to them is this: As long as I can stand behind this desk and grab this microphone and use my power as a Senator, I will be pushing for this DREAM Act. It is my highest priority. It is a matter of simple American justice, and I would hope the 11 Republicans who joined us last time will stop cowering in the shadows and come forward and join us in a bipartisan effort and not stop us procedurally from even debating and deliberating this critical issue.  For those who are so sad today, take heart. Tomorrow is another day, and we will be there to fight for you, and many others will join us. Don't give up your dream to be part of this great Nation.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Hawaii.
