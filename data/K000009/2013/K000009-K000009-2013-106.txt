While I have some sympathy for this issue--and it's not a new one to this bill--I believe that more consistency should be brought to the way we evaluate wetland impacts, not less, as this amendment would ensure.  The Charleston Method has been utilized for over two decades in various Corps districts, and it is a quick and inexpensive and consistent methodology for use by the regulated public and the Corps. In 2006 and 2007, the New Orleans district worked with its Federal and State partners to modify the Charleston Method so that it better reflected the unique conditions found in south Louisiana, resulting in the Modified Charleston Method that our colleagues have suggested.  The use of this method is a longstanding one in many Corps districts. Many regulatory customers use the tool to assess their potential mitigation requirements for their impacts as well as credits required at mitigation banks. This transparency in Corps mitigation requirements has helped the applicant prepare a complete application package and determine mitigation costs up front--importantly, costs up front--costs often that are borne by the Federal taxpayer.  The suspension of the use of the Charleston Method in Corps districts would require that any pending permit application, under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and pending mitigation banks, would need to be reevaluated using a different assessment tool or methodology, or, in the absence of such a methodology, use the best professional judgment to determine appropriate mitigation requirements for impacts and for available credits in mitigation banks. All approved mitigation banks with available credits that were determined by the process would be temporarily closed until a new methodology could be developed and the banks' credits converted to the credit system of the new methodology.  These banks were established utilizing the credit system of the Charleston Method, and until a similar credit system can be determined for proposed impact sites, it would not be possible to correlate the new requirements in the old credit system.  So we are into the weeds on this one, and we know that the difficulty at the edges--where the water meets the land, where we have very severe coastal conditions that occur as a result of weather changes and so forth--do require us to be more land planning conscious. I've seen the work that the Corps has done in Louisiana, and I appreciate the gentlemen's concern about their home State. I think to try to change this in this bill is probably not wise policy, and we know the costs of these damaged areas to the taxpayers of the United States. With coastal storms being what they are, we anticipate greater coastal activity, and I think that wiser planning is better than moving to a process that, I think, is less rigorous.  So, on those bases, I oppose the gentlemen's amendment, but I do thank them very much for their deep service to their State, to their region, which has been so impacted by changes in our environment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).  The amendment was agreed to.
