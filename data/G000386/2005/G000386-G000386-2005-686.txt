 We are not talking about changing anything in regard to filibusters on legislation because we understand that is where you can work compromises. You cannot really work compromises when it comes to an individual--is it either up or down. But you can change words, you can change paragraphs, you can rewrite an entire bill to get to 60, to get to finality, on any piece of legislation.  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend from Iowa is entirely correct. The filibuster would be preserved for all legislative items, preserved for executive branch nominations, not for the judiciary. It would be preserved even for district court judges, where Senators have historically played a special role in eitherselecting or blocking district judges. All of that would be preserved. If we have to exercise the constitutional option tomorrow, it will be narrowly crafted to deal only with future Supreme Court appointments and circuit court appointments, which is where we believe the aberrational behavior has been occurring in the past and may occur in the future.
