President, today I am pleased to join Senators Portman, Blumenthal, Cantwell, Brown, and Kirk to introduce the Child Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act of 2013. This bipartisan legislation will help us to better understand and combat the unforgivable and fast-growing criminal enterprise of trafficking children for sex right here in the U.S.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and ignore this terrible problem. Child victims of sex trafficking need and deserve the full range of coordinated assistance and care required to help them recover from this trauma.  Unfortunately, some people still refuse to acknowledge that American children are being bought and sold for sex and they criticize the few estimates surrounding trafficking rates that do exist. As a policymaker, it is hard to advance an issue when there are critics who deny its very existence. For those of us who have spoken to law enforcement officers, child welfare workersand judges who work with these victims every day, we know that denying that the problem exists will not make it go away.  I became engaged in efforts to address child trafficking a few years ago when I had the opportunity to accompany police officers along 82nd Avenue in my hometown of Portland. I will never forget a 15-year-old girl working out there with the tools of the trade--a cell phone to stay in constant contact with her pimp and report how much money she had made; a 15-inch butcher knife to try to protect herself; and, a purse full of condoms.  This problem does exist, but we still do not know its full scope--we do not know how many children in the U.S. are victimized by pimps, Johns and traffickers every year. Quantifying the problem, as simple a step as that may seem, is truly is the first step in bringing these children out of the shadows to help them progress from victims to survivors.  The Child Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act of 2013 provides a framework for systematically identifying and tracking the number of child trafficking victims who are in our Nation's foster care system. It would further require child welfare agencies to promptly report information on missing and abducted children to law enforcement and would require law enforcement authorities to notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, when a child is missing from State care.  The bill would also take steps to ensure children who are sex trafficked or exploited are treated as victims, not criminals. The protections, services and protocols established for abused and neglected children within the child welfare system are rarely extended to trafficked children and youth, and in most States, such children aren't even categorized as victims. Instead, they are often sent to the juvenile justice system and criminalized for being raped and trafficked.  The Child Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act would amend Federal law to say all child victims of sex trafficking are victims of abuse and neglect. It would require state plans, under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, designed to improve child protection services contain: provisions and procedures requiring identification and assessment of all reports involving children known or suspected to be victims of sex trafficking; provisions and procedures for training child protective services workers to identify and provide comprehensive services for children who are victims of sex trafficking; a description of efforts to coordinate with State law enforcement, juvenile justice, and social service agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters to serve these victims; and an annual State data report on the number of children identified as known or suspected to be victims of trafficking.  These steps alone will not solve the problem before us. These are still some very daunting problems that need to be overcome, and the current fiscal climate alone presents a significant barrier to providing resources needed by victims, child welfare workers, law enforcement and service providers. Still, this is an important step toward making sure that vulnerable foster children are protected from pimps, Johns and traffickers.                                 ______                                       By
