Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule.  Unfortunately the chairman of the Committee on Rules was not present when I testified before the Committee on Rules, but immediately preceding me was a gentleman from Alabama talking about the McVeigh trial and that 168 Americans, innocent children, women, Government workers, law enforcement officials, people seeking services were murdered by a violent criminal heinous act. All of us believe that justice is being done in that case.  Mr. Speaker, 1,000 times that number, yes, 10,000 times that number, have been murdered, raped, driven from their homes, subjected to genocide.  There is no one on this floor for genocide. Everyone on this floor would say that in a civil world international genocide, as we said in Nuremberg, needs to be acted against collectively by the international community and hold accountable international criminals.  I sought to offer an amendment to carry forward the Dayton Peace accords which said that all of the signatories to that accord and all the nations of the United Nations would hold accountable the criminals in Bosnia.  Now I understand that there are debates about what does that expose us to, how far should we go with our troops? I understand those are legitimate questions. What I do not understand, Mr. Speaker, is why we could not debate that on the floor of this, the people's House.
