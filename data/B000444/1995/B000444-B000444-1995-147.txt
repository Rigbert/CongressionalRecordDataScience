 I was just curious. I would point out to him that in the Federal prison system, we stopped fooling around--unlike the State of Oklahoma or the State of Delaware and other States--we stopped fooling around like many who served in the State legislature fool around. We passed an amendment that the Senator from Delaware offered in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It is called ``the same time for the same crime.'' You get convicted in the Federal court, you go to jail for all the time, and I am just sorry the State legislatures are not as we have been and as the Federal Government has been for a long time.
