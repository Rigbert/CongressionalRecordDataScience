President, today the Commission on Opportunity in Athletics sent Secretary Rod Paige their recommendations to change the landmark gender equity law--Title IX.  Two members of the Commission--Julie Foudy and Donna de Varona--decided not to sign the report and instead submitted a minority report because they found the final report slanted, incomplete, and failing to acknowledge that discrimination against women in education still exists. I am very disappointed the Commission did not write a more balanced report, which all members would have felt comfortable signing.  Since its passage more than 30 years ago as part of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title IX has played a monumental role in the advancement of equality for women throughout America. This landmark legislation has opened the doors to colleges, universities and sports team locker rooms for our sisters, daughters and friends. Women's participation in sports has dramatically increased so that women now make up about 40 percent of all college athletics, compared with 15 percent in 1972. Studies have shown that women who participate in athletics learn important values such as, teamwork, leadership, and discipline--values that stay with them throughout their lives.  On January 29, Senators Daschle, Snowe, Kennedy, Specter, Murrayand I wrote to Education Secretary Rod Paige urging him to defend and strengthen the enforcement of current Title IX policies and regulations. Today, I joined those same Senators in a letter urging President Bush to reaffirm the current policies under Title IX and to reject the changes to those policies proposed by the Commission.  Over the past 30 years, Title IX has been a good and fair law and it should not be weakened in any way. I urge President Bush and Education Secretary Rod Paige to give as much consideration to the report filed by Julie Foudy and Donna de Varona as they do to the majority report and to ultimately reject any efforts to weaken Title IX and its goal to address widespread sex discrimination in athletics and all other aspects of education.                          ____________________
