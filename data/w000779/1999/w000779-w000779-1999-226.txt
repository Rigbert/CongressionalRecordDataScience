President, online consumer purchases are exploding, having topped more than $8 billion last year. But the goldrush in cyberbuying is likely to carry along with it a boom in cyberfraud. As with telemarketing fraud, fraudulent schemes over the Internet are increasingly aimed at seniors--some of our most vulnerable citizens. Congress can help head-off this cybercrime by extending our current telemarketing laws to encompass fraud on the Net. That is the purpose of the legislation I am introducing today.  In response to the staggering $40 billion consumers lose in telephone fraud each year, Congress passed the l998 Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act. I strongly supported that effort. The new law builds upon the four federal laws enacted since the early 1990s that deal directly with telemarketing fraud. The 1998 law stiffens penalties for telemarketing fraud by toughening the sentencing guidelines--especially for crimes against the elderly, requires criminal forfeiture to ensure the booty of telemarketing crime is not used to commit further fraud, mandates victim restitution to ensure victims are the first ones compensated, adds conspiracy language to the list of telemarketing fraud penalties so that prosecutors can find the masterminds behind the boiler rooms, and will help law enforcement zero in on quick-strike fraud operations by giving them the authority to move more quickly against suspected fraud.  The 1998 law is a good step forward but it's not enough to deal with today's digital economy. As more Americans--and especially seniors--go online, cyberscams are proliferating. The Congressional crackdown on telemarketing fraud will only encourage cyberscammers to migrate to the Net unless the law gets there first. That is the purpose of the legislation I am pleased to introduce today with Senator Baucus.  The Telemarketing Fraud and Seniors Protection Act, which I introduced last year as S. 2587, simply extends current law against telemarketing fraud to include the same crimes committed over the Internet. The approach expands the existing law applicable to mail, telephone, wire, and television fraud to fraud over the Internet, and its enforcement would follow the same division of labor there is today between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice. The bill would apply the same tough penalties that Congress enacted in l998 to cyberscams. The growth of Internet telephony makes it more attractive for cyberscammers to set up shop offshore, beyond the reach of U.S. law. My bill would address this problem by allowing law enforcement to freeze the assets and deny entry to the United States of those convicted of cyberfraud.  The bill takes special aim against those attempt to defraud one of our most vulnerable groups--our senior citizens. Seniors are the target for more than 50 percent of telemarketing fraud. Although telemarketers convicted of fraud face stiff penalties--a minimum of 5-10 years in jail and restitution payments to their victims, we also need to better educate and inform senior citizens on how to avoid becoming victims of telemarketing fraud in the first place, and how to assist law enforcement in catching the perpetrators.  The legislation would also authorize the Administration on Aging, through its network of area agencies of aging, to conduct an outreach program to senior citizens on telemarketing fraud. Seniors would be advised against providing their credit card number, bank account or other personal information unless they had initiated the call unsolicited. They would also be informed of their consumer protection rights and any toll-free numbers and other resources to report suspected illegal telemarketing.  Mr. President, the Federal Trade Commission is off to a good start against cyberscammers. Some of the operations the FTC has targeted are not companies at all, but merely websites that promise consumers everything from huge new consulting contracts to the elimination of bad credit reports. They may use scare tactics to frighten consumers into sending important personal financial information and hundreds of dollars for services the consumer will never see, or attempt to lure consumers with the promise of helping them cash in on the Internet explosion. The FTC also has a strong operation going against junk e-mailers. My legislation will complement and strengthen the FTC's effort to target telemarketing fraud over the Internet and especially when such fraud is aimed at seniors.  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Baucus. This legislation is similar to that which Rep. Weygand has introduced in the House of Representatives. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to cosponsor this important legislation, and ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 699       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,        TITLE I--TELEMARKETING FRAUD AND SENIORS PROTECTION ACT     SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Telemarketing Fraud and      Seniors Protection Act''.     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Telemarketing fraud costs consumers nearly      $40,000,000,000 each year.       (2) Senior citizens are often the target of telemarketing      fraud.       (3) Fraudulent telemarketers compile into so-called ``mooch      lists'' the names of consumers who are potentially vulnerable      to telemarketing fraud.       (4) According to the American Association of Retired      Persons, 56 percent of the names on such ``mooch lists'' are      individuals age 50 or older.       (5) The Department of Justice has undertaken successful      investigations and prosecutions of telemarketing fraud      through various     operations, including ``Operation Disconnect'', ``Operation      Senior Sentinel'', and ``Operation Upload''.       (6) The Federal Bureau of Investigation has helped provide      resources to assist organizations such as the American      Association of Retired Persons to operate outreach programs      designed to warn senior citizens whose names appear on      confiscated ``mooch lists''.       (7) The Administration on Aging was formed, in part, to      provide senior citizens with the resources, information, and      assistance their special circumstances require.       (8) The Administration on Aging has a system in place to      inform senior citizens of the dangers of telemarketing fraud.       (9) Senior citizens need to be warned of the dangers of      telemarketing fraud before they become victims of such fraud.     SEC. 103. PURPOSE.       It is the purpose of this title to protect senior citizens,      through education and outreach, from the dangers of      telemarketing fraud and fraud over the Internet and to      facilitate the investigation and prosecution of fraudulent      telemarketers.
