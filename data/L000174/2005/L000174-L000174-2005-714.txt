President, I am a cosponsor of the AgJOBS bill, which will do a world of good for farmers and farmworkers in Vermont and around our Nation.  First, this amendment would reform the H2A program for temporary agricultural labor. As it currently exists, this program is cumbersome and deeply unpopular with farmers. As a result, it is underused and promotes the widespread use of illegal labor on our Nation's farms. Indeed, experts estimate that more than half of our Nation's farmworkers are here illegally.  Second, this amendment would provide an opportunity for that illegal workforce to come out of the shadows and obtain legal permanent residency in return for the contributions they have made and will make to American agriculture, both before and after enactment. It would allow undocumented aliens who can demonstrate that they have worked in agriculture for 100 or more days in a 12-month period during the last 18 months to apply for legal status. Eligible applicants would be granted temporary resident status. If the farmworker then works at least 360 days in agriculture during the next 6 years, he or she may apply for permanent resident status. Workers would be free to choose from any employer.
