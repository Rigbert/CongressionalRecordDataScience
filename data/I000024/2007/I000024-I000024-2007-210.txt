President, let me make one comment. Something the Senator from Georgia said is very important. This is not a spending bill, this is an authorization bill. If we didn't have this bill in the process, then the appropriators, when the bill would come up, would have all kinds of projects that did not go through a process, where we would know if there is local support and so forth. So the conservative position is to authorize these things and, if there is something somebody doesn't like, go after it when the appropriations come.  We have a good bill. I thank the chairman for working with us. I know the Senator from Louisiana wants to be heard, also.
