As we, as well, also discussed last week, can the leader bring us up to date on the progress of the budget resolution and when he expects it to be marked up in committee and when we can expect to have that bill on the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. It is my understanding after a lot of discussion that Chairman Nussle and his Budget Committee members are working furiously to complete all their hearings and be prepared to mark it up possibly as early as next week. I would imagine moving the budget resolution to the floor the week after the committee reports its resolution out of the committee.
