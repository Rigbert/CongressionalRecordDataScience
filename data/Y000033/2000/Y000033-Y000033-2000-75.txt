Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of the proposed Tribal Justice Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 1999.  This bill authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to tribal justice systems to provide training and technical assistance for the development, enrichment, and enhancement of tribal justice systems.  This legislation also authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to provide technical assistance to Indian tribes to enable them to carry out programs to support their tribal justice systems.  Let me point out that all grants provided for in this legislation will be subject to the availability of appropriations.  S. 1508 was passed by the other body on November 19, 1999. Very frankly, Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill to many tribes, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
