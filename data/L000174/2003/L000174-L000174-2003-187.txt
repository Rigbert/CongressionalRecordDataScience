President, I want to clarify a sentence in the committee report, Report 108-106, accompanying S. 1426, the fiscal year 2004 foreign operations bill.  On page 38 of the report, under the heading ``Middle East Partnership Initiative,'' the committee expresses support for using a portion of MEPI funds ``for scholarships for needy Muslim students at the American University of Beirut.'' We do support that, but we intended to also mention the American University in Cairo and the Lebanese American University. Their omission was purely an oversight. I ask my friend from Kentucky, the subcommittee chairman, Senator McConnell, if he agrees with me about this.  Mr. McCONNELL. I do. My friend from Vermont is correct that this was an oversight. We intended to express support for the use of MEPI funds for scholarships for Muslim students at the other American universities in the Middle East, as well as at the American University of Beirut.                          ____________________
