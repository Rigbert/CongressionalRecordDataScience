Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman of the subcommittee and Mr. Shays and the chairman of the full committee.  It is indeed an honor that I will speak on Charlton Heston today. We have already heard some of the roles that he played in ``Planet of the Apes,'' ``Julius Caesar,'' ``Antony and Cleopatra,'' ``Omega Man,'' and I can go on down the line. His famous roles, of course, were Moses, Michelangelo, Andrew Jackson, John the Baptist, Mark Antony, El Cid, and Ben Hur.  Some people may not remember his role in politics. He became very active as president of the Screen Actors Guild. Before every actor in the world got involved politically, he was involved in the Screen Actors Guild. He was also very active and involved, as mentioned by the chairman, in civil rights. He marched with Martin Luther King. And one of my interests was that he enlisted in the Army Air Force in World War II and served 2 years as a B-25 gunner in the Aleutian chain, a God-awful place it was, but part of my great State of Alaska, and defended against the enemy at that time with great honor.  He had two children. He married the love of his life, Lydia Clarke, in 1944, and was married to her for the rest of his life.  He was the president of the NRA from June 1998 until April 2003, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bush.  I have to say I knew him personally. I never called him Chuck or Charles, it was always Mr. Heston or Mr. President because he was president of an organization which I am very proud of, and that is the NRA, the National Rifle Association. He probably did more to protect the freedoms of America in his actions as president of that organization than any other individual. And that may not be proper with certain people in this body, but he did guarantee us, through the second amendment, the right to protect ourselves, the right to protect the castle which we live in, the right to be able to protect those that we love against those who would do us harm. He believed in it, as I believe in it. It is very, very important.  If America were to recognize one individual who probably contributed most to our individual freedoms, it would be Charlton Heston.                          ____________________
