President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering legislation today that will leave no doubt about the constitutional propriety of the appointment of administrative patent judges and administrative trademark judges within the Patent and Trademark Office. I thank my cosponsor, Senator Specter, for his work with me on this. These judges are currently appointed to their positions by the Director of the PTO. Our bill will change this process, so that the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Director of the PTO, will appoint these judges, thus bringing the process more clearly in line with the appointments clause of the Constitution. This legislation will also allow the Secretary of Commerce to ratify the appointment of the current judges. A companion bill was introduced in the House.  It is important to ensure that the decisions made by these judges are allowed to stand on their merits, and that they are not nullified by a potential constitutional challenge to the appointment process somewhere down the line. By making this small change to the existing law, Congress can leave no doubt that the appointment of these judges complies fully with the process set out by the Constitution.  I am pleased that the Senate will adopt this measure today, and I hope that the House of Representatives will quickly take it up and pass it so that it can be sent to the President for his signature without delay.
