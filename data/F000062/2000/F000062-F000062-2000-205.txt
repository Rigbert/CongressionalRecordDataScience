 President, I want to take a few minutes as a 7-year member of the Judiciary Committee, to set the record straight on some of the comments that have been made with respect to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I have heard that circuit called a rogue circuit, out of control, out of sync with the rest of the Nation. All of this is based on statistics for 1 year, 1996-1997, when the Supreme Court reversed that circuit 27 out of 28 times.  The question is, Even in that year, did that place it as the most reversed circuit? The answer is no because even in that year they fell in the middle of the pack. When the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 95 percent, it was still less than five other circuits: The Fifth, the Second, the Seventh, D.C., and Federal Circuits all had a 100-percent reversal rate.  You can seek out the Ninth Circuit because it has 9,000 cases on appeal as opposed to a circuit with 1,000 or 1,500 cases. But the record is the record, even in that year, that much maligned year that is the basis of all of these comments.  Let's look at some of the other years. In the 1998-1999 Supreme Court session, the Supreme Court reviewed 18 cases of the Ninth Circuit; 4 were affirmed, 11 were reversed, and 3 had mixed rulings. So only 11 out of 18 cases were outrightly reversed. That is a 61-percent reversal rate.  Is that the worst? No. This is less than the reversal rates for the Third Circuit, 67 percent; the Fifth Circuit, which was reversed 80 percent of the time; and the Seventh Circuit, 80 percent of the time; the Eleventh Circuit, 88 percent; and the Federal Circuit, 75 percent.  In terms of reversals, the Ninth Circuit is not at the bottom of the pack, it is in the middle of the pack.  I think I know why there were newspaper articles. The Ninth Circuit has been made a target by many conservatives who either want to see it split or, in some way, destroyed. That has become very clear to me as a member of the Judiciary Committee as I have watched proposal after proposal surface.  Am I always pleased with the Ninth Circuit? Absolutely not. Do I like all the decisions? Of course not. But the point is, the Ninth Circuit is well within the parameters, and in virtually every year that one can look at reversals, one will see the Ninth Circuit is approximately in the middle of the pack.  The argument is also made that Clinton appointees are making decisions that are being reversed. I have looked at the Ninth Circuit judges who were reversed over the last 3 years by the Supreme Court. Once again I correct the record. On only eight occasions in the last three full Supreme Court terms have Clinton appointees on the Ninth Circuit joined in decisions later reversed by the Supreme Court. At the end of the 1998-1999 term, Clinton appointees were 20 percent of the judges on the Ninth Circuit.  If one wants to compare, compare Clinton appointees with Reagan appointees. Reagan appointees on the Ninth Circuit have been overturned in 30 instances from the 1996-1997 Supreme Court term through the 1998-1999 term. Currently, there are the same number of Reagan appointees on the Ninth Circuit as Clinton appointees.  I have wondered, as I have watched this debate emerge for the last 7 years, why there is this persistent effort to demean, to break up, in some way to destroy this court. I have a hard time fathoming why.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              United States Courts                                        for the Ninth Circuit,                                          Reno, NV, March 1, 2000.     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: I write on behalf of the      Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to emphasize the importance of      filling the judicial vacancies on this court.       During the four years that I have been Chief Judge of the      Ninth Circuit, we have had up to ten vacancies on the court      of appeals. We now have six vacancies, two have been vacant      since 1996, two since 1997, one since 1998, and one since      1999. It has been very difficult to operate a court of      appeals with up to one-third of our active judges missing. As      you know, I have worked with the White House and the Senate      in an attempt to fill these vacancies in a timely manner, and      I am continuing to do so.       As Chief Judge, I have implored our active judges and our      senior judges, on an emergency basis, to carry a larger      caseload during this interim while the vacancies are being      filled, in order to do our best to avoid building up a      backlog of cases with the consequent delay for the litigants.       Our judges have been most responsive in hearing      considerably more cases than would ordinarily be assigned. I      am very grateful, but I cannot expect the judges to do this,      on an emergency basis, for the indefinite future.       In addition, we have called upon the district judges within      our circuit to serve on panels, as well as visiting judges      from other circuits. However, this is not the ideal way to      perform the services of a court of appeals. The appeals from      the Ninth Circuit should be heard by the judges of the Ninth      Circuit Court of Appeals.       Despite all these efforts, we do have a backlog of cases,      which principally affect civil cases, some of which have had      to wait a year or more to be heard. My major concern is that      we have had a significant increase in filings this past year,      which considerably exceed the number of cases we are able to      terminate even with this enhanced effort. In the year ending      December 31, 1999, the number of appeals filed was 9,444, and      the number of appeals terminated was 8,407. This is a      difference of over 1,000 cases.       If our six vacancies were filled and those judges were on      our court, it would mean we could decide an additional 800      cases on the merits. If they are not filled, I can anticipate      considerable delay for the litigants of this circuit.       Our court is very pleased that the leadership of the Senate      has committed to hold a floor vote this month on nominees      Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. We have every hope that      they will be confirmed. We would ask, however, that the other      nominees, Barry P. Goode, James F. Duffy, Jr., Richard C.      Tallman, and Johnnie B. Rawlinson receive hearings before the      Judiciary Committee in the near future. It is vital to our      Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.       By the way of emphasizing the need brought about by our      increasing caseload and the importance of filling these      vacancies, I might note a little historical perspective. In      1980, shortly after I came on the court of appeals, we had 23      active judges with a caseload of 3,000 appeals. Today, with 6      of our 28 judgeships vacant, we have 22 active judges to hear      over 9,000 appeals. You can see the importance of proceeding      promptly with the confirmation process.       I might make one other observation--I have noted that the      reversal rate of the Supreme Court in one unusual year, 1996-     97, has assumed some importance in the hearings. Even in that      year, when the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 95%, it was      less than five other circuits--the Fifth, Second, Seventh,      D.C., and Federal Circuits--all with a 100% reversal rate. In      the 1997-98 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 76%,      equivalent to that of the First Circuit's 75%, and less than      the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits' 100% reversal rate. In the      1998-99 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 78%,      equivalent to that of the Second and Federal Circuits' 75%,      and less than the Fifth Circuit's 80%, the Seventh Circuit's      80%, and the Eleventh Circuit's 88% reversal rates.       However, the important point to emphasize, in my opinion,      is that the reversal rate has little to do with the      effectiveness of any circuit court of appeals. For example,      the 13, 14, or 20 cases reversed in a term were out of 4,500      cases decided on the merits in the Ninth Circuit. The      reversal rate in any circuit should also have little to do      with the nomination or confirmation of judges to fill      vacancies on a court.       Our judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will      certainly appreciate any efforts on your parts to afford the      judicial nominees a hearing in the near future and a prompt      vote on the floor of the Senate.           Yours sincerely,                                                 Procter Hug, Jr.,                                                      Chief Judge.
