Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to comment additionally on food safety. And I would like to point out what was done in terms of funding, what was done in the research authorization bill passed through the Committee on Agriculture and ultimately, law. Food safety was given a high priority. We designated in that legislation that food safety research should have a priority, both in the detection of food-borne pathogens and in reducing food-borne pathogens. In the effort to make sure that the food that America eats is healthy both the Research Authorization bill and this appropriation bill gives priority.  I would like to point out to my colleagues we included language in the authorization bill important in assuring coordination of the activities of the Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration. We directed that those three agencies of government start working together now to coordinate their efforts in the event of a health risk from food-borne pathogens. A very important part of our food safety efforts must be preparedness. USDA has already designated food safety efforts as a priority. Food and Drug has already designated it as a priority, and the Centers for Disease Control has of course always had it as a priority. The coordination of efforts at the local, state and national level is important as is research and education.  I think most of us agree that this is a very important aspect of how we make sure that disease outbreaks from food-borne pathogens is minimized. As we become more and more dependent on additional food products coming in from the other countries, because of new regulations, and I might add amendments, that put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage, food safety will become an ever more important issue.
