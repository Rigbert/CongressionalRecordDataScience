I know the State of Oregon closed their schools earlier this year, and the idea that we would eliminate part of the school year, afterschool programs, and summer school programs, to me, means these young people are not going to be given the chance they need to improve themselves.  I know the Senator from Nevada, probably more than anybody in this Chamber, has focused on the dropout issue. If we don't really have a sensitivity to the number of kids dropping out, we should not be surprised at what is happening to them. They end up with lives that are not as productive as they could be, and sometimes they end up in tragedy. If you are going to cut back on the school year, a child who really needs a helping hand to be a good student is more likely to be discouraged and less likely to be educated. How can that be good for our Nation? I know the Senator has focused on the dropout rate in the past.
