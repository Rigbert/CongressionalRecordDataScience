 President, let me say to my friend, the assistant Democratic leader, his points are well made both on the congratulations that are certainly due these individuals who have been confirmed tonight and on the need to improve the process by which we get individuals confirmed here in the Senate. I must say, without the able and effective assistance of the assistant Democratic leader, we would not have been able to clear some of these nominations tonight. I thank him for his perseverance in making that possible.                          ____________________
