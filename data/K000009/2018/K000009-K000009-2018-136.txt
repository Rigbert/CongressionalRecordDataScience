Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.  It was in 1935 that this body enacted the National Labor Relations Act. It guaranteed basic rights to private sector workers to organize into trade unions, to engage in contractual bargaining for decent wages and better conditions at work, and to take joint action, if necessary.  But in 1935, just like today, here, 2018, the Republican Party and business interests vehemently opposed passage of any laws that help workers. Little has changed. Once again our Republican colleagues trample on the backs of workers.  This legislation rolls back proven protections that allow wages to rise in places like California, and their casinos, from $10 an hour to $13 an hour. Now, these modest pay increases have helped elevate the workers who work in those casinos above the Federal poverty level.  Who has ever tried to buy a house in California or tried to live on $13 an hour or $10 an hour? You are not talking about a whole lot of money there, especially from a party that just gave $1 trillion away to the people at the very top.  But with this bill, our Republican colleagues chose to strip these hundreds of thousands of workers, the majority of whom are not members of Tribes but work in those casinos, of decent wages and their right to a voice in the workplace.  Wow.  Beneath their sheepskin costumes hides another Republican attack on worker rights in this country, this time under the guise of Tribal sovereignty.
