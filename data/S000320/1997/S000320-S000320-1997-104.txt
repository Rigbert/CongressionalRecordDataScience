 President, although the tax reconciliation bill promises to cut taxes by approximately $76 billion over 5 years and $238 billion over 10 years, it should be viewed as only a small step forward in providing tax relief to the American people.  I remind my colleagues this afternoon that we must not forsake our broader agenda to seek comprehensive reform of our tax system. Piecemeal tax cuts are not, and I want to say it again, are not a substitute for broad-based tax reform. Therefore, I rise today to offer the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act which will scrap the entire Income Tax Code as we know it and replace it with a system that taxes all income once and only once at one low, flat rate of 17 percent.  A flat tax, I believe, will correct the vast and pervasive problems of the current system. As illustrated before here, the complexity of Federal tax laws costs taxpayers approximately 5.3 billion hours to comply with the current Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Code is so complicated that even the IRS doesn't understand it.  In 1993, the IRS gave 8.5 million wrong answers to taxpayers seeking assistance, and the IRS sent out 5 million correction notices which turned out to be wrong.  In 1996, this past year, taxpayers spent a staggering $225 billion trying to comply with the Tax Code. Think about it--$225 billion in America spent by the taxpayers trying to comply with the Tax Code. This is a deadweight loss to the economy that is, as the Presiding Officer knows as a member of the Armed Services Committee, about equal to our national defense budget.  We live in a society that accepts the notion that some level of taxation is necessary to finance the cost of Government, but it is important that it does no more harm than is necessary to achieve the stated goal. The current Tax Code is the product of a 40-year experiment with social engineering that has hampered the effort of the American people to be free, bear the fruit of their labor and ultimately live the American dream.  Recently, the bipartisan national commission on restructuring the IRS came out with a report laying out their vision for a new and improved IRS. One of the key recommendations of this commission that was made was that simplification of the tax law is necessary to reduce taxpayer burden and to facilitate improved tax administration.  We need to address significant tax policy changes that will not only provide taxpayers with relief, but will simplify and equalize the tax collection in this country. Taxation is bad enough without administering that tax through the inefficient, inequitable, and oppressive tax system that we have today.  Rather than wading through stacks of complicated IRS forms and instruction manuals, under a flat tax taxpayers would file a simple, postcard-size return. When fully phased in, the family allowance would be $11,600 for a single person, $23,200 for a married couple filing jointly and $5,300 for each dependent child.  These allowances will be indexed to inflation under our bill. For a family of four, this will mean that their first $33,800 of income would be exempt from taxation by the Federal Government, which will assure a progressive average rate for low-income households.  The flat tax, I believe, will restore fairness to tax laws by treating everyone alike, regardless of what business they are in, whether or not they have a lobbyist in Washington or how much money they make. If you earn more, under the flat rate tax, you would pay more. Under the current system, one taxpayer may pay little or no taxes because they have paid an accountant or tax attorney to figure out the Tax Code for them. At the same time, another person with the same exact income but who does not have the professional assistance may pay much more in taxes. I say that is not fair.  Under a flat tax, this would end. People would not have to hire an accountant or tax attorney simply to comply with the law. Everyone would fill out the same simple, postcard-size return. Everyone will be taxed at the same rate. And, yes, everyone will pay their fair share.  Furthermore, the flat tax will eliminate the double taxation of savings and promote jobs and higher wages in this country. Because the flat tax applies a single low rate to all Americans, I feel it is the best replacement of the current system. I do not think that Americans should have to jump through hoops just to keep the money they have earned through their hard work. The current Tax Code basically says you can keep your money only if you do what we think you should do. This is not freedom; it is serfdom. The flat tax does away with Government micromanagement of people's personal lives and allows them to spend their hard-earned money as they see fit.  But perhaps the most important virtue of the flat tax is that it supports the basic value of work, savings, and individual liberty. It has been a commitment to these principles that has made America the most successful economy in the world. In recent years, we have watched as the private sector has streamlined itself. I think it is now time for us to streamline the Tax Code.                                 ______                                       By
