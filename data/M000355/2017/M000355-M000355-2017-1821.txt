 President, I wish to lay out the schedule for everyone. I know they are interested in knowing the way forward. I have discussed with the Democratic leader where we go from here.  The Senate is going to debate the pending joint resolution tonight for as long as there is interest in debate. Tomorrow the Senate will convene at 6:30 a.m. and immediately proceed to two rollcall votes: passage of the joint resolution of disapproval and cloture on the nomination of Betsy DeVos.  Restating that, debate tonight as long as our friends on the other side would like to debate, and tomorrow we will convene at 6:30 a.m. and immediately turn to two rollcall votes: passage of the joint resolution of disapproval and cloture on the nomination of Betsy DeVos.
