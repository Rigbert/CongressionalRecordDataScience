 President.  Mr. President, my amendment increases Function 500 budget authority and outlays to include the President's education initiatives, and adds the Resolution level for IDEA. The offset is a Function 920 across-the-board reduction of less than one percent, taken from non-defense discretionary funds.  The President's budget request only included a level of $35 million for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (I.D.E.A). To get the Federal Government back on track toward its responsibility to cover 40 percent of the cost of educating special education students at the local level, significant increases are necessary.  The Resolution level in fiscal year 99 for Function 500 is $500 million below a freeze. It does not provide enough funding for the important education initiatives requested by the President and supported by the American public: Continuing investments in education technology, including teacher training reflecting my Teacher Technology Training Act; creation of education empowerment zones; appropriations for Minority Teacher Recruitment; funding for the 21st Century Learning Centers; appropriations for Children's Literacy and Work Study; increases for Title I funding; an increase in the maximum Pell Grant; and increased funding for Safe and Drug-Free Schools.  My amendment makes education a higher priority within the construct of a balanced budget. I must point out that even with my amendment, the President and the Budget Committee have left other critical educational services unfunded. But by passing this amendment, we will take steps to stop the cuts to education, and get on the road toward results for American students.  Mr. President, the American people believe education should be a higher priority than its current 1.8 percent of total Federal outlays. They see the need to improve the quality of every Federal education program, minimize red tape, improve efficiency, and create collaboration. But, they also see our Nation facing increased enrollments, a teacher corps nearing retirement, and other factors which increase the overall need for education funding at this critical point in our history. The American people see that education must become a higher priority in our national budget.  Unfortunately, this budget fails to meet the education needs of America. It does not invest in the future. It cuts from services that are helping students in schools today. This budget resolution places America at a crossroads--and it takes us down the wrong road. A vote for the Murray amendment is a vote that honors our commitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education funding, but doesn't try to pit students against one another over limited federal dollars. We need to invest in the future, and we need a budget that reflects America's priorities.  Mr. President, when looking at the budget resolution as it came from the Committee, I think we need to ask ``what do the assumptions in the Republican budget resolution leave out?'' The answers are disturbing.  Within Function 500, for sub-function 501 (Elementary and Secondary Education), Chairman Domenici's Committee resolution starts with a freeze.  The resolution then adds $2.5 billion for funding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA), and $6.3 billion for Title VI School Reform efforts, for a total of $8.8 billion over 5 years.  From this amount, the majority then assumes that $2.2 billion will be saved through consolidation of current educational services, leaving their overall add to a freeze at $6.6 billion.  Mr. President, another important question now arises: Which important priorities of the American people were left out when the majority ignored the President's new initiatives?  The only education programs explicitly left unfunded by the discretionary Republican budget resolution are the President's new initiatives (such as educational empowerment zones; teacher technology training; the new transition to school program; community-based technology centers; and Safe and Drug-Free Schools coordinators). These programs total $2.4 billion.  When added to the $7.3 billion in mandatory spending for class size reduction, the total President's request level for new sub-function 501 funds is $9.7 billion over a freeze.  Because the Republicans assume $2.2 billion in consolidation, we need to ask another question: Which current programs will be cut under their $2.2 billion consolidation proposal?  This list could include any discretionary elementary and secondary education program, such as:  Title I Education for the Disadvantaged (including reading and math assistance for needy students; Even Start; Migrant Education; services for neglected and delinquent students; and others.)  America Reads Children's Literacy  Eisenhower Professional Development  Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities  Magnet Schools  Education for Homeless Children and Youth  Inexpensive Book Distribution  Bilingual Education  Goals 2000  Arts in Education  Women's Educational Equity  School-to-Work  Vocational Education  The American people will remember that last year, during debates on consolidation and block granting, proponents of block-granting federal education funds proclaimed that by eliminating bureaucracy under block-granting, school districts would actually have more money to spend, not less. Hold-harmless provisions were discussed, which would purportedly assure that school districts would not see funding cuts.  But we had all heard this kind of talk before, from those who start by ``consolidating,'' and then take the next step to ``downsizing.'' Too often a block-grant equals a cut, and our school communities know it.  We were told that the fundamental philosophical question was whether or not we believed that individual school districts and parents and teachers know best how to handle education in their own communities, or whether webelieved those fundamental decisions are best left to bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  I think the fundamental question is rather when certain people in positions of authority in Washington D.C. are going to listen to their state and local governments and the people. This is a time of incredible renewal in education. Republicans, Democrats and Independents in my state of Washington and other states are on a serious, measurable road to school improvement.  From school report cards, to higher standards, to increased family and community involvement--improvement is happening, accountability is present, and students and their parents are seeing results. At a minimum, there is a fundamental discussion about educational improvement going on in every community in my state. When federal consolidation is tied to questions of ``who knows best,'' I think those who do know best, the parents, teachers, students, and community leaders like those in my state have reason to feel betrayed.  Because money does matter. Yes, we need to consolidate services where it has an educational goal. Yes, the federal government works best when it creates red tape least--but Americans interested in improving education already have venues to make these changes. And these discussions--such as the one that will occur during the 1999 rewrite of federal elementary and secondary education programs--respect the knowledge and experience of those who actually learn with or work with federal education services.  But when the Congress ignores needed investments to improve school facilities and improve the quality of school personnel--then uses block-grants as cover for education cuts--local communities have reason to feel betrayed.  So, my hope is that those who want to improve the federal government's efforts to help students learn, and who see consolidation as a vehicle toward this end, will work with local school communities. My hope is that they will work with those of us who have experience in education. My hope is that we can work together to find results for students.  Because when the Congressional majority begins to pay attention to the appropriate federal role in school improvement, that is a positive step. Now that the discussion is joined, however, it must be productive, bipartisan, and aimed at efforts that will work.  When we look at this budget resolution, we also need to ask ``what do the assumptions in the President's budget request leave out?''  The President's budget request assumes less than sufficient funding (less than current-services funding, or complete terminations) for, among others:  Impact Aid (Construction and payments for Federal Property)  State Student Incentive Grant  Innovative Education Program Strategies  Ellender Fellowships  Literacy Programs for Prisoners  Urban Community Service  National Early Intervention Scholarships and Partnerships  State Grants for Incarcerated Youth Offenders  In addition, the President's budget includes only $35 million for funding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act over a freeze annually. My amendment would meet the $500 million increase per year in Sen. Domenici's Committee reported resolution ($465 million over the President's level). For too long, the Congress has not met its obligation to pay 40 percent of the costs of educating each special education student.  Education, especially public education, is near and dear to the American people. Although the challenges are great, there are productive discussions happening in public schools across the country. Local people are making decisions that are producing results for students. We know we need to expect more from our schools than folks did in the past. We know we have an economy and a society full of new demands. Regardless of political persuasion, ethnicity, income, age, or any other dividing line one might find--all Americans want students to succeed. And there is broad recognition that we should do more, not less. More to improve the quality of our schools. And more to make education a higher priority in the federal budget. I urge adoption of the Murray amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several letters regarding education funding be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               American Federation of Teachers                                                    April 1, 1998.       Dear Senator: On behalf of over 950,000 members of the      American Federation of Teachers (AFT), I urge you to oppose      the FY 1999 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, S. Con. Res.      86, unless changes are incorporated to rectify the following      shortfalls.       Although the budget resolution assumes a $2.5 billion      increase for IDEA over five years, a $500 million increase in      FY 1999, total discretionary spending in Function 500      reflects only a $600 million increase over FY 1998. This      level is $1.6 billion below the President's budget and $1      billion below the amount needed to maintain current program      levels in education, job training, and social services.       This budget resolution should include funding for the      President's initiatives in class size reduction and for      school construction. The President requested $1.1 billion to      recruit and train 100,000 new teachers over the next seven      years in order to reduce class size to an average of 18 in      grades 1-3, when children need the most help in learning to      read proficiently and mastering the basics. The AFT also      supports he President's proposal for more than $20 billion in      interest-free bonds for school construction. An estimated      one-third of all schools need extensive repairs and new      academic facilities are needed to serve the booming      enrollments in elementary and secondary schools. Instead, the      budget resolution assumes a $6.3 billion increase, $522      million in FY 1999, for Title VI Innovative Program      Strategies, an education block grant program, while assuming      an estimated $2.2 billion in savings from unspecified      consolidation of elementary and secondary education programs.       In addition, the AFT opposes savings assumed in      discretionary spending resulting from repealing Davis-Bacon      and the Service Contract Act beginning in the year 2000. The      AFT also opposes the citing of S. 1133, The ``Parent and      Student Savings Account Plus,'' as an illustration of tax      relief, which would expand the use of Education IRAs to      include private and religious school tuition for elementary      and secondary students.       For these reasons, I urge you to oppose S. Con. Res. 86      unless amendments are adopted to address these concerns.           Sincerely,                                                 Gerald D. Morris,     Director of Legislation.                                  ____                                                        NAPSEC                                                   March 25, 1998.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: On behalf of the National Association      of Private Schools for Exceptional Children (NAPSEC), an      association that represents over 900 private special      education schools for children with disabilities across the      nation both nationally and through its Council of Affiliated      State Associations, I urge you to oppose the FY 99 Budget      Resolution when it is considered by the Senate.       Although the resolution adds a billion dollars for special      education programs and Title VI innovative education      strategies programs, the resolution provides only $600      million more for all education and related programs. The      resolution would fund education programs at $1.1 billion      below current service levels. Programs like Head Start, Title      I, Pell Grants, and other education programs would have to be      cut or frozen to make up the difference.       This action appears totally inappropriate considering the      new challenges facing America's education system--rising      enrollments at all levels, more students with special needs,      growing teacher shortages, unsafe, overcrowding, and decaying      schools, just to name a few.       Recent polls ranked increasing federal funding for      education ahead of health care, reducing national debt, tax      cuts, crime, and defense. I urge you to represent this      priority by supporting a bipartisan budget resolution that      makes increased investments in education. I also ask you to      support the amendments that are offered that would increase      funding for education.       Thank you for considering our request.           Sincerely,                                                  Sherry L. Kolbe,     Executive Director & CEO.                                  ____                                                         NSBA,                                                   March 25, 1998.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: The National School Boards      Association, representing 95,000 school board members through      its federation of 53 states and territories, urges you to      make education your first priority and to oppose the FY 1999      Budget Resolution reported from the Senate Budget Committee      last week because of its inadequate levels of funding for      education.       The Senate Budget Committee's resolution is more than $1      billion below current services for discretionary spending in      Function 500,     which includes education and related programs and is $1.6      billion below the President's request. While recommending a      billion dollars more for special education and the Title VI      innovative education strategies programs, the FY 1999 Budget      Resolution provides only $600 million more for all education      and training programs. Programs like Title I, Impact Aid, and      charter schools would have to be cut or frozen to make up the      difference.       In contrast, the FY 1999 Budget Resolution allocates      increases for health and transportation over the next five      years that are $20 billion and $30 billion higher,      respectively, than the levels approved in last year's budget      agreement. This increase will put further pressure on funding      levels for education and other domestic programs.       Finally, the FY 1999 Budget Resolution also rejects      creating new revenue streams for education such as tax      incentives to encourage school construction and mandatory      spending for new initiatives proposed by President Clinton.       When looked at as a totality, the FY 1999 Budget Resolution      will result in cuts below the current level of services for      education at a time when America's educational system is      facing new challenges at the start of the 21st century.       Education is America's best investment. Education will      continue to fuel a growing economy that is able to compete in      world markets; provide the job-ready labor force that will      contribute to the stability of the Social Security system;      give all Americans the opportunity to achieve a higher      standard of living for themselves and their families; and      allow the United States to maintain its strong leadership      role in the world. Last year, Congress and the Administration      worked together to provides a substantial increase in the      investment in higher education. This year, several important      investments for elementary and secondary education have been      targeted, and it is vitally important for our nation's      schoolchildren that we make a commitment to fund them. Our      nation's schools face unprecedented challenges: exploding      enrollments; dramatic increases in students with special      needs; overcrowded, inadequate, and unsafe school buildings;      high demands for costly, new technology; and the commitment      to reach high standards for all students. To meet the current      challenges for elementary and secondary education, the      federal government needs to expand its financial commitment      to education funding, state and local funding cannot meet the      expanded demands and expectations for our schools.       We hope to work with you to ensure a significant federal      funding of the American public's top priority--education. We      hope the year will not begin with a debate about cutting the      federal investment in elementary and secondary education.       If you have any further questions about this issue, please      call Laurie A. Westley, assistant executive director, at 703-     838-6703.           Sincerely,                                                William B. Ingram,                                                        President.

Bryant,     Executive Director.                                  ____                               Committee for Education Funding                                                   March 23, 1998.     Re: Oppose FY99 Budget Resolution That Falls Short of          America's Education Investment Needs       Dear Senator, The Committee for Education Funding, a      nonpartisan coalition of over 90 education organizations      reflecting the broad spectrum of the education community,      urges you to oppose the FY99 Budget Resolution reported out      by the Senate Budget Committee on March 18, 1998 because of      its inadequate funding levels for education.       The Senate Budget Committee's Resolution is over $1 billion      below current services levels for discretionary spending in      Function 500, which includes education and related programs,      and is $1.6 billion below the President's request. While      recommending a billion dollars more for special education and      the Title VI innovative education strategies programs, the      resolution provides only $600 million more for all education      and related programs. Programs like Head Start, Title I, Pell      grants, or other education and related programs would have to      be cut or frozen to make up the difference.       In contrast, the resolution allocates increases for health      and transportation over the next five years that are $20      billion and $30 billion higher, respectively, than the levels      approved in last year's budget agreement. These increases,      while much needed, will put further pressure on funding      levels for other domestic programs like education.       The budget resolution also rejects creating critical new      revenue streams for education such as mandatory spending to      reduce class size and tax incentives to encourage school      construction as proposed in the President's budget.       Taken all together, this budget resolution is likely to      result in cuts below current service levels for education at      a time when America's educational system is facing new      challenges at the start of the 21st century. These include      rising enrollments at all levels; more students with special      needs; growing teacher shortages and professional development      needs; unsafe, overcrowded and outdated school facilities;      access to rapidly advancing educational technology; and      continuing access to postsecondary education for low income      students.       Recent polls ranked increased federal funding for education      ahead of health care, reducing national debt, tax cuts, crime      and defense (Greenberg-Guinlan and the Tarrance Group,      January 1998). We urge you to support a bipartisan budget      resolution that makes increased investment in education the      top budget priority to meet the growing needs of America's      students and secure America's future. We also urge you to      support amendments to the budget resolution that would      increase funding for education.           Sincerely,                                             Kenneth G. McInerney,                                                        President.                                                  Edward R. Kealy,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                 National PTA,                                                   March 16, 1998.     Hon. Patty Murray,     Committee on the Budget,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: The National PTA urges you to include      education as a top funding priority in the FY 1999 budget      resolution you are about to consider. There are thousands of      excellent public schools in this country, but too many others      lack the resources they need to provide a quality education      for all children. These schools face formidable challenges,      which include record-high student enrollments, an increase in      the number of children with disabilities, a growing need for      new and qualified teachers, extensive and expensive      technology needs, and school facilities in desperate need of      expansion and renovation. An increased federal financial      investment is needed to address these national concerns.       For the past two years, Congress has increased federal      funding for education, and National PTA supports this      leadership. National PTA now urges lawmakers to continue this      positive trend to assure that the benefits of this investment      are long-lasting. Even with the recent spending growth, none      of the major elementary and secondary education programs      designed to expand educational opportunity or improve      achievement is funded near the level needed to serve all who      are eligible.       As you develop the FY 1999 Senate Budget Resolution,      National PTA asks that you include an increase for      discretionary education and children's programs sufficient to      allow funding for new initiatives and increases in vital      existing programs like Title I, IDEA, and Impact Aid. We also      urge you to include in the budget an accommodation for new      sources of funding for education, such as an infrastructure      tax credit or mandatory education programs to reform schools      and increase student learning.       Now is an excellent time to strengthen the federal      investment in successful and cost-effective education      programs. The nation's economic health is robust. The      president's budget request is balanced and projects growing      surpluses for at least the next ten years. Many vital      interests will compete for discretionary funds this year, but      investing in education is one of the best ways to assure that      the national economy continues to prosper, and the stability      of the Social Security system is strengthened.       We look forward to working with Congress to secure much-     needed resources to improve the quality of public schools and      to invest now for America's future.           Sincerely,                                                      Shirley Igo,     Vice President for Legislation.                                  ____  Mr. President, I request the yeas and the nays.
