 President, on October 31, 1997 Washington state Governor Gary Locke declared the month of October ``Bernie Whitebear Month'' and proclaimed Bernie Whitebear as a ``Citizen of the Decade''. I would like to join the Governor, and the whole state of Washington in paying tribute to Bernie Whitebear for his outstanding contributions to the Seattle metropolitan community, the urban Native American community, the state of Washington, and in fact the entire Pacific Northwest.  For 30 years, Bernie Whitebear has been a voice and representative of the needs and concerns of the urban Indian community in Seattle and surrounding areas. His commitment to the preservation and edification of Native American culture within a diverse urban environment has never wavered. He established the Minority Executive Director's Coalition of King County, participates in the Northwest Asian American Theater's annual community Show-Off, and through his United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, acts as the Executive Director of the Daybreak Star Cultural and Education Center in Discovery Park, a center he established.  In recent years, Bernie has been tireless in his pursuit of his next vision: the People's Lodge. The People's Lodge is the next phase of development for the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation (United Indians) Indian Cultural Center (ICC) which includes the Daybreak Star Center. The United Indians is a well-established organization thanks to Bernie with over 20 years of service in Western Washington. The ICC mission, and Bernie's focus in life, is to improve the social, economic, and cultural well-being of Native Americans living in the metropolitan Seattle area. Bernie and United Indians run a variety of educational, community service, and cultural arts programs serving 4,000 clients and attracting 30,000 visitors a year. The People's Lodge will improve and expand United Indian's desire to preserve and enhance Indian heritage and educate people about Indian cultural diversity. The People's Lodge will include a permanent Hall of Ancestors exhibition, a multiple-use Potlatch House, and an exhibition gallery, the John Kauffman, Jr. Theater, a resource center, and the Sacred Circle of the American Indian Art.  The programs and activities envisioned by Bernie in the People's Lodge will be a great benefit to the greater Seattle community and the citizen's of Western Washington. The People's Lodge will create new jobs, serve as a new venue for sales and performances by artists of all kinds, and help preserve and advance the cultural heritage of Native Americans in this region. It has been my pleasure to work with Bernie in seeking federal support of this project. Bernie has been working diligently to secure an Economic Development Administration grant for the People's Lodge. I urge the EDA to give the grant proposal of United Indians for the People's Lodge their utmost consideration.  Bernie Whitebear is a true leader for Native Americans in Seattle and a genuine asset to our community in the greater Seattle area. I personally appreciate his efforts. It is always a pleasure to see Bernie's warm face and bright smile come into my office. Bernie truly is a Citizen of the Decade.                          ____________________
