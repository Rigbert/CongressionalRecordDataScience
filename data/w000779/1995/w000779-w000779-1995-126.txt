Speaker, the technology of drugs and medical devices has reached a new frontier. Through emerging sciences such as bioengineering we can anticipate truly monumental breakthroughs in the way we treat, and conquer, dread diseases which for centuries have plagued mankind.  It is crucial, absolutely critical, that the Federal regulatory system so integral to the development and commercialization of these new products change, improve, and advance in step with this technological revolution.  In support of this effort, I am today introducing H.R. 1742, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1995. This bill offers reasonable, progressive, and user-friendly approaches toward making the FDA drug and device approval process more efficient and cost effective.  Most importantly, it accomplishes these goals while preserving the Agency's critical mission to assure the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and medical devices.  It ensures that our multibillion-dollar medical products industry continues as the preeminent international competitor.  Here are the salient features of this legislation:  The bill grants the agency authority to grant early, conditional approvals for promising drugs and devices which appear to be effective in fighting serious or life-threatening disease. Full and final approval would rest upon the manufacturer's ability to demonstrate that the initial promise of effectiveness was proven out in broader use.  [[Page E1158]] The bill offers authority and strong encouragement to the Agency to use third parties--unbiased, independent panels under FDA supervision--to approve and oversee early stage trials of new drugs and devices.  The bill relaxes some restrictions now barring the exchange of scientifically valid material--professional journal articles, medical textbook excerpts, research compendia--between manufacturers, clinicians, and health insurers. This change will make it easier for knowledgeable observers to receive information on promising, though unapproved, new uses of drugs and devices which have already been approved by the FDA for at least a single use. At the same time, the legislation gives the Agency authority to require that persons disseminating these articles provide appropriate supportive scientific data and respond on its balance.  The bill fundamentally revamps and modernizes FDA review processes for biologics, therapeutics which are manufactured or propagated through bioengineering.  The bill offers reasonable relaxation on current restrictions on the export of drugs or devices which are not approved by the FDA, but which meet the importing nation's approval regime. This flexibility would be limited to exports to member nations of the World Trade Organization.  The bill modifies current reporting and approval requirements for minor manufacturing changes in devices of low to moderate risk. In essence, a manufacturer would be required to report, but not obtain prior approval for manufacturing changes which would improve the product's quality. This would allow manufacturers to make swift, useful, and perhaps even lifesaving changes in products without having to wait out an FDA approval decision.  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt in my mind that the FDA is a premier public health care agency with many extraordinarily dedicated employees. This Agency has a crucial health and safety mission that this Congress must not allow to be undermined.  But I firmly believe that these vital safety missions can be preserved, and better products can be brought to consumers more rapidly and at lower cost, through the modest reform proposals contained in this legislation.  It's time to make a good agency better. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1742, the FDA Modernization Act of 1995.                          ____________________
