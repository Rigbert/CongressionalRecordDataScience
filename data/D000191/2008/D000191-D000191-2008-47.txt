 So I would hope that, on a bipartisan basis, we can send a message to the Bush White House by passing this bill unanimously, or nearly unanimously, and say that the Congress cares about the safety of the traveling public. The Congress cares about the fact there's no meaningful commercial driver's license database in Mexico. We don't really know who these people are.  The Congress cares about the fact that there is no meaningful hours of service program in Mexico and that many of these drivers may be crossing the border fatigued to the point of endangering public safety.  The Congress cares about the fact that there is no certified drug testing laboratory in Mexico, no meaningful program of testing for drugs of truck drivers in Mexico.  The Congress cares about the potential for insurance fraud and other things as mentioned by our colleague from California (Mr. Filner).  And the Congress is determined that this administration, the administration of George W. Bush, this Republican administration, should stop violating the law and violating the law and jeopardizing the American public for their own ideological ends in their hope that they can pry this program open wide enough that a future Congress or a future administration won't be able to slam it shut again.
