Speaker, as we celebrate the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and reflect on his life and work, we are reminded of the challenges that democracy poses to us and the delicate nature of liberty. Dr. King's life, and, unfortunately, his untimely death, reminds us that we must continually work and, if necessary, fight to secure and protect our freedoms. Dr. King, in his courage to act, his willingness to meet challenges, and his ability to achieve, embodied all that is good and true in the battle for liberty.  The Gary Frontiers Service Club, founded in 1952, sponsors this annual memorial breakfast. This year the Gary Frontiers Service Club will pay tribute to four local individuals who have unselfishly contributed to improving the human condition of others in the City of Gary for decades. Those individuals, who will be named Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Marchers at this year's breakfast, include Dr. Clarence W. Boone, Sr. MD, Richard Comer, Dharathula (Dolly) Millender, and Sgt. Louis Stewart. Mr. Johnathan Comer will be honored with the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drum Major Award. Mr. Comer has dedicated his life to fighting for civil rights. These distinguished individuals from Indiana's First Congressional District will be recognized during the 26th Annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Breakfast on Monday, January 17, 2005, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana. The invited guest speaker will be The Honorable Mitch Daniels, Governor of the State of Indiana.  This year the Gary Frontiers Club also will honor Richard Grey, the Post Tribune's North Lake editor and columnist for his outstanding service to the Gary Frontiers Service Club, Inc. in publicizing the Martin Luther King Jr. Marchers and Drum Major Awards. Richard passed away on November 25, 2004 at the age of 53. Mrs. Audrey Grey will accept his award. Ms. Sydney Eastern, a senior at Wirt High School in Gary, Indiana will be honored for receiving first place among all participants in the State of Indiana in the 2005 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Essay Contest. Ms. Gloria Griffin is Sydney's teacher. Though very different in nature, the achievement of these individuals reflects many of the same attributes that Dr. King possessed, as well as the values he advocated. Like Dr. King, these individuals saw challenges and rose to the occasion. Each one of the honored guests' greatness has been found in their willingness to serve with ``a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love.'' They set goals and worked to achieve them.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Gary Frontiers Service Club President, Mr. Floyd Donaldson, Oliver Gilliam, Melvin Ward, Clorius L. Lay, and all other members of the service club for their initiative, determination and dedication to making Northwest Indiana a better place for all who live and work there.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E67]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 COMMENDING GARY FRONTIERS SERVICE CLUB                                 ______                                                         HON.
