Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with mixed feelings. On the one hand, I want to tell the House I am pleased that the House is moving forward on legislation we have been working on for many years only to see it thwarted, frankly, in the Senate by Republican politics. Yet today in a bipartisan fashion we are on the floor in what will hopefully be the final stages in this legislative drama.  However, the legislation before us today is new to the House. Although this bill has been the subject of extensive debate in the Senate, it has not had one hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives. The American public, I am told today in a 1-minute, voted for reform, voted to open up this institution, and voted for democratization in debate and extensive analysis of programs. There was not one hearing in the House of Representatives during the 104th Congress on this bill.  It was first brought up on this floor just 13 days ago in a different form under a completely closed rule. Today a new version is before us, with little if any opportunity for review and no chance for amendment. If this is the new wind blowing through the House of Representatives, then it is a wind that blows little good.  H.R. 1 was the first piece of legislation to move through the new House of Representatives. It did so under a process in which no Member could suggest changes. Today it is back, as I have said, in a new version. It is again brought to the floor of this House under a completely closed process.  This should be, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, a day of pride for this House. It should be a day of joy, but instead it is a day of sadness for a Congress that started out with such anticipation of a new day. Instead, on day 6 of the 104th Congress we can clearly declare power and muscle are the rule of order of this House, not the rule of democracy.  Having said that, having expressed the concern of this side of the aisle about the process, let me talk about the substance. S. 2, as I said, will finally bring into place a process which many of us fought for for a long time. It will provide protection and antidiscrimination laws to congressional employees and employees of other legislative-branch agencies. My good friend, the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Shays], a Republican, has been a leader in this effort with Mr. Swett, a Democrat from New Hampshire. Mr. Shays is to be commended for his tenacity, for his courage in the light of stiff opposition from time to time, and for his tireless efforts in bringing this bill before us today. He has performed a service for this House and for this country.  I believe that S. 2 is an improvement, very frankly, over the House bill. S. 2 spells out the rights, protections, remedies, and procedures provided to congressional employees. The bill establishes an independent nonpartisan Office of Compliance to develop the regulations applying the laws to Congress and to resolve complaints. It will be composed of a five-member board of directors whose board is selected on a bipartisan, bicameral basis similar to the old rules for the House administrative officer. Former Members of Congress and current staff are prohibited from serving on the board. No Member of the House or Senate nor any House or Senate employee can serve as hearing officer on a complaint.  Most importantly, any party aggrieved by a board decision can seek judicial review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and employees can bring suit directly in Federal district court after mediation and counseling if that is allowed under the applicable statute. This is an important new right for congressional employees, and I am pleased that we are finally moving forward on this effort.                              {time}  1150  This is an important new right for congressional employees. I am pleased that we are finally moving forward on this effort.  As I have said on the floor, Mr. Speaker, many times, of all the talk of reform, of all the speechifying, the one reform that my constituents, and I gainsay every representative's constituents, have always asked for, and the one reform that I have always thought was justified and real, this is it, covering Congress by the same laws we ask others to live under.  Congress should live under the laws it passes, and, my colleagues, in most cases, civil rights, the ADA, fair labor standards, family and medical leave, to name a few, it has, let me repeat that, this House has lived under those statutes. S. 2, however, improves congressional coverage and provides an outside remedy for employees, a critical addition to present protections.  This is a change whose time has not only come but is overdue. I am proud to be on the floor today with the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Shays] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas] and others, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling], Members on our side. I regret that Mr. Sweet is not here because he fought very hard. And through his leadership and that of the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Shays], this similar legislation passed the House, as I said earlier, and was killed in the Senate.  I would urge today my colleagues to support this legislation in spite of the heavy-handed procedural railroad on [[Page H269]] which this bill comes to the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
