 President, for two decades, Representative Marie Rader from Mckee was a powerful voice for her constituents in Kentucky's House of Representatives. It is my privilege today to pay tribute to a dedicated public servant and a dear friend who retired from her legislative career at the end of last year.  A graduate of Berea College in Madison County, Marie was a passionate advocate for the causes important to Kentuckians, and she spent her career helping guide the public policies of our State. As the chair of house transportation committee, she proved her leadership for Kentucky and was a strong supporter of our Commonwealth's infrastructure, Her work to encourage economic development provided a wonderful service to Marie's constituents and to families throughout our State.  Even after her retirement from the general assembly last year, Marie has continued to remain active in the Jackson County community. She serves as the executive director of the public housing authority and employs her many talents with the Jackson County Development Association and the Jackson County Industrial Authority. Earlier this year, she helped organize a Memorial Day event to honor the service and sacrifice of local Vietnam veterans. The community gathered to celebrate more than 100 brave Kentuckians, and Marie was crucial to making the event a success. Her selfless work for the residents of Jackson County and the Commonwealth continues to inspire others.  When the Kentucky State House came into session at the beginning of this year, its members recognized the absence of their former colleague with gratitude and respect. Representative Robert Goforth, Marie's successor, sponsored a resolution honoring her lasting impact in that body and throughout Kentucky. It is my privilege today to join with the members of the Kentucky State House in sharing those sentiments and wishing her a wonderful retirement. I urge each of my Senate colleagues to help me honor Marie Rader, a remarkable individual and my friend.                          ____________________
