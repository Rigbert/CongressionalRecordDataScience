Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1431 reauthorizes the Coastal Barrier Resources Act for five years and corrects mapping errors in three units of the System.  The Coastal Barrier Resources System prohibits Federal development assistance on undeveloped coastal barriers and it is a sound natural resource management policy. The Act does not prohibit private development on private lands. However, it requires the landowner, not the Federal Government, to shoulder the burden of cost and assume the risks when developing dynamic barrier islands.  Regrettably, the Federal Government has been known to make mistakes from time to time. This is the case with the System units that are addressed in H.R. 1431. Three otherwise protected areas--one in Florida, one in Delaware, and one in North Carolina--were mapped incorrectly when these units were created in 1990. At the time these otherwise protected areas were delineated, the Fish and Wildlife Service incorrectly included private lands that were not held for conservation purposes into the otherwise protected areas, in direct contradiction to the intent of the Act. This mistake effectively cut off Federal flood insurance for many existing homes. Similarly, the 1990 maps did not include all of the public lands that should have been included in the otherwise protected areas. H.R. 1431 makes changes to the maps to reflect the true boundaries of the underlying conservation areas, and it results in a net addition of more than 2,000 acres for the System.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which will correct mapping errors that have adversely affected several private landowners for nearly a decade.  H.R. 1431 is a good bill and I urge an aye vote.
