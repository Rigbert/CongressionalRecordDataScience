 I would, I guess, start at the dueling admirals' statements. The gentleman quoted Admiral Mullen from 2010. I would suggest that Admiral Locklear, who is commander of the Pacific Command, stated this year that the most destabilizing problem that we face in the Pacific Basin is climate change and the impact it has on the people and the national security in that part of the world.  I continue to emphasize that we need to keep our options open for the Department of Defense and, I would suggest, for this great Nation.  Indiana, the State in which I live--and have lived all of my life--is a coal State. More steel is produced in the district I represent than any State in the United States. I am very proud of that.  You need carbon to make steel. What we need is a matrix--not only carbon-based fuels, but other types of fuels, including renewables: wind, tidal, solar, hydro, and biofuels.  I would also reference Senator Lugar, who I continue to have a profound respect for. Senator Lugar suggested that energy is a problem economically in the United States. Senator Lugar suggested that it is an environmental problem in the United States.  He said, fundamentally, energy is, most importantly, a national security problem, which is why we ought not to limit the options for the Department of Defense to expand the use of biofuels.  For those reasons, I am opposed to the gentleman's amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
