Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being and prosperity of the County of Riverside, California, is exceptional. The County of Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Tom Mullen is one of these individuals. After two terms as Riverside County Supervisor, Tom is retiring this year. I know all of the citizens in our great County will miss Tom and wish him well as he moves to new endeavors.  Tom Mullen is a native of Hastings, Nebraska and has served his country honorably in the United States Air Force. Tom also served his community as a law enforcement officer and as an aid to State Senator Bob Pressley. Mullen was first elected to the Fifth District Supervisor seat for Riverside, California in 1994. As a county supervisor, he has been responsible for a population greater than 12 states and a multi-billion dollar budget that would rank among Forbes Magazine's Fortune 500 companies. Mullen has also been the leader for an ambitious planning initiative, the Riverside County Integrated Project, a three-pronged plan to simultaneously address transportation, habitat conservation and housing demands brought on by rapid population growth in Riverside County. The plan has been praised as a national model for other states and communities to emulate.  Under Tom Mullen's excellent leadership Riverside County has achieved impressive results. The economy has grown significantly and during his tenure more than 350,000 jobs have been generated. Mullen's aggressive hiring of new Sheriff Deputies and prosecutors has produced a 50-percent decrease in crime since 1994.  In recognition of Tom's exemplary work as a Riverside County Supervisor, Tom has been awarded the Riverside Community College Alumnus of the Year 2000; Management Leader of the Year 1998 by the A. Gary Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Riverside; and the Good Government Award from the Riverside County Chapter of the Building Industry Association.  Tom is a devoted husband to wife, Kathy, and proud father and grandfather.  Tom's tireless work as the Riverside County Supervisor has contributed unmeasurably to the well-being and betterment of Riverside County. His outstanding involvement in the community makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend.                          ____________________
