President, as part of a bipartisan action this morning, Democrats and Republicans agree to send a reconciliation bill back to the House of Representatives for further consideration. Even though the vast majority of this bill hurts working families and the most vulnerable among them, there were a handful of important proposals that we support in that bill that need to be enacted immediately. That is why I am going to be asking unanimous consent in just a moment for the Senate to pass the Health and Welfare Relief Act of Senator Stabenow of Michigan.  This bill prevents the scheduled reduction in Medicare physician payments while holding Part B premiums harmless for beneficiaries. The bill extends TANF and transitional medical assistance, TMA, for an additional year. Finally, the bill provides temporary Medicaid relief to Katrina victims.  We should all be able to agree, even if there are parts of the bill subject to a point of order, parts that will be debated, there are many provisions in that bill that meet pressing needs that are important and need to be addressed on a timely basis. Many of them are taken directly from the conference report my friends across the aisle have just supported. I hope we can take up this bill and pass it today.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2164, the Health and Welfare Relief Act of 2005, introduced earlier by Senators Stabenow, Reid, Baucus, and others; that the bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table without any intervening action or debate.
