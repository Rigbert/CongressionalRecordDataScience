Where is the investigation now?                              {time}  2045  You read a little bit about what the FBI is doing; you read a little bit about what FDIC is doing. We need a massive investigation of which institutions led us into this subprime crisis that the country is facing. Who was the first one? I've asked everybody, who was the first one? Give me the first three or four. And through which institutions did they broker those loans and how did they get to Wall Street? Nobody knows. Nobody knows; or else they're not saying.  Where was the Office of Thrift Supervision? What happened to HUD's appraisal and underwriting standards? Assuming many of these loans were moved to market through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, why did their regulatory standards and HUD's oversight fall short? Why did HUD change its appraisal and underwriting practices in 1993 and 1994?  How were the boards and executives in these entities compensated during those years when the risky practices proliferated? Because it isn't just these fellows, it's the people in the regulatory agencies and the government secondary market enterprises that were involved. Which board members at which financial institutions and brokerages, regulators and secondary market bodies voted to allow these risky and predatory policies that escalated this equity drawdown? Do we have evidence that any of those board members personally benefited from their board decisions?  Through which domestic and international institutions were the original securitizations first moved? Which persons did it? Which regulatory agencies sanctioned the process? What role did the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and the Office of Thrift Supervision play--the Securities and Exchange Commission, how about the Federal Reserve--in allowing these practices to flourish?  I say to the chairwoman, I know the great work that you have done. There should be many committees in this institution involved in unraveling what has happened before we're asked to do a trillion dollar bailout here in the Congress of the United States.  You know, it's sort of interesting to me that even the New York Times editorialized that we've got to do this right now; you Congress, you pass a trillion dollars more--or who knows how much--because these institutions are too big to fail. And therefore, we can't do due diligence; we can't make good decisions for the American people. I can't even tell my constituents today--I hope I can find out by Thursday or Friday or Saturday this week--what exactly is in the bill that is beingwritten somewhere here so that I can see exactly how much money has to be appropriated and how big the drawdown will be from the Federal Reserve. Right now we don't know. There isn't a final bill that is available to the Members. I know it's being worked on somewhere in this place. I hope that there is a regular markup session by the respective committees that have to be involved here and an open rules process.
