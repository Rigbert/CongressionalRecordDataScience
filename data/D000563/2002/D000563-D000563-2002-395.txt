BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois. I have been waiting since about 3:45 because there were a number of points that were raised by my good friend from Massachusetts. He was kind enough to pay attention to some analogies I drew. It is probably going to take me 10 to 15 minutes to correct the Record. But I am very sympathetic to the needs of my other colleagues who wish to speak, and I do need to straighten that out. With the Chair's permission, I will go ahead and reclaim my time and begin by making, first, a request.
