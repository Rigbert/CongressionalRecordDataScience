President, I want to celebrate the success of a Vermont entrepreneur and small business owner, Steve Gagner, of 14th Star Brewery. Started in 2012, 14th Star Brewery began in a hand-built brew house in St. Albans, VT, with beer brewed in repurposed maple sap collection tanks. Under the leadership of the team he has assembled, the company has grown immensely since then, increasing their staff to 24 and moving to a new location where they are expected to produce over 8,000 barrels of craft beer by year-end. 14th Star has become widely popular throughout Vermont and distributes to six nearby States.  The creation of this Vermont brewery, however, began on the battlefields of Afghanistan. The founders of 14th Star, Steve Gagner and Matt Kehaya, served in Afghanistan with the Vermont Army National Guard. During their deployment, they drafted the business plan for their dream company on the back of a notebook. Even as the business has grown dramatically, Steve continues to serve in the Vermont Army National Guard and has been named commanding officer of the Army Mountain Warfare School in Jericho, VT. Steve was deployed for two combat tours and is a two-time Bronze Star recipient. He also teaches the next generation of leaders as an assistant professor at Norwich University.  Named after Vermont's status as the 14th State to join the Union, Steve has ensured that 14th Star Brewery maintains a close tie to service of our fellow Vermonters. Taking its values from Steve and his close-knit leadership team, the brewery directs a portion of its proceeds towards supporting Purple Hearts Reunited, an organization founded by fellow Vermont Guardsman Zach Fike to return lost or stolen military medals to veterans and their families. Each June, which is PTSD awareness month, 14th Star releases a special brew, 11Bravo, and hosts an annual event to support the Josh Pallotta fund for addressing veteran suicides, in memory of his fellow Vermont Guardsman.  Steve and 14th Star are proud and devoted members of the St. Albans and Franklin County community, serving every way possible, such as raising enough funds to ensure eggs and milk were supplied to a local kitchen for an entire year. 14th Star's tireless efforts to give back to their community and the State shows how far a small business's impact can go.  Marcelle and I have enjoyed getting to know Steve and his wife Nicole over the years. During the Vermont Brewers Festival in 2015, Steve kindly gave me a tour of the festival and introduced me to many amazing brewers within our State. Marcelle and I have also had the pleasure of visiting 14th Star Brewery, where we were impressed not only by the creativity and quality of the beer but also the sense of community they have fostered by creating a welcoming gathering space in St. Albans. His sister and business partner, Andrea Gagner, who is the CEO of 14th Star, has also joined us in DC to participate in the annual Taste of Vermont on Capitol Hill for 2 years, and Marcelle and I have enjoyed spending time with her at the event.  I was proud to hear that Steve was chosen as the Vermont Small Business Person of the Year earlier this year. I have seen firsthand the dedication Steve has not only to his community in St. Albans but also to the veteran's community. He has an outstanding work ethic and I applaud him for all the selfless work to give back to his community. I believe Steve truly exemplifies what it means to be a small business owner in Vermont and he is very deserving of this high recognition.                          ____________________
