Res. 106       Whereas the Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out      by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, resulting in the      deportation of nearly 2,000,000 Armenians, of whom 1,500,000      men, women, and children were killed, 500,000 survivors were      expelled from their homes, and which succeeded in the      elimination of more than 2,500-year presence of Armenians in      their historic homeland;       Whereas, on May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers issued the      joint statement of England, France, and Russia that      explicitly charged, for the first time ever, another      government of committing ``a crime against humanity'';       Whereas that joint statement stated ``the Allied      Governments announce publicly to the Sublime Porte that they      will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members      of the Ottoman Government, as well as those of their agents      who are implicated in such massacres'';       Whereas the post-World War I Turkish Government indicted      the top leaders involved in the ``organization and      execution'' of the Armenian Genocide and in the ``massacre      and destruction of the Armenians'';       Whereas in a series of courts-martial, officials of the      Young Turk Regime were tried and convicted on charges of      organizing and executing massacres against the Armenian      people;       Whereas the officials who were the chief organizers of the      Armenian Genocide, Minister of War Enver, Minister of the      Interior Talaat, and Minister of the Navy Jemal, were tried      by military tribunals, found guilty, and condemned to death      for their crimes, but the punishments imposed by the      tribunals were not enforced;       Whereas the Armenian Genocide and the failure to carry out      the death sentence against Enver, Talaat, and Jemal are      documented with overwhelming evidence in the national      archives of Austria, France, Germany, Russia, the United      Kingdom, the United States, the Vatican, and many other      countries, and this vast body of evidence attests to the same      facts, the same events, and the same consequences;       Whereas the National Archives and Records Administration of      the United States holds extensive and thorough documentation      on the Armenian Genocide, especially in its holdings for the      Department of State under Record Group 59, files 867.00 and      867.40, which are open and widely available to the public and      interested institutions;       Whereas the Honorable Henry Morgenthau, United States      Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to 1916, organized      and led protests by officials of many countries, among them      the allies of the Ottoman Empire, against the Armenian      Genocide;       Whereas Ambassador Morgenthau explicitly described to the      Department of State the policy of the Government of the      Ottoman Empire as ``a campaign of race extermination'', and      was instructed on July 16, 1915, by Secretary of State Robert      Lansing that the ``Department approves your procedure . . .      to stop Armenian persecution'';       Whereas Senate Concurrent Resolution 12, 64th Congress,      agreed to July 18, 1916, resolved that ``the President of the      United States be respectfully asked to designate a day on      which the citizens of this country may give expression to      their sympathy by contributing funds now being raised for the      relief of the Armenians,'' who, at that time, were enduring      ``starvation, disease, and untold suffering'';       Whereas President Woodrow Wilson agreed with such      Concurrent Resolution and encouraged the formation of the      organization     known as Near East Relief, which was incorporated by the Act      of August 6, 1919, 66th Congress (41 Stat. 273, chapter 32);       Whereas, from 1915 through 1930, Near East Relief      contributed approximately $116,000,000 to aid survivors of      the Armenian Genocide, including aid to approximately 132,000      Armenian orphans;       Whereas Senate Resolution 359, 66th Congress, agreed to May      11, 1920, stated in part that ``the testimony adduced at the      hearings conducted by the subcommittee of the Senate      Committee on Foreign Relations have clearly established the      truth of the reported massacres and other atrocities from      which the Armenian people have suffered'';       Whereas such Senate Resolution followed the report to the      Senate of the American Military Mission to Armenia, which was      led by General James Harbord, dated April 13, 1920, that      stated ``[m]utilation, violation, torture, and death have      left their haunting memories in a hundred beautiful Armenian      valleys, and the traveler in that region is seldom free from      the evidence of this most colossal crime of all the ages'';       Whereas, as displayed in the United States Holocaust      Memorial Museum, Adolf Hitler, on ordering his military      commanders to attack Poland without provocation in 1939,      dismissed objections by saying ``[w]ho, after all, speaks      today of the annihilation of the Armenians?'' and thus set      the stage for the Holocaust;       Whereas Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term ``genocide'' in      1944, and who was the earliest proponent of the Convention on      the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, invoked the      Armenian case as a definitive example of genocide in the 20th      century;       Whereas the first resolution on genocide adopted by the      United Nations, United Nations General Assembly Resolution      96(1), dated December 11, 1946, (which was adopted at the      urging of Raphael Lemkin), and the Convention on the      Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, done at Paris December      9, 1948, recognized the Armenian Genocide as the type of      crime the United Nations intended to prevent and punish by      codifying existing standards;       Whereas, in 1948, the United Nations War Crimes Commission      invoked the Armenian Genocide as ``precisely . . . one of the      types of acts which the modern term `crimes against humanity'      is intended to cover'' and as a precedent for the Nuremberg      tribunals;       Whereas the Commission stated that ``[t]he provisions of      Article 230 of the Peace Treaty of Sevres were obviously      intended to cover, in conformity with the Allied note of 1915      . . . offenses which had been committed on Turkish territory      against persons of Turkish citizenship, though of Armenian or      Greek race. This article constitutes therefore a precedent      for Article 6c and 5c of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters,      and offers an example of one of the categories of `crimes      against humanity' as understood by these enactments'';       Whereas House Joint Resolution 148, 94th Congress, adopted      by the House of Representatives on April 8, 1975, resolved      that ``April 24, 1975, is hereby designated as `National Day      of Remembrance of Man's Inhumanity to Man', and the President      of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a      proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to      observe such day as a day of remembrance for all the victims      of genocide, especially those of Armenian ancestry'';       Whereas Proclamation 4838 of April 22, 1981 (95 Stat. 1813)      issued by President Ronald Reagan, stated, in part, that      ``[l]ike the genocide of the Armenians before it, and the      genocide of the Cambodians which followed it--and like too      many other persecutions of too many other people--the lessons      of the Holocaust must never be forgotten'';       Whereas House Joint Resolution 247, 98th Congress, adopted      by the House of Representatives on September 10, 1984,      resolved that ``April 24, 1985, is hereby designated as      `National Day of Remembrance of Man's Inhumanity to Man', and      the President of the United States is authorized and      requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of      the United States to observe such day as a day of remembrance      for all the victims of genocide, especially the one and one-     half million people of Armenian ancestry'';       Whereas, in August 1985, after extensive study and      deliberation, the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention      of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities voted 14 to 1      to accept a report entitled ``Study of the Question of the      Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide'', which      stated ``[t]he Nazi aberration has unfortunately not been the      only case of genocide in the 20th century. Among other      examples which can be cited as qualifying are . . . the      Ottoman massacre of Armenians in 1915-1916'';       Whereas such report also explained that ``[a]t least      1,000,000, and possibly well over half of the Armenian      population, are reliably estimated to have been killed or      death marched by independent authorities and eye-witnesses      and this is corroborated by reports in United States, German,      and British archives and of contemporary diplomats in the      Ottoman Empire, including those of its ally Germany'';       Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, an      independent Federal agency that serves as the board of      trustees of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum      pursuant to section 2302 of title 36, United States Code,      unanimously resolved on April 30, 1981, that the Museum would      exhibit information regarding the Armenian Genocide and the      Museum has since done so;       Whereas, reviewing an aberrant 1982 expression by the      Department of State (which was later retracted) that asserted      that the facts of the Armenian Genocide may be ambiguous, the      United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia      in 1993, after a review of documents pertaining to the policy      record of the United States, noted that the assertion on      ambiguity in the United States record about the Armenian      Genocide ``contradicted longstanding United States policy and      was eventually retracted'';       Whereas, on June 5, 1996, the House of Representatives      adopted an amendment to H.R. 3540, 104th Congress (the      Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs      Appropriations Act, 1997), to reduce aid to Turkey by      $3,000,000 (an estimate of its payment of lobbying fees in      the United States) until the Government of Turkey      acknowledged the Armenian Genocide and took steps to honor      the memory of its victims;       Whereas President William Jefferson Clinton, on April 24,      1998, stated, ``This year, as in the past, we join with      Armenian-Americans throughout the nation in commemorating one      of the saddest chapters in the history of this century, the      deportations and massacres of a million and a half Armenians      in the Ottoman Empire in the years 1915-1923'';       Whereas President George W. Bush, on April 24, 2004,      stated, ``On this day, we pause in remembrance of one of the      most horrible tragedies of the 20th century, the annihilation      of as many as 1,500,000 Armenians through forced exile and      murder at the end of the Ottoman Empire''; and       Whereas, despite the international recognition and      affirmation of the Armenian Genocide, the failure of the      domestic and international authorities to punish those      responsible for the Armenian Genocide is a reason why similar      genocides have recurred and may recur in the future, and that      a just resolution will help prevent future genocides: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) calls on the President to ensure that the foreign      policy of the United States reflects appropriate      understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to      human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in      the United States record relating to the Armenian Genocide      and the consequences of the failure to realize a just      resolution; and       (2) calls on the President, in the President's annual      message commemorating the Armenian Genocide issued on or      about April 24 to accurately characterize the systematic and      deliberate annihilation of 1,500,000 Armenians as genocide      and to recall the proud history of United States intervention      in opposition to the Armenian Genocide.
