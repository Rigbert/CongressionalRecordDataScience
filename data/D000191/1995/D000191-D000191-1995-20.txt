I think that the serious money in the Department of Energy, if you look at the Department of Energy budget, it is not any more dedicated to energy independence and conservation of resources in this country. It is dedicated only to nuclear weapons production against a lot of enemies that no longer exist. These three labs get the lion's share of the money.  Things that would make America truly competitive in the next century, like solar energy research, research conservation, we are gutting and doing away with. During the Reagan years,  we sold all of our solar energy division here in Washington, DC. We privatized it. You know who bought it? Seimens, the Germans. Now what? They are the world's leader in solar energy technology. The United States is far, far behind.  So we are going to unilaterally disarm, that is, give up any research that makes America more competitive in the international energy markets, international energy wars, but we are going to keep on building hydrogen bombs that we do not need when we have already got 10,000 of them. So the gentleman here, it looks good on the surface, but I wish the gentleman would do away with the obsolete nuclear weapons laboratories, ones that are building hydrogen bombs, and save the real money as opposed to picking on the things that have a real product, research for the civilian sector, research that makes this country more competitive in the international marketplace. It is an ill-intentioned amendment from that direction since it does not go after the big bucks.
