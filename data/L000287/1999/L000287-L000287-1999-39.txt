Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, most of my friends know that I had the privilege of spending a decade of my life in Sacramento while serving as a member of the State legislature between 1968 and 1978. During that time, Sacramento virtually became, for Arlene and myself, our second home.  The moment I heard of this horrid act, I could not help but immediately call my brother-in-law, who is a part of the Jewish community in Sacramento, Bill Brodovsky, and share our own concern about this expression of violence in our society.  It is very, very clear that the fringe elements who are involved in this kind of vicious act are a very small number in our society. They reflect those people who are motivated by fear. We cannot allow the worst in our society to dominate any piece of our society.  So I want to express my deep appreciation to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ose) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Matsui) for the effort they put together here in a bipartisan, nonpartisan sense to make sure that the Congress' voice, this Hall of Freedom's voice, is heard clearly.  Beyond that, Mr. Speaker, the reaction in Sacramento is so impressive. The best of the community has come forth, of all faiths. People of all backgrounds who believe in that community are coming together in a level of unity we have not seen for years. It is a reflection of the best of America, a credit to Sacramento, and indeed, it is a credit to those who represent Sacramento here in the House.
