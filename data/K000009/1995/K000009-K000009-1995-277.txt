One of the most advanced industries in our country is the airline industry. Every day we see newspaper articles in papers across this country about the fate of USAir. That is one of our major carriers, which serves my hometown and has served different parts of the Northeast.  There has been no surge as far as I have noted from those same three gentlemen mentioned by the gentleman from Vermont, who appeared before the Committee on Banking to try to help USAir work out of its situation or its handsome losses over the past several years, to keep thousands and thousands of people on their jobs.  I have no seen any phone calls or comments made by anybody over at Treasury. In fact, it is interesting if you look at the Chrysler situation several years ago before I got to the Congress, Alan Greenspan at that time was opposed to any Federal involvement in the Chrysler bailout.  Whether you agreed with the Chrysler bailout or you did not agree with the Chrysler bailout, they paid their money back with interest, as Lee Iacocca will remind us no matter where you meet him anywhere in the country; he was opposed. Yet he is for this, one of the chief sponsors of this effort to try to find a way, back doorway now of getting our taxpayers and our banking system to bail out Mexico. Yet when one of our own companies has been in trouble, now USAir needing a little bit of help, I have not seen the Secretary of the Treasury on the telephone or the Chairman of the Federal Reserve with the head of USAir.  So I would agree with the gentleman.  While I have the floor for a moment I just want to commend the gentleman from California [Mr. Hunter] who has also been on this floor so many evenings trying to give some incredible speeches that reached far beyond the Beltway into the hearts and minds of the American people, trying to show the people a new road, not a road that closes off America but a road that is fair to American workers and builds democracy abroad.  That is what we should be about here. For those of us who have fought this long fight it is a great fight to be in because we know we are right. The American people are now listening. They know something is up.  I thank the gentleman from Oregon for having this special order this evening.  Mr. DeFAZIO. The interesting problem is that we have been somewhat successful. I think when we first started to speak out against the Mexican bailout it was pretty lonely. The Republican Speaker and the Republican majority leader in the Senate went down to the White House to meet with the President, Alan Greenspan, Secretary of the Treasury, Democrat President. We had a bipartisan agreement that it was in the national security interest of the United States to bail out Mexico and rush something through the Congress. But then a few of us started standing up and asking embarrassing questions about why this was necessary, why the haste, what was the collateral, what exactly was the national security interest. These are questions of cost that have never been answered, and in fact that is why they will not try to have to move that legislation through the House. They do not want answers to those questions, the list that the gentlewoman from Ohio provided about exactly who holds these securities that are at risk. They are trying to come in and tell us it is pension funds.                              {time}  2100  Well, we made some calls in my district, and I know other people have, and we have yet to find anybody managing a pension fund that will admit that they were speculating in junk bonds in Mexico, bonds that paid between 20 and 50 percent interest.  Now I do not think there are very many prudent pension managers around the Nation who are engaged in such speculation, but apparently Goldman Sachs was into Mexico very big time, $5.2 billion over 4 years, and who knows how many of their clients were at risk here, as opposed to Goldman Sachs itself as a firm, and how much liability they might have for having provided poor advice to their clients talking about the emerging markets of Mexico, but in our success it appears we are about to be short-circuited.  Where we could not get $40 billion out the front door, it appears that the President is going to attempt to take $40 billion out the back door, still working hand in glove with the Federal Reserve with secret amounts of money under terms not to be disclosed to the people's Representatives in the Congress, working through the International Stabilization Bank. How much of the money being channeled through the International Stabilization Bank is flowing out of our Federal Reserve, working through the International Monetary Fund? How much of the money coming through the International Monetary Fund is money being channeled by the Federal Reserve of the United States of America? I have not heard the outcry in Europe that we must stabilize Mexico in order to stabilize the world economy. I have not heard those cries, but we certainly heard the cries coming from the people running Goldman Sachs in Wall Street.  So, now it turns out that the President, even though he came to the Congress in a bipartisan way to propose this bailout, has decided, well, actually he did not need the authority anyway, that there is another way to structure [[Page H965]] this bailout using section 5302 or chapter 31, section 5302, of the U.S. Code stabilizing exchange rates and arrangements.  The gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] is on the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, and I know the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur] is more versed than me, but the way I read this, Mr. Speaker, it allows us to engage in short-term swaps or exchanges of funds to defend the U.S. dollar, not 10-year loans to bail out a failing government in a collapsing economy.  I ask, ``Would you want to address that for a moment?''
