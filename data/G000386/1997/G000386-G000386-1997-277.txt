 President, to begin with, Mr. Freeh, in his letter to the IG--just as Mr. Kennedy did with me--believes that he can interpret the IG's report better than the IG can. He is saying to the IG, in effect, ``I don't care what you meant to say about Dr. Whitehurst. I care about what you said.'' He then plays a game of semantics and interprets the IG report as he wishes, not as the IG intended.  Then, elsewhere in the letters, Mr. Freeh takes a few pot shots at Dr. Whitehurst and at the IG. I understand why he would take pot shots at the IG. After all, the IG did an independent investigation of the crime lab. He apparently, according to news accounts, found credibility in many of Dr. Whitehurst's allegations. And that contradicts the FBI's own findings, which were nothing more than a whitewash of the exact same allegations. And the whitewash was done under this current director, Director Freeh. And Director Freeh personally signed off on the review. So, yes, I understand what would motivate the FBI Director to go after the IG.  But it is less clear why Mr. Freeh, before a subcommittee of Congress and later under his own signature, would go after Dr. Whitehurst. Why would theFBI Director involve himself, by misleading the public and the subcommittee, in an attack on Dr. Whitehurst? After all, Mr. Freeh recused himself from matters dealing with Dr. Whitehurst. Last week, I released the document showing the recusal.  What kind of recusal is this? Is this part of a Kafka novel? Now, everyone in the entire Justice Department, including the FBI, knows how the FBI Director feels about Dr. Whitehurst. When decision-time comes to fire or retain Dr. Whitehurst, everyone has the message, directly from the FBI Director, regarding what he thinks about Dr. Whitehurst.  Finally, Mr. President, since I am on the subject of misleading. On March 5, the same day Mr. Freeh misled the Nation and the subcommittee on the IG report, he misled the public in another way. He announced in a press release the enhancement of a more independent Office of Professional Responsibility, or OPR. The new head of OPR would report directly to Mr. Freeh and his deputy.  But how can it be independent? It reports directly to Mr. Freeh and his deputy. Am I again reading one of Kafka's novels? Think of how reassuring the new, independent OPR is for Dr. Whitehurst, given what the Director said about him this past week.  The one truism that I have uncovered in all this, Mr. President, is this: The FBI has shown, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it cannot police itself. This institution--the U.S. Congress--has bent over backward over the years to give the FBI what it says it needs. We have done it in good faith. We have done it without performing the necessary oversight. We put too much trust in the FBI. The FBI has squandered our trust.  In the coming weeks and months, I will attempt to show that, at the expense of fighting crime effectively, the FBI has engaged in a colossal campaign to build its empire. They have done it right under the noses of our oversight committees, the Judiciary Committees--of which I have been a member since I came to the Senate.  What the FBI needs is a good dose of oversight. They need to be reined in. There needs to be more independent oversight of their management. There needs to be more accountability of their budget, which has grown too large too quickly.  The FBI's leadership has come under fire because of its response to problems that have surfaced. It has chosen to mislead rather than acknowledge. That tells me, the Bureau is more worried about its image than its product.  Until the FBI acknowledges it cannot police itself, and works with Congress to establish more and better oversight, the FBI's leaders will keep taking heavy criticism from Capitol Hill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a letter from Dr. Whitehurst's attorneys to Director Freeh, dated today, taking the Director to task for his testimony and correspondence. I believe this letter will provide the necessary context for the public to judge whether Mr. Freeh's pot shots were fair.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, P.C.,                                             Attorneys at Law,                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 1997.     Hon. Louis J. Freeh,     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of          Justice, Washington, DC.       Dear Director Freeh: We have read with great interest your      letters dated March 11, 1997 sent to Mr. Michael R. Bromwich,      the Inspector General (``IG'') of the U.S. Department of      Justice (``DOJ'') and the Honorable Harold Rogers, Chairman,      U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Commerce,      Justice, State, and Judiciary of the Committee on      Appropriations, respectively. These two letters directly      concern our client, Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, Supervisory      Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation (``FBI''), and      relate to testimony you provided to the Subcommittee on March      5, 1997.       As a threshold matter, we understood that you had recused      yourself from involvement with any administrative action      concerning Dr. Whitehurst's employment with the FBI or his      whistleblower allegations that have been investigated as part      of the DOJ IG ``Whitehurst Review.'' Nonetheless, by      publishing your opinions concerning Dr. Whitehurst to a wide      national audience, by providing testimony about his      employment status and by requesting an executive session with      a committee of the U.S. Congress to discuss matters related      to Dr. Whitehurst, you clearly have not recused yourself from      these matters. Furthermore, we were informed by a member of      the news media prior to your testimony that you intended to      answer questions concerning the actions the FBI took      regarding Dr. Whitehurst. Thus, your comments about Dr.      Whitehurst do not appear to have been spontaneous or      accidental.       By widely publishing your very negative opinions about Dr.      Whitehurst you have called into question the effectiveness of      any purported ``recusal'' in matters related to the FBI crime      lab or Dr. Whitehurst's employment.       In your letter to Mr. Bromwich you have deliberately      distorted and published selected ``draft'' findings of the      Inspector General in a manner clearly intended to discredit      Dr. Whitehurst. You have alleged that the IG has concluded      that ``the majority of Mr. Whitehurst's allegations are      unfounded and that he is often unable to distinguished      fact from conjecture.''       We highly doubt that the IG reached such conclusions or      whether such conclusions will be contained in any final      report issued by that office. Our review of more than 10,000      pages of documents released by the FBI pursuant to a court      order and other publicly available materials related to the      IG report, demonstrate that the vast majority of Dr.      Whitehurst's major allegations have been fully substantiated.      These include, but are not limited to, the allegation about      misconduct in the Judge Hastings matter, major problems in      the handling of evidence in the Oklahoma City Bombing matter,      major problems in the FBI lab work and testimony in the World      Trade Center Bombing matter, confirmation that Dr.      Whitehurst's reports have been illegally altered and that      illegally altered lab documents have been used as evidence in      courts of law, confirmation that in a case you prosecuted the      FBI Crime Lab did not follow proper protocols or properly      evaluate the evidence, the withholding of exculpatory      evidence in the case of the bombing of an airliner,      confirmation that the contamination of the FBI Lab with the      explosive residue PETN was not properly addressed,      confirmation that your subordinates took adverse action      against Dr. Whitehurst based on his lawful testimony in the      World Trade Center case and his lawful actions of filing      allegations of misconduct with the Department of Justice and      confirmation that you were fully aware that the FBI crime lab      could not meet the minimum standards of accreditation one      year before the Oklahoma City Bombing tragedy occurred.       In regard to your statement that Dr. Whitehurst could not      ``distinguish fact from conjecture,'' the fact that many of      his most important allegations have been fully validated      belies this point.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ As I am sure you are aware, Mr. James Maddock, FBI Deputy      General Counsel, and the individual appointed to serve as the      FBI's ``point man'' concerning matters related to Dr.      Whitehurst, personally informed us on several occasions in      late 1996 that the FBI knew the IG had validated many of Dr.      Whitehurst's allegations and that the FBI either had or would      take corrective action. Mr. Maddock's statements are at odds      with your characterization of the IG's findings.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       We are very distressed at your apparent ignorance of the      controlling FBI regulations and Executive Orders which govern      Dr. Whitehurst's whistleblowing activities. As you should be      well aware, in order to encourage employee whistleblowing,      these regulations actually provide for and require the      reporting of ``conjecture.''       We had assumed you were fully aware of Executive Order      12731 signed by President George Bush on October 17, 1990.      This Executive Order, along with the published      ``supplementary Information'' interpreting this Order, were      directly provided to every employee of the U.S. Department of      Justice, including Dr. Frederic Whitehurst. In being provided      a copy of this packet of information Dr. Whitehurst was      informed that ``These standards apply to all Department of      Justice employees. Please read and retain them for future      reference.'' Exhibit 1, U.S. Department of Justice, ``This      Package Contains Important Ethics Materials, The Executive      Order On Conduct and the Standards of Conduct'' (undated),      attached hereto. As a loyal and dedicated public servant and      federal law enforcement officer, Dr. Whitehurst read this      packet of information. The Executive Order contained in the      packet states as follows: ``Employees shall disclose waste,      fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities.''      Ex. 1, quoting from Executive Order 12731, Part I Section      101(k) (emphasis added).       As you can see, under this Executive Order, Dr. Whitehurst      was under a mandatory duty to report certain allegations to      the ``appropriate authorities.'' Pursuant to this obligation      he in fact informed you and others within the FBI of very      serious problems in the FBI crime lab. After the FBI failed      to take action on these allegations Dr. Whitehurst fully      informed the Inspector General of these allegations.       In regard to your purported concern over ``conjecture,''      the DOJ packet also contained the explanatory notes      concerning Executive Order 12731, Part I Section 101(k) which      were written by the Office of Government Ethics (``OGE'') and      included as part of the final rule making governing the      Executive Order. These comments make explicit what is      implicit in the Executive Order, i.e., that federal employees      had a duty to ``overreport'' indications of misconduct and      that the appropriate authorities would determine whether      allegations were ``spurious.'' The OGE explained this      reasoning as follows:       ``Five agencies suggested changes to Sec. 2635.101(b)(11)      [the OGE Code of Federal Regulations provision which      incorporated the requirements of Executive Order 12731, Part      I Section 101(k)], the principle requiring disclosure of      fraud, waste, abuse and corruption. The recommendation by two      agencies to change ``shall'' to ``should'' was not adopted.      Section 2635.101(b)(11) is a verbatim restatement of the      principle enunciated in the Executive order and the      recommended substitution of precatory for mandatory      language would change the principle. The Office of      Government Ethics does not share those agencies' concern      that the principle will elicit frivolous reporting. The      Government's interest in curbing waste, fraud, abuse and      corruption is better served by overreporting than by      underreporting, and the authorities to whom such      disclosure are to be made can best determine the merits of      allegations and ensure that harm does not result from any      that are spurious.''       Exhibit 1, quoting from Federal Register p. 35007 (emphasis      added).       In addition, the OGE warned that agencies could not require      employees to apply ``complex legal principles'' when      determining whether to report potential ``improprieties.''      Id. Thus Dr. Whitehurst, who read these regulations prior to      filing any allegations with the Office of Inspector General,      or the FBI for that matter, acted pursuant to mandatory      authority when he reported potential violations of complex      legal matters such as improper withholding of Brady      information by the FBI and DOJ, potential perjury, the use of      improper scientific procedures and the lack of scientific      integrity at the FBI lab.       Thus, it is incumbent upon the Director of the FBI to      insure that all FBI employees report any allegations of      misconduct, and to err on the side of ``overreporting'' these      kinds of concerns. We are very troubled that your office has      not enforced the requirement that employees are under a      mandatory duty to disclose indications of misconduct. Instead      of strictly enforcing the law, you have publicly attacked Dr.      Whitehurst for doing exactly what he was require to do under      federal law.       Not only was Dr. Whitehurst required to report his concerns      pursuant to Executive Order, the OGE regulations and the      Department of Justice employee handout, the FBI's own      internal procedures regarding employee conduct required that      Dr. Whitehurst report ``any indication'' of ``possible''      misconduct, whether proven or not, to the appropriate      authorities. Section 1-22(c) of the FBI Manual of      Administrative Operations and Procedures (MAOP) states as      follows:       ``Each employee has the responsibility to report promptly,      any indication of possible exploitation or misuse of Bureau      resources; information as to violations of law, rules or      regulations; personal misconduct. . . .''       Exhibit 2, FBI MAOP Section 1-22 (emphasis added), attached      hereto.       Once again, it is clear that Dr. Whitehurst had to report      unproven and ``possible'' ``indications'' of misconduct to      the appropriate authorities. It is fundamentally wrong for      you to challenge his right to ``overreport,'' and ridicule      his allegations as ``conjecture'' in the face of these legal      mandates and in the face of the severe crisis that has gone      unaddressed within the crime lab. To make matters even worse,      you were fully aware of many of these problems in 1994, yet      you failed to approve an independent review of these matters      and failed to correct these problems.       In your March 11th letter to Mr. Bromwich you also state      that Dr. Whitehurst could have been placed on leave as a      result of his ``refusal to answer questions, in direct      ocntravention of an order to cooperate by an FBI Acting      Director, with regard to an investigation into allegations      that Mr. Whitehurst, without authorization, disclosed      official information to the media.'' Once again, your      characterization of events is neither complete nor accurate.      Dr. Whitehurst was asked to answer questions concerning an      investigation conducted by the Inspector General about an      alleged leak of information to a journalist. Dr. Whitehurst      was originally informed that his cooperation with this      investigation was completely voluntary. Specifically, the      Special Investigative Counsel assigned by the IG to conduct      the investigation stated that the interview would be      ``voluntary'' and that Dr. Whitehurst could ``terminate'' the      interview ``at any time.'' Exhibit 3, Hutchison to Kohn,      February 13, 1996, attached hereto. The fact that this      interview was originally scheduled as a ``voluntary''      interview is consistent with the manner in which the IG      conducted its interviews during the course of the IG's      ``Whitehurst Review.'' Documents reviewed by Dr. Whitehurst's      counsel demonstrate that FBI employees were informed by the      IG of their right to refuse to answer questions and the fact      that such refusal would not result in any adverse actions.       Unfortunately, the FBI issued an instruction that Dr.      Whitehurst could not fully communicate with his private      attorneys concerning the proposed interview. This instruction      was clearly retaliatory, unconstitutional and illegal. The      DOJ was informed that as long as this instruction stood, we      would instruct our client not to answer any questions and      that the government's restriction on Dr. Whitehurst's      communications with his private counsel would be challenged      in federal court. Exhibit 4, Cochran and Kohn to Reno (March      27, 1996) attached hereto.       On March 19, 1996, after the FBI was informed of our      objections to the improper restrictions on Dr. Whitehurst's      communications with counsel, and after Dr. Whitehurst had      been informed that the interview would be ``voluntary,'' the      FBI Acting Assistant Director ordered Dr. Whitehurst to      ``appear'' and answer questions on a mandatory basis.      Exhibit 5, Thompson to Whitehurst (March 19, 1996),      attached hereto. This order was issued almost three weeks      after the FBI was informed of our objections and position      regarding the government's interference with Dr.      Whitehurst's communications with counsel.\2\ See, Ex. 4.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \2\ Notably, a subsequent attempt by the FBI to force Dr.      Whitehurst to answer hostile questioning by arbitrarily      switching a voluntary interview to a mandatory one was      enjoined by court order. In September, 1996 the FBI once      again ordered Dr. Whitehurst to submit to a mandatory      interview and provide information to a prosecutor. The      retaliatory nature of that instruction was so obvious that a      U.S. District Court Judge issued a temporary restraining      order and a permanent injunction prohibiting the mandatory      interview. Ex. 6, U.S. v. McVeigh, Orders of Judge Matsch      (Sept. 12, 1996 and Oct. 29, 1996).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Unfortunately, your letters of March 11th are not the first      time you have treated Dr. Whitehurst in a disrespectful      fashion. In 1994, after Dr. Whitehurst contacted your Office      of General Counsel and, in good faith, attempted to      communicate his concerns about the crime lab, the Office of      General Counsel, with your specific concurrence, ridiculed      him as a ``perfectionist'' who ``refuses to compromise or be      realistic about his expectations of the LD [Laboratory      Division]''. Memorandum of May 26, 1994, initialed by FBI      General Counsel H.M. Shapiro. These types of derogatory      characterizations are inconsistent with the regulations      governing FBI employee-whistleblowing. It is highly      unprofessional for the FBI to personally deride an individual      who had the courage to come forward and point out problems      within the crime lab. Frankly, we are shocked at the complete      disrespect toward Dr. Whitehurst you have repeatedly shown or      approved. Given the FBI's record in its dealings with Dr.      Whitehurst we are not surprised that you objected to the IG's      February 26, 1997 testimony confirming that the IG had      ``found substantial problems [at the FBI crime lab] based on      the allegations that Dr. Whitehurst made to us.'' Freeh to      Bromwich, p. 2 (March 11, 1997). The FBI's pattern of      attacking Dr. Whitehurst and ignoring the real problems which      exist in the crime lab are not consistent with the goals of      law enforcement.       In your letter to Mr. Bromwich you suggest that Congress      should be briefed in ``executive session'' about undisclosed      issues related to Dr. Whitehurst. The inference you clearly      intended to leave with any person who read this letter      borders on blatant ``McCarthyism''. You suggest that Dr.      Whitehurst engaged in misconduct which needed to be ``treated      confidentially.'' The facts indicate that the FBI's      treatment of Dr. Whitehurst and its indifference in      responding to his serious allegations will be recorded as      one of the saddest chapters in law enforcement history.       In the future, if you intend to provide any member of      Congress with a ``confidential'' briefing regarding Dr.      Whitehurst, we hereby request that we be notified in advance      of this briefing and that you request permission for Dr.      Whitehurst's counsel to attend any such briefing and respond      to the information you place before Congress.       Finally, your letters of March 11th referenced above were      filed in violation of the Privacy Act and other applicable      federal laws. We hereby request that you take immediate steps      to correct the inaccurate information contained in your      letters. Pursuant to the Privacy Act we also hereby request      that a copy of this letter be sent to all persons to whom you      provided a copy of your March 11th letters. In addition,      pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.      Sec. 552, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552a and the      February 5, 1997 Order issued by the Honorable Gladys Kessler      in Whitehurst v. FBI, et al., C.A. No. 96-572(GK) (D.D.C.) we      hereby request immediate access to all documents directly or      indirectly related to: (a) the subject matter of this letter;      (b) all interactions with the U.S. Congress related to Dr.      Whitehurst; (c) all notes concerning any conversations      between the FBI and the DOJ IG; (d) all documents related to      and a complete accounting of all disclosures of information      made about Dr. Whitehurst from any FBI employee to any person      outside of the FBI (including, but not limited to, the      Director of the FBI, the FBI Deputy Director, Mr. Jim      Maddock, Mr. Weldon Kennedy, the office of public affairs, of      office of congressional affairs, the Acting Assistant      Director, Laboratory Division and Mr. D.W. Thompson); (e) all      documents in any manner related to the above-referenced March      11, 1997 letters signed by the FBI Director; and (f) all      documents in any manner related to any briefing given by any      FBI employee to any Member of the U.S. Congress, or any      person employed by the U.S. Congress or a Member thereof.       We also request that fees be waived concerning our FOI/PA      request because this information will significantly      contribute to the public interest and the public's      understanding of the operation of its government. In      addition, we request that this FOIA and Privacy Act request      be expedited given the intense public interest in these      matters.       Thank you in advance for your prompt attention. We expect      full compliance with the     FOIA and Privacy Act requests contained herein within ten      days.           Sincerely yours,     Stephen M. Kohn,     Michael D. Kohn,     David K.
