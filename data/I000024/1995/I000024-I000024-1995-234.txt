BYRD. Not yet. I will yield in a moment.  The Senator's party is the party that is out here advocating cutting taxes louder than anybody else.  I think it is folly to cut taxes in this climate. It is folly, whether it is my President advocating it, or whether it is the so-called Contract With America. It is silly.  I cannot look my grandchildren in the eye and say ``Well, I am for cutting taxes. I would rather have you live with the problems that we leave.'' I cannot say that to my grandchildren. ``I would rather have you live with the problems that we have created in our time. I prefer that you increase taxes in your day and time.''  Do not talk to me about cutting taxes. I think that is a bad message.  But we say, ``Cut taxes.'' What utter folly! Now, the Senator's party is advocating cutting taxes. I do not see how they can do that with a straight face and come here on this floor, day after day after day and moan and groan and gnash their teeth over the fact that the balanced budget to the Constitution has been voted down. Now they say that that is the cause of the drop in the dollar. That is the cause of this, that, everything else.  But yet, not a word do they say--not a word--about the $200-plus billion tax cut that is being advocated by the so-called Contract With America.
