' Regrettably, that effort is not duplicated by the Senate, because the Senate Republican leadership continues to object, stall and delay consideration of these much-needed judges.  This is not a partisan issue. Two weeks ago in a hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Justice Scalia agreed that the extensive delays in the confirmation process are already having a chilling effect on the ability to attract talented nominees to the Federal bench. Chief Justice Roberts has also described the ``persistent problem of judicial vacancies in critically overworked districts.'' Hardworking Americans are denied justice when their cases are delayed by overburdened courts. While people appearing in court are waiting years before a judge rules on their case, they feel they are being forced to live the old adage ``justice delayed is justice denied.''  I have heard Republican Senators come to the floor purporting to justify their delays by selectively pointing to past instances in which Democratic Senators opposed a handful of President Bush's most ideological nominations. Their misguided attempt to go ``tit for tat'' and settle a political score on nominations ignores the realities of the crisis in judicial vacancies created by their delays. They ignore the fact that President Obama's current nominees are not divisive, ideological picks, but consensus, qualified nominees who are being blocked across the board for no good reason.  Senate Republicans also ignore the actual record on nominations established by Senate Democrats in considering President Bush's nominations. In the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first 2 years in office, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of his judicial nominees. In stark contrast, it has taken us twice as long--34 months--to confirm just over 100 of President Obama's judicial nominations. In President Bush's first term we confirmed a total of 205 Federal circuit and district court judges. As of today, we have almost 100 confirmations of President Obama's circuit and district court nominations to go in order to match that total during the next 12 months. Given the obstruction and delays during these first 3 years of President Obama's administration, we have a lot of ground to make up andneed to get started if the Senate is to be as productive as we were during President Bush's first term.  Democrats did not go ``tit for tat'' on nominations during President Bush's first years in office. Even though Senate Republicans pocket filibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations and refused to proceed on them while judicial vacancies skyrocketed to more than 110, we proceeded. As I have noted, we confirmed 100 in 17 months during President Bush's first 2 years. Now, however, Senate Republicans have not built on that progress and bipartisan cooperation but have returned, instead, to their practices of obstruction in order to hold judicial vacancies open, rather than confirm the nominations of a Democratic President. And as a result, judicial vacancies have skyrocketed, again. At this point in President Bush's first term we had confirmed 162 Federal circuit and district court judges, and the vacancy rate was down to 5 percent, with 46 vacancies. Vacancies are now twice as high with a vacancy rate of nearly 11 percent and vacancies again at 90, where they have been for well over 2 years.  This is not the way to make real progress. In the past, we were able to confirm consensus nominees more promptly, often within days of being reported to the full Senate. They were not forced to languish for months. The American people should not have to wait weeks and months for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and ensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around the country.  There is no good reason for the Republican refusal to consent to votes on three circuit court nominations which were favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee many months ago. We should be able to have a debate and vote on the nomination of Caitlin Halligan, the superbly qualified nominee to the ninth seat on the D.C. Circuit reported by the Judiciary Committee over seven months ago. She is a highly-respected appellate litigator who has excelled in private practice and public service, including 6 years as Solicitor General of the State of New York, and her nomination has the strong support of law enforcement and a number of prominent conservative lawyers. With a new vacancy on that court, it is now more than one-quarter vacant. Four of President Bush's D.C. Circuit nominees were confirmed to that Court, twice filling the tenth seat and once filling the eleventh seat. There is no reason we cannot now confirm President Obama's first D.C. Circuit nominee to fill the ninth seat.  There is also no reason for the Senate to have been required by Republican objection to have skipped the nominations of Stephen Higginson of Louisiana to the Fifth Circuit and Christopher Droney of Connecticut to the Second Circuit. Each has been nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy and each was reported unanimously by the Committee three months ago and before the nomination being considered today. In fact the Senate has only been allowed to consider 5 circuit court nominations this entire Congress. This stands in sharp contrast to the 17 circuit court nominations in 17 months that we confirmed when I chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002 and President Bush was in the White House.  The delays which have led to the damaging backlog in judicial nominations are compounded by attempts by Senate Republicans to use invented controversies to damage qualified nominees. The decision by the entire Republican caucus to vote against the nomination of Alison Nathan to the Southern District of New York last week reminded me of the shameful party line vote which defeated President Clinton's nominee of Justice Ronnie White of Missouri in 1999. Even though Alison Nathan's nomination had been reported in July with the support of half of the Republican members of the Committee, last week those Senators flipped their votes and all Republican Senators voted as a bloc against confirming her to the Federal bench. That was extraordinary. Fortunately, they did not prevail and Judge Nathan, an accomplished, impressive nominee, was confirmed. She deserved better treatment by Senate Republicans, not their party line opposition.  Today the Senate finally considers the nomination of Cathy Bissoon. She will make a superb addition to the Federal bench. She is already well-known on the court to which she is nominated, having served as a Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania since 2008, when she became the first Hispanic woman appointed to that role. She also clerked for Judge Lancaster of the Western District following law school. Judge Bissoon worked in private practice for 14 years at Cohen & Grigsby and Reed Smith in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Both of Pennsylvania's Senators support her nomination. Senator Casey, in particular, has worked very hard to help us get to this day. The Judiciary Committee favorably reported Judge Bissoon's nomination without dissent in July. When confirmed, she will be the first Hispanic woman to serve the Western District of Pennsylvania as a Federal judge.  I hope we can consider additional judicial nominations this week to address the serious judicial vacancies crisis on Federal courts around the country that has persisted for over 2 years. We can and must do better for the nearly 170 million Americans being made to suffer by these unnecessary Senate delays.                               Exhibit 1                                     American Bar Association,                                    Chicago, IL, October 13. 2011.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Republican Leader McConnell: I am writing on behalf of      the American Bar Association to commend you on the      confirmation of ten judges during the past two weeks. Your      agreement with Senator McConnell allowed a higher number of      judges to be confirmed than in any prior month this Congress.      Moreover, your scheduling of the first six nomination votes      on the same day was a welcome departure from the general      pattern observed this Congress of considering only one or two      nominees at a time. We strongly encourage you to continue to      schedule same-day votes on multiple nominees throughout the      rest of the session. Nothing less than a sustained,      concerted, and cooperative effort will be sufficient to make      discernible progress in reducing the longstanding and      dangerously high vacancy rate on the federal courts. And, as      important, nothing less will assure litigants--businesses and      aggrieved individuals alike--that our federal courts have      sufficient judges to hear their cases in a timely and      thorough fashion.       Filling existing vacancies on the federal bench has become      a matter of increasing urgency. Across the nation, federal      courts with high caseloads and longstanding or multiple      vacancies have no choice but to delay or temporarily suspend      their civil dockets due to Speedy Trial Act requirements.      This deprives our federal courts of the capacity to deliver      timely justice in civil matters and has real consequences for      the financial well-being of businesses and for individual      litigants whose lives are put on hold pending resolution of      their disputes.       The effect of the recent confirmations on the overall      vacancy rate amply attests to the need for continued      bipartisan action to achieve progress. On September 7, the      day after the Senate's first confirmation vote since its      return from the August recess, there were 91 vacancies on the      federal bench. Despite the recent confirmation of ten judges,      there are 92 vacancies on the bench today because of recent      retirements and a death. Regrettably, this outcome is not an      aberration or product of selective statistical reporting;      even though the Senate has confirmed from one to seven judges      every month this Congress, the vacancy rate continues to      hover around 10 percent--right where it has been for the past      24 months.       However, if the Senate were to confirm by the end of this      month the 29 nominees currently pending on the floor who were      reported from the Judiciary Committee by bipartisan voice      vote, the vacancy rate would drop to approximately seven      percent, absent unanticipated events. That would be a real      accomplishment.       We urge you to build on your recent success by continuing      to reach agreements to schedule multiple nominees for votes      on the same day at regular intervals throughout the remainder      of this session. Given the long-term backlogs, it is      important that confirmations outpace attrition and that the      Senate has the opportunity to achieve significant success in      reducing the vacancy rate and providing the federal judiciary      with the judges it needs to evaluate each case on its merits      and dispense timely justice to all.           Sincerely,                                       Wm. T. (Bill) Robinson III,                                                        President.
