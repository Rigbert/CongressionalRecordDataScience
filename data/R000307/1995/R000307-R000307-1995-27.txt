Chairman, I would really hope it would not come to this, to get back into this whole argument on the disaster program and crop insurance. The mandatory crop insurance program is underfunded. It is not working well in high-risk agriculture country mainly because of the efforts of the gentleman from Illinois.  Now we will adhere to our responsibilities in regards to crop insurance, and we are trying to move away from the disaster program. But to try to rewrite an unworkable crop insurance bill right in the middle of an appropriation bill when we are trying to do it in the farm bill is just not the way to do business. I want water and sewer programs, but that was a very untoward remark by the gentleman from Illinois, and I resent it.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Olver].  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.                             recorded vote
