Since 1995, the National Center for Assisted Living has sponsored National Assisted Living Week to emphasize the importance of the options assisted living provides seniors and persons with disabilities.  Assisted living is a long-term care alternative for seniors who need more assistance than is available in general retirement communities but do not require the heavy medical and nursing care provided by nursing homes.  This year's theme for National Assisted Living Week is ``Sharing Life's Treasures'' which highlights the need for all of us, no matter what our age, to take time to appreciate the treasures we find along life's pathway.  My State, Oregon, helped to pioneer the assisted-living concept because it could help promote security, dignity, and independence for seniors. While assisted living varies from State to State, it remains a consumer-oriented option for long-term care needs, and highlights the need to support options for long-term care as our population ages.                          ____________________
