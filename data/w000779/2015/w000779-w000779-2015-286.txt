President, I wish to honor the University of Oregon's football team for its tremendous season. The Fighting Ducks of Oregon accumulated 13 wins with only 2 losses this year, which accounts for the most wins in team history. This season culminated with the Ducks winning their 11th Pac-12 Conference championship, playing in the first NCAA college football playoff, winning their third-ever Rose Bowl and reaching the National Championship game. It is truly a great year to be a Duck.  Recognition should not only be given to this football team's success on thefield but also to the hard work and effort demonstrated by players, coaches, and staff off the field. From volunteering at local afterschool programs to honoring our military, members of the Oregon Ducks football team have shown dedication and commitment to their school and their community.  Special recognition should go to head coach Mark Helfrich--a native Oregonian--for leading this group of young men to success on and off the field. I am also proud to honor Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota for winning the University of Oregon's first Heisman Trophy. Marcus is the first athlete of Polynesian descent to win this award, which makes him the pride of his home State of Hawaii. His acceptance speech during the Heisman Trophy presentation was truly moving. I am proud to watch him represent the University with such class.  The Oregon Ducks have seen tremendous success throughout this 2014 season, scoring an average of 45.4 points per game, 90 total touchdowns, and amassing more than 3,000 total yards rushing. Marcus Mariota set a school record for single-season passing yards--more than 4,400 yards in 15 games--and, following completion of the regular season, two members of the Oregon football team were honored as first-team All-Americans by the Associated Press.  It has been a remarkable season all around, and I look forward to more years watching Coach Helfrich encourage his players to win the day. Go Ducks!                          ____________________
