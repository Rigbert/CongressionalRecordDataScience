President, I rise today to offer an amendment that would rename the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center at Rock Island, IL, in honor of Representative Lane Evans.  Representative Evans has been a tireless advocate of our men and women in uniform during his 24 years in Congress. Unfortunately, Congress will lose a great man when he retires at the end of this year, and we can honor him and his accomplishments by renaming the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center at Rock Island after him.  Lane Evans came to Congress as a Marine Corps veteran, and military personnel and veterans were always on the forefront of his mind during his service on the House Committee on Armed Services and Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Throughout his career, Representative Evans has fought to ensure that veterans receive the medical care they need and has provided outspoken support for individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and gulf war syndrome. Additionally, Representative Evans is credited with bringing new services to veterans living in his congressional district. In particular, he was responsible for the development of outpatient clinics in the Quad Cities and Quincy, IL, as well as the establishment of the Quad-Cities Vet Center.  Representative Evans also has worked to ensure that military personnel experience a smooth transition from active military service into the care of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Generations of veterans will continue to benefit from his hard work long after he has retired.  Representative Evans has worked in conjunction with local leaders to promote the Rock Island Arsenal, and through his support, the facility has received new jobs and new missions. It is fitting and proper that the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center at Rock Island Arsenal be named in honor of Representative Evans in order to commemorate his service to America's military personnel, its veterans, and his 17th Congressional district.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.                           amendment no. 4336
