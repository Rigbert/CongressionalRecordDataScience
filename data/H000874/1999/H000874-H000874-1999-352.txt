Speaker, April 24 marks the commemoration of the massacre of the Armenian people in Turkey during and after the First World War. More than 1.5 million people were expelled from their homes and marched to their deaths in what is recorded as the first of this century's state-ordered genocides against a minority group. Tragically, at the close of the century we again bear witness to the universality of human cruelty and fanaticism as the Kosovar Albanians are ethnically cleansed from their homeland.  We must remember, we must reflect and we must learn. One of the great thinkers and advocates of our time--indeed, the conscience of this century--Elie Wiesel, has said that ``indifference makes humans inhuman; indifference is always the friend of the enemy; indifference is not only a sin, it is a punishment.'' We must not be indifferent, Mr. Speaker, we must also act.  We remember the Armenians and their suffering, the incomprehensive magnitude of their loss. We honor those who perished. Yet, Mr. Speaker, we also remember the survivors and are inspired by their sacrifice, their strength and their creativity in building a future for the Armenian people. Today, independent Armenia guarantees the security and future of the nation and is a beacon of hope to Armenian people everywhere. Its people work tirelessly to strengthen democratic institutions and build a flourishing market economy to ensure peace and prosperity for generations to come. It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that those to come will not have to sacrifice as their ancestors have. It is also my hope that the parties to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh will renew and redouble their efforts to reach a negotiated settlement and to help bring peace and prosperity to the entire region.  Mr. Speaker, the Armenian people did not ``disappear,'' as their persecutors intended. They survived and they flourished. Their strength of spirit, endurance and prosperity of the Armenian people give hope for the future to all of us--especially those who suffer now.                          ____________________
