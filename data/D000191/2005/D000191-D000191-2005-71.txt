  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, the government is in a fiscal crisis. We are borrowing $1.2 billion a day to run the government under the Bush administration and the Republican leadership. They have raised the national debt to $8 trillion in 5 short years, but now they are newly born as fiscal conservatives, and they want to cut $50 billion.  From where? Student loans, the school lunch and breakfast programs, those kids are eating too much, foster care and child support enforcement to help the deadbeat dads. They will, unfortunately, more than overspend their cuts to those struggling people and those good programs. They want $70 billion of tax cuts, $20 billion more added to the sea of red ink that is drowning America in tax cuts for, guess who, the wealthy because trickle-down is the highest form of achievement in Washington, D.C. these days. They want to bleed struggling Americans to float the yachts of the wealthy on a sea of red ink one more time while lying about what they are doing.                          ____________________[Page H9558]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      REPUBLICAN BUDGET PRIORITIES  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
