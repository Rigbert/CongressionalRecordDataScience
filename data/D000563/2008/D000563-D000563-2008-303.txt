President, this February, on Valentine's Day, a youngman walked into a lecture hall at Northern Illinois University and opened fire. Five students were killed and 17 were wounded before the shooter took his own life. Northern Illinois University was not the first college to experience this kind of tragedy. We all remember the horrific events at Virginia Tech only months earlier--where 32 lives were taken by a gunman. The magnitude of heartbreak for friends and families and communities of those killed is hard to imagine. So, too, is the continuing trauma experienced by those who survived. These tragedies opened our eyes to a reality that needs attention.  Since February I have learned just how thin colleges and universities are stretched when it comes to providing counseling and other support services to students, and I think we need to help them. So today I am introducing the Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act, which would establish grant programs to help schools meet the rising need for mental health services on campus.  The ratio of counselors to students on campus is widening. Currently there is only one counselor for every 2,000 students on our college campuses. At some colleges, the situation is even more dismal. Studies show that 10 percent of college students have contemplated suicide. Mr. President, 45 percent have felt so depressed that it was difficult to function. Colleges are also encountering students who 10 or 20 years ago would not have been able to attend school due to mental illness, but who can today because of advances in treatment of mental illness.  Taking care of mental health needs on our college campuses is somewhat unique. Many mental illnesses start to manifest in this period when young people leave the security of home and regular medical care. The responsibility for the students' well-being often shifts from parents to students, who aren't always completely prepared. The colleges try to fill in the gaps, but with so few services and counselors, we are beginning to recognize how many needs are overlooked. This is a very real problem, even for schools that have made mental health services a dedicated priority.  Take Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. SIUC has eight full-time counselors for 21,000 students. That is one counselor for every 2,500 students. And there is another problem. Like many rural communities, Carbondale only has one community mental health agency. That agency is overwhelmed by the mental health needs of the community and refuses to serve students from SIU. The campus counseling center is the only mental health option for students. The eight hard-working counselors at SIUC do their best under impossible conditions. They triage students who come in seeking help so that the ones who might be a threat to themselves or others are seen first. The waitlist of students seeking services has reached 45 students.  With so many students looking for help and so few counselors to see them, the counseling center has to cut back on outreach. Without outreach, the chances diminish of finding students who need help but don't ask for it. This is a serious problem. We know that the shooter at Virginia Tech exhibited many warning signs of a tortured mental state. But faculty and students did not know how or where to express their concerns. Outreach efforts by campus counseling centers can help educate the community about warning signs to look for as well as how to intervene. Of the students who committed suicide across the country in 2007, only 22 percent had received counseling on campus. That means that of the 1,000 college students who took their own lives, 800 may never have looked for help. How many of those young lives could have been saved if our college counseling centers had the resources they needed to identify those students and help them? Our students deserve better.  The Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act would create a grant program to provide funding for colleges and universities to improve their mental health services. Colleges could use the funding to hire personnel, increase outreach, and educate the campus community about mental health. The bill also would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a public, nation-wide campaign to education campus communities about mental health.  Reflecting on the loss of his own son, the well known minister Rev. William Sloan Coffin once said, ``When parents die, they take with them a portion of the past. But when children die, they take away the future as well.'' I hope the bill I am introducing today will help prevent the unnecessary loss of more young lives and bright futures.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3311       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health on Campus      Improvement Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The 2007 National Survey of Counseling Center Directors      found that the average ratio of counselors to students on      campus is nearly 1 to 2,000 and is often far higher on large      campuses. The International Association of Counseling      Services accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per      1,000 to 1,500 students.       (2) College counselors report that 8.5 percent of enrolled      students sought counseling in the past year, totaling an      estimated 1,600,000 students.       (3) Over 90 percent of counseling directors believe there      is an increase in the number of students coming to campus      with severe psychological problems. The majority of      counseling directors report concern that the demand for      services is growing without an increase in resources.       (4) A 2006 American College Health Association survey      revealed that 44 percent of students at colleges and      universities report having felt so depressed it was difficult      to function, and one out of every 11 students seriously      considered suicide within the past year.       (5) Research conducted from 1989 to 2002 found that      students seen for anxiety disorders doubled, for depression      tripled, and for serious suicidal intention tripled.       (6) Many students who need help never receive it.      Counseling directors report that of the students who      committed suicide on their campuses, only 22 percent were      current or former counseling center clients. Directors did      not know the previous psychiatric history of 60 percent of      these students.       (7) A survey conducted by the University of Idaho Student      Counseling Center (2000) found that 77 percent of students      who responded reported that they were more likely to stay in      school because of counseling and that their school      performance would have declined without counseling.       (8) A 6-year longitudinal study of college students found      that personal and emotional adjustment was an important      factor in retention and predicted attrition as well as or      better than academic adjustment (Gerdes & Mallinckrodt,      1994).
