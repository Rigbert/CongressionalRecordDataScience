 President, if the Senator will yield for a moment, I say to my friend from Utah, we are prepared to accept several additional amendments that are on the Republican list and the Republican manager, as I understand, is close to being prepared to accept several amendments on the list of the Democrats.  Senator Levin has indicated on his amendment No. 1244 that he is willing to withdraw that amendment under an assertion by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee that he would hold hearings on the Levin-Nunn-Inouye amendment.
