 The conference report has been filed and this will give ample time for Members to review that measure. We will also consider any legislative or executive items that can be cleared by unanimous consent. I hope among those will be some of these 95 innocent nominees who were caught up in the obstructionism in the Senate. Hopefully, during the Thanksgiving recess, we will come back with a different attitude and clear the nominees. One issue we need to address is the pension rate bill, and we will continue to work toward finishing that bill when we return.  I will announce, no rollcall votes will occur that day. So obviously on that day what we will be able to do will be done by consent.  We wish everyone a pleasant Thanksgiving holiday and hope when we come back on December 9 we will be able to do some of the Nation's unfinished business.                          ____________________
