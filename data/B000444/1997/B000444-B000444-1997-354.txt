 President, today I join with my longtime colleague in this endeavor, Senator Boxer, to restate our continuing opposition to legislation changing the current dolphin-safe standard. As usual, she has explained the issue much better than I could, so my remarks will be brief.  Throughout the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's, hundreds of thousands of dolphins were senselessly killed every year because of the use of gigantic purse seine fishing nets. Our efforts to require that each nation wishing to export tuna to the United States document that it possessed a dolphin protection program and a dolphin mortality rate comparable to ours largely failed, resulting in unilateral embargoes against noncomplying nations.  The senseless slaughter of dolphin justifiably outraged many Americans. Literally tens of thousands of letters, telegrams, and phone calls poured into tuna companies' offices and Capitol Hill. The message heard was loud and clear: Don't allow this needless massacre to continue.  Then, in 1990, something remarkable happened. American tuna companies, environmentalists, and consumers came together and revolutionized an entire industry. That April, Starkist, and shortly after that Chicken of the Sea, and Bumblebee--which combined sold more than 80 percent of the tuna in America--announced voluntary purchasing bans against all tuna caught in association with dolphins.  On the heels of this campaign, then-Congresswoman Boxer and I wrote and shepherded into law the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act--a landmark statute that set one very simple, uniform standard: No tuna caught by purse seine net fishing, or by a boat capable of purse seine net fishing, can be labeled as dolphin-safe.  Our labeling law immediately transformed the decades-long controversy. Dolphin mortalities caused by both American and foreign tuna boats plummeted from more than 52,000 in 1990, to just under 3,000 in 1995. A tremendous decrease.  Millions of consumers now purchase tuna with a clear conscience, knowing that the deadly purse seine net method was not used.  Simply put, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act remains a remarkable success story. It does not mandate anything. It does not require thousands of bureaucrats. It merely requires accurate, truthful labeling.  From the nutritional information printed on boxes of cereal, to salt content listings on low-sodium crackers, honesty in labeling is a well-established principle of law.  This does not necessarily mean that all types of a given product must conform to the requirements of a particular labeling law. All milk is not required to contain 2 percent milkfat, for example. But, if a dairy company wishes to label its product as 2 percent milkfat, it must meet that standard. In essence that is the concept underlying the current dolphin safe standard.  Unfortunately, legislation (S. 39) introduced recently by Senator Stevens and Senator Breaux changes the criteria for the current label, thereby eliminating the protection and honesty now provided. While the proposed no-mortalities requirement sounds good on its face, it is for all practical purposes unworkable and unenforceable. One observer, equipped with a pair ofbinoculars, can hardly keep accurate watch over the entire contents of a 1 to 2 mile long, half-mile wide net, submerged hundreds of feet below water.  I recognize the potential significance and power of the October 1995 Panama Declaration, and I agree that our unilateral embargoes deserve a serious reexamination. In fact, legislation I and Senator Boxer introduced during the 104th Congress would have implemented key parts of the declaration by repealing the current comparability embargoes and opening our market--literally the most lucrative in the world--to all tuna caught in compliance with the current dolphin-safe standard.  But market access issues, questions of whether to allow dolphin-safe and other tuna into our market, are separate from the reasoning behind the current label.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in the administration to lock-in the progress we have made. And I commend Senator Boxer for her diligent efforts to protect our environment while preserving our principles.                          ____________________
