 I have had an opportunity to work with him not only on legislation of this type but a lot of other pieces of legislation, and I enjoy working with him because he is a person of great common sense. I thank him for his leadership in this area, and, more importantly, I thank him for serving in the outstanding position as chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, with a lot of responsibilities in the area of making sure aging problems are brought to the forefront.  This legislation we are introducing is called the Nursing Home Transparency and Improvement Act. It brings to the surface some very important issues he is watching as chairman of the Aging Committee. I have some interaction with it because I am a member of the Finance Committee.  This is a critical piece of legislation that brings overdue transparency to consumers regarding nursing home quality and operations. It also provides long needed improvements to our enforcement system.  In America today, there are well over 1.7 million elderly and disabled individuals in over 17,000 nursing home facilities. As the baby boom generation enters retirement, this number is going to rise dramatically. While many people are using alternatives, such as community-based care, nursing homes are going to remain a critical option for elderly and disabled populations.  As the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have a longstanding commitment to ensuring that nursing home residents receive the safe and quality care we expect for our loved ones. Why? Because the taxpayers put in tens of billions of dollars--I would imagine over $47 billion or $48 billion now, and maybe that figure is higher than the last time I looked, but it is billions of dollars. Our Aging Committee and all of Congress have a special responsibility to make sure that money is spent well, and one way of spending it well is to make sure it delivers quality care to these people who are in need.  Unfortunately, as in many areas, with nursing homes, a few bad apples often spoil the barrel. Too many Americans receive poor care, often in a subset of nursing homes. Unfortunately, this subset of chronic offenders stays in business, often keeping their poor track records hidden from the public at large and often facing little or no oversight or enforcement from the Federal Government, based on laws that were passed in 1986 and 1987.  There is a lack of transparency, a lack of accountability, and sometimes in our approach to nursing homes, quite simply, a lack of common sense--the sort of common sense the Senator from Wisconsin always exhibits in the legislative approach. These are things this legislation seeks to bring to nursing homes and their residents--transparency, accountability, and common sense.  Let's look at transparency. In the market for nursing home care, as in all markets, consumers must often have adequate information to make informed choices. For years, people looking at a nursing home for themselves or their loved ones had no way of knowing a nursing home facility's record of care, inspection history, or which individuals were ultimately responsible for caring for their loved ones.  This bill is intended to change that and to emphasize this point about why we have to be concerned about the type of facility in which a person is placed.  I have never once in my life run into a single elderly or disabled person who said to me: I am dying to get into a nursing home. This is on the continuum care, the stop where people cannot be taken care of beforehand. We need to make sure that is right.  This legislation requires nursing facilities to make available ownership information, including the individuals and entities that are ultimately responsible for a home's operation and management.  Today when I am discussing this bill with people in the industry, I don't have anybody objecting who actually owns a nursing home. But early on, that seemed to be something that, for some reason or another, did not seem to be anybody's business. Tell me it isn't anybody's business who owns a nursing home if they are receiving $45 billion to $50 billion of taxpayer money going to that industry. That ownership is very important.  How nursing homes are staffed can greatly affect the care they provide, especially when dealing with complex conditions, such as nursing homes. So you go behind who owns a nursing home, who is working there, and that is pretty important. If you do not have all this information, it leaves residents and their families without clear information about who is ultimately responsible for ensuring that a resident is consistently provided with high-quality care.  This provides transparency, as well, concerning nursing home staffing and surveys. Homes differ widely in terms of the number of specialized staff available to residents, as well as the number of registered nurses and certified nursing assistants who provide much hands-on care.  Let me say it a second time. How a nursing home is staffed can greatly affect the care it provides, especially when dealing with complex cases. This legislation requires better tracking of this information and requires that this information is available to prospective residents and their families.  In addition, this legislation will help families have a better idea of a nursing home's track record in that it requires better transparency for nursing home inspection reports that are completed on a routine basis.  The Secretary will also now be required to provide consumers with a summary of information on enforcement actions taken against a facility during the previous 3 years.  This same transparency will also provide additional market incentives for poor homes to improve. If customers know about problems, that home is incentivized to improve or face going out of business.  This effort also requires a strong, effective enforcement and monitoring system to ensure safe and quality care at facilities that will not take the necessary steps voluntarily. But even with improved transparency, there are some nursing homes that will not improve on their own.  In the nursing home industry, most homes provide quality care on a very consistent basis. So we need to give inspectors better enforcement tools.  The current system provides incentives to correct problems only temporarily and allows homes to avoid regulatory sanctions while continuing to deliver substandard care to residents. This system must be fixed.  Last year, CMS requested two things: one, statutory authority to collect civil monetary penalties sooner, and, two, the ability to hold those penalties in escrow pending appeal.  To that end, this bill requires nursing homes that have been found in violation of law be given the opportunity to participate in an independent, informal dispute resolution process within 30 days. After that point, depending on the outcome of the appeal, the penalties are collected and held in escrow pending the exhaustion of the appeals process. This will ensure that nursing homes found to be violating the rules actually pay the penalties assessed if it is determined those penalties are appropriate. But we should not have to resort to enforcement. Problems resulting in penalties should be avoided or detected and fixed immediately by the nursing home in the first place. That is why this bill now requires all nursing homes to have compliance and ethics programs, as well as quality assurance and performance improvement programs.  In addition to increased transparency and improved enforcement, this bill provides commonsense solutions to a number of other problems.  This legislation requires the Secretary of HHS to establish a national independent monitoring program to tackle problems specific to interstate and large intrastate nursing chains.  In the case of nursing homes being closed due to poor safety or quality of care, this bill requires that residents and their representatives be given sufficient notice so they can adequately plan a transfer to an appropriate setting.  We need to be very sensitive--and I am very sensitive--to the fact that nursing home residents are often elderly and fragile. Moving them into a new facility is traumatic. So we have to make sure these residents are transferred appropriately and with adequate time and care.  This bill also aims to help nursing homes that self-report their concerns and remedy certain deficiencies, giving those homes that are trying to do their best and find things wrong on their own to get credit for that. By doing so, nursing homes then may have any penalties reduced by 50 percent. This will encourage facilities to take the lead in finding, flagging, and fixing violations.  This bill is also intended to strengthen training requirements for nursing staff by including dementia and abuse prevention training as part of pre-employment.  I am proud to introduce this bill along with my friend Senator Kohl. The Committee on Aging and I have a long history of working together on elderly care issues, and I am happy to continue that work.  I also note today the Government Accountability Office is releasing a report critical of CMS's funding of State oversight entities, such as nursing homes. This report notes that survey activity is sometimes so unreliable that certain homes have not even been inspected in more than 6 years. The report makes a number of recommendations to CMS, and I will be looking very carefully at how CMS follows those recommendations. In the meantime, it is important that we improve transparency and accountability for the inspections that are taking place.  We will continue to do everything we can to make sure that American nursing home residents receive the safe and quality care they deserve. Increasing transparency, improving enforcement tools, strengthening training requirements will go a long way toward achieving that goal. I thank, once again, Senator Kohl.                                 ______                                       By
