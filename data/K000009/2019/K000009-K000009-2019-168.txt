On this anniversary, I am introducing legislation to add ``Great Lakes'' to the name of the Seaway.  This new name, the ``Great Lakes'' Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation will now reflect the Seaway's enormous role for connecting commerce, promoting economic development, and protecting national security across the nation.  In 1959, Great Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and U.S. President Eisenhower presided over festivities that marked the opening of the modern Great Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway.  Sixty years later, the role of the seaway is just as crucial. A 2018 analysis by the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation found that commercial navigation that transits the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario sustains 92,661 jobs in the US, Canada, and supports almost $13 billion in economic activity.  It is imperative that the United States continues to support the mission of the Seaway and ensure that it receives the recognition it deserves.                          ____________________
