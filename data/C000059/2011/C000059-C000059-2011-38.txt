Speaker, the United States has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make our country a better place to live and work. I rise today to recognize and honor one of those individuals, Richard ``Rick'' Grammier. Rick passed away on Sunday, January 22, 2011. He will be deeply missed.  Rick was the beloved son of Joseph and Elizabeth Grammier. After high school, Rick received his Bachelor of Science degree from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1977. Rick was a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army and served with a field artillery unit as a Captain. Following his honorable discharge, Rick began working in Executive Management with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. He earned his Master's Degree in computer and electrical engineering from Cal Poly Pomona.  Rick joined JPL in 1989 and was the Director for Solar System Exploration. Previously, he had served as the Deputy Director for Solar System Exploration and he has contributed to numerous flight projects including as the Command and Data Subsystem Manager for Cassini, the Project Engineer and Deputy Project Manager for Stardust, the Project Manager for Deep Impact, and the Project Manager for Juno. Rick also managed the Laboratory's Office of Mission Assurance.  Rick was awarded the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal for Cassini, as well as two NASA Outstanding Leadership Medals for his accomplishments on Stardust and Deep Impact. JPL Director Charles Elachi believed that, ``Rick brought great strength to the Executive Council in his leadership role overseeing the Laboratory's robotic missions to the planets and small bodies. This is a great personal loss for me and for the Laboratory.''  Rick leaves behind his beloved wife, Laura, children, Daniel, Dave, Matthew, Jackson and Jessica, his stepmother, Jeaneal Grammier, and a special nephew, Chris Grammier.  Although I never had the privilege of meeting Rick, in reading about his life I have no doubt that he will always be remembered for his incredible intelligence, work ethic, generosity, and love of family. His dedication to his work and family is a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Rick's family, friends and co-workers; although Rick may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
