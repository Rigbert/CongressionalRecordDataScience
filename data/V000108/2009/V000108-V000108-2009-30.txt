Betty Morgavan. Betty has served the Croatian community in Northwest Indiana and beyond for many years, and for her efforts she will be honored at a banquet celebrating her 50 years of service to the Croatian Fraternal Union on Sunday, July 19, 2009, at the Croatian Fraternal Lodge 170 in Merrillville, Indiana. Her complete dedication and her endless enthusiasm put forth toward her community and the Croatian Fraternal Union has allowed her the opportunity to enrich the lives of countless people.  Betty was born on June 1, 1930, to George and Vica Chelich. Her parents immigrated to the United States from Croatia early on in their adult life, and they settled in Northwest Indiana. Betty is one of three children. She has one brother, John Chelich, and one sister, Ann Chelich Lieber, who is a Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 170 board member. As a child, Betty attended Saint Mark's Elementary School and went on to graduate from Lew Wallace High School in Gary, Indiana. On October 7, 1940, Betty married Vince Morgavan, and they had three children, Helen, Ray, and Elizabeth. Betty's husband Vince was her counsel, confidant, and her most staunch ally, and they were married for almost 57 years. The two shared a wonderful marriage as well as a strong desire to help the community.  In 1959, Betty won her first official position within the lodge when she became Club Secretary. It was during those years as Secretary that Betty became inspired by her mentor and President of Lodge 170 at the time, Nicholas Erbesti. Betty's commitment to the Croatian community grew stronger, and she was elected President of Lodge 170 in 1980. During her time as President, Betty initiated the sale of the original hall on 36th Avenue and Broadway because the members decided they needed a larger space for their events and the growing community. During the late 1980s, Betty assembled a team of dedicated members to build the largest Croatian Fraternal Home in the United States and Canada, and to this day there is no lodge in all of the Croatian Fraternal Union that has a building of this size. In 1991, the $1.5 million dollar building opened. It stands as a testament to the hard-working immigrants who inspired their children to build things they themselves could hardly imagine. Under Betty's leadership, Lodge 170 grew to become the third largest membership lodge in the country. Because of her selfless dedication and undying motivation to improve this community and to keep the Croatian culture and traditions alive in Northwest Indiana as well as nationwide, Betty was re-elected by the lodge members for twenty-eight years in a row. She also had the honor of being elected to the Croatian FraternalUnion National Board for several years. In addition, Betty was also a delegate to many of the union's national conventions.  In 2008, Betty retired from her post as lodge President. Today, Betty enjoys spending time with her six grandchildren. She continues to remain an inspiration to the Croatian Fraternal Union and continues her service as a member. The beloved Croatian community could not have asked for a more devoted and loyal servant, and she is worthy of the highest praise.  Madam speaker, Mrs. Betty Morgavan has always given her time and efforts selflessly and has truly been an inspiration to so many people throughout the years. She continues to be a tremendous source of pride for the Croatian community and for the people of Northwest Indiana. I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Betty on her 50 years of service to the Croatian Fraternal Lodge 170! ``Hvala Za Sve!'' ``Thanks for Everything!''                          ____________________
