  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Dunn) and I were going to enter an amendment today to create an incentive program for States to implement a 24-hour holding period for a psychological evaluation for juveniles who bring firearms to school.  That amendment would have been subject to a point of order and we will not offer it, but I wonder if the chairman would be willing to engage in a brief colloquy.
