 President, I introduce the Victim Restitution Enhancement Act of 1995, an important piece of legislation--called for in the Contract With America--which will help victims of crime. I have long thought that swift and decisive congressional action is needed in order to change some of the basic injustice associated with our criminal justice system. I believe that the way to do this is to change the focus of our energy and time to assisting and protecting victims of crime. And some of the bills that have been introduced by Senator Nickels and Senator Hatch do an admirable job of changing the focus.  Mr. President, this morning the Judiciary Committee, under the able leadership of Senator Hatch, conducted a very thorough hearing on mandatory victim restitution. At that hearing, we heard testimony from a number of excellent witnesses, and one theme was particularly evident: We in Congress need to make sure that victims can actually receive the restitution they are due.  First and foremost, I am a practical man--somebody who looks at the way good ideas and good legislation actually functions in reality. My concern with victim restitution is making sure that crime victims actually receive the restitution they are entitled to.  That is why I am introducing the Victim Restitution Enhancement Act to make sure that crime victims receive full restitution from criminals.  In drafting this bill, I consulted with former U.S. attorneys and others who have actually participated in the current system for victim restitution. And I have incorporated practical, real world suggestions from these seasoned professionals.  Let me briefly summarize the key provisions of my bill:  First, my bill forces criminals to submit sworn affidavits listing their assets after being convicted. If criminals try to hide their assets, or lie about them, they can be prosecuted for perjury, since their asset listing is under oath.  Second, my bill requires that criminals pay off their restitution debts immediately, or at least within 5 years; currently, some criminals have been able to stretch payments over an extended period of time, making victims wait longer for their due.  Third, my bill provides that bankruptcy proceedings will not discharge a criminal's duty to pay restitution.  Fourth, my bill establishes an automatic lien on all of a criminal's assets immediately upon conviction for an offense which gives rise to restitution liability.  Fifth, importantly, my bill provides that prisoners who file prisoner lawsuits must notify their victims in writing of the lawsuit and turn any monetary award over to the victims if the prisoner has not fully satisfied his duty to pay restitution. I think this will help deter many prisoner lawsuits, because criminals will realize that even if they hit the jackpot they can't keep the money.  That is what the bill does. It makes sure that good pieces of legislation, like the draft bill circulated by Senator Hatch, will really work in the real world.  Mr. President, ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1404       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Victim Restitution      Enhancement Act of 1995''.     SEC. 2. RESTITUTION.       Section 3663 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--       (1) in subsection (f)--       (A) by striking paragraphs (1) through (3);       (B) by inserting the following new paragraph:       ``(1)(A) The order of restitution shall require the      defendant to--       ``(i) submit a sworn statement listing all assets owned or      controlled by the defendant; and       ``(ii) make payment immediately, unless, in the interest of      justice, the court provides for payment on a date certain or      in installments.       ``(B) If the court provides for payment in installments,      the installments shall be in equal monthly payments over a      payment period prescribed by the court unless the court      establishes another schedule.       ``(C) If the order of restitution permits other than      immediate payment, the payment period shall not exceed 5      years, excluding any term of imprisonment served by the      defendant for the offense.'';       (C) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (2); and       (D) by amending paragraph (2), as so redesignated, by      striking ``under this section,'' and all that follows through      the end of the paragraph and inserting ``under this      section.'';       (2) in subsection (h)--       (A) by striking ``(h) An order'' and inserting ``(h)(1)      Subject to paragraph (2), an order'';       (B) by redesignating paragraphs (1)(A), (1)(B), and (2) as      subparagraphs (A)(i), (A)(ii), and (B), respectively; and       (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:       ``(2) Notwithstanding any other law that applies a shorter      time limitation, a victim may bring an action to enforce an      order of restitution on or until the date that is 20 years      after the date of the order.''; and       (3) by adding at the end the following new subsections:       ``(j) No discharge of debt pursuant to a bankruptcy      proceeding shall render an order of restitution under this      section unenforceable or discharge liability to pay      restitution.       ``(k)(1) An order of restitution imposed pursuant to this      section or by any State court is a lien in favor of the      designated agent for a victim of crime entitled to      restitution by reason of any Federal or State law, or if such      victim cannot be identified, in favor the United States or      any State agency charged with providing restitution to      victims of crime, upon all property belonging to the person      against whom restitution is ordered. The lien arises at the      time of the entry of the order and continues until the      liability is satisfied, remitted, or set aside. The court      ordering restitution shall notify all potential claimants      entitled to restitution. On application of the person against      whom restitution is ordered, the Attorney General or any      other person or entity holding a lien pursuant to this      section, shall--       ``(A) issue a certificate of release, as described in      section 6325 of the Internal Revenue Code, of any lien      imposed pursuant to this section, upon his acceptance of a      bond described in section 6325(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue      Code; or       ``(B) issue a certificate of discharge, as described in      section 6325 of the Internal Revenue Code, of any part of the      person's property subject to a lien imposed pursuant to this      subsection, upon his determination that the fair market value      of that part of such property remaining subject to and      available to satisfy the lien is at least three times the      amount of the restitution ordered.       ``(2) The provisions of sections 6323, 6331, 6332, 6334      through 6336, 6337(a), 6338 through 6343, 6901, 7402, 7403,      7424 through 7426, 7505(a), 7506, 7701, and 7805 of the      Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and of section 513 of the Act      of October 17, 1940 (54 Stat. 1190), apply to an order of      restitution and to the lien imposed by paragraph (1) as if      the liability of the person against whom restitution is      ordered were for an internal revenue tax assessment where the      Attorney General is the lienholder, except to the extent that      the application of such statutes is modified by regulations      issued by the Attorney General to accord with differences in      the nature of the liabilities. For the purposes of this      paragraph references in the preceding sections of the      Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to `the Secretary' shall be      construed to mean `the Attorney General' and references in      those sections to `tax' shall be construed to mean `order of      restitution'.       ``(3) A notice of the lien imposed by paragraph (1) shall      be considered a notice of lien for taxes payable to the      United States for the purposes of any State or local law      providing for the filing of a notice of a tax lien. The      registration, recording, docketing, or indexing, in      accordance with section 1962 of title 28, United States Code,      of the judgment under which an order of restitution is      imposed shall be considered for all purposes as the filing      prescribed by section 6323(f)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue      Code of 1986.       ``(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this      subsection, an order of restitution may be enforced by      execution against the property of the person against whom it      is ordered in like manner as judgments in civil cases.       ``(5) No discharge of debts pursuant to a bankruptcy      proceeding shall render a lien under this section      unenforceable.       ``(6)(A) If a person against whom restitution is ordered      and whose assets are subject to a lien under this subsection      files any civil action seeking money damages, including an      action filed during a period of incarceration, such person      shall serve notice, at the expense of that person, of the      filing of the action upon each person entitled to receive      restitution, or the designated agent of such person, and the      Attorney General.       ``(B) Failure to timely provide actual notice shall be      grounds for dismissal of the underlying civil action.       ``(C) A person entitled to receive restitution under this      section, the Office of Victims of Crime of the Department of      Justice, or any agency or instrumentality of any State      charged with providing restitution to victims of crime, may      intervene in the civil action described in subparagraph (A)      if the court determines that such intervention would be in      the interests of justice.''.     SEC. 3. COSTS RECOVERABLE.       Section 1918(b) of title 28, United States Code, is amended      by inserting before the period the following: ``, including      any amount advanced to purchase contraband in a sting      operation during the investigation resulting in the      conviction''.                                 ______      By
