 President, first of all, before the Senator from Alabama leaves, he needs to be thanked for the outstanding work he has done to help put this compromise piece of legislation together that came out of committee by a bipartisan vote of 14-4, and also during the remarks he just presented for laying out the history of this legislation last year in which the bill passed 97-1. He very accurately stated what the situation is.  He also now raises the question, which is a legitimate question: What has gotten rotten in Denmark, so that all of a sudden a bill that passed 97-1 about a year ago is being filibustered in the effort to bring it up, if some people aren't playing some sort of game?  I thank the Senator from Alabama for his work on this bill.  I also thank him for reminding the Senate of what that situation was a year ago and raising the question of what has changed. Not much has changed. It is just that some people want to use tactics behind the scenes to keep a bill from coming out in the open when they wouldn't express those same views in a vote on the floor of the Senate.  Also, there was a previous speaker on the other side, a friend of mine, who recently spoke against the cloture motion to bring debate on this bill to a halt on the motion to proceed and then immediately get to the bill; he expressed a view that there ought to be opportunity to offer nongermane amendments on the issue of agriculture.  Normally, I am sympathetic to those opportunities to bring to the floor of the Senate the complaints and concerns of an economic crisis such as we are facing in agriculture. But I think there are opportunities available to do that other than messing up an opportunity to bring needed reform to the bankruptcy code.  Besides, during my remarks today, I am going to point out to the Senator from Minnesota how there are opportunities in this very bankruptcy bill to help the family farmer. They relate directly to the permanent reauthorization of chapter 12 bankruptcy. If that is not authorized in this bill--in fact, if this isn't done by the 1st of October--there is no chapter 12. Then, instead of using a chapter of the bankruptcy code that is written to the special needs of agriculture, the farmers are going to have to file for bankruptcy under chapter 11. That was written for corporate America. That doesn't fit the needs of agriculture. They are going to find, unlike chapter 12's existence for reorganization of farmers where 88 percent of them are still able to farm and maintain the family farming operation, that there will be a very high percentage of farmers forced to file under chapter 11, the chapter friendly to corporate structure, and they are not going to be farming anymore at all. They won't be farming as family farmers, if they farm.  Mr. President, we are coming soon to a cloture vote on the bankruptcy bill. If cloture is not invoked, it will be very unfortunate. I've worked very closely with the minority and with Senator Torricelli, who is the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the courts, to fashion a bill which contains many changes and modifications requested by Democrats. For instance, the means-test is looser than I would personally prefer. But I have made this change to respond to concerns raised by the other side of the aisle.  I think we're in this situation because we have Members from the minority party who want to offer an unlimited number of amendments on subjects totally unrelated to bankruptcy. This, of course, is a delay and stalling tactic by imposing these nongermane amendments upon a very important bill, a bill that will pass this body by an overwhelming margin, if we get it up for a vote, but a bill that can be stalled by people who maybe don't want this bill to pass and don't want to face it head on, because this bill passed by a 97-1 vote in the last Congress.  From my conversations with the Republican leadership, I think it's fair to say that we are willing to accommodate a few unrelated amendments from the minority. But, it appears that some Members of the Minority want to turn the bankrupticy bill into a Christmas tree for everything you can think of. Obviously, that's not acceptable. So here we are. At some point, I hope that this situation is resolved. We Republicans stand ready to be reasonable.  I want to take this opportunity to talk about what is being delayed. The bankruptcy bill contains some very important provisions that are vital for family farmers, especially Midwestern family farmers, and particularly with this economic crisis even in my State of Iowa.  As we all know from recent debate on the emergency agriculture appropriations bill, which is in conference this very night to iron out the differences between the House and Senate, many of America's farmers are facing financial ruin. We have some of the lowest commodity prices in 30 years. Pork producers have lost billions of dollars--not just in income but in equity. The price of corn is currently well under the cost of production. And the cash market for soybeans has reached a 23-year low. This is all in addition to the poor weather conditions in parts of the Midwest and the drought in the 10 States of the Eastern United States.  Just last week, I sent a letter with a number of farm State Senators from both parties, including the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, signing it, to all Senators, discussing the needs for reauthorization of chapter 12, which is done in this all-encompassing bankruptcy reform legislation.  As you can imagine, these difficult financial circumstances have sent many farming operations into a tailspin. Clearly, we need to make sure that the family farmers continue to have bankruptcy protection available during this difficult period. But bankruptcy protection won't be available if this bill is blocked by turning it into a Christmas tree.  I don't pretend to talk about bankruptcy being needed by the family farmers as a substitute for anything that can be done here in the Congress or what can be done through the marketplace to bring profitability because that is what is absolutely necessary. But under any circumstances, in good times or bad times, some farmers are going to need to have the protection of chapter 12, just as corporations in America have the protection of chapter 11. And farmers are entitled to a chapter that fits the needs of agriculture, the same way corporate America is entitled to a chapter that fits the needs of corporate America.  Title X of this bill makes chapter 12 permanent and makes several changes to chapter 12 to make it more accessible for farmers and to give farmers new tools to assist in reorganizing their financial affairs.  As things stand now, chapter 12 will cease to exist by September 30 unless we get this bill through the Senate, through conference, and on the President's desk. It would be a supreme act of irresponsibility if we let chapter 12 die and we leave our farmers without a last ditch protection against foreclosure and forced auctions.  Make no mistake about it. By delaying this bill, Senators who vote against cloture will leave family farmers across America exposed to forced auctions and foreclosures. That is what I urge the Senator from Minnesota to be cognizant of as he votes against cloture, as he indicated he would do.  Back in the mid-1980s, when Iowa was in the midst of another devastatingfarm crisis, I wrote chapter 12 to make sure family farmers would receive a fair shake in dealing with the banks and the Federal Government as a lender of last resort. At that time I didn't know if chapter 12 was going to work or not, so it was only enacted on a temporary basis. Chapter 12 has been an unmitigated success. As a result of chapter 12, many farmers in Iowa and across the country are still farming and contributing to the American economy. With a new crisis in the farm country, we need to make chapter 12 a permanent part of Federal law. This bankruptcy bill provides for permanency for farmers.  Chapter 12 worked in the mid-1980s and it should be made permanent so family farmers in trouble today or any time in the future can get breathing room and a fresh start. This statement that chapter 12 works for farmers is backed up by an Iowa State University study of farmers who used chapter 12 during the 1980s. Mr. President, 88 percent of those farmers were successfully farming at the time of the study.  The Bankruptcy Reform Act doesn't just make chapter 12 permanent; the bill makes improvements to chapter 12 so it will become more accessible and helpful for farmers. First, the definition of a family farmer is widened so more farmers can qualify for chapter 12 bankruptcy protections. Second, and perhaps more importantly, my bankruptcy bill reduces the priority of capital gains tax liabilities for farm assets sold as a part of a reorganization plan. This will have the beneficial effect of allowing cash-strapped farmers to sell livestock, grain, and other farm assets to generate cash-flow when liquidity is essential to maintaining a farming operation. Together, all of these suggested reforms will make chapter 12 more effective in protecting America's family farms during this difficult period. These reforms will never happen if the bill is continually blocked by Senators offering unrelated and nongermane amendments.  It is imperative we keep chapter 12 alive. Before we had chapter 12, banks held a veto over reorganization plans. They wouldn't negotiate with farmers and the farmer would be forced to auction off the farm, even if the farm had been in the family for generations. The fact is that fire-type sales under these circumstances actually drive down prices at those auctions so both the creditor and the debtor end up with less. Now, because of chapter 12, the banks are willing to come to terms.  We must pass this bankruptcy reform bill to make sure America's family farms have a fighting chance to reorganize their financial affairs. Unless things change, this bill may be set aside because of stalling tactics by some Members on the other side of the aisle.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter signed by five Members, including Senator Johnson of South Dakota, Senator Brownback of Kansas, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                               Washington, DC, September 13, 1999.           Support Bankruptcy Protections for Family Farmers       Dear Colleague: As the Senate returns to work for the final      months of the first session of the 106th Congress, we will      likely consider S. 625, ``the Bankruptcy Reform Act.'' We are      writing to ask your support for Title X of S. 625, which      contains vital protections for America's family farmers.       By now, we are sure that you are aware that the      agricultural sector of our economy is experiencing severe      distress. Due to grain, livestock, cotton, rice, and      commodity indexes plunging to record lows this summer, many      family farmers are in the midst of an economic crisis.      Farmers across the nation are suffering some of the lowest      farm commodity prices in 30 years. Pork producers have lost      billions of dollars in equity, the price of corn is currently      well under the cost of production and the cash market for      soybeans has reached a 23 year low. This is all in addition      to the poor weather conditions in parts of the Midwest.       In the midst of desperate times in farm country, we believe      that the important reforms contained the Title X of S. 625      are essential. Title X makes Chapter 12 of the bankruptcy      code permanent. As it stands now, Chapter 12 will expire at      the end of this fiscal year. If that happens, millions of      family farms may face foreclosure and forced auctions. We      believe that Congress has an affirmative responsibility not      to leave financially troubled family farmers without the      protections of Chapter 12.       Title X also alters Chapter 12 to make it more accessible      and helpful for farmers. First, the definition of family      farmer is widened so that more farmers can qualify for      Chapter 12 bankruptcy protections. Second, Title X also      reduces the priority of capital gains tax liabilities for      farm assets sold as a part of a reorganization plan. This      will have the effect of allowing cash-strapped farmers to      sell livestock, grain and other farm assets to generate cash      flow when liquidity is essential to maintaining a farming      operation. Together, we believe that these reforms will make      Chapter 12 even more effective in protecting America's family      farms during this difficult period.       While floor debate may focus on other provisions of S. 625,      we ask that you support Title X.     Chuck Grassley.     Tim Johnson.     Sam Brownback.     Bob Kerrey.     Tom Daschle.
