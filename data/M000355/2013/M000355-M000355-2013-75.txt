 President, many of us were stunned this week to see the administration blocking the World War II Memorial. It was a reminder to all of us how much we owe the ``greatest generation.'' Last week the Senate unanimously agreed to ensure our troops are paid during the shutdown, and the President correctly signed it into law immediately.  Today the House will pass a bill to ensure our veterans--in fact, they have done that--continue to get the services and benefits they so richly deserve. If Democrats are unwilling to fund other parts of the government, at the very least they can agree to support our veterans.  As the Senator from Texas and the majority leader were just discussing, I have the first of these unanimous consent requests to propound.  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives H.J. Res. 72, making continuing appropriations for veterans' benefits for fiscal year 2014, the measure be read three times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table.
