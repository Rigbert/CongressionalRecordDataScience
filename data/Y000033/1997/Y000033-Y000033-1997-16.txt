Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2493. As I mentioned, this is a bill that has been worked on very hard by the chairman of the subcommittee. The chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and of course myself have worked through this legislation. I believe it goes far toward the stability of the grazing activity that takes place on public lands, protecting the lands environmentally, providing for the owners of those lands the base allotments, so they can continue their efforts to try to protect the environment through sound management of thegrazing forage areas on our public lands.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2493, the Forage Improvement Act, was introduced by my good friend and colleague from Oregon, Congressman Bob Smith. Congressman Smith should be applauded for laboring tirelessly on putting together a bill that keeps the controversy out and the common sense in regarding grazing practices on our public lands. Congressman Smith has worked extremely hard to bring together the many sides of the grazing issue and has assembled a bill that helps the rancher whose livelihood depends on public land grazing without doing any harm to the rangeland resources. In fact, implementing this bill will ultimately improve the rangelands across the west.  Controversy and confrontation on grazing of the public lands have been raging for years. It is clear that changes in current grazing laws and regulations are not only long overdue, but are absolutely necessary in order to resolve many of the grazing issues. H.R. 2493 makes these needed changes.  For example, this bill will bring economic stability to those ranchers who use Federal land for grazing while at the same time generate additional revenue for the Federal Treasury. This will be accomplished by implementing a new grazing fee formula which is easy to understand, simple to track, and which charges a fair price to the rancher who buys access to forage from the Federal Government.  Furthermore, the changes found in H.R. 2493 will improve rangeland conditions by increasing the focus on science-based monitoring. For far too long and for a variety of excuses the Federal Government simply hasn't done its job in assessing rangeland condition through monitoring. Congressman Smith's bill puts the emphasis back to what actually exists on the ground through a monitoring program that is science-based and which follows established protocols. This program will greatly enhance the decisionmaking process and help establish rangeland goals that are good for the land and achievable.  Moreover, H.R. 2493 will establish a program of management flexibility to those ranchers who have demonstrated good land stewardship. This will help to keep the grazing lands in good and excellent condition.  This is a good bill whose time has come. It does nothing to harm the environment. In fact, it will improve rangelands across the West. It treats the Western land grazer honestly and fairly. And in return, the U.S. Treasury makes more money and gets an improved rangeland resource.  I urge all my colleagues to support and vote for H.R. 2493.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1100
