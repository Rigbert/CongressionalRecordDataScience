I ask unanimous consent to add to Senator Daschle's request an amendment to the same bill relative to unemployment insurance benefits, which had 57 votes and 3 absentees who are present today, a sufficient number that it be included in this unanimous consent request. It is an effort to improve and increase unemployment insurance benefits by $25 a week to try to keep up with the cost of inflation but, more importantly, to cover temporarily displaced workers as well as expand coverage to low-wage and recent hires. This money is all Federal money going to the States. Governors have entire discretion as to whether or not they want to enhance the unemployment insurance benefits.  I ask unanimous consent to amend the request of the Senator from South Dakota, our majority leader, to include this amendment, which I now send to the desk.
