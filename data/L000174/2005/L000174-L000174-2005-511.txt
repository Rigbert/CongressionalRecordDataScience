In some States it is a crime. In Texas, for example, it is a third degree felony. It is a serious dereliction of a lawyer's duty. It is a commonplace of American jurisprudence that no one is above the law. If the American people are to have confidence in our system of laws that must include the lawyers, and beyond question, it must include the judges. I continue to be disappointed by Mr. Griffith's unwillingness to do what is now long overdue: namely, to take the Utah bar exam and become properly licensed to practice law in Utah, where Mr. Griffith has been practicing law for the last 5 years.  Despite the evident controversy surrounding his practice of law in Utah for 5 years without becoming a member of the Utah bar, he appears to have comfortably and conveniently placed himself above the law. That is not something I look for in lifetime appointments to the Federal courts. For a court that decides some of the most important issues of law in our Nation, where the ruling in just one case can affect millions of people in the most critical areas of their lives, the President has chosen to send us a nominee whose disregard for the rules that apply to him is simply unacceptable.  Over the months that this nomination has been pending before us we have done a good deal of investigation into this matter on a bipartisan basis. The committee investigators questioned the nominee, spoke to officials and experts at the D.C. bar and the Utah bar, asked for and received correspondence and other documents relating to Mr. Griffith's bar memberships and worked to understand the facts and circumstances surrounding the two situations. Having reviewed all of this information and studied Mr. Griffith's many answers, I have come to the inescapable conclusion that he feels he cannot be bothered to live up to the laws that apply to everyone else.  I will begin with the D.C. bar dues problem. In his initial description of this problem Mr. Griffith did his best to downplay it, telling the committee in his questionnaire that his membership in the D.C. bar ``lapsed for non-payment of dues . . . due to a clerical oversight.'' At the committee hearing on his nomination, he tried to do the same, telling us that from the time he first began practicing law in North Carolina, and continuing through the time he practiced with a firm in D.C., he counted on his law firm to pay his bar dues. He went on further to say that when he took the job as Senate legal counsel he discovered the Government does not pay your professional fees. Here, I quote his testimony, where he told us: ``[W]hen I learned that the Senate wouldn't pay, I notified the D.C. bar to send the bar notices to my home, where I pay personal bills. They did so in '95, '96 and '97, and every time they sent a notice, I paid.''  The only problem arose, according to Mr. Griffith, in 1998, when, for reasons he cannot explain, the D.C. bar suddenly stopped sending him mail. He says he never received his bill for the 1998 dues year, does not remember receiving any of the follow-up notices the bar routinely sends, and simply forgot about his obligation until 3 years later, when he was seeking a certificate of good standing from the D.C. bar.  All of this may seem relatively harmless but a more serious problem arises because what Mr. Griffith told us and what he testified to is not entirely true, it was not the whole truth. For example, his membership in the D.C. bar did not just lapse when he failed to pay his dues in 1998, it was actually suspended. That means for the 3 years the suspension lasted, he was not legally allowed to practice in reliance on his D.C. law license. And he was not only suspended once from the D.C. bar, he was suspended twice, once in 1998 for not paying his dues at all, and also the year before, in late 1997. Furthermore,we have also learned that while he managed to avoid suspension in 1996, he paid his bar dues late that year, as well. Contrary to his misleading testimony at his hearing, it seems that the only year Mr. Griffith actually paid his D.C. bar dues on time, after coming to the Senate in 1995, was in 1995. Two suspensions from the practice of law in 2 years, 3 late or nonexistent payments in 4 years, and an attempt to mischaracterize this embarrassing record are hardly just a single ``administrative oversight'' unless by that Mr. Griffith means to indicate that his single admitted error is that he does not comply with the law.  What may be more disturbing than Mr. Griffith's failure to pay his D.C. dues, for whatever reason, is his lack of concern about the implications of having practiced law in D.C. without proper licensure. When I asked him if he had notified his clients from the period he was suspended, whether he had told his partners or even the law firm's liability insurance carrier, he brushed me off, telling me that his membership in good standing was reinstated once he paid his dues. Of course, that ignored my real question about the ramifications of having been suspended for 2 separate periods totaling more than 2 years. Clients should be notified, partners should be told, and courts should be contacted.  The Department of Justice apparently agrees that suspension for failure to pay bar dues is a serious matter. Recent newspaper reports disclosed that the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility takes such a matter seriously enough to have opened an investigation into the case of a longtime career attorney there who, like Mr. Griffith, was suspended from the D.C. bar because he did not pay his dues. Unlike Mr. Griffith's case, the Department is concerned enough about such a suspension that they filed notices with the courts in every case this attorney worked on during the period of his suspension, notifying them that he was not authorized to practice at the time. This may impact the matters that Government attorney was supervising, which included the treatment and proper compensation of black farmers. Practicing law without a license is a serious matter.  The facts surrounding Mr. Griffith's membership, or lack thereof, in the Utah bar are even more disturbing. Thomas Griffith began his service as assistant to the president and general counsel of BYU in the summer of 2000. At that time he was not a member of the Utah bar, he was suspended from membership in the bar of the District of Columbia, and he was an inactive member of the North Carolina bar. He apparently did not have a valid license to practice from any jurisdiction.  According to BYU, its general counsel ``is responsible for advising the Administration on all legal matters pertaining to the University.'' In addition:       All contracts, other legal documents and legal questions      pertaining to the University or its personnel shall be      presented to the Office of General Counsel or its staff      members as directed for approval and/or recommendation. The      General Counsel directs and manages all litigation involving      the University and decides when to engage outside counsel and      the terms and duration of outside counsel's representation.      The General Counsel delegates the University's legal work      among the lawyers in the office and supervises the work of      the office.     --https://bronx.byu.edurystlife/prod/Handbook/University/     Organization/President.html  Mr. Griffith gave us a similar description of his duties, telling the committee:       When University policy involves legal matters, I advise the      President's Council and its members on the legal issues      implicated . . . In addition, I supervise the work of the      Office of the General Counsel, which includes interpreting      University policy, participating in transactions involving      the University and outside entities, overseeing litigation,      assuring compliance with law, and coordinating activities      with other University offices whose work involves legal      issues such as human resources, risk management, and internal      audit.     --Responses of Thomas B. Griffith to the Written Questions of      Senator Russell D. Feingold, Dec. 3, 2004, Q.1.  But Utah law prohibits the practice of law in Utah by any person not ``admitted and licensed to practice law within this state.'' Rule 5.5 of the Utah Rule of Professional Conduct holds that, ``[a] lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction.''  So, what made Mr. Griffith think he could practice law and not be a member of the Utah bar? Mr. Griffith testified to the committee that, ``it was my understanding that in Utah in-house counsel need not be licensed in Utah, provided that when legal advice is given, it is done so in close association with active members of the Utah bar.'' When I asked him in writing to explain how he came to that understanding, and to point out which Utah laws or bar rules might apply, Mr. Griffith told us only that this, ``understanding was formed over the course of the years of practicing law and as I had interacted with in-house counsel in a variety of settings including other Utah in-house counsel who were not members of the Utah bar.''  Mr. Griffith testified that he relied on an in-house counsel exception that does not exist in Utah statutes and is not recognized by the Utah Supreme Court, as Mr. Griffith was forced to concede. It was a most convenient and self-serving excuse. There is no such ``general counsel'' exception in Utah and there never has been. He could not point to any Utah statute or Utah Supreme Court pronouncement allowing this behavior because it does not exist as a matter of law. Moreover, his predecessor at BYU and the general counsels of the other universities in Utah are all members of the Utah bar.  Previously, in his April 2003 letter to John Adams, then the president of the Utah bar, Mr. Griffith explained the matter differently and relied specifically on a former BYU general counsel and on unnamed persons at the Utah bar, saying that, ``I was told by my predecessor that the Utah bar had created'' what he referred to as a ``general counsel exception'' and that ``I didn't need to become a member of the Utah bar to perform my responsibilities. Subsequent conversations with people in your office as well as discussions with other general counsel around the state confirmed that understanding.''  Mr. Griffith has never been able to identify who at the Utah bar he claims advised him that he did not need to join the bar. This fundamental refusal to abide by the law is all the more troubling by Mr. Griffith's obstinate behavior in refusing to take the bar in order to cure his failure. This is not complicated: Get licensed. Indeed, during the course of committee consideration he admitted that when he asked a second-year law student to research the matter she came back to him and advised that he should take the bar. Yet here we are, with the Senate being urged to confirm someone to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge on a court with jurisdiction over important cases that can have nationwide impact and that nominee has adamantly refused to follow legal requirements in his own legal practice.  Mr. Griffith did respond for the first time in his December 3, 2004 answers to some of our written questions that he had spoken to Bar President Adams in March 2002. But in his answers, Mr. Griffith reported the subject of that conversation was whether or not, in order to join the bar, he would need to take the bar examination, rather than whether or not he needed to become a bar member in the first place. Mr. Griffith explained to the committee that he took Mr. Adams' silence on the unasked question to be an endorsement of his self-serving position that he did not need to be a member of the Utah bar to carry out his responsibilities at the University.'' To Mr. Griffith, Mr. Adams' silence on this unarticulated question apparently overrode all of the rules of the Utah bar and the laws of the State of Utah.  There was one official representative of the Utah bar who told Mr. Griffith in no uncertain terms what to do; namely, take the Utah bar examination. Asked by Mr. Adams to respond to the April 10, 2003 letter, Katherine Fox, Utah bar general counsel, wrote to Mr. Griffith on May 14, 2003, telling him she was ``surprised'' he thought there was a general counsel exception, and explaining that in his circumstances there was no way to waive into the Utah bar and become a member without taking the bar exam. In her letter, and in plain, simple-to-understand words, Ms. Fox instructed Mr. Griffith to take the bar examination at the earliest opportunity. Ms. Fox wrote Mr. Griffith: ``You are fortunate, however, to have aviable option remaining, i.e., admittance by examination and I would encourage you to start preparing your application as soon as possible.'' In addition, she ``strongly'' encouraged him to, ``review [his] current duties,'' and to either limit his work to non-legal practice or, if legal activities were unavoidable in the interim until he could pass the exam, be admitted to the Utah bar and cure his deficiency, ``to closely associate with someone who is actually licensed here and on active status.'' She closed by reminding him that the character and fitness portion of the evaluation of prospective members of the Utah bar could be affected by ``[p]racticing law without a Utah license.'' I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Griffith's letter to the Utah bar and Katherine Fox's response be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                                               Utah State Bar,                               Salt Lake City, Utah, May 14, 2003.     Thomas B. Griffith,     Assistant to the President, Office of the General Counsel,          Brigham Young University, Provo, UT.       Dear Mr. Griffith: I have been provided with a copy of your      letter dated April 10, 2003 and would like to respond on      behalf of the Bar to a few issues which you raised. First, I      was somewhat surprised that you were informed by your      predecessor at Brigham Young University's Office of General      Counsel and perhaps others that Utah had created a ``general      counsel rule exception.'' As you are now aware from speaking      with Joni Dickson Seko, the Bar's Deputy General Counsel in      charge of admissions, Utah does not have and has never had      such a rule. Second, although we were optimistic that the      Utah Supreme Court would approve the proposed reciprocity      rule, there was no guarantee that it would happen or that the      rule would emerge in the format we submitted.       It is unfortunate that you anticipated relying on the rule      without having an understanding of the restrictions it      imposed. However, I know of no other jurisdiction where a      reciprocity rule has no conditions or restrictions such as a      years of practice requirement. For instance, North Carolina's      reciprocity rule requires applicants to have been physically      practicing law elsewhere for at least four out of the last      six preceding years.       Your reading of the new reciprocity rule is accurate and      admission to the Utah State Bar requires a minimal number of      years of active practice in the reciprocating jurisdiction.      As both Ms. Seko and her assistant Christy Abad have informed      you, the Rules for Admission do not provide for Bar staff or      our governing body, the Board of Bar Commissioners, to make      any exceptions to uniform application of the rules. If an      applicant seeks a waiver of a rule it can only be granted      by the Utah Supreme Court through a petition. This route,      however, historically has not proven very fruitful for      those seeking waivers. See, e.g., In re Larry Gobelman, 31      P.3d 535 (Utah 2001).       You are fortunate, however, to have a viable option      remaining, i.e., admittance by examination and I would      encourage you to start preparing your application as soon as      possible. The application is an extensive one and it takes      time to complete including making arrangement for the      necessary supporting documentation. While I know you spoke      with Joni about your inability to meet the May 1st deadline,      I wanted you to realize that the final (and again, non-     waivable) deadline (with a $300 late fee) is December 1st for      the February 2004 exam. Earlier deadlines are October 1st (no      late fee) and November 1st ($100 late fee).       Finally, while I regret any misunderstandings or      assumptions that may have occurred, I also would strongly      encourage you to carefully review your current duties as      Assistant to the President in the Office of General Counsel.      As noted above, we have no general counsel exception rule      allowing individuals who serve in such positions to actually      practice law without Utah licensure. Towards that end, it      would be a prudent course of action to limit your work to      those activities which would not constitute the practice of      law. If such activities are unavoidable, I strongly urge you      to closely associate with someone who is actually licensed      here and on active status. Finally, just so you know, all      applicants are required to undergo a character and fitness      assessment prior to being permitted to take the examination.      Practicing law without a Utah license has been an issue for      some applicants in the past and has resulted in delayed      admission or even denial.           Very truly yours,                                                 Katherine A. Fox,     General Counsel.                                  ____                                    Office of the General Counsel,                                     Brigham Young University,                                      Provo, Utah, April 10, 2003.     John Adams,     President, Utah Bar Association, c/o Ray Quinney & Nebeker,          South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah.       Dear John: I need your advice. When I moved to Utah to      accept the position of Assistant to the President and General      Counsel of Brigham Young University, I was told by my      predecessor that the Utah Bar had created what he referred to      as a ``general counsel exception'' and that I didn't need to      become a member of the Utah Bar to perform my      responsibilities. Subsequent conversations with people in      your office as well as discussions with other general counsel      around the state confirmed that understanding. I have,      however, always been active in bar associations where I have      practiced--Washington, DC and North Carolina--and I      determined that I wanted to be admitted to the Utah Bar. To      that end, I prepared to take the bar exam last summer. During      the course of preparing my application materials, I learned      that the Utah Supreme Court was then actively considering the      reciprocity rule that it has only recently adopted. In      discussions with the Utah Bar Association (maybe even you--my      memory is not entirely accurate on this point), I was advised      that the conventional wisdom was that the Court would in fact      promulgate a reciprocity rule. For that reason, I suspended      my preparations and did not submit my application nor take      the bar exam last summer.       I have now read the reciprocity rule recently adopted by      the Court and. as far as I can tell, it may not be helpful to      me. The requirement that an applicant for admission under the      reciprocity rule has been practicing law in the jurisdiction      from which he or she is seeking reciprocity for three of the      last four years is a bar to me inasmuch as I have been in      Utah and not practicing in Washington, D.C. or North Carolina      for the last two and one-half years. I am writing you to see      if there might be some interpretation of which I am unaware      that would allow me to be admitted to the Utah Bar without      taking the exam. If there is not, I will prepare to take the      bar exam next summer.       I look forward to hearing from you.           Sincerely,                                               Thomas B. Griffith,                                                  General Counsel.
