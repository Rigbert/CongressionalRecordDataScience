Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to make the point that this is an authorization that the level of spending will actually be determined by the Appropriations Committee, not ours.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a news release from the EPA making the point from Administrator Wheeler:       ``As this report details, the DERA program is an effective      and innovative way to improve air quality across the country      while providing children with safer, more reliable      transportation to and from school,'' said EPA Administrator      Andrew Wheeler.       Nearly 10 million older diesel engines are operating      throughout our transportation system.       DERA has led to cleaner air across the U.S. by reducing      emissions:       472,700 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxides.       15,490 tons of particulate matter.       17,700 tons of hydrocarbon.       5,089,170 tons of carbon dioxide.                         [From EPA, 7/25/2019] News Releases from Headquarters, Air and Radiation (OAR) EPA Report:          Clean Diesel Grants Rack up Major Air, Health Benefits                         (By EPA Press Office)       Washington (July 25, 2019)--Grants to clean up or replace      older diesel engines under the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act      (DERA) have delivered significant health and environmental      benefits to communities across America, according to a U.S.      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report released today.      DERA, a bipartisan effort authorized by Congress, provides      cost-effective reductions of harmful diesel pollution across      the U.S. and particularly in areas where air quality is a      concern.       ``As this report details, the DERA program is an effective      and innovative way to improve air quality across the country      while providing children with safer, more reliable      transportation to and from school,'' said EPA Administrator      Andrew Wheeler. ``Children's health is a top priority for      EPA, and DERA helps fulfill our children's health agenda and      commitment to ensure all children can live, learn, and play      in healthy and clean environments.''       Nearly 10 million older diesel engines are operating      throughout our transportation infrastructure with no modern      emissions controls. While some of these will be retired over      time, many will remain in use, polluting America's air for      the next 20 years. The DERA program provides rebates and      grant funding to replace these vehicles and engines with      equipment that meets or exceeds current emissions standards.       DERA has led to cleaner air across the U.S. by reducing      emissions:       472,700 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxides.       15,490 tons of particulate matter (PM).       17,700 tons of hydrocarbon.       5,089,170 tons of carbon dioxide.       Since 2008, DERA has awarded $629 million in funding to      replace or retrofit 67,300 legacy diesel engines. EPA      estimates that reducing these harmful pollutants will lead to      $19 billion in health benefits and 2,300 fewer premature      deaths. EPA estimates that for every federal dollar spent,      DERA projects generate between $11 and $30 in public health      benefits and over $2 in fuel savings.       The DERA program works to reduce exposure and provide      improved air quality in communities where air pollution is of      concern, including those near ports, rail yards, and PM and      ozone non-attainment areas. Sixty-four percent of projects      awarded in fiscal year 2008-2016 were in areas with these air      quality concerns.       The Fourth Report to Congress summarizes the program's      accomplishments from fiscal year 2008-2013 and discusses      final and estimated results from funding in fiscal year 2014-     2016.
