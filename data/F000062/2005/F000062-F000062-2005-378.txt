 President, I thank the Democratic leader and Senator Inhofe for this courtesy.  I don't think there is a Member of this body who hasn't gone to an event, made a speech, answered a question, advocated a cause, who hasn't said: Oh, I wish I had done it differently. I don't think there are any of us who haven't awoken the next morning and said: Gee, I really meant it, and I am sure it is going to be taken out of context, or they are going to think I meant this or that. I don't think there are any of us who haven't sometimes written letters to correct what we have said.  We know Dick Durbin. We know he is patriotic. We know he cares about the men and women serving. And we know that he would do nothing to ever mean anything to the contrary.  I was very much taken by his remarks. More importantly, I was taken by the emotion behind the remarks. We have been having in the Judiciary Committee a legitimate debate on Guantanamo. Hearings have been held. Debate is taking place. That is healthy. That is what this system is all about. Senator Durbin has played a role in that debate. I hope, too, that this will mark the end of it.  I thank, too, the Senator from Arizona for what he said. No one has a more distinguished military record than he. I also hope that everyone who has heard Senator Durbin tonight recognizes his sincerity and his depth of concern. Let this be the end of it.
