  I felt obliged, as Teddy Roosevelt said, to speak the truth about the President.  Let me quote him once more.  Some of my colleagues may not have heard me yesterday.  He said it is absolutely necessary that we have full liberty to tell the truth about the President and his acts.       Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and      servile.       To announce that there must be no criticism of the      President . . . is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is      morally treasonable to the American public . . .       It is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or      unpleasant, about him than about anyone else.  I quoted yesterday from another great President, also named Roosevelt. Franklin D. Roosevelt. He said,       The Presidency is not merely an administrative office . . .       It is more than an engineering job . . .       It is pre-eminently a place of moral leadership.  That is why it is important to reflect on this issue.  I speak about the moral leadership issue because I believe it is critical.  Because it is lacking.  I make a distinction between leadership and moral leadership.  Leadership means the capacity for exercising responsible authority.  There are many in this body who are outstanding leaders.  This is reflected in the many important laws we write for the Nation.  Moral leadership is different.  Moral leadership means we do not just pass laws for the rest of the Nation, and exempt ourselves.  It means we pass laws and we apply them to ourselves, as well.  We set the example.  We say one thing, and we do it, too.  That is what I mean by moral leadership.  This Congress, for example, in one of its very first deeds, passed the Congressional Accountability Act.  In doing so, for the very first time we applied the laws to ourselves that we passed for the rest of the country.  That is moral leadership, Madam President.  That is setting an example.  It says, ``Watch what we do, not just what we say.''  It is not often that Congress is able to exhibit moral leadership.  We do things more by consensus and compromise.  The reality of Congress is, we usually do things ugly.  Foreigners always have the best observations about our form of government. de Tocqueville, of course, is the most famous example.  But a Russian visitor, Boris Marshalov, once observed, ``Congress is so strange. A man gets up to speak and says nothing. Nobody listens--and then everybody disagrees.  Madam President, that's precisely why leadership from the White House is so important.  The individuality of the President is required to provide the moral leadership for the Nation that Congress, as a body, cannot.  The country desperately needs it.  That is what Franklin Roosevelt was talking about.  Yesterday, I talked about why the White House has covered up all its non-legal activities, on both Whitewater and Travelgate.  It is because the activity of those in the White House conflicts with their projected image.  In the words of syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, it is ``political duplicity * * * The offense is hypocrisy of a high order. Having posed as our moral betters, they had to cover up. At stake is their image.''  Yesterday, I referred to and quoted from the new book by James B. Stewart, ``Blood Sport.''  The book reveals much about the Clintons to which Mr. Krauthammer alluded. Mr. Stewart raises several questions about the Clintons.  One is about their willingness to abide by the same standards that everyone else has to meet. A second is about whether they abide by financial requirements in obtaining mortgage loans. A third is whether they should have accepted favors from people who were regulated by the State of Arkansas.  Last week, Mr. Stewart was interviewed by Ted Koppel on ``Nightline.'' In that interview, Mr. Stewart calls this a story about: ``the Arrogance of Power, what people think they can do/and get away with/as an elected official, then how candid and honest they are when questioned about it.''  He offers an illustration. It is a quote from the First Lady. She was advised by White House staff to disclose everything rather than stonewall. Let the Sun shine in, they said. But the First Lady rejected that advice. She said, according to Mr. Stewart, ``Well, you know, I'm not going to have people poring over our documents. After all, we're the President.''  Madam President, I will put the entire interview of Mr. Stewart by Mr. Koppel into the Record.  That way, the Record will reflect the full context of Mr. Stewart's words, so that I am not accused of misleading the American people.  But Mr. Stewart's observations, as well as those of Mr. Krauthammer, heighten the public's awareness of a moral leadership void in the White House.  So I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the interview of Mr. Stewart by Mr. Koppel.  There being no objection, the interview was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From ``Nightline'' Mar. 11, 1996]       Ted Koppel [voice-over]. The Whitewater controversy,      accusations made and denied.       James Stewart [Author, ``Blood Sport'']. Mrs. Clinton,      essentially, took singlehandedly the control of this      investment.       Hillary Clinton. We saw no records, we saw no documents.       Ted Koppel [voice-over]. New questions about the Clintons'      credibility.       James Stewart. I think the death of Vincent Foster is the      pivotal event in this story.       Hillary Clinton. There were no documents taken out of Vince      Foster's office on the night he died.       President Bill Clinton. An allegation comes up, and we      answer it, and then people say, ``Well, here's another      allegation. Answer this.''       James Stewart. The President practically screamed over the      phone. He said, ``I can't take this anymore. I'm here in      Europe and they're asking me about Whitewater.''       Ted Koppel [voice-over]. Now, the picture may become a      little clearer. Tonight, new details about Whitewater, Vince      Foster and damage control.       Announcer. This is ABC News Nightline. Reporting from      Washington, Ted Koppel.       Ted Koppel. This program may be the first you've heard      about ``Blood Sport,'' a new book which becomes available      later this week, but it will not be the last. To begin with,      you need to know how and why the book came about. The idea      appears to have originated with Hillary Clinton. In any      event, it was her close friend, Susan Thomases, herself a      lawyer, who approached the author, Jim Stewart, and suggested      that those closest to the First Family and, indeed, the      President and the First Lady themselves, would be willing to      cooperate with an objective, outside-the-Beltway writer on a      detailed, no-holds-barred Whitewater book.       Stewart, a lawyer and former page one editor of the Wall      Street Journal, had impeccable credentials. He had shared in      a 1988 Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on insider trading.      In 1991, he published the book ``Den of Thieves,'' about      financial fraud in the 1980's. Stewart took up the offer and      even had one lengthy meeting with Mrs. Clinton at the White      House, but the promised cooperation never materialized,      although a number of people close to the Clintons did      ultimately talk. Stewart went ahead and wrote the book      anyway. Jim Stewart is a meticulous writer, which is another      way of saying that there are few blaring headlines, but      dozens of troubling revelations.       To understand what Jim Stewart has done, you need to      refresh your memory on what the Clintons have variously      claimed and insisted. The Clintons have insisted, for      example, that they were only passive investors in Whitewater,      and had virtually nothing to do with it themselves.       Hillary Clinton. We gave whatever money we were requested      to give by Jim McDougal. I mean, he was the one who would      say, ``Here's what you owe on interest, here's what your      contributions should be.'' We did whatever he asked us. We      saw no records, we saw no documents.       Ted Koppel. The Clintons insist that they have fully      cooperated with the investigation of Whitewater, but that      they have been dogged by one unproved allegation after      another.       President Bill Clinton. That's really the story of this for      the last four years. An allegation comes up and we answer it,      and the people say, ``Well, here's another allegation. Answer      this.'' And then, ``Here's another allegation. Answer this.''      That is the way we are--we're living here in Washington      today.       Ted Koppel. And only a couple of weeks ago, after the FDIC      released a report prepared by Jay Stevens, a former      Republican U.S. attorney not known to be friendly toward the      Clintons, there was this.       Mark Fabiani [Associate White House Counsel]. This report      blows out of the water the allegations that have been made      about the First Lady and the Rose Law Firm, and it undermines      the contention of those who would extend these Whitewater      hearings endlessly on into the future.       Ted Koppel. That may be as good a place as any to introduce      Jim Stewart, the author of ``Blood Sport,'' in his first      television interview on the book, and let me have you respond      right away, because the White House is obviously very proud      of the fact that Jay Stevens, Republican, no friend of the      Clintons, supervised a report by the FDIC which, in effect,      according to the White House, found the Clintons blameless in      the--in the Whitewater affair. Is that an overstatement?       James Stewart [Author, ``Blood Sport'']. Well, I think the      White House reaction is misplaced optimism. The report is      good news, as far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far. It      explicitly says that it's not the definitive report on many      of the questions that have arisen here, and there is still an      independent counsel investigating all of these and even more      allegations. As long as the independent counsel investigation      continues, a real threat hovers over this President.       Ted Koppel. Why or how do you explain the fact that Jay      Stevens, who, as I say, has no particular love for the      Clintons, why would he end an investigation if, as you say,      it's incomplete?       James Stewart. He was retained to investigate the narrow      question of whether the government should sue the Clintons or      others to regain losses from Madison Guaranty, and he      concluded there was no evidence to warrant a suit against the      Clintons or the Rose Law Firm to do that, and I think that's      the right conclusion. I do not conclude that Madison Guaranty      losses flowed to the Clintons.       Ted Koppel. What then, do you conclude, that--I mean, try      and give it to me in a broad sense. What is it that you would      say if you were obliged, in 15 or 30 seconds, to summarize      what is troublesome about Whitewater and what will still come      back to haunt the Clintons?       James Stewart. Well, I think the Whitewater investment and      the story of that is important because it shows many things      about the Clintons. It shows their willingness to hold      themselves to the standards that everyone else has to meet.      It shows their willingness to abide by financial requirements      in obtaining mortgage loans. But I think, most of all, it      shows their willingness, while in Arkansas, to accept the      favors of people who were regulated by the state.       Their attitude to this, which bordered on the negligent in      the beginning, clearly indicated a mindset which said,      ``Somebody else will take care of us because of our power as      highly elected officials in the state of Arkansas.''       Ted Koppel. In a sense, Jim, that's a negative way of      saying the same thing we heard Mrs. Clinton say at the      beginning of this broadcast. In other words, let somebody      else take care of this. She put, in a more positive sense,      i.e., ``We had nothing to do with this. If Jim McDougal came      and said, `You owe so-and-so-much in interest,' we paid it,      but we never saw documents, we never had an active role in      this Whitewater affair.'' To which you would say what?       James Stewart. Well, that simply isn't true. I think it may      have been true in the very beginning of the investment, when      there were still high hopes that this would make money and      the McDougals could handle everything, but by 1986, when the      McDougal empire was crumbling, it was not true. At that      point, Mrs. Clinton essentially took, singlehandedly, the      control of this investment. She was the one who negotiated      the loan renewals with the bank that held the mortgage. She      was the one who handled all the correspondence. She was the      one who went over all the numbers. She had possession of all      the records.       Ted Koppel. It is your contention that she vastly inflated      the value of the Clintons' interest in Whitewater.       James Stewart. That's correct.       Ted Koppel. Correct?       James Stewart. As I'm sure anybody who has ever applied for      a mortgage knows, you have to disclose your assets in such a      financial disclosure statement, and there are warnings on      these forms to be honest about this, to be accurate, to be      careful, not to use uncertain judgments, because to inflate      that can be a federal crime. And yet Mrs. Clinton valued      Whitewater at $100,000 on a 1987 financial disclosure      document, right after the bank itself had visited the      property and concluded the most generous estimate for their      half-interest would be $52,000.       Ted Koppel. So when you're talking about a $100,000      evaluation, you're not talking about the value of the whole      property, but the Clinton's half-interest?       James Stewart. They valued their half-interest at $100,000.       Ted Koppel. I ask you this question advisedly, reminding      our viewers that you have some experience as a lawyer. Is      that a crime?       James Stewart. It is a crime to submit a false financial      document. In fact, their partners, the McDougals, are on      trial in Little Rock this week for having submitted false      financial documents to financial institutions. But to prove a      case like that, a prosecutor would have to prove that it was      knowingly a false submission. We haven't heard an explanation      from either Mrs. Clinton or the President about that      document, and that ultimately would be a question for a      prosecutor and a jury to decide.       Ted Koppel. I bring you back, Jim, to what we heard the      President say just a few moments ago, again, at the top of      this broadcast, sort of this--this cry of ``What in heaven's      name are we supposed to do? Somebody makes an allegation, we      respond to the allegation. Somebody makes a new allegation,      we respond to that allegation.'' This sounds like another one      of those allegations. How do you respond to--to what the      President is saying?       James Stewart. Well, I don't think these allegations would      be coming out, or the revelations, in this kind of slow,      drip-by-drip process, if the White House and the Clintons had      been forthright from the beginning, when this first surfaced      in the campaign. Get the story out. They came to me, or they      sent someone to me, allegedly because they wanted to get the      whole story out, and they had been advised at the time--and I      told them the same thing--that to stop these inquiries, get      in front of the story. Tell us what happened, and don't leave      holes in the story. Be complete. Err on the side of      completeness, and if people are bored, they can ignore it.      But that has never been the strategy they have employed.       Ted Koppel. Let's take a short break, Jim. When--we come      back, we will talk about what Vince Foster knew about      Whitewater and a number of other subjects.       [Commercial break.]       Ted Koppel. And back once again with Jim Stewart.       You begin with the suicide of Vince Foster, and clearly      believe that his suicide is pivotal to understanding      everything that's happened to the Clintons in--in subsequent      months and years. Have you reached any conclusion as to why      he committed suicide?       James Stewart. Well, first of all, there was the things      [sic] he enumerated in--in the note that he wrote, and I      think foremost among those was probably his concern about the      handling of the firing of employees in the travel office, but      what I think I can contribute that's new is that there were      things bothering him that were so serious he didn't dare      write them in his note, he didn't confide them to his wife.      He was worried about his marriage. He was very much enmeshed      in what we now know as Whitewater, and he knew of things that      hadn't come to light that could prove embarrassing. He was      concerned about the deterioration of his relationship with      the First Lady, and I think there's a good chance he knew of      the problems that Webster Hubbell was about to face, given      his handling of clients in the Rose firm.       Ted Koppel. When you talk about Web Hubbell, I should point      out, first of all, Vince Foster, Hillary Clinton, Web Hubbell      had all been partners at the--at the Rose Law Firm together.      Web Hubbell then came with the Clintons to Washington, was      briefly the assistant attorney general of the United States,      and you write that in the months before Vince Foster      committed suicide, that he went over to Web Hubbell's house      and went down in the basement to look at what?       James Steward. Well, there were files in Web Hubbell's      basement that had been removed from the Rose Law Firm during      the campaign by Web Hubbell and Vince Foster. Web and Vince,      during the campaign, went through the Rose Firm and removed      anything that they thought might be controversial or create      problems for the campaign, and this including many of the      billing records relating to Hillary Clinton's work for      Madison Guaranty and other matters. And one day Vince Foster      went over and he and Web Hubbell got into the basement, they      went to the boxes, and they went through those materials      looking for these particular files, which they did get and      turn over to the First Lady. But also in those files were      all of this other material, including a lot of the      Whitewater material, bank records from Whitewater, and the      billing records, as I mentioned before.       Ted Koppel. Is it--is it your impression that Vince Foster      then took those billing records to the White House, to his      office?       James Stewart. It's certainly a possibility. I don't know      for sure, and nobody's said they recalled him taking      documents out of the basement. But those documents in the      basement were later all turned over to the Williams and      Connolly firm after they learned that Web Hubbell had all      these documents, and they supposedly turned all those      documents over to Congress. So these records did not surface      there. So that suggests to me that somehow, between their      first being removed from the Rose firm to their being      discovered, they were in Vince Foster's office.       Ted Koppel. Talk to me for a moment about--about      Travelgate, but first of all, let's take a look at something      the First Lady said, I believe in her interview with Barbara      Walters, about the whole Travelgate affair.       Hillary Clinton [``20/20'']. I think that everyone who knew      about it was quite concerned, and wanted it to be taken care      of, but I did not make the decisions, I did not direct anyone      to make the decisions, but I have absolutely no doubt that I      did express concern, because I was concerned about any kind      of financial mismanagement.       Ted Koppel. Mrs. Clinton presents herself in that interview      as exercising a sort of passive role. ``Yes, I may have      expressed some concern about but I certainly didn't initiate      it.'' There is a memorandum by David Watkins, I believe. Tell      the story of that memorandum, because it, of course, suggests      something totally different, but the White House itself      ultimately produced that memorandum and made it available.      Why is that significant?       James Stewart. Well, the facts, as I discovered, on the      travel office affair, are as follows. I learned, before the      production of this memo, that in fact, whatever her own      personal belief about this is, Mrs. Clinton was the first      person to suggest to David Watkins that these people be      replaced.       Ted Koppel. David Watkins being?       James Stewart. He was the head of management in the White      House and was the person in charge of personnel in the White      House, including the travel office.       Ted Koppel. Right.       James Stewart. She was the first one to say to him, ``We      need our people in this office.'' Did she literally say      ``Fire them''? No. But the implication seemed very clear to      him and to everyone else who spoke with her, and that's what      set in motion the chain of events that led to their being      fired.       Ted Koppel. But the--the memorandum that David Watkins      wrote to his own file about all of this, and about falling on      his sword for the First Lady, is a memorandum that the White      House itself, after all, made available. Now, that certainly      puts them in a good light, doesn't it?       James Stewart. Well, I don't think so. First of all, that      memorandum had been under subpoena for a considerable period      of time. The independent counsel, the predecessor to Kenneth      Starr, had subpoenaed that particular document. Meanwhile, I      think the White House was aware that all this information was      soon going to be made public. I have no idea how they found      it, when they did, or why they decided to--to make it public      when they did, but I do know that the week before that, I and      my fact checker were checking the details about the First      Lady's involvement in the travel office affair with the White      House press office, with people in the White House, and had      even faxed them material that dealt with this very subject,      and almost immediately after that the memo itself appeared.       Ted Koppel. What you're suggesting, Jim, is that because      you indicated that something about this was going to be in      your book that they then decided to--to make it public before      it became public in your book?       James Stewart. Well, as I said, I don't know why they did      it. All I can say is, I had all this information in the book,      we were fact-checking this information with the White House,      so the White House knew this information was going to be in      the book and shortly after that the memo appeared. But I'm      sure the White House will say that no, that had nothing to do      with it.       Ted Koppel. Let's take another short break. An inside peek      at the White House damage control operation when we come      back.       [Commercial break.]       Ted Koppel. There was, Jim Stewart, considerable debate      going on within the White House, you discovered, about how      much to reveal, when to reveal it, how cooperative to be, and      at one point there is a--a line that I suspect is going to be      a rather devastating line that the First Lady uttered in      reference to all of this.       James Stewart. Well, you're--you're right. The--there was      internal advice, especially from David Gergen, to turn      everything over, and this was seriously considered until the      First Lady interrupted at one point and said, ``Well, you      know, I'm not going to have people poring over our documents.      After all, we're the President,'' suggesting that, by virtue      of grandeur and power of the office, that they somehow should      not have to endure such an experience.       Ted Koppel. The key questions, I think, ultimately may      become not so much what happened during Whitewater, but what      happened in more recent months, in terms of either covering      things up or not being as forthcoming with information. There      is one story that--that you uncover having to do with the      Paula Jones story, this is the young lady who charged sexual      harassment against then-Governor Clinton, and the--and the      Arkansas state troopers who were then guarding Mr. Clinton.      What is that all about?       James Stewart. Well, I think it's well-known at this point      that the troopers surfaced with some accounts of their      experiences while in the security detail of the governor.      What I think hasn't gotten much attention is that before      these reports were published, and before the troopers      actually made the final decision to reveal what they claim to      know, there was pressure applied to them to try to get them      not to speak out, and I think the most significant example of      this came when the President of the United States himself      called one of these troopers and offered him a federal job.      That trooper subsequently decided not to participate. He was      not one of the troopers who subsequently did tell stories to      anyone, so if the goal of that job offer was to get this      trooper to remain silent, it worked.       Ted Koppel. Is there not one trooper who, in fact, ended up      with a federal job?       James Stewart. The head of the governor's security detail      did end up with a federal job, but the trooper who heard      directly from the president and decided not to participate      did not accept it. He said he didn't--didn't want one of      these jobs, he wanted to stay in Little Rock.       Ted Koppel. Now, again, let me draw on some of your      experience as a lawyer. If, indeed, that could be--that could      be proved true, the charge that you--that you make in your      book, that would be a federal crime, would it not?       James Stewart. Well, that, again, could be a federal crime.      I think the--the issue here is was a job offered explicitly      in exchange for something else?       Ted Koppel. Let me ask you--and I realize this--this may be      the most difficult question I ask you of all--after having      written a book that is 400 pages-plus, how do you--how do you      reduce it to a conclusion as to culpability, lack of      culpability, whether this is a story that has just been      blown way out of proportion, whether it is simply being      kept alive for partisan reasons now and is--is doomed to      do so for the rest of this year because there is a      presidential election and because, you know, for the      Clintons, the unfortunate timing that your book is coming      out right now--how do you summarize everything you've      learned?       James Stewart. Well, my interest is not partisan, and my      interest is not narrowly was a law broken. I think to sum up      the whole book is a study in the acquisition and wielding of      power, and in the end, it's a study of the arrogance of      power, what people think they can do and get away with as an      elected official, and then how candid and honest they are      when questioned about it. I think that is what it reveals, I      think, most significantly about the Clintons.       Ted Koppel. And--and to those who say, has all of this      investigation, the congressional investigations, the      independent prosecutors, the time that you have spent in      putting this book together, you know, was the--was it all      worth all the money and the time and the effort and the pain?       James Stewart. I think, in the end, we'll find that it was,      that the truth is important in our society, that justice is      important in our society. I don't think you can put a price      tag on those things. Yes, it's terribly expensive, and at      times it seems very wasteful, and at times it's nasty and      it's partisan. It often is a blood sport, as Vince Foster      said. But why is that? It's 'cause the truth was never      honored in the first place, and I hope if there's any lesson      that comes out of that, that people in the future will      recognize that.       Ted Koppel. Jim Stewart, thank you.       I'll be back in a moment.       [Commercial break.]       Ted Koppel. The controversy over ``Blood Sport'', this      book, will be the subject of a segment on ``Good Morning      America'' tomorrow.       That's our report for tonight. I'm Ted Koppel in      Washington. For all of us here at ABC News, good night.
