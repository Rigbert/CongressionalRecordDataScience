Mr. Speaker, there is a Member of this Congress, a Republican, who has told one of his colleagues that he ``trusts Hamas more than he trusts our own Government.'' That is an outrageous and morally repugnant statement, Mr. Speaker.  Hamas is a terrorist organization that targets, maims, and kills innocent men, women, and children. Which Member of Congress thinks they can trust that sick and twisted group more than our own Government. Whoever believes this doesn't deserve the right and privilege to serve in this Congress.  Mr. Speaker, this anonymous Republican Member has disgraced him or herself and cast a cloud over the entire Congress. The Members and the American people deserve an explanation and an apology.  Who among you? Who among you believes such a thing? Step forward and explain yourself. The American people are watching and waiting. For shame, Mr. Speaker, for shame.                          ____________________
