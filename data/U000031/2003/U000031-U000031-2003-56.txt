Chairman, the final proviso under the heading ``Federal Trade Commission salaries and expenses,'' page 84, line 15 through 85, line 3 of the bill violates clause 2 of rule XXI of the rules of the House prohibiting legislation on appropriations bills.  This provision bans commissioners and employees of the FTC to accept payment or reimbursement of a non-Federal entity for travel and related expenses, and would apply towards travel to a convention, conference, or meeting. The only exception provided for in the bill is if the person or corporation paying is an organization exempt from taxation pursuant to 501(c)(3) of the IRS code of 1986.  In short, this language clearly constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2, rule XXI of the rules of the House, because it changes current law, and I insist on my point of order.
