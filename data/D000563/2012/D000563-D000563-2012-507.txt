At the suggestion of the chairman of the committee, Senator Lieberman, as well as ranking members, we have modified the amendment. The sum total of its change would be for those limited facilities which have been found since the year 2006 to be efficient. Before they could be closed, the postal service would have to call on the U.S. Postal Service's inspector general to conduct an audit to find that the previous findings have been terminated and are no longer valid.  That is the only change that was recommended by the committee and the staff, and I have added that modification to the amendment.
