President, I would like to comment. We have a sizable Ukrainian-American population in Illinois, particularly Chicago, that followed this election closely. My son lives in a section known as Ukraine Village, and the neighborhood was covered with orange ribbons in support of the newly elected president. So I am happy to join in passing this resolution.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Illinois.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
