President, I was pleased to join Senator Specter and Senator Dodd in offering an amendment to restore the Great Writ of habeas corpus, a cornerstone of American liberty since the founding of this Nation. Senator Specter and I introducedthis legislation late last year and reintroduced it on the first day of this new Congress. This amendment continues our efforts to amend last year's Military Commissions Act, to right a wrong and to restore a basic protection to American law. This is an issue on which we continue to work together and urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to join with us.  As Justice Scalia wrote in the Hamdi case: ``The very core of liberty secured by our Anglo-Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom from indefinite imprisonment at the will of the Executive.'' The remedy that secures that most basic of freedoms is habeas corpus. It provides a check against arbitrary detentions and constitutional violations. It guarantees an opportunity to go to court, with the aid of a lawyer, to prove one's innocence. This fundamental protection was rolled back in an unprecedented and unnecessary way in the run up to last fall's election by passage of the Military Commissions Act.  The Military Commissions Act eliminated that right, permanently, for any noncitizen determined to be an enemy combatant, or even ``awaiting'' such a determination. That includes the approximately 12 million lawful permanent residents in the United States today, people who work and pay taxes in America and are lawful residents. This new law means that any of these people can be detained, forever, without any ability to challenge their detention in Federal court--or anywhere else--simply on the Government's say-so that they are awaiting determination whether they are enemy combatants.  I deeply regret that Senator Specter and I were unsuccessful in our efforts to stop this injustice when the President and the Republican leadership insisted on rushing the Military Commissions Act through Congress in the weeks before the recent elections. We proposed an amendment that would have removed the habeas-stripping provision from the Military Commissions Act. We fell just three votes short in those politically charged days. It is my hope that the new Senate and new Congress will reconsider this matter, restore this fundamental protection and revitalize our tradition of checks and balances.  This amendment to the 9/11 Commission bill provides the right time and the place for the Senate to make this stand. The 9/11 Commission bill seeks to make us stronger and to protect us from the threat of terrorism. Protecting our values and the safeguards that make us a strong democracy is key to that effort. Restoring our place as an example to the world of liberty and the rule of law will only increase our security and undermine those who would seek to recruit terrorists.  Giving the Government such raw, unfettered power as the Military Commissions Act did should concern every American. Last fall, I spelled out a nightmare scenario about a hard-working legal permanent resident who makes an innocent donation to, among other charities, a Muslim charity that the Government secretly suspects might be a source of funding for critics of the United States Government. I suggested that, on the basis of this donation and perhaps a report of ``suspicious behavior'' from an overzealous neighbor, the permanent resident could be brought in for questioning, denied a lawyer, confined, and even tortured. Such a person would have no recourse in the courts for years, for decades, forever.  Many people viewed this kind of nightmare scenario as fanciful, just the rhetoric of a politician. It was not. It is all spelled out clearly in the language of the law that this body passed. In November, the scenario I spelled out was confirmed by the Department of Justice itself in a legal brief submitted in a Federal court in Virginia. The Justice Department, in a brief to dismiss a detainee's habeas case, said that the Military Commissions Act allows the Government to detain any non-citizen designated an enemy combatant without giving that person any ability to challenge his detention in court. This is true, the Justice Department said, even for someone arrested and imprisoned in the United States. The Washington Post wrote that the brief ``raises the possibility that any of the millions of immigrants living in the United States could be subject to indefinite detention if they are accused of ties to terrorist groups.''  In fact, the situation is even more stark than The Washington Post story suggested. The Justice Department's brief says that the Government can detain any noncitizen declared to be an enemy combatant. But the law this Congress passed says the Government need not even make that declaration: They can hold people indefinitely who are awaiting determination whether or not they are enemy combatants.  It gets worse. Republican leaders in the Senate followed the White House's lead and greatly expanded the definition of ``enemy combatants'' in the dark of night in the final days before the bill's passage, so that enemy combatants need not be soldiers on any battlefield. They can be people who donate small amounts of money, or people that any group of decision-makers selected by the President decides to call enemy combatants. The possibilities are chilling.  We have eliminated basic legal and human rights for the 12 million lawful permanent residents who live and work among us, to say nothing of the millions of other legal immigrants and visitors who we welcome to our shores each year. We have removed a vital check that our legal system provides against the Government arbitrarily detaining people for life without charge. We may well have also made many of our remaining limits against torture and cruel and inhuman treatment obsolete because they are unenforceable. We have removed the mechanism the Constitution provides to check Government overreaching and lawlessness.  This is wrong. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American. It is designed to ensure that the Bush-Cheney administration will never again be embarrassed by a United States Supreme Court decision reviewing its unlawful abuses of power. The conservative Supreme Court, with seven of its nine members appointed by Republican Presidents, has been the only check on this administration's lawlessness. Certainly the last Congress did not do it. With passage of the Military Commissions Act, the Republican Congress completed the job of eviscerating its role as a check and balance on the administration.  Some Senators uneasy about the Military Commissions Act's disastrous habeas provision took solace in the thought that it would be struck down by the courts. Instead, the first court to consider that provision, a Federal court in the District of Columbia, upheld the provision. The DC Circuit, in a sharply divided 2-1 decision, upheld that ruling, holding that at least the hundreds of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay cannot go to court to challenge their detention. We should not outsource our moral, legal and constitutional responsibility to the courts. We cannot count on the courts to fix our mistakes. Congress must be accountable for its actions, and we should act to right this wrong.  Following the DC Circuit's decision, newspapers and experts from across the country and across the political spectrum have called on Congress to take action. Editorial boards from the Washington Post and the New York Times to the Evansville Courier & Press in Indiana, and the Columbia Tribune in Missouri have called for reversing the MCA's habeas provision. Prominent conservatives like Bob Barr and Bruce Fein, along with Aberto Mora, former Navy General Counsel in the Bush Administration, have echoed this call. I ask that a selection of these editorials be placed in the record.  A group of four distinguished admirals and generals who have served as senior military lawyers argued passionately for fixing this problem in a letter they sent to me earlier this week. They wrote, ``In discarding habeas corpus, we are jettisoning one of the core principles of our Nation precisely when we should be showcasing to the world our respect for the rule of law and basic rights. These are the characteristics that make our nation great. These are the values our men and women in uniform are fighting to preserve.''  Abolishing habeas corpus for anyone who the Government thinks might have assisted enemies of the United States is unnecessary and morally wrong. It is a betrayal of the most basic values of freedom for which America stands. It makes a mockery of the administration's lofty rhetoric about exporting freedom across the globe.  We should take steps to ensure that our enemies can be brought to justice efficiently and quickly. I introduced a bill to do that back in 2002, as did Senator Specter, when we each proposed a set of laws to establish military commissions. The Bush-Cheney administration rejected our efforts and designed a regime the U.S. Supreme Court determined to be unlawful. Establishing appropriate military commissions is not the question. We all agree to do that. What we need to revisit is the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus for millions of legal immigrants and others, denying their right to challenge indefinite detainment on the Government's say-so.  It is from strength that America should defend our values and our Constitution. It takes commitment to those values to demand accountability from the Government. We should not be legislating from fear. In standing up for American values and security, I will keep working on this issue until we restore the checks and balances that are fundamental to preserving the liberties that define us as a nation. We can ensure our security without giving up our liberty. That is what the 9/11 Commission bill aims to do, and that is what this amendment will help to achieve.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following editorials be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 4, 2007]                   Extend Legal Rights to Guantanamo              (By Alberto J. Mora and Thomas R. Pickering)       For more than 200 years, the courts have served as the      ultimate safeguard for our civil liberties. A critical part      of this role has been the judicial branch's ability to      consider writs of habeas corpus, through which people who      have been imprisoned can challenge the decision to hold them      in government custody. In this way, habeas corpus has      provided an important check on executive power. However,      because of a provision of the Military Commissions Act passed      last fall, this fundamental role of the courts has been      seriously reduced.       Habeas corpus--the Great Writ--has been the preeminent      safeguard of individual liberty for centuries by providing      meaningful judicial review of executive action and ensuring      that our government has complied with the Constitution and      the laws of the United States. Habeas review has always been      most critical in cases of executive detention without charge      because it provides prisoners a meaningful opportunity to      contest their detention before a neutral decision maker.       In 2004, the Supreme Court held that the protections of      habeas corpus extend to detainees at Guantanamo Bay, who may      rely on them to challenge the lawfulness of their indefinite      detentions. The court noted that at its historical core,      ``the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of      reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and it is in      that context that its protections have been strongest.''       But the Military Commissions Act eliminates the federal      courts' ability to hear habeas petitions filed by certain      noncitizens detained by the United States at Guantanamo Bay      and elsewhere. Late last month the U.S. Court of Appeals for      the D.C. Circuit upheld this provision and dismissed the      lawsuits filed by many of the Guantanamo detainees.       We fully recognize that our government must have the power      to detain suspected foreign terrorists to protect national      security. But removing the federal courts' ability to hear      habeas corpus claims does not serve that goal. On the      contrary, habeas corpus is crucial to ensure that the      government's power to detain is exercised wisely, lawfully      and consistently with American values. That is why we have      joined with the Constitution Project's broad and bipartisan      group of judges, former members of Congress, executive branch      officials, scholars and others to urge Congress to restore      federal court jurisdiction to hear these habeas corpus      petitions.       The unconventional nature of the ``war on terrorism'' makes      habeas corpus more, not less, important. Unlike what is found      in traditional conflicts, there is no clearly defined enemy,      no identifiable battlefield and no foreseeable end to the      fighting. The government claims the power to imprison      individuals without charge indefinitely, potentially forever.      It is essential that there be a meaningful process to ensure      that the United States does not mistakenly deprive innocent      people of their liberty. Habeas corpus provides that process.       We recognize that the Military Commissions Act still      enables the Guantanamo detainees to have hearings before a      Combatant Status Review Tribunal, which is charged with      determining whether the detainee is in fact an ``enemy      combatant.'' But unlike court hearings, the tribunal hearings      rely on secret evidence, deny detainees the chance to obtain      and present their own evidence, and allow the government to      use evidence obtained by coercive interrogation methods.      While these tribunals have some utility, they cannot replace      the critical role of habeas corpus.       The government has detained some Guantanamo prisoners for      more than five years without giving them a meaningful      opportunity to be heard. The United States cannot expect      other nations to afford its citizens the basic guarantees      provided by habeas corpus unless it provides those guarantees      to others.       And in our constitutional system of checks and balances, it      is unwise for the legislative branch to limit an established      and traditional avenue of judicial review.       Americans should be proud of their commitment to the rule      of law and not diminish the protections it provides. Our      country's detention policy has undermined its reputation      around the world and has weakened support for the fight      against terrorism. Restoring habeas corpus rights would help      repair the damage and demonstrate U.S. commitment to a      counterterrorism policy that is tough but that also respects      individual rights. Congress should restore the habeas corpus      rights that were eliminated by the Military Commissions Act,      and President Bush should sign that bill into law.                                  ____               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 27, 2007]                          Rule of Law Crippled                            (By Bruce Fein)       The Great Writ of habeas corpus is to the rule of law what      oxygen is to life.       The U.S. Court of Appeals imprudently crippled the writ      last week in Lakhdar Boumediene v. Bush (Feb. 20). A divided      three-judge panel declared suspected alien enemy combatants      held indefinitely at Guantanamo Bay may not question their      detentions in federal courts though petitions for writs of      habeas corpus under the Military Commissions Act of 2006      (MCA). Writing for a 2-1 majority, Judge Raymond Randolph      mistakenly endorsed a cramped interpretation of habeas corpus      as though he were addressing a tax exemption in the Internal      Revenue Code.       Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Accordingly, the Great      Writ prevents the president from disappearing political      opponents or the unpopular into dungeons based on his say-so      alone, a frightening power that has earmarked despots from      time immemorial. The writ enables detainees to require the      president to establish the factual and legal foundations for      their detentions before an independent judiciary.       The goal is justice, the end of civil society as James      Madison explained in the Federalist Papers. The president may      be inclined to detain bogus enemy combatants in the war      against global terrorism to inflate public fear and to      justify executive aggrandizements, for example, spying      without judicial or legislative oversight in contravention of      the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. A former      commandant and deputy commandant at Guantanamo Bay have      averred that most of its detainees do not belong there.       The Great Writ does not threaten to release a single      genuine enemy combatant. The burden to defeat the Great Writ      is modest: plausible evidence (far short of proof beyond a      reasonable doubt) that the detainee was implicated in active      hostilities against the United States. In Rasul v. Bush      (2004), the Supreme Court held the federal habeas corpus      statute extended to aliens at Guantanamo. Two years later,      Congress overruled Rasul in the MCA by suspending the Great      Writ for alien enemy combatants detained anywhere. Its      proponents were unable to cite a single habeas case either      before or after Rasul that precipitated the release of an      authentic terrorist. Such a case might be hypothesized with a      fevered enough imagination. But the law would become ``a ass,      a idiot,'' in the words of Charles Dickens' Mr. Bumble, if      required to answer jumbo speculations that never happen in      the real world.       Article I, section 9, clause 2 of the Constitution      (Suspension Clause) declares ``The Privilege of the Writ of      Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless in Cases of      Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.''      Judge Randolph tacitly acknowledged in Boumediene that      neither habeas exception justified the MCA, i.e., global      terrorists have not invaded America. He insisted, however,      that the Great Writ has no application to aliens detained      outside the sovereignty of the United States; and, that      Guantanamo Bay is under the sovereignty of Cuba, albeit      subject to a perpetual United States lease.       The latter observation is risible. Fidel Castro has no more      access or control over Guantanamo than he does over      Washington, D.C., or Des Moines. If Mr. Castro formally      abandoned sovereignty over Guantanamo tomorrow, nothing would      change. Judge Randolph maintained that a declaration by the      political branches in the MCA that Guantanamo is not part of      the United States is conclusive on the courts. But the      dimensions of the Great Writ which defines what we are as a      people should not be so easily contracted by semantic      jugglery.       Judge Randolph observed that historically the Great Writ in      Great Britain was withheld from remote islands, garrisons and      dominions. Compliance with a writ from overseas would have      been impractical because of time limitations for producing      the detainee. But as Chief Justice John Marshall taught in      McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the Constitution was designed      to endure for the ages and     to be construed accordingly to achieve its purposes. Congress      is empowered to create an Air Force, although the      Constitution speaks only of armies and navies. The Fourth      Amendment protects against indiscriminate government      interceptions of e-mails and conversations, although its      language speaks only of persons, houses, papers and effects.      Similarly, the Great Writ should apply to suspected alien      enemy combatants detained abroad unless compliance would be      impractical or unworkable.       No civilized Constitution risks injustice for the sake of      injustice, aside from the folly of creating poster children      to boost al Qaeda's recruitments. The Supreme Court should      grant review of Boumediene and reverse the appeals court.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 23, 2007]                          A Congressional Duty       ON THE FIRST day of the new Congress, two leading senators      announced they would join in an attempt to reverse the hasty      and ill-considered decision of the previous Congress to      deprive foreign prisoners at Guantanamo Bay of the ancient      right of habeas corpus, which allows the appeal of      imprisonment to a judge. One of the senators, Arlen Specter      (R-Pa.), predicted that the courts would rule that the      provision of the Military Commissions Act eliminating habeas      corpus was unconstitutional; he nevertheless joined the      incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick      J. Leahy (D-Vt.), in sponsoring a bill restoring the appeal      right.       Now Mr. Specter's prediction is looking less sure: The U.S.      Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled this week that      Congress's act was constitutional, and it threw the cases of      dozens of Guantanamo detainees out of federal court. That      ruling will almost certainly be reviewed by the Supreme Court      on appeal, but Congress should not wait for its decision. It      should move quickly on the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act.       The Supreme Court has already twice overruled decisions by      the D.C. Circuit denying Guantanamo detainees habeas rights,      but it is hard to predict whether it will do so again. The      court's composition has changed since those rulings, with the      addition of justices more likely to be sympathetic to the      arguments of the Bush administration. Congress has reversed      part of the basis for the court's previous rulings by      enacting a statute saying that persons found to be ``enemy      combatants'' by military review panels, including detainees      held at Guantanamo, have only a limited right of appeal.       The principal remaining question is whether Congress's      action is permitted under Article I, Section 9 of the      Constitution, which says, ``The Privilege of the Writ of      Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended'' except in cases of      ``Rebellion or Invasion.'' Two judges of the three-member      appeals court panel ruled that the provision does not apply      at Guantanamo because it is not on U.S. territory and the      detainees are foreigners. A dissent written by Judge Judith      Rogers pointed out that one of the earlier Supreme Court      rulings stated that giving appeal rights to Guantanamo      inmates ``is consistent with the historical reach of the writ      of habeas corpus.'' But the court has not ruled squarely on      the constitutional issue.       Rather than wait for the court's decision, Congress should      correct its own mistake. The 51 to 48 vote rejecting Mr.      Specter's previous attempt to restore habeas condemned      hundreds of foreign prisoners to indefinite detention without      trial at Guantanamo; only a few score are expected to be      prosecuted by the military commissions. Since 2002 it has      become clear that a number of prisoners at the facility were      arrested in error, are not terrorists and pose no threat to      the United States. Moreover, improvements in the prisoners'      treatment have come about largely because of their court      appeals. Congress has both a practical and a moral interest      in ensuring that this basic human right is restored.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Feb. 22, 2007]                   American Liberty at the Precipice       In another low moment for American justice, a federal      appeals court ruled on Tuesday that detainees held at the      prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, do not have the right to      be heard in court. The ruling relied on a shameful law that      President Bush stampeded through Congress last fall that      gives dangerously short shrift to the Constitution.       The right of prisoners to challenge their confinement--     habeas corpus--is enshrined in the Constitution and is      central to American liberty. Congress and the Supreme Court      should act quickly and forcefully to undo the grievous damage      that last fall's law--and this week's ruling--have done to      this basic freedom.       The Supreme Court ruled last year on the jerry-built system      of military tribunals that the Bush Administration      established to try the Guantanamo detainees, finding it      illegal. Mr. Bush responded by driving through Congress the      Military Commissions Act, which presumed to deny the right of      habeas corpus to any noncitizen designated as an ``enemy      combatant.'' This frightening law raises insurmountable      obstacles for prisoners to challenge their detentions. And it      gives the government the power to take away habeas rights      from any noncitizen living in the United States who is      unfortunate enough to be labeled an enemy combatant.       The United States Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia Circuit, which rejected the detainees' claims by a      vote of 2 to 1, should have permitted the detainees to be      heard in court--and it should have ruled that the law is      unconstitutional.       As Judge Judith Rogers argued in a strong dissent, the      Supreme Court has already rejected the argument that      detainees do not have habeas rights because Guantanamo is      located outside the United States. Judge Rogers also rightly      noted that the Constitution limits the circumstances under      which Congress can suspend habeas to ``cases of Rebellion or      invasion,'' which is hardly the situation today. Moreover,      she said, the act's alternative provisions for review of      cases are constitutionally inadequate. The Supreme Court      should add this case to its docket right away and reverse it      before this term ends.       Congress should not wait for the Supreme Court to act. With      the Democrats now in charge, it is in a good position to pass      a new law that fixes the dangerous mess it has made. Senators      Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Arlen Specter,      Republican of Pennsylvania, have introduced a bill that would      repeal the provision in the Military Commissions Act that      purports to obliterate the habeas corpus rights of detainees.       The Bush administration's assault on civil liberties does      not end with habeas corpus. Congress should also move quickly      to pass another crucial bill, introduced by Senator      Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, that, among other      steps, would once and for all outlaw the use of evidence      obtained through torture.       When the Founding Fathers put habeas corpus in Article I of      the Constitution, they were underscoring the vital importance      to a democracy of allowing prisoners to challenge their      confinement in a court of law. Much has changed since Sept.      11, but the bedrock principles of American freedom must      remain.                                  ____               [From the Columbia Tribune, Feb. 22, 2007]               Enemy Combatants: A Fast Track to Justice       Under the president's shortcut plan for wartime justice,      anyone he labels an ``enemy combatant'' loses normal      constitutional rights. The government denies hundreds of      detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the right to a hearing in      court.       Last year the U.S. Supreme Court declared this denial      unconstitutional. In response, the Bush administration pushed      through Congress the Military Commissions Act authorizing the      use of such commissions instead of courts for hearing these      cases.       This week the District of Columbia appeals court upheld the      new law, a decision certain to be appealed, sending the issue      back to the highest court, where I hope this latest gambit      will be denied.       I suppose President George W. Bush and his crew refuse to      let these prisoners have habeas corpus hearings in the U.S.      court system because they fear the outcome. Why else? And if      so, what does that say about their expectations for the      military commissions? That these extra-judicial bodies will      affirm the government's extralegal detention policies? What      else?       This dogged insistence is but one example of Bush's      eagerness to ignore essential constitutional guarantees,      ranking right up there with his programs of warrantless      wiretapping and other surveillance of U.S. citizens.       Bush simply refuses to go to court for oversight of his      administration's actions in denial of civil rights. Before he      took office, it was simple. When a person is arrested, he has      a right to a real court hearing to determine the legitimacy      of the arrest and his ultimate guilt or innocence. When      citizens' privacy is invaded by government, it is to be done      only with court permission.       We see signs that the American public is getting fed up      with these constitutional shortcuts. These practices alone      are enough to unwarrant this administration. Let us pray the      Supreme Court again slaps them down.                                  ____          [From the Evansville Courier & Press, Feb. 21, 2007]  A Matter of Right: Federal Court Upholds Denial of Habeas Corpus to                        Detainees Outside the U.S       Congress should tear itself away from the pointless      business of passing nonbinding resolutions on Iraq and begin      cleaning up the damage we've done to ourselves in the war on      terror.       That task became more urgent this week when the federal      court of appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the      constitutionality of a provision denying the right of habeas      corpus to detainees held outside the United States.       The Military Commissions Act (MCA) was passed last year,      hastily and without much thought like so much anti-terrorism      legislation, after the Supreme Court told the Bush      administration that it had to get congressional permission      for its plan to try the detainees before military tribunals.       Part of that law banned the detainees at U.S. prisons in      Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Afghanistan from challenging in      civilian courts the legality of their detention. That right      of habeas corpus is a bedrock principle of Anglo-Saxon law      going back eight centuries. It is a fundamental right      enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.       Carving out an exception to that right based on a sketchy      designation as an ``enemy combatant'' was a terrible      precedent, essentially justifying arbitrary imprisonment.       The senior members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Arlen      Specter, R-Pa., and     Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to rectify this departure from      U.S. respect for the rule of law last year and failed by      three votes.       They have reintroduced their bill in the new Congress.       Another bill, by Leahy and Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., would      restore the right of habeas corpus and clean up some other      unfortunate provisions in the MCA by sharpening the      definition of ``illegal combatant,'' excluding evidence      obtained by coercion and allowing military judges to exclude      hearsay evidence.       If the circuit-court ruling stands, the practical effect      would be to force the federal courts to dismiss more than 400      habeas-corpus appeals. The ruling will certainly be appealed      to the Supreme Court, and one hopes that the high court would      stand up for this ancient and fundamental right.       But it would be better if Congress acted first to      demonstrate our faith and confidence in our own system.
