President, as someone who has been concerned about the problem of landmines for nearly two decades, I was heartened when every nation in this hemisphere, except, regrettably, the United States and Cuba, joined the Ottawa Treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. Many of them had experienced the human misery and economic hardship that landmines cause. Today most people in Central and South America can walk in safety thanks to the treaty and thanks to the efforts of the Organization of American States, with assistance from the U.S. Government, to remove the mines in those countries.  Today Colombia is the only country in Latin America where landmines are still being used. They are a persistent problem in almost every department, including some of Colombia's richest coffee-growing areas. According to the 2006 Landmine Monitor report, landmines in Colombia claim an average of three new victims a day. Colombia has the third highest incidence of mine victims in the world, behind only Cambodia and Afghanistan.  In Colombia the mines are used by rebel and paramilitary groups, and they are rudimentary in design. They kill or maim whoever comes into contact with them, whether it is a soldier or a young child. Many of the victims live in remote areas, hours or days from any medical services, so there is a high risk of bleeding to death.  Several initiatives are under way to help Colombia's mine victims with artificial limbs and rehabilitation and vocational services. Among them are the Polus Center for Social and Economic Development, the Colombian Coffee Federation, the OAS, Centro Integral de Rehabilitacion de Colombia, the Observatorio de Minas Antipersonnel, and the Colombian organization TECNOVO.  In addition, the Colombian organization United for Colombia has been working on a shoestring budget, and recently with assistance from the U.S. Government, to bring Colombian soldiers who have been grievously injured from landmines to the United States for reconstructive surgery.  I applaud the efforts of organizations that are working to assist victims of landmines in Colombia.  It is tragic that any of this is necessary. Landmines are inhumane, inherently indiscriminate weapons which should be relegated to the dustbin of history. The FARC rebels and AUC paramilitaries who use mines should be condemned. The use of these weapons is a gross violation of human rights and a crime against humanity.  On December 3, 2007, the world will mark the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Ottawa Treaty. Great progress has been made during the past decade in ridding the world of landmines. Let us hope that those who continue to insist on their right to use these indiscriminate weapons--in Colombia and in other parts of the world including the United States--will finally recognize that too often their victims are innocent people and that this cannot be justified.                          ____________________
