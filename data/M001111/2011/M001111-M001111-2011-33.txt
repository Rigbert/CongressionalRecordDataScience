 President, I would like to take a moment today to recognize W. Todd Grams for his service to our Nation's veterans. Mr. Grams serves as the chief financial officer and executive in charge for the Office of Management at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, where he has led the effort to improve the provision of benefits for our veterans through efficient financial management.  Mr. Grams was recently awarded the prestigious 2011 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Management Excellence Medal from the Partnership for Public Service. The award, also known as a ``Sammy,'' is one of the most important annual awards provided to Federal civil servants who have made a significant contribution to our country. Mr. Grams was recognized for his leadership in integrating and streamlining VA's operations, reducing costs, and improving delivery of services to veterans.  Mr. Grams is a worthy recipient of the Management Excellence Medal. In his role as VA chief financial officer, he has demonstrated not only the courage, but also the creativity and tenacity necessary to help VA maximize value for our veterans. Along with the help of his qualified team, Mr. Grams' initial push for an in-depth analysis of VA's financial management priorities allowed VA to serve veterans with higher quality service and care. He redirected resources to lower the cost and risk for investment for VA. Furthermore, Mr. Grams integrated the management governance structure and established systems that allowed VA to spend money more wisely and improve services to veterans.  I appreciate Mr. Grams' hard work and dedication at VA, and I am so pleased that his extraordinary talents and effort have been recognized.                          ____________________
