 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess for 3 minutes so that the Prime Minister of Australia may be greeted.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 11:10 a.m., recessed and reassembled at 11:13 a.m. when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Nelson of Florida).                          ____________________
