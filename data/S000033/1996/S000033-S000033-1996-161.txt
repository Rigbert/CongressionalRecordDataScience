 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Alison Carpenter, a high school student from Brattleboro, VT, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Children suffer at the hands of adults. They are beaten,      kicked and burned with cigarettes. They are thrown against      walls, scalded by hot water, forced to stand in freezing      showers until they pass out, and thrown into running washing      machines. They are sexual molested: they are the victims of      incest. Child abuse is a serious issue that has existed      throughout history, and it is a major concern in our society      today. It was not until recently that it was recognized as a      medical and social problem.       Child abuse takes many forms: it occurs whenever an adult      inflicts intentional physical, emotional or sexual harm to a      child. There are many steps that are being taken to prevent      all three forms of child abuse, but it will take a long time      to fully eliminate it. The most common form of abuse on      children is physical abuse. There are approximately 200 cases      of physical abuse for every one that is reported, according      to the National Committee for the Protection of Child Abuse.      A child is the victim of physical violence even if the anger      is not directly inflicted on him or her. A witness to      violence is a victim of violence. Children who witness abuse      at home can suffer in unseen ways. Quite often, their pain      goes untreated; they can suffer serious emotional damage.       Children need a large amount of emotional support from      their families. Some elements of emotional support include:      respecting the child's needs, tolerating his or her feelings,      and a willingness to learn from their behavior. Our emotions      are one of our basic powers. Emotional abuse is form of      psychological battering. A child's earliest needs in life are      for a warm, loving person to be there, to mirror, echo and      affirm them. Children need to be prized, and applauded during      their growth achievement. If they do not get this, they will      do whatever they can in order to. These are basic needs.      Children need to be allowed to feel, and to express what they      feel. If a child is controlled compulsively, he or she will      become an adult with a compulsive, controlling and immature      childish side. Some forms of emotional abuse are yelling,      belittling, criticizing, humiliating and comparing a child.       Incest, or sexual abuse, is the most shaming of any form of      violence, because it involves the betrayal of a supposed      loved one. It leaves a long-term effect on the child,      believing it was their fault. It is a violation of the      child's sexuality. Some people believe that children may      simply imagine episodes of sexual abuse. An argument that is      made by psychologists, is that a young child who has not been      molested, has not had the experience of with sex to      be capable of imagining such an experience.       The profile of an abuser tends to be very similar in all      forms of child abuse. An abuser is usually someone who has a      poor self-image; someone who lacks sensitivity to others'      feelings. A person who abuses was most likely abused      themselves, or was deprived of basic parenting. An abuser has      usually had unmet needs for love or comfort, and is in denial      about his or her feelings. Child abuse has a tremendous      impact on victims throughout their entire lives. They tend to      feel helpless and out of control. The victims tend to      dissociate from all of their memories, and begin to feel a      sense of unreality. They may have recurring nightmares, sleep      disorders or flashbacks. As they get older, they tend to      develop split or multiple personalities. They have little or      no interest in anything, trouble completing thought      processes, confusion, and no trust. A girl who has been      abused sexually grows up to believe that she cannot escape      being battered. A boy who has been abused may believe in male      supremacy. Boy victims, more than girls, identify with the      offenders, and sometimes become offenders. This bonding with      abusers is a way to overcome the feeling of helplessness and      powerlessness.       There are many actions that are being taken against child      abuse. Forty-nine States (except for Wyoming), have      established children's trust funds. All of the States have a      Child Protective Service system, which is a government system      that is responsible for investigating reports of child abuse      or neglect. This, however, lacks the resources needed to      respond to overwhelming number of reports. All States also      have a child abuse reporting law, requiring reports of      suspected abuse to be made by specified professionals, or      others whose work brings them in regular contact with      children. There are also family preservation services, that      are working to make it so the child can remain with his or      her family as long as his safety is not endangered. Private      organizations, such as Mothers Against Raping Children and      Mothers of Sexually Abused Infants and Children serve as      support groups, and fight for the rights of children. We Can      Help Ourselves is another organization that teaches children      how to handle abusive sitations.       There are still many things that need to be done to help      prevent the abuse of children. States need to provide even      more services for victims of abuse. They need to look at the      quality of foster care, because it needs to be more than just      giving a child a place to live. People need to be more alert      to possible child abuse cases, and to report them to the      authorities. Those in a position of authority need to      investigate quickly and accurately, and take the first steps      to remove children from abusive situations. We need to bring      offenders to court, and most of all, we need to stop abusing      our children.       Bringing a child into the world is a huge responsibility,      that two people make and     must live with forever. Parenting is not temporary; it is not      something that can be put aside when a person wants a break.      Child abuse is an awful cycle, which travels from generation      to generation. As author John Bradshaw says, ``It is about      the silence of nights spent holding in screams, holding back      tears, holding in one's very self.'' One of the main causes      of child abuse is the lack of education that this country      has. There are so many people who do not know what is morally      right from wrong. Children should be able to look up to their      parents without fearing them. Our society as a whole needs to      work together to stop child abuse.       The first step in this long fight is to educate. Now is not      the time to cut back on education services.       One quote I believe summarizes the issue is, ``If a child      live with criticism, he learns to condemn. If a child lives      with hostility, he learns to fight. If a child lives with      shame, he learns to feel ashamed.'' Thank you.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you, Alison. Alison has touched      on one of the most tragic issues that we as a country face,      and that is that there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands      of little kids and teenagers who are being abused. And as      Alison indicated, that type of abuse has a profound impact on      one's ability to grow up to be a mature adult. Alison, let me      just ask you a couple of questions. Why is it, do you think--     what goes through an adult's mind, a grown-up person's mind      who would abuse a child. What motivates somebody to do that,      do you think?       Answer: I think that an abuser is one who has a lot of      inside pain, and they don't know any other way of handling      their pain, and they take it out on children, because      children don't really fight back. Children, they're the only      thing that they can take it out on, because they . . . don't      have the ability to fight back.       Congressman Sanders: I think . . . that's a very good      answer. Let me ask you another question. Very specifically,      and I know you touched on this a little bit, what can we do      to ameliorate that problem? What do we as a community, as a      society, as a country, how do we address that tragedy?       Answer. I think that the most important thing is to      educate, not only the abusers but the children of abusers, so      that children know that this isn't right; that what they have      been growing up in is not a good situation. Because, quite      often children who are abused grow up to be abusers, because      they don't know any better, and I think we need to educate      them and show them that this isn't the way that our society      should be.       Congressman Sanders: Alison, thank you very much for that      excellent testimony.                          ____________________
