Mr. Speaker, the gentleman indicated that he intends to begin debate on the Iraq supplemental bill on Thursday. Our side would like to know if it would be possible for us to begin that debate, since we are going to be here, on Wednesday, so that every Member, every Member of the Congress will have an opportunity to participate in this debate?  I take particular notice of the fact that when we debated the force resolution that every Member of the Congress, all of us, had an opportunity to participate in that debate.
