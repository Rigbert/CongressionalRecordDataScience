 President, let me again welcome all of our colleagues back. I think they will join me in remembering former Senator Dale Bumpers, who passed away over the holidays.  Some called Dale Bumpers an improbable Senator. Others have remarked on his humor and wit. But what is clear about this former Senate colleague is that he was larger than life in many ways. I am sure his name will continue to be remembered by Arkansans for many years to come. The Senate sends its condolences to the family and friends Senator Bumpers leaves behind.                          ____________________
