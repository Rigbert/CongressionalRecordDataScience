President.  Before he leaves the floor, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for the unanimous consent request that he made that ensured I would have the opportunity to speak now and also to thank him for all that I have learned from him during my first years in the Senate.  It is one thing to take out a book that describes some of the procedures and the rules of the Senate, but it seems to me that there is no better way to learn about the Senate and the very high standards that are so important here than to simply watch the Senator from West Virginia for a few hours on the floor of the Senate.
