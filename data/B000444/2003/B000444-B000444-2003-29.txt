 President, yesterday in my opening statement at a hearing of the Committee on Foreign Relations on anti-Semitism in Europe, I criticized the European Union for not having included in its Brussels summit's so-called ``Presidency Conclusions'' a denunciation of the Malaysian Prime Minister's vile anti-Semitic remarks.  I also recognized that French President Chirac wrote a personal letter to the Malaysian Prime Minister, but I said that I doubted that many Muslims would have access to his criticisms.  This morning, however, I was informed by my friend the French Ambassador that President Chirac's letter had, in fact, been made public.  I am happy to learn this, and I applaud President Chirac for his personal condemnation of the Malaysian Prime Minister's disgusting speech.  This does not, however, change my opinion that the European Union should have included a condemnation in the catalog of external issues delineated in its ``Presidency Conclusions.''  Most importantly, as yesterday's hearing pointed out, it is imperative that both the European Union and the United States resolutely and publicly oppose the cancer of anti-Semitism wherever in the world it raises its ugly head.                          ____________________
