Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his representation. Let me, reclaiming my time, make another observation.  In times past, the defense bill being, for instance, the authorization bill which we passed very quickly a few weeks ago, we had spent 6 days, 7 days on that piece of legislation. This legislation is going to have an extraordinary impact on millions of Americans, and we would hope that there would be sufficient time to debate the bill and, again, substitutes and amendments, so that we could fully air its ramifications to those millions of people, and to Medicare itself.  Obviously, there are different points of view on how to get to where we all want to get, or at least most of us want to get. I think there is a substantial difference on whether or not we want to see a program in a viable, ongoing, healthy Medicare, or whether or not Medicare is eliminated or shrunk very substantially and the private sector is in charge of whether or not to offer such benefits. That is a significant policy difference between us, I think; and it needs to be debated.  So not only would I urge that we be given the amendments and substitutes that we seek, but also the time to develop those amendments and positionson those amendments, as it is appropriate for the American public to understand the perspectives of the parties and of the individuals offering amendments.
