That is what this is all about, to try to get some uniformity. And any time you have a murderer like Roger Dale Stafford, who sat on death row for 15 years after murdering nine Oklahomans in cold blood, it is time that we changed our attitude toward crime and punishment in this country.  I would suggest--and I think perhaps the Senator from Delaware would agree--that when someone is contemplating a crime, and if he thinks the downside is going to be sitting on death row watching TV in an air-conditioned cell for 17 years, that is not much of a deterrent. And that is what I would like to change.
