 President, the Army's Space and Strategic Defense Command has created a promising concept for the integration of the pillars of missile defense. Currently, there are no integrated warfighting scenario simulations available for a comprehensive integration of active defense, passive defense, attack operations and battlefield management. SSDC proposes to make fully operational a battlefield integration center to provide this virtually needed service. Certainly, the gulf war demonstrated that missile defense is not simply missile intercept.  Instead, comprehensive missile defense involves a myriad of activities ranging from the preparation of civilian populations for attack to the active suppression of an enemy's missile capabilities. Without coordination between these elements, we cannot maximize our missile defense capabilities. Increased coordination and integrated battlefield simulations will allow us to fully utilize these capabilities and create far more effective and comprehensive missile defense plans.  In addition, the integration and coordination offered by the BIC is not a distant technology. The computing and communications hardware is already in place that will allow the BIC to create missile defense plans for actual theater and regional conflicts involving U.S. forces. The BIC will instantaneously allow U.S. commanders to download and receive comprehensive missile defense battle plans based upon the existing ground conditions.  The BIC is a cost-effective, immediately available resource that will fill a large void in our missile defense system and I thank the Senate for its support.
