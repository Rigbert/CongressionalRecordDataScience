Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I want to thank the gentleman for recognizing me to claim the other side's opening time.  I would like to salute first my colleague from New Mexico for a fine job under very difficult circumstances.  Mr. Chairman, we all know we are serious about budget deficit reduction, and as we have learned many years ago in the Committee on Appropriations, we deal in the reality of limited funds and unlimited needs. Our subcommittee, like so many others, has tried to fairly balance those two opposing situations. I think we have done a good job, although I will say there are some parts of it that I would like to have seen us do a little better job on.  Most people, when they hear the budget for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, think in terms of farmers and ranchers and do not think about the other major responsibilities of the department.  The gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen] properly noted the responsibility of this department in the area of nutrition. One of the programs that I have focused on in my tenure in the House of Representatives, serving on the subcommittee, is the WIC Program, the supplemental feeding program for women infants and children. It is a program which is designed to help low-income mothers during their pregnancy and, after they have given birth, to raise healthy children.  I happen to think it is one of the single most important investments that U.S. taxpayers make. This program literally reaches and helps 40 percent, 40 percent of the infants in America. We are talking about a program that is essential to make certain that babies are born strong, healthy, with a fighting chance to become productive citizens.  This program, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is a Godsend in many parts of America where, otherwise, pregnant mothers would go without this assistance, counseling, and nutritional advice, and the basic foodstuffs that feed them during their pregnancies. And children, of course, new to the world, in those formative months, need the very best. This program was worked to make sure this happens.  Mr. Chairman, I am happy my colleague from New Mexico shares my dedication to this program. It should be bipartisan. It is a bipartisan program. I think our goal is to reach some 7.6 million, I am not certain of the exact figures as I stand here, by the end of this next fiscal year. And I hope we can do that in a bipartisan fashion.  We are hopeful that what we have done in this bill will provide the necessary funds for WIC to meet its goal of enrollment. I think the subcommittee has spoken informally, and we should put on the record here our commitment to return, if necessary, and ask for additional funds, if needed, to make sure the WIC Program is not underfunded. I hope that it is not.  I believe we have taken care of them, and if that is not the case, then I think there is a general feeling that we must return and make sure that is done.  Mr. Chairman, let me speak about several other items in the bill that I think are important.                              {time}  1615  Agriculture research is often overlooked by people. We have colleagues of ours on the floor of the House who like to stand at these microphones and giggle about the names of some of these ag research projects. The Pink Bull Work project, they giggle. The Boll Weevil Eradication project. The Screw Worm project, and their sides are bursting as they laugh about the names of these projects.  Little do they know that the critical research that is being done in these areas is absolutely essential, not only for the farmers and ranchers involved, but for consumers and environmentalists. Our efforts to eradicate pests that attack cotton in America are essential because that is one of the crops that uses so many ag chemicals. As we find ways to reduce the pests assaulting cotton, we reduce the need for the use of ag chemicals and potential danger from runoff.  So I hope that some of my friends, particularly from the city, who like to get a good belly laugh over some of these ag research programs would be honest enough to take the time, as I have, to understand how important these programs are.  Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that we have had to cut back on ag research. It is an area where we should be spending our money and our investment.  I have to commend the chairman for the $30 million additional in the Food Safety and Inspection Service. Each of us in America takes for granted the safety of meat and poultry and fish and food products that we buy at the grocery store. If we travel to a Third World country, we not only worry about the purity of the drinking water and the safety, but also the safety of the food that is being served to us. Has it been cooked long enough to be safe to eat?  That is usually not a concern in the United States because we have a good Food Safety and Inspection Service. We are in the process of making it dramatically better by moving to new technological ways to measure the danger to consumers and to go after them. This investment of $30 million will help us reach that goal so that the hundreds and sometimes thousands of Americans who suffer from food contamination each year will be protected.  The cutback in funds for soil and water conservation is hurtful, and I hope that we can revisit this at some time in the future to restore some of these funds. It is an essential part of any effort to keep the environment clean, and I can tell my colleagues that our friends who live in rural areas are anxious to be part of that partnership.  These are families that live on farms and drink the water out of wells a fewhundred feet away from the crops that are being planted. They want their water safe in the wells around the farms and they do not want the runoff to endanger the drinking water of any other American.  I also want to say that the rural development funds are down in amount, up in flexibility. We are going to find out whether that works; if we give the department more flexibility in rural development, whether it is in water or sewer development, whether that can overcome a cutback in some funding. When it comes time for budget deficit reduction we often have to make that kind of a choice.  This is a good bill. There are parts of it that I disagree with. That is not unusual. There were parts that I disagreed with when I was Chair of this subcommittee. But we have to bring a bill to the floor that is an honest compromise to achieve the purpose of this subcommittee and this appropriation. My colleague from New Mexico has done that. I salute him for it. Though we may disagree from time to time on the floor, our friendship and collegiality are never in jeopardy and it will not be in the course of this debate.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
