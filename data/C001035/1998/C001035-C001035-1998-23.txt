President, to continue the colloquy with the distinguished chairman, I again thank him very much for his support. I would like to point out the research conducted at the University of Maine is particularly vital because of the 104 USDA-ARS labs across the country, the laboratory located in Orono, ME, is the only one in New England. The facility is thus able to conduct research on the unique challenges that face our New England farmers.  Specifically, the lab at Orono has conducted research into raised bed techniques that allow potatoes to be grown in the short New England growing season, as well as into disease and pest management.  The potato industry in New England, 95 percent of which is located in northern Maine where I grew up, is suffering through a difficult period. Underpriced subsidized imports and several consecutive years of disease, drought and pest problems have resulted in a steady decline in the amount of acreage planted in potatoes. The additional $300,000 included in the managers' amendment will allow the lab to hire a new pathologist and microbiologist to help New England farmers to overcome many of the challenges they face. I look forward to working with my colleague to enact this significant legislation and, again, I commend and thank him for acceding to our request in this regard.
