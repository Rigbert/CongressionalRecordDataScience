Anthony S. Fauci, Director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).  Yesterday, the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation announced the selection of Dr. Fauci to receive the Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service. Dr. Fauci is being honored in recognition of his leadership in engineering two major U.S. governmental programs addressing HIV and biodefense.  The Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service is awarded biannually in recognition of extraordinary achievements. Mary Lasker is widely recognized for her singular contribution to the growth of the National Institutes of Health, and her strong commitment to eradicate disease and disability through medical research. Dr. Fauci's commitment to this Nation through his accomplished career reflects well on this award's namesake.  Since coming to the National Institutes of Health in 1968, Dr. Fauci has pushed the frontiers of scientific discovery in the field of immunology. In 1980, Dr. Fauci was named Chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation, a position he continues to hold. Four years later, Dr. Fauci was named Director of NIAID, where he oversees an extensive research program to prevent, diagnose, and treat infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections, influenza, tuberculosis, malaria, and illnesses from potential agents of bioterrorism. Over the years, Dr. Fauci has been an excellent steward of this multi-billion dollar investment in infectious disease research.  Dr. Fauci has served for over 20 years as a key advisor to the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services on global AIDS issues, and on initiatives to bolster medical and public health preparedness to fight against emerging threats of infectious disease. He has assisted four Presidents in shaping the research priorities and public health demands of these formidable challenges.  Dr. Fauci has made enormous contributions to basic and clinical research. In 2003, an Institute for Scientific Information study indicated that over 20 years, Dr. Fauci was the 13th most-cited scientist among close to 3 million international authors in all disciplines. He has made seminal contributions to the understanding of the AIDS virus, and he has been instrumental in developing effective therapy strategies for those afflicted with this disease.  Madam Speaker, I can think of no individual more deserving of this recognition than Dr. Fauci. I am pleased to join with my colleagues and a grateful Nation in extending congratulations to Dr. Anthony Fauci for this well-deserved honor and thanking him for his unwavering commitment to scientific discovery and his role in spearheading the efforts to combat disease and undermine the threat of bioterrorism.                          ____________________
