Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Republican proposal.  For more than 30 years, the Medicare and Medicaid programs have exemplified our national commitment to care for seniors, disabled Americans, and low-income Americans. In essence, it is the tangible evidence that, in the most affluent and productive country in the world, we would not let millions of Americans suffer because they were too old, too poor, or too ill to fend for themselves, Because of our investments in Medicare and Medicaid, we have also created the most sophisticated and highest quality health care system in the world.  But today, Republicans will begin their all-out assault on these programs by cutting the Medicare program by $270 billion. These cuts represent the most sweeping changes in the Medicare program since its establishment in 1965. And let me be clear, these cuts are not about reforming the Medicare program--it is about tax cuts for wealthy Americans and an arbitrary march to a seven year deficit reduction target. These cuts are three times more than any estimate of what is necessary to make Medicare solvent.  Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, managing trustee of the Medicare Trust Fund, has recently stated that ``no member of Congress should vote for the $270 billion in cuts believing that reductions of this size have been recommended by the Medicare trustees or that such reductions are needed now to prevent an imminent funding crisis. That would be factually incorrect''.  Here is why the Republican cuts in Medicare are not about reforming the system and are about paying for a tax cut for the rich and a forced march to deficit reduction. The Medicare Part A Trust Fund is not faced with an unprecedented and immediate crisis. The trustees are required by law to report each year on the status of the Part A Trust. The trustees have on eight previous occasions warned that the Trust Fund would be insolvent within seven years. On each of these occasions, the Congress and the president--without alarmist predictions of collapse--took appropriate action to protect the fund.  Republican proposals go far beyond the Part A Trust Fund and also reach into the Part B Trust Fund. Their plan calls for about $170 billion in cuts to Part A of Medicare, which funds hospitalization, and about $100 billion in cuts to Part B, which pays for doctor visits and ancillary services. The Part A Trust is financed by employer and employee contributions, and ``savings'' will be retained by the Trust. However, since the federal deficit is calculated by including the surplus of the Part A Trust, these savings will be used to fund the tax cut and mask deficits in other public accounts. Part B is funded by premiums paid by the elderly and the Treasury. Savings here will directly rebound to tax cuts and deficit reduction.  And the cuts we will vote on today are not only about senior citizens paying more for less health care; the cuts are also about straining the intergenerational benefit of the Medicare program. When Congress passed the Medicare program in 1965, we assured working families that they would not have to choose between investing in their children and caring for their elderly parents when they became old and frail. I have heard from many middle-aged working parents in my district who are afraid of what these Medicare cuts will mean for their families--How will they find the means to ensure that their parents receive quality health care in their old age? How will they choose between their parents and their children? Surely this is not reform.  This bill also repeals the current prohibition against physician self-referral. These laws provide vital protections for consumers. It has been well documented that physician self-referral leads to excessive utilization, fraud and abuse, and drives up the cost of health care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these changes to the physician self-referral laws will cost Medicare an additional $400 million over the next 7 years--$400 million in patient abuse in over-testing and over-referring!  Republicans claim that this bill will give seniors more choices. However, the real truth is that the Republicans will squeeze down so hard on payments to health plans that beneficiaries are likely to pay higher premiums to get the same or fewer benefits. That is not what I would characterize as more choices.  This bill also represents the possible dismantling of my state's medical education infrastructure. As a result of the proposed cuts in the Medicare program, Rhode Island alone will lose $20 million (10%) of its medical education budget each year. This bill does nothing to rationalize the graduate medication education system financed through Medicare; rather, it simply guts GME which will translate into a reduction in the quality of health care and reduced access for many citizens as teaching hospitals close and downsize.  The Republican proposal that this House will vote on today will increase costs for health coverage for seniors, reduce quality and access, and burden working parents. But most importantly, this bill represents nothing less than a betrayal of the trust of the people of this country and a reversal of a generation of guaranteed health care for the elderly.                              {time}  1500
