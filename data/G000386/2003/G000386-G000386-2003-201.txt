 President, I understand the concerns of the Senators from Oregon, and look forward to working with them to reauthorize the TANF program in the coming months. I appreciate their concern for the need for Oregon to retain flexibility in TANF. I hope the Senator from Montana will agree that the Finance Committee, on both sides of the aisle, should discuss this issue as we move to reauthorize the TANF program.
