Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, House Republicans have taken two bad bills that failed to meet the challenge of the humanitarian crisis on the border and made them worse. They are worse for children. They are worse for women. And they are worse for those who were brought here as children, grew up here, and know no other home than America. These bills do not reflect America's values and our highest ideals.  The bills that were put forward yesterday had no chance of seeing action in the Senate. Neither do these. In fact, Representative John Fleming is reported to have said that the supplemental bill is ``political cover'' and that ``not a single Republican in the House believes it'll be signed into law.''  I believe that statement to be absolutely accurate.  Chairwoman Granger, my friend with whom I served on the Appropriations Committee, said, just a few minutes ago, doing nothing is not an option. And I very politely suggest to her what we are doing tonight is nothing.  What we do tonight will not pass, will not solve a problem, will not change policy, and it will not give the needed resources that are necessary. Republicans have once again embraced their ``my way or the highway'' attitude, the same attitude that led to last year's shutdown, instead of reaching across the aisle and working with Democrats on bipartisan legislation that can address this crisis and be enacted.  We are debating a bill that is not only bad in substance, but that was brought to the floor in near secrecy in violation of the Republican majority's own 3-day rule. How ironic. How ironic that Majority Leader McCarthy said in an op-ed in the Washington Post today:       I will commit to the committee process and regular order.  This is neither the committee process nor regular order.
