 As I am sure they know, the SCAAP reimbursements provided in prior years did not nearly cover the costs states and localities incurred to incarcerate illegal aliens in their jurisdictions.  In fiscal year 1998, the last year for which such cost figures are available, the cost for states and localities amounted to $1.7 billion. Thus, last year's funding level covered only 30 percent of actual costs.  A cut along the magnitude of that which is included in the Committee bill would be absolutely devastating. I understand the House CJS Subcommittee is recommending an FY00 SCAAP funding level of $585 million. I will work closely with the Chairman and Ranking Member and others in both bodies during the weeks to come to assure that the conference on this bill adequately funds this program.
