President, today we confirmed an outstanding lawyer, a knowledgeable and diligent servant of justice and great judicial nominee from my State of Oregon. It was a great honor to present to the Senate the name of Mr. Garr ``Mike'' King to be a United States District Judge for the District of Oregon.  Mr. King comes before the Senate today with the bipartisan support of the Oregon Congressional delegation, and with broad support from both Oregon's law enforcement community and our state's legal community. Mr. King has served as a member of the Oregon State Bar Association since 1963 and has distinguished himself as one of the finest attorneys in the state. During this period of time, Mr. King has developed a sterling reputation for integrity, hard work, intelligence, and diligence.  In addition to his outstanding career as an attorney in private practice, Mr. King also has served as Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney and was elected to the Board of Regents of the American College of Trial Lawyers. He helped draft the Oregon Rules for Civil Procedure, authored the arbitration rules for Multnomah County and served as an arbitrator through the American Arbitration Association. He has been active in the U.S. District Court Mediation program since it was initiated and has worked quite closely with the Court to improve the federal mediation system.  Mr. King is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps who served his country with honor from 1954 to 1957. He has lived in Oregon for the past 35 years and is a proud father of seven children who is deeply involved in his church and community affairs. As those of my colleagues who were at Mike's confirmation hearing can attest, I think he single-handedly managed to fill about half of the hearing room with family members from all over the country, and I believe that speaks volumes about the kind of caring, concerned and committed family man Mike King is.  As with previous recommendations that I have made for the federal bench, the recommendation of Mr. King was preceded by an extensive bipartisan screening effort undertaken by a committee of leading Oregon attorneys. The selection committee was appointed with input from all the members of the Oregon Congressional delegation and the Governor's office. All applicants reviewed by the committee were evaluated on three criteria: judicial temperament, fitness to serve on the federal bench, and legal qualifications. Mr. King was rated very highly by the committee, and after personally interviewing him, I found him very well qualified for this position.  I want to again thank the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch for moving us to this point in the process. I am very grateful for both the amount of time and good counsel you continue to give me in the consideration of my region's needs on the federal bench.  I also thank my colleague, Senator Smith, for his efforts on behalf of this nominee. Senator Smith and I have now worked together in support of two other fine candidates to the federal bench, both of whom have been confirmed by the Senate.  I am certain that Mike King will bring to the federal bench the same intelligence, legal skill and integrity that he has brought to his work as one of our state's most respected attorneys.
