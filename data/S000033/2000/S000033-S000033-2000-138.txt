 Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see the government do regarding these concerns.  I submit these statements for the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                     Mike Flower and Brett Michaud               Regarding STUDENT NIGHTLIFE--May 26, 2000       MIKE FLOWER: I am Mike Flower from Youth Build, and it is      an organization that we do construction and do school every      other week. And basically my subject is how there isn't a lot      of things for youth to do at nighttime. And I just think that      there should be a club for just youth or something every      night that they can do instead of drugs. So that is my      thought.       BRETT MICHAUD: I basically have the same idea as him      because, I mean, without any clubs what do students resort      to? They resort to gangs and drugs, and that is not what      people want and that is not what people want to see in the      youth of Burlington. They want to see people active in their      community, and sometimes the activities are just not there      for the students and they just have no other place to resort      to.                                  ____                                   Hillary Knapp, Shawn Keane, Sue Martin, Laura Drummond and Joel Felion               Regarding OTTER TEEN NETWORK--May 26, 2000       HILLARY KNAPP: I would first like to thank you for inviting      us and giving us the opportunity to tell about some of the      things that we have been doing at Otter Valley Union High      School through our teen network organization, Otter Teen      Network.       The issue that we would like to present to you is continued      support, encouragement and funding for organizations such as      Otter Teen Network that give teens an opportunity to be      leaders, putting continued emphasis on school funding,      opportunities for grants that support prevention programs and      funding for groups such as Green Mountain Prevention Projects      are very important. We feel that we as teens are the best      support and the best role models for each other and that we      have more of a direct influence on each other, but those of      us who want to become leaders need a clean and drug-free      school and even the right tools. In addition to supporting      prevention, we would also like to encourage research in      intervention programs that support teens in our daily lives.       SHAWN KEANE: Otter Teen Network is an idea that came from      two students two years ago. Otter Teen Network is student-     initiated, student-run and student-organized that promotes      teens working together to create a positive school, community      and safe school environment while promoting being drug-free.      Otter Teen Network is a great example of teens being given      the opportunity to express their opinions, share ideas and      improving their school environment and being encouraged to      make a difference. We have the opportunity to pull together      many resources and merge them into the program making it      quite a team effort. Safe and Drug-free Schools has funded      our advisor's position. It has been the advisor's goal to      work within the school soliciting support from      administration, faculty and staff. With the creation of OTN,      Otter Valley has created an umbrella organization to take      advantage of a number of outside resources, such as Green      Mountain Prevention Projects, which are stated in there, GMR      projects, leadership projects and teen institutes. We are      very close to DTLSP. We even have someone on the advisory      council. We participate in the Governor's Leadership      Conference and also VCAT. Otter Teen Network has also worked      with the office of Alcohol and Drug Abuse on presentations.      We have also developed them through the goal of working      through grant writing and awards to further our projects.       In addition to Safe and Drug-free School mini-grants we      have also been given an award. We have also awarded ODAT      community grants.       Another area of support that we have tapped into is our      outside community organization called Neighborhood      Connections. This is a team--it is this teamwork and      cooperation that has made us stronger and helped us to such      positive influence in such a short time.       LAURA DRUMMOND: Otter Valley Union High School has      approximately 770 middle school and high school students.      This type of diverse program reaches everyone, Otter Teen      Network meetings are held weekly. Once a month we try to have      planning sessions where we talk about theme and how to get it      across to the school. Often we do informal bulletin boards      and school art displays. In many of our topics we focus on      prevention in school and community or showing how we are all      connected.       JOEL FELION: We have teen leaders which initiate and head a      project. There are team members who do network on the project      and get it ready, and there are participants who are in      school who have not worked on the project but received direct      benefit and then there are recipients who are on the      outskirts, they are not picking up anything directly but they      still benefit from our program and our influence.       HILLARY KNAPP: We would like to present to you this binder      showing some of the things that we have done, and we would      like to thank you for having us. And the next presentation is      about our Power of Choice Day which was held on May 3rd.                                  ____                                  Chris Bullard, Becki Kenyon, Jenn Bearor, Angel Boise and Hillary Knapp                Regarding POWER OF CHOICE--May 26, 2000       CHRIS BULLARD: Hi. My name is Chris Bullard and I am here      to go over the concept of the Power of Choice Day. Through      attending many conferences with GMPP and GLSP we were always      greatly influenced on what we had saw or what we had done, so      we decided it would be good for the entire school to have      something like that. We began brainstorming ideas last year.      As we began brainstorming, the ideas just kept flowing. In      February of this year we finally had enough on paper to      present it to our administration. It was a go for May 3rd.      The Power of Choice was named an all day, schoolwide      conference offering teens at Otter Valley Union High School      an opportunity to learn, interact and discuss problems and      issues that teens face 3 today. And now I am going to turn      over to these two.       BECKI KENYON: Hi. I am Becki. Here you have a Power of      Choice flyer or pamphlet you can use and it would help. Could      you please take it out just to look at it? It should be in      one of the pockets.       JENN BEAROR: The meaning of this day was to give awareness      to our peers about alcohol and drugs and peer pressure and to      let them make their own decisions. We have a group of us      called the SOS Players which emphasized on all types of      issues that teens face today. We also had the pleasure to      have a couple of peers from Mountain View come as well as      many celebrities, like the Middlebury Men's and Women's      Hockey Team, and all of this was possible by the funding of      grants from the Governor's Highway Safety Program, New      Direction, OBCC, Refuse to Abuse, and many more.       BECKI KENYON: In the back of the program we had different      workshops that our students went to throughout the day, and      some of those workshops are Addiction and Intervention,      Dealing with Tragedy, Health, Home and Phobia Resolves,      Parties, Respecting Yourself, Does Your Body Meet Your Image,      Healthy Habits. And the students gave different--well, it had      their names on them for drawings throughout the day so we     kind of rewarded them for coming and participating with us.      And then in our school we have three different lunches which      we use to invite different groups and which we go there.       We have also been working with several groups throughout      the whole process. Some of these are Fine Family Resources,      Vermont Liquor Control, OBCC, Trapp Coalition, Department of      Health, VTLSP, GMPP, and all these groups working together      helped us to meet the Vermont standards adopted by the state      for all students in the state.       And we would like to turn it over to Angel.       ANGEL BOISE: As Becki Kenyon already said, my name is Angel      Boise. I would Just like to say we have received positive and      negative comments about this day. We had several students      absent that day because they thought they would be      ineffective. The day had turned out to have a big impact on      the faculty, students and community members. The students      that missed Power of Choice realized that they had missed out      on a great day. Some of the positive comments were that it      was a wonderful day, it had a big impact and it was      unbelievable. Thank you for all your time.       HILLARY KNAPP: It has been a privilege to be here today. As      a small token of our appreciation, we would like to present      you with our Otter Valley mascot, the otter, and it is from      us at Otter Teen Network and Otter Valley Union High School.                               ____________________
