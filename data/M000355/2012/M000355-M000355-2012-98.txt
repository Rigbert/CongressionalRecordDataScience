 President, S. 3510 addresses the concerns raised by 14 of the most highly respected folks in the national security field, from Michael Chertoff to Mike Mcconnell to Michael Mukasey, all of whom wrote with serious concerns about the application of one provision of the STOCK Act requiring online posting of financial data which would potentially impact the national security and the personal safety of national security and law enforcement professionals and their families. These are very serious concerns they have raised, and given that we are on the eve of the August district work period, we do not have time to adequately address those concerns. Thus, this very short bill adopts their joint recommendation to delay implementation until the national security and personal safety implications can be fully evaluated. Not one change has been made to what is required to be reported, and there is no change to the longstanding requirement that all these reports are already available in person. It is for the safety and security of our brave men and women that we need to ensure they are protected which is exactly what this bill does.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter dated July 19, 2012, addressed to congressional leaders printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 19, 2012.

John Conyers, Jr.,     Ranking Member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, House          of Representatives.       Dear Congressional Leaders: We are writing to express      concern about section 11 of the Stop Trading in Congressional      Knowledge Act (the STOCK Act), which requires that the      financial disclosure forms of senior executive branch      officials be posted on the Internet by August 31. While we      agree that the government should have access to the financial      information of its senior officials to ensure the integrity      of government decision making, we strongly urge that Congress      immediately pass legislation allowing an exception from the      Internet posting requirement for certain executive branch      officials, in order to protect the national security and the      personal safety of these officials and their families.       The STOCK Act was intended to stop insider trading by      Members of Congress. However, section 11 of the Act, which      was added without any public hearings or consideration of      national security or personnel safety implications, requires      that financial data of over 28,000 executive branch officials      throughout the U.S. government, including members of the U.S.      military and career diplomats, law enforcement officials, and      officials in sensitive national security jobs in the Defense      Department, State Department and other agencies, be posted on      their agency websites.       It is not clear what public purpose is served by inclusion      of Section 11. We are not aware that any transparency      concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the existing      review process for executive branch officials, most of whom      have devoted their careers to public service. For several      decades, executive branch officials have prepared and      submitted SF-278 financial disclosure forms to their      employing agencies. The completed forms and the extensive      financial data they contain are carefully reviewed by agency      ethics officers in light of the specific responsibilities of      the officials submitting them in order to identify and      eliminate potential conflicts of interest. Although the forms      may be requested by members of the public, they are not      published in hard-copy or on the Internet. Moreover,      individuals requesting copies of the forms must provide their      names, occupation, and contact information. Agencies      generally notify the filing officials about who has requested      their personal financial information.       In contrast, Section 11 of the STOCK Act would require that      the financial disclosure forms of executive branch officials      be posted on each agency's website and that a government-wide      database be created containing the SF-278s that would be      searchable and sortable without the use of a login or any      other screening process to control or monitor access to this      personal information.       We believe that this new uncontrolled disclosure scheme for      executive branch officials will create significant threats to      the national security and to the personal safety and      financial security of executive branch officials and their      families, especially career employees. Placing complete      personal financial information of all senior officials on the      Internet would be a jackpot for enemies of the United States      intent on finding security vulnerabilities they can exploit.      SF-278 forms include a treasure trove of personal financial      information: the location and value of employees' savings and      checking accounts and certificates of deposit; a full      valuation and listing of their investment portfolio; a      listing of real estate assets and their value; a listing of      debts, debt amounts, and creditors; and the signatures of the      filers. SF-278s include financial information not only about      the filing employee, but also about the employee's spouse and      dependent children.       Posting this detailed financial information on the Internet      will jeopardize the safety of executive branch officials--     including military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and      potentially intelligence officials--and their families who      are posted or travel in dangerous areas, especially in      certain countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Embassy      and military security officers already advise these officials      to post no personal identifying information on the Internet.      Publishing the financial assets of these officials will allow      foreign governments, and terrorist or criminal groups to      specifically target these officials or their families for      kidnapping, harassment, manipulation of financial assets, and      other abuse.       Equally important, the detailed personal financial      information--particularly detailed information about debts      and creditors--contained in the SF-278s of senior officials      is precisely the information that foreign intelligence      services and other adversaries spend billions of dollars      every year to uncover as they look for information that can      be used to harass, intimidate and blackmail those in the      government with access to classified information. Yet under      the STOCK Act, these SF-278s will be placed on the Internet      for any foreign government or group to access without      disclosing their identity or purpose and with no notice to      the employees or their agencies. We should not hand on a      silver platter to foreign intelligence services information      that could be used to compromise or harass career public      servants who have access to the most sensitive information      held by the U.S. government.       Section 11 could also jeopardize the safety and security of      other executive branch officials, such as federal prosecutors      and others who are tracking down and bringing to justice      domestic organized crime gangs and foreign terrorists. Crime      gangs could easily target the families of prosecutors with      substantial assets or debts for physical attacks or threats.       Finally, publishing detailed banking and brokerage      information of executive branch officials, especially with      their signatures, is likely to invite hacking, financial      attacks, and identity theft of these officials and their      families, particularly by groups or individuals who may be      affected by their governmental work.       Given these inevitable adverse national security      consequences, we urge you to amend the STOCK Act to protect      U.S. national security interests and the safety of executive      branch officials by creating an exception from the      requirements of Section 11 for senior executive branch      officials with security clearances. The exception should also      apply to other officials based on a determination by an      agency head that an exception is necessary to protect the      safety of the official or the official's family. At the very      minimum, Congress should act to delay implementation of      Section 11 until the national security and personal safety      implications can be fully evaluated.       If the financial disclosure forms of senior executive      officials are actually posted on the Internet in August,      there will be irreparable damage to U.S. national security      interests, and many senior executives and their families may      be placed in danger. This issue is too important to be      trapped in partisan politics. We urge Congress to act      swiftly, before the Congress goes on its summer recess on      August 6.
