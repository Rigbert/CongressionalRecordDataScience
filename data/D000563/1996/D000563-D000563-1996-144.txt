Speaker, if I might, the fact is that we are over 3 months into this fiscal year. this subcommittee has failed to produce an appropriations bill for the District of Columbia. We are forced to lurch from spending bill to spending bill with gross uncertainly among the residents of the District of Columbia about their future. To blame anyone other than this committee and this Congress for this dereliction of duty would be improper.  I would like to ask the gentleman another question: The District of Columbia appropriations bill which came over from the Senate carried with it an amendment offered by Senator Boxer, Senator Dole, and Senator Daschle entitled No Budget, No Pay. It said that so long as the Federal Government was shut down, Members of Congress would not receive their paychecks. That provision was included in the bill, the Senate version of this appropriations bill, and I am asking the gentleman from New York whether it is included in his temporary spending bill.
