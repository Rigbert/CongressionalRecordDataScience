Chair, I rise in very reluctant opposition to this amendment. I agree with the goal. I agree with the fine Congressman's goal of getting that lock modernized, improving the access, and securing the Great Lakes region for generations to come. My problem lies in the offset coming out of the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy accounts.  So I would only ask the gentleman to consider advising his colleagues, who will go into conference, if we could find a different offset, it would sure be a lot more comfortable on this side of the aisle.  I want to congratulate him for his amendment and, again, reluctantly rise in opposition.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
