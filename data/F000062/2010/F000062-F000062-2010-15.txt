 REID. Yes. The fourth is the $250 COLA. Madam President, we would do the votes an hour after we come in. We will try to work something out to do it after we complete the impeachment. The other thing I have indicated--in fact, we had a number of bipartisan conversations yesterday--is, we are trying to figure out a time to move forward on the Defense authorization bill. The issue on that is what we do with amendments.  Without belaboring the point, I would be happy to consider doing a number of amendments if we had time agreements on them. Just to have an open process at this stage, I don't see how we can do that. I will continue to work with my friends, the chairman of the committee, and others who are interested, both Democrats and Republicans, recognizing how important that legislation is.
