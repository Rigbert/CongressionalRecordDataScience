Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 609, the College Access and Opportunity Act of 2006. This legislation misses a critical opportunity to provide students from moderate and low income families, access to the American dream. This legislation further depletes our already under-funded Federal student aid programs, placing post-secondary education even further out of reach for the students who need it the most. To be sure, I share the concerns of my colleagues and my constituents, about the rising costs of college and the difficulties of obtaining student aid. However, I am convinced that H.R. 609 fails to adequately address these issues.  Mr. Chairman, my concerns with H.R. 609 extend beyond the fact that it squanders an opportunity to enhance America's economic competitiveness, by providing a future generation of highly skilled workers. I have serious concerns about additional provisions contained within the bill. I am terribly concerned about the rising costs of college tuitions across the Nation, and I commend the House Education & Workforce Committee for attempting to address this issue. In fact, I believe that some of the provisions addressing the rising costs of college could aid in addressing this issue. However, I believe that we must tread carefully when setting price controls on college tuitions. It is imperative that we do not infringe upon the independence of our Nation's private and religious institutions.  Mr. Chairman, I also am concerned with provisions contained in H.R. 609 that would allow states to function as an accrediting body. If we are going to legislate a deviation from the existing quasi-independent programmatic and institutional accrediting bodies, we must remain cognizant of the potential for major conflicts of interest and the emergence of divisions among public and independent institutions. Politics, demographics, higher education strategies, and economic incentives are among the factors that could contribute to the unintended result of compromising the independence of our nation's private colleges and universities.  Mr. Chairman, last month the Republican majority of the House of Representatives voted to raid Federal student aid programs of $12 billion, in the budget reconciliation bill. As you may recall, all of my Democratic colleagues voted against that misguided legislation. Once again I encourage my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to stand up for the children of America's hard working families and support increased access to higher education for all students. I urge my colleagues to vote against final passage of H.R. 609, the College Access and Opportunity Act of 2006.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Dent). All time for general debate has expired.

The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 741, the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment to the College Access and Opportunity Act, and I would like to take a few moments to identify and clarify for Members a few points regarding the manager's amendment.  The process that we go through here is, somebody, after many hearings, writes a bill, and then it goes to our committee by direction of the Speaker, and then generally the subcommittee holds a markup giving all members a chance to participate and amend the bill, and then the full committee, and we go through the process again with all members on the committee able to add amendments, change the bill. It goes through a series of debate. And then, after that, between the time it goes to the committee and the time it comes to the floor, we continue working on the process, and the changes that are worked out at that time are added to a final manager's amendment, which we are now presenting on the floor.  And with respect to the College Affordability Index provisions of H.R. 609, which aim to shine a spotlight on hyperinflation and college costs, the manager's amendment, after this process, makes a couple of very important changes. First, it requires institutions whose affordability index ranking falls in the highest 10 percent nationwide to establish a quality, efficient task force charged with comparing the operating costs of its institution with those of others. This is down from the highest 25 percent in the underlying bill, so we have reduced that 25 percent of the colleges that have increased their costs the most over the period of the 8 years that it affects, to be highlighted, and we have cut that from 25 down to 10 percent.  Furthermore, under the manager's amendment, one of the things that we had in the original bill was we could call on the Inspector General to do an audit of the school. We have removed that, and there will be nothing more than the reporting provisions that the schools will have to comply with connected to the College Affordability Index.  On accreditation, the manager's amendment explicitly clarifies that a State cannot require colleges and universities within its borders to be accredited by that State. There has been some misinformation out on that. We have clarified that in the manager's amendment.  Moreover, this amendment provides colleges and universities a clear choice regarding whose accreditation they seek.                              {time}  1315  It forces no accreditation decisions on any school or any State, period. If the State wants to get into the accrediting business, they have to go through the requirements that are offered for all other accreditors. They have to be approved by the Department of Education, and then the school picks what accrediting body they want to work with.  Finally, the manager's amendment retains current law with respect to campus-based aid programs, as well as the TRIO Federal college access programs. It requires new studies that will allow us to take a deeper look into these programs and determine what steps need to be taken in the future to ensure they are running as effectively and as efficiently as possible.  Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment contains several other changes including many that are the products of negotiations with my friends on the other side of the aisle. I urge my colleagues to support both this amendment and the underlying bill.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
