Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong opposition to the Hoyer amendment, and I urge Members to realize that this is a pro-abortion amendment and would provide and facilitate abortion on demand. It would force taxpayers to underwrite the cost of abortions, and premium payers would also have to pay for abortions as well.  Mr. Chairman, let me remind Members that we contribute as taxpayers,   we contribute 70 percent, a little over 70 percent, of the funding to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. Not only that, even if it was not a taxpayer-funded issue, by providing this money we are also facilitating, by providing this authority which would be precluded by the underlying language, we are facilitating the demise and the destruction of unborn children.
