 Obesity is an issue that must be addressed--not just by the Federal Government, but by individuals, parents, schools, and health professionals across the country. Given the high cost of health care, we must all look at ways we can reduce the risks of obesity and the many diseases that come with it.  I bring this up today because a constituent of mine made me realize that there is an easy and cost-effective way to address the problem. We all know that childhood obesity can be prevented if we motivate young people to eat better and exercise more. There are many fad diets, surgeries, strategies and pills that claim to help reduce obesity. Americans are always looking for the next big breakthrough, and they are willing to pay any price to do it easily and simply. But, nothing is as simple or as cost effective as helping kids learn and maintain the ability to do pull ups.  Kids can immunize themselves against obesity, and they can do that by learning to do pull ups. It's been acknowledged that pull ups counteract a child's tendency to obesity. In the context of a of a four year study at Jefferson Elementary School in Davenport, Iowa, my constituent demonstrated that if you start children young, most young people can learn to do pull ups. And, as long as young people maintain the ability to do pull ups, most can naturally immunize themselves against obesity for a lifetime without ever having to resort to pills, shots, or special diets.  Due to the rising prevalence of obesity in children and its many adverse health effects. Obesity has been recognized as a serious public health concern. The adverse health effects of obesity do not just include physical conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep problems, and other life-threatening disorders. The threat of obesity includes emotional and psychological problems, depression and low self-esteem.  Aside from doing pull-ups, we must also encourage other lessons for our youth. We must stress goal setting, diligence, diet, rest, and education. The goal is not only to beat physical obesity for life but also to overcome the psychological and emotional problems as a result of low self-esteem. Building confidence is at the heart of pulling people out of obesity.  Childhood obesity is an issue we must all take seriously. I thank my constituent for bringing this simple solution to my attention and commend people like him who are concerned about the health of our future generations.                          ____________________
