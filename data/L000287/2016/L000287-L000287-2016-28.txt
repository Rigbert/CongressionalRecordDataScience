Speaker, I include in the Record an opinion editorial that appeared in the Washington Post on August 26, 2016.  This piece is authored by Mr. Wade Henderson, who serves as the president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the national coalition of more than 200 organizations committed to a fair, open, and inclusive America:  The pursuit of capital punishment for Dylann Roof is a step backward                     (By Wade Henderson, August 26)       On Nov. 7 in Charleston, S.C., a federal court will begin      selecting a jury in the death penalty prosecution of Dylann      Roof, the accused killer of nine African American worshipers      at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. At first      glance, the notion of a white man facing the death penalty      for murdering black people in the South--in a killing      inspired by the murderer's racist views--may seem like a      marker of racial progress.       It isn't--and those who champion civil rights should not      celebrate this moment. Roof's crime was surely heinous, and      his racism was repugnant. But supporters of racial equality      and equal treatment under the law should support Roof's offer      to plead guilty and serve a sentence of life without the      possibility of parole.       How can it be that a lifelong civil rights lawyer such as      myself would take this position? Because the death penalty      cannot be separated from the issue of racial discrimination,      especially in the South. The history of slavery and lynching      left deep scars in the black community, and the current death      penalty does not fare much better. More than 8 in 10 of the      executions carried out since the death penalty was reinstated      in 1976 have occurred in the South. Blacks make up more than      one-third of the 1,170 defendants executed in the region,      with most convicted of murdering a white victim.       Given the racial disproportion inherent in the modem      application of the death penalty, it is no surprise that most      African Americans (including me) oppose the death penalty, a      position that would also disqualify most of them (and me)      from serving on the jury in Roof's case.       As a result, if the Roof trial continues on its present      course, a jury will be chosen that represents only part of      the community. Those who oppose the death penalty on      principle will be struck from the pool of jurors by the      presiding judge. Those who express doubts about the death      penalty will likely be struck by the prosecution. The      resulting jury will have fewer blacks, fewer women and fewer      people of faiths that oppose the death penalty than a jury      selected at random from the residents of Charleston. That      cannot be a desirable outcome in such an emotional and      racially charged case.       Neither would the adversarial proceeding necessitated by a      refusal to accept Roof's offer to plead guilty and accept a      sentence of life without the possibility of parole. Once the      trial begins, there will be a detailed recounting of the      worst day this community has ever experienced. It will be the      prosecution's duty to portray this multiple murder as      gruesomely as possible in order to secure a death sentence.      Family members may be called to the stand to describe      precisely what they went through that day and how it affected      them.       Likewise, the defense will be obligated to do everything in      its power to lessen Roof's culpability. This is how our      adversarial process works, but it is not necessary here.      Without the agony of trying to decide between life and death,      a sentencing proceeding that followed a guilty plea could pay      tribute to the victims, focusing on the value of their lives      and the consequences of their loss. All family members could      voice their pain, regardless of their view on the death      penalty. It would not be an easy day, but far better than      months of focusing only on Roof, followed by years of appeals      and uncertainty.       Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch has allowed this case to      proceed as a capital prosecution until now, but a new      decision point is coming soon. Most criminal cases settle      before trial because it is in the best interests of the      entire community. That could happen here; the offer is      already on the table. The attorney general need only agree.       After the racially inspired attack on the parishioners of      Mother Emanuel, as the church is known, South Carolina took      the bold and important step of permanently lowering the      Confederate battle flag from the state capitol grounds. This      powerful symbol--perceived by many as the embodiment of      racism and discrimination--had to go.       With the death penalty, the Justice Department now has the      power to lower another flag that has torn communities apart      along racial lines. Capital punishment in this case may      appear to be just retribution for Roof's unfathomable crime.      Yet the real-life operation of the death penalty suggests      that its application to Roof would only pave the way for      future cases in which the death penalty is invoked to harm      the very community on which he inflicted so much pain.                            ____________________
