All the Scriptural evidence, historical evidence, and archeological evidence says, yes, it has always been changing and always will change. But what they are trying to infer is that because of that, then the world is coming to an end because of what? Manmade gases--anthropogenic gases--manmade gases. That is what the real hoax is, but I am not going to waste my time on that. However, I will next week, I might add.  The Senator from New York talked about the fact that we have an attorney general who has sued the EPA many times. Let me just remind everyone--and I don't think I have heard this on the floor, but I have watched Democrat after Democrat after Democrat come by and just brutally attack Scott Pruitt, a guy I know to be an honorable man. I don't know of one attorney general who has served with him who doesn't agree with that.  In terms of suing, I think it is important to understand that almost every Democrat who has stood up and said disparaging things about Scott Pruitt and talked about the fact that he has sued the EPA countless times--their attorney general from their State has also sued the EPA. I will read the States: The attorneys general from Wisconsin, Colorado, Ohio, Nevada, Indiana, New Mexico, Missouri, Florida, Michigan, and Montana, all have Democratic Members of the Senate who have been criticizing Scott Pruitt. Their own States have filed lawsuits against the EPA.  The other thing I want to mention, which I think is very important, is a letter from our newest Senator, Luther Strange. Senator Strange is the replacement for our Honorable Jeff Sessions, who now is the Attorney General. This letter is signed by two pages of attorneys general from all over America--Democratic States, Republican States, States where Democrats have come to this floor criticizing him. I will read the last two paragraphs of the letter from Luther Strange signed by all of these Democratic and Republican Attorneys General:       Scott Pruitt is more than just an exemplary state attorney      general, he is also our friend. A man of deep faith who is      committed to his family and to his friends, Scott seeks      always to do the right thing. His friendship and leadership      have been invaluable to us over the years.       The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency      plays a critical role in our Nation's government.  Keep in mind, this is coming from Democratic attorneys general.       Attorney General Pruitt has proven over the course of his      career that he has the right character, experience, and      knowledge to serve as the Administrator of the EPA. We urge      the Senate to confirm his nomination.  This is signed by about 22 attorneys general, Democrats and Republicans.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent this letter, along with the list of States who have had occasion to sue the EPA, the same as Scott Pruitt has, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 State of Alabama,                               Office of the Attorney General,                                  Montgomery, AL, January 4, 2017.     Hon. John Barrasso,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Carper,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper: As the      attorneys general of our respective states, we write to      express our unqualified support for our colleague and the      Attorney General of Oklahoma, E. Scott Pruitt, as      Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.       As attorneys general, we understand the need to work      collaboratively to address threats to our environment that      cross state lines, as well as the importance of a federal      counterpart in the EPA Administrator who possesses the      knowledge, experience, and principles to work with our states      to address issues affecting our environment. We believe that      no one exemplifies these qualities more than Scott Pruitt.       As the Attorney General of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt developed      expertise in environmental law and policy. He negotiated a      historic water rights settlement with Indian tribes that      preserved the ecosystems of scenic lakes and rivers; he      worked with his Democrat counterpart in Arkansas to reduce      pollution in the Illinois River; and he represented the      interests of Oklahomans in rate cases against utility      companies and in numerous actions against those who      contaminated his state's air and water.       Attorney General Pruitt is committed to clean air and clean      water, and to faithfully executing the environmental laws      written by Congress. He believes that environmental      regulations should be driven by State and local governments--     a notion endorsed by Congress in the Clean Air Act and Clean      Water Act. When our nation is confronted with issues      affecting the environment that are not covered by a      particular statute, Scott will come to Congress for a      solution, rather than inventing power for his agency. He      wholeheartedly believes in a strong Environmental Protection      Agency that carries out its proper duties, providing a      backstop to state and local regulators as they develop      environmental regulations suited to the needs of their own      communities.       Scott Pruitt is more than just an exemplary state attorney      general, he is also our friend. A man of deep faith who is      committed to his family and to his friends, Scott seeks      always to do the right thing. His friendship and leadership      have been invaluable to us over the years.       The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency      plays a critical role in our Nation's government. Attorney      General Pruitt has proven over the course of his career that      he has the right character, experience, and knowledge to      serve as the Administrator of the EPA. We urge the Senate to      confirm his nomination.
