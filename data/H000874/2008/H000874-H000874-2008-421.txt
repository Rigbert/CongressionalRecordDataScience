 The schedule for the week of February 4 is attenuated, to some degree obviously, by the 22 States that have a primary on February 5. Both Democrats and Republicans obviously will be involved in those to one degree or another. Monday and Tuesday the House is not, therefore, in session.  On Wednesday, the House will meet at 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Thursday and Friday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business this week. In addition, we will consider H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act.  That is the schedule. Of course, I will tell my friend that we obviously have a couple of bills that we passed todaythat we want to see move as quickly as possible, and if we could move those next week, we would certainly try to do so.  Thank you for yielding.
