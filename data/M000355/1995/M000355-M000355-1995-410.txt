(2) All testimony and action relating to a sworn complaint      shall be kept secret and shall not be released by the      Committee to any individual or group, whether governmental or      private, except the respondent, without the approval of a      majority of the Committee, until such time as a report to the      Senate is required under Senate Resolution 338, 88th      Congress, as amended, or unless otherwise permitted under      these Rules. (See Rule 9 on Procedures for Handling Committee      Sensitive and Classified Materials.)

(2) If any Committee proceeding appears to relate to a        Member of the Committee in a manner described in      subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the staff shall      prepare a report to the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If      either the Chairman or the Vice Chairman concludes from      the report that it appears that the Member may be      ineligible, the Member shall be notified in writing of the      nature of the particular proceeding and the reason that it      appears that the Member may be ineligible to participate      in it. If the Member agrees that he or she is ineligible,      the Member shall so notify the Chairman or Vice Chairman.      If the Member believes that he or she is not ineligible,      he or she may explain the reasons to the Chairman and Vice      Chairman, and if they both agree that the Member is not      ineligible, the Member shall continue to serve. But if      either the Chairman or Vice Chairman continues to believe      that the Member is ineligible, while the Member believes      that he or she is not ineligible, the matter shall be      promptly referred to the Committee. The Member shall      present his or her arguments to the Committee in executive      session. Any contested questions concerning a Member's      eligibility shall be decided by a majority vote of the      Committee, meeting in executive session, with the Member      in question not participating.       (3) A Member may also disqualify himself from participating      in a Committee proceeding in other circumstances not listed      in subparagraph (k)(1).       (4) The President of the Senate shall be given written      notice of the ineligibility or disqualification of any Member      from any initial review, investigation, or other proceeding      requiring the appointment of another Member in accordance      with subparagraph (k)(5).       (5) Whenever a Member of the Committee is ineligible to      participate in or disqualifies himself from participating in      any initial review, investigation, or other substantial      Committee proceeding, another Member of the Senate who is of      the same party shall be appointed by the Senate in accordance      with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Rule XXIV of the      Standing Rules of the Senate, to serve as a Member of the      Committee solely for the purposes of that proceeding.       (6) A Member of the Committee staff shall be ineligible to      participate in any Committee proceeding that the staff      director or outside counsel determines relates specifically      to any of the following:       (A) the staff Member's own conduct;       (B) the conduct of any employee that the staff Member      supervises;       (C) the conduct of any Member, officer or employee for whom      the staff Member has worked for any substantial period; or       (D) a complaint, sworn or unsworn, that was filed by the      staff Member. At the direction or with the consent of the      staff director or outside counsel, a staff Member may also be      disqualified from participating in a Committee proceeding in      other circumstances not listed above.       (l) Recorded Votes: Any Member may require a recorded vote      on any matter.       (m) Proxies; Recording Votes of Absent Members:       (1) Proxy voting shall not be allowed when the question      before the Committee is the initiation or continuation of an      initial review or an investigation, or the issuance of a      report or recommendation related thereto concerning a Member      or officer of the Senate. In any such case an absent Member's      vote may be announced solely for the purpose of recording the      Member's position and such announced votes shall not be      counted for or against the motion.       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph      (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held      open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the      absent Committee Member has been informed of the matter on      which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested the      Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered      to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of      establishing a quorum.       (n) Approval of Blind Trusts and Foreign Travel Requests      Between Sessions and During Extended Recesses: During any      period in which the Senate stands in adjourment between      sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled to      extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice Chairman,      or their designees, acting jointly, are authorized to approve      or disapprove blind trusts under the provision of Rule XXXIV,      and to approve or disapprove foreign travel requests which      require immediate resolution.       (o) Committee Use of Services or Employees of Other      Agencies and Departments: With the prior consent of the      department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize      the services, information, or facilities of any such      department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a      reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such      personnel of any such department or agency as it deems      advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the      Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the      facilities and the services of the staff of such other      committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice      Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that      such action is necessary and appropriate.                rule 2: procedures for sworn complaints       (a) Sworn Complaints: Any person may file a sworn complaint      with the Committee, alleging that any Senator, or officer, or      employee of the Senate has violated a law, the Senate Code of      Official Conduct, or any rule or regulation of the Senate      relating to the conduct of any individual in the performance      of his or her duty as a Member, officer, or employee of the      Senate, or has engaged in improper conduct which may reflect      upon the Senate.       (b) Form and Content of Complaints: A complaint filed under        paragraph (a) shall be in writing and under oath, and      shall set forth in simple, concise and direct statements:       (1) The name and legal address of the party filing the      complaint (hereinafter, the complainant);       (2) The name and position or title of each Member, officer,      or employee of the Senate who is specifically alleged to have      engaged in the improper conduct or committed the violation      (hereinafter, the respondent);       (3) The nature of the alleged improper conduct or      violation, including, if possible, the specific provision of      the Senate Code of Official Conduct or other law, rule, or      regulation alleged to have been violated.       (4)(A) A statement of the facts within the personal      knowledge of the complainant that are alleged to constitute      the improper conduct or violation.       (B) The term ``personal knowledge'' is not intended to and      does not limit the complainant's statement to situations that      he or she personally witnessed or to activities in which the      complainant was a participant.       (C) Where allegations in the sworn complaint are made upon      the information and belief of the complainant, the complaint      shall so state, and shall set forth the basis for such      information and belief.       (5) The complainant must swear that all of the information      contained in the complaint either (a) is true, or (b) was      obtained under circumstances such that the complainant has      sufficient personal knowledge of the source of the      information reasonably to believe that it is true. The      complainant may so swear either by oath or by solemn      affirmation before a notary public or other authorized      official.       (6) All documents in the possession of the complainant      relevant to or in support of his or her allegations may be      appended to the complaint.       (c) Processing of Sworn Complaints:       (1) When the Committee receives a sworn complaint against a      Member, officer or employee of the Senate, it shall determine      by majority vote whether the complaint is in substantial      compliance with paragraph (b) of this rule.       (2) If it is determined by the Committee that a sworn      complaint does not substantially comply with the requirements      of paragraph (b), complaint shall be returned promptly to the      complainant, with a statement explaining how the complaint      fails to comply and a copy of the rules for filing sworn      complaints. The complainant may resubmit the complaint in the      proper form. If the complaint is not revised so that it      substantially complies with the stated requirements, the      Committee may in its discretion process the complaint in      accordance with Rule 3.       (3) A sworn complaint against any Member, officer, or      employee of the Senate that is determined by the Committee to      be in substantial compliance shall be transmitted to the      respondent within five days of the determination. The      transmittal notice shall include the date upon which the      complaint, was received, a statement that the complaint      conforms to the applicable rules, a statement that the      Committee will immediately begin an initial review of the      complaint, and a statement inviting the respondent to provide      any information relevant to the complaint to the Committee. A      copy of the Rules of the Committee shall be supplied with the      notice.    Rule 3: Procedures on Receipt of Allegations Other Than a Sworn                      Complaint; Preliminary Inquiry       (a) Unsworn Allegations or Information: Any Member or Staff      Member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, and      any other person may report to the Committee, any credible      information available to him or her that indicates that any      named or      [[Page S2895]] unnamed Member, officer or employees of the      Senate may have--       (1) violated the Senate Code of Official Conduct;       (2) violated a law;       (3) violated any rule or regulation of the Senate relating      to the conduct of individuals in the performance of their      duties as Members, officers, or employees of the Senate; or       (4) engaged in improper conduct which may reflect upon the      Senate. Such allegations or information may be reported to      the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a Committee Member, or a      Committee staff Member.       (b) Sources of Unsworn Allegations or Information: The      information to be reported to the Committee under paragraph      (a), may be obtained from a variety of sources, including but      not limited to the following:       (1) sworn complaints that do not satisfy all of the      requirements of Rule 2;       (2) anonymous or informal complaints, whether or not      satisfying the requirements of Rule 2;       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the      Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate,      including information obtained in connection with legislative      or general oversight hearings;       (4) information reported by the news media; or       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or      department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.       (c) Preliminary Inquiry:       (1) When information is presented to the Committee pursuant      to paragraph (a), it shall immediately be transmitted to the      Chairman and the Vice Chairman, for one of the following      actions:       (A) The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may      conduct or may direct the Committee staff to conduct, a      preliminary inquiry.       (B) The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly may      present the allegations or information received directly to      the Committee for it to determine whether an initial review      should be undertaken. (See paragraph (d).)       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries,      interviews, sworn statements, depositions, and subpoenas that      the Chairman and Vice Chairman deem appropriate to obtain      information      upon which to make any determination provided for by this      Rule.       (3) At the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry, the      Chairman and Vice Chairman shall receive a full report of its      findings. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly,      shall then determine what further action, if any, is      appropriate in the particular case, including any of the      following:       (A) No further action is appropriate, because the alleged      improper conduct or violation is clearly not within the      jurisdiction of the Committee;       (B) No further action is appropriate, because there is no      reason to believe that the alleged improper conduct or      violation may have occurred; or       (C) The unsworn allegations or information, and a report on      the preliminary inquiry, should be referred to the Committee,      to determine whether an initial review should be undertaken.      (See paragraph (d).)       (4) If the Chairman and the Vice Chairman are unable to      agree on a determination at the conclusion of a preliminary      inquiry, then they shall refer the allegations or information      to the Committee, with a report on the preliminary inquiry,      for the Committee to determine whether an initial review      should be undertaken. (See paragraph (d).)       (5) A preliminary inquiry shall be completed within sixty      days after the unsworn allegations or information were      received by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. The sixty day      period may be extended for a specified period by the Chairman      and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. A preliminary inquiry is      completed when the Chairman and the Vice Chairman have made      the determination required by subparagraphs (3) and (4) of      this paragraph.       (d) Determination Whether To Conduct an Initial Review:      When information or allegations are presented to the      Committee by the Chairman and the Vice Chairman, the      Committee shall determine whether an initial review should be      undertaken.       (1) An initial review shall be undertaken when--       (A) there is reason to believe on the basis of the      information before the Committee that the possible improper      conduct or violation may be within the jurisdiction of the      Committee; and       (B) there is reason to believe on the basis of the      information before the Committee that the improper conduct or      violation may have occurred.       (2) The determination whether to undertake an initial      review shall be made by recorded vote within thirty days      following the Committee's receipt of the unsworn allegations      or information from the Chairman or Vice Chairman, or at the      first meeting of the Committee thereafter if none occurs      within thirty days, unless this time is extended for a      specified period by the Committee.       (3) The Committee may determine that an initial review is      not warranted because (a) there is no reason to believe on      the basis of the information before the Committee that the      improper conduct or violation may have occurred, or (b) the      improper conduct or violation, even if proven, is not within      the jurisdiction of the Committee.       (A) If the Committee determines that an initial review is      not warranted, it shall promptly notify the complainant, if      any, and any known respondent.       (B) If there is a complainant, he or she may also be      invited to submit additional information, and notified of the      procedures for filing a sworn complaint. If the complainant      later provides additional information, not in the form of a      sworn complaint, it shall be handled as a new allegation in      accordance with the procedures of Rule 3. If he or she      submits a sworn complaint, it shall be handled in accordance      with Rule 2.       (4)(A) The Committee may determine that there is reason to      believe on the basis of the information before it that the      improper conduct or violation may have occurred and may be      within the jurisdiction of the Committee, and that an initial      review must therefore be conducted.       (B) If the Committee determines that an initial review will      be conducted, it shall promptly notify the complainant, if      any, and the respondent, if any.       (C) The notice required under subparagraph (B) shall      include a general statement of the information or allegations      before the Committee and a statement that the Committee will      immediately begin an initial review of the complaint. A copy      of the Rules of the Committee shall be supplied with the      notice.       (5) If a Member of the Committee believes that the      preliminary inquiry has provided sufficient information for      the Committee to determine whether there is substantial      credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the      Committee to conclude that a violation within the      jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred, the Member may      move that the Committee dispense with the initial review and      move directly to the determinations described in Rule 4(f).      The Committee may adopt such a motion by majority vote of the      full Committee.          rule 4: procedures for conducting an initial review       (a) Basis for Initial Review: The Committee shall promptly      commence an initial review whenever it has received either      (1) a sworn complaint that the Committee has determined is in      substantial compliance with the requirements of Rule 2, or      (2) unsworn allegations or information that have caused the      Committee to determine in accordance with Rule 3 that an      initial review must be conducted.       (b) Scope of Initial Review:       (1) The initial review shall be of such duration and scope      as may be necessary to determine whether there is substantial      credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the      Committee to conclude that a violation within the      jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.       (2) An initial review may include any inquiries,      interviews, sworn statements, depositions, and subpoenas that      the Committee deems appropriate to obtain information upon      which to make any      determination provided for by this Rule.       (c) Opportunity for Response: An initial review may include      an opportunity for any known respondent or his designated      representative, to present either a written or oral      statement, or to respond orally to questions from the      Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be      transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement      or answers.       (d) Status Reports: The Committee staff or outside counsel      shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and      according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The      reports shall be confidential.       (e) Final Report: When the initial review is completed, the      staff or outside counsel shall make a confidential report to      the Committee on findings and recommendations.       (f) Committee Action: As soon as practical following      submission of the report on the initial review, the Committee      shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is      substantial credible evidence which provides substantial      cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within      the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee      may make any of the following determinations:       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such      substantial credible evidence. In this case, the Committee      shall report its determination to the complainant, if any,      and to the respondent, together with an explanation of the      basis for the determination. The explanation may be as      detailed as the Committee desires, but it is not required to      include a complete discussion of the evidence collected in      the initial review.       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such      substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation      is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis      nature. In this case, the Committee may attempt to correct or      to prevent such violation by informal methods. The      Committee's final determination in this matter shall be      reported to the complainant, if any, and to the respondent,      if any.       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such      substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged      violation, if proven, although not of a de minimis nature,      would not be sufficiently serious to justify the severe      disciplinary actions specified in Senate Resolution 338, 88th      Congress, as amended (i.e., for a Member, censure, explusion,      or recommendation to the appropriate party conference      regarding the Member's seniority or positions of      responsibility; or for an officer or employee, suspension or      dismissal). In this case, the Committee, by the recorded      affirmative vote of at least four Members, may      [[Page S2896]] propose a remedy that it deems appropriate. If      the respondent agrees to the proposed remedy, a summary of      the Committee's conclusions and the remedy proposed and      agreed to shall be filed as a public record with the      Secretary of the Senate and a notice of the filing shall be      printed in the Congressional Record.       (4) The Committee may determine, by recorded affirmative      vote of at least four Members, that there is such substantial      credible evidence, and also either:       (A) that the violation, if proved, would be sufficiently      serious to warrant imposition of one of the severe      disciplinary actions listed in paragraph (3); or       (B) that the violation, if proven, is less serious, but was      not resolved pursuant to the procedure in paragraph (3). In      either case, the Committee shall order that an investigation      promptly be conducted in accordance with Rule 5.           rule 5: procedures for conducting an investigation       (a) Definition of Investigation: An ``investigation'' is a      proceeding undertaken by the Committee, by recorded      affirmative vote of at least four Members, after a finding on      the basis of an initial review that there is substantial      credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the      Committee to conclude that a violation within its      jurisdiction has occurred.       (b) Scope of Investigation: When the Committee decides to      conduct an investigation, it shall be of such duration and      scope as is necessary for the Committee to determine whether      a violation within its jurisdiction has occurred. In the      course of the investigation, designated outside counsel, or      if the Committee determines not to use outside counsel, the      Committee or its staff, may conduct inquiries or interviews,      take sworn statements, use compulsory process as described in      Rule 7, or take any other actions that the Committee deems      appropriate to secure the evidence necessary to make this      determination.       (c) Notice to Respondent: The Committee shall give written      notice to any know respondent who is the subject of an      investigation. The notice shall be sent to the respondent no      later than five working days after the Committee has voted to      conduct an investigation. The notice shall include a      statement of the nature of the possible violation, and a      description of the evidence indicating that a possible      violation occurred. The Committee shall offer the respondent      an opportunity to present a statement or to respond to      questions from Members of the Committee, the Committee staff,      or outside counsel.       (d) Right to a Hearing: The Committee shall accord a      respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends      disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate.       (e) Progress Report to Committee: The Committee staff or      outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee      concerning the progress of the investigation. Such reports      shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and according      to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and shall be      confidential.       (f) Report of Investigation:       (1) Upon completion of an investigation, including any      hearings held pursuant to Rule 6, the outside counsel or the      staff shall submit a confidential written report to the      Committee, which shall detail the factual findings of the      investigation and which may recommend disciplinary action, if      appropriate. Findings of the fact of the investigation shall      be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary action      is recommended.       (2) The Committee shall consider the report of the staff or      outside counsel promptly following its submission. The      Committee shall prepare and submit a report to the Senate,      including a recommendation to the Senate concerning      disciplinary action, if appropriate. A report shall be      issued, stating in detail the Committee's findings of fact,      whether or not disciplinary action is recommended. The report      shall also explain fully the reasons underlying the      Committee's recommendation concerning disciplinary action, if      any. No recommendation or resolution of the Committee      concerning the investigation of a Member, officer or employee      of the Senate may be approved except by the affirmative      recorded vote of not less than four Members of the Committee.       (3) Promptly, after the conclusion of the investigation,      the Committee's report and recommendation shall be forwarded      to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy shall be provided      to the complainant and the respondent. The full report and      recommendation shall be printed and made public, unless the      Committee determines by majority vote that it should remain      confidential.                    Rule 6: Procedures for Hearings       (a) Right to Hearing: The Committee may hold a public or      executive hearing in any inquiry, initial review,      investigation, or other proceeding. The Committee shall      accord a respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it      recommends disciplinary action against that respondent to the      Senate. (See Rule 5(d).)       (b) Non-Public Hearings: The Committee may at any time      during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b)      of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to      receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive      session. If a witness desires to express a preference for      testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall      so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she      is scheduled to testify.       (c) Adjudicatory Hearings: The Committee may, by majority      vote, designate any public or executive hearing as an      adjudicatory hearing; and, any hearing which is concerned      with possible disciplinary action against a respondent or      respondents designated by the Committee shall be an      adjudicatory hearing. In any adjudicatory hearing, the      procedures described in paragraph (j) shall apply.       (d) Subpoena Power: The Committee may require, by subpoena      or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses      and the production of such correspondence, books, papers,      documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule      7.)       (e) Notice of Hearings: The Committee shall make public an      announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any      hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).       (f) Presiding Officer: The Chairman shall preside over the      hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice      Chairman is also absent, a Committee Member designated by the      Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is      required, it shall be administered to a witness by the      Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee      Member.       (g) Witnesses:       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served      on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled      appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time,      as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing      and to employ counsel if desired.       (2) The Committee may, by majority vote, rule that no      Member of the Committee or staff or outside counsel shall      make public the name of any witness subpoenaed by the      Committee before the date of that witness' scheduled      appearance, except as specifically authorized by the Chairman      and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written      statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy      of such statement with the Committee at least two working      days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to      be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine      whether such statements may be read or placed in the record      of the hearing.       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted      to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she      desires to do so.       (h) Right To Testify: Any person whose name is mentioned or      who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in      testimony or in statements made by a Committee Member, staff      Member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably      believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or      her reputation may--       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to      testify in his or her own behalf; or       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the      testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she      complained. Such request and such statement shall be      submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.       (i) Conduct of Witnesses and Other Attendees: The Presiding      Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by      censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by      majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender      be cited for contempt of Congress.       (j) Adjudicatory Hearing Procedures:       (1) Notice of hearings: A copy of the public announcement      of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall      be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all      witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise      summoned to testify.       (2) Preparation for adjudicatory hearings:       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of      an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the      following information and documents to the respondent, if      any:       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the      hearing;       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as      exhibits at the hearing; and       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony      expected to be given by each witness to be called at the      hearing.       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of      an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall      provide the information and documents described in divisions      (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and      documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be      subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and      disclosure.       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and      documents to the Committee (see A) and (B) of this      subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual      violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the      Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that      the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.       (3) Swearing of witnesses: All witnesses who testify at      adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding      Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have      to be sworn.       (4) Right to counsel: Any witness at an adjudicatory      hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own      choosing, who shall      [[Page S2897]] be permitted to advise the witness of his or      legal rights during the testimony.       (5) Right to cross-examine and call witnesses:       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent who is the      subject of an investigation, and any other person who obtains      the permission of the Committee, may personally or through      counsel cross-examine witnesses called by the Committee and      may call witnesses in his or her own behalf.       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the      issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the      production of documents on his or her behalf. An application      shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent      that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and      appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or      other individual given permission by the Committee, each such      witness shall first be examined by the party who called the      witness or by the party's counsel.       (D) At least one working day before a witness' scheduled      appearance, a witness or a witness' counsel may submit to the      Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that      witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary,      such questions may be asked by any Member of the Committee,      or by any Committee staff Member if directed by a Committee      Member. The witness or witness' counsel may also submit      additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four      hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The      insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject      to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting      jointly within five days after the testimony is received.       (6) Admissibility of evidence:       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the      truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall      be admissible unless privileged under the Federal Rules of      Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly,      but the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly      repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight      that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of      the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to      the Committee. Such rules shall be final unless reversed or      modified by a majority vote of the Committee before the      recess of that day's hearings.       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter      before the Committee involving allegations of sexual      discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual      misconduct, by a Member, officer, or employee within the      jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided      by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal      Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit      evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only      upon a determination of a majority of the Members of the full      Committee that the interests of justice require that such      evidence be admitted.       (7) Supplementary hearing procedures: The Committee may      adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems      necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory      hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be      furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made      available upon request to any Member of the public.       (k) Transcripts:       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall      be made of all public and executive hearings. Any Member of      the Committee, Committee staff Member, outside counsel      retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of      the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own      remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any      typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter      declines to make the requested corrections, the Member, staff      Member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by      the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any Member or      witness shall return the transcript with suggested      corrections to the Committee offices within five working days      after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is      practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session,      the Member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a      location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting      jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing      and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the      Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to      the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is      practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The      Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the      transcript of a hearing to be printed without the      corrections of a Member or witness if they determine that      such Member or witness has been afforded a reasonable time      to correct such transcript and such transcript has not      been returned within such time.       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost,      one transcript copy of that witness' testimony given at a      public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive      session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon      request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions      prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any      individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the      Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be      cited for contempt of Congress.                   rule 7: subpoenas and depositions       (a) Subpoenas:       (1) Authorization for Issuance: Subpoenas for the      attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or      hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and      tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and      places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by      either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the      Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time      before a preliminary inquiry, for the purpose of obtaining      information to evaluate unsworn allegations or information,      or at any time during a preliminary inquiry, initial review,      investigation, or other proceeding.       (2) Signature and Service: All subpoenas shall be signed by      the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any      person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by      the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served      with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief      statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.       (3) Withdrawal of Subpoena: The Committee, by majority      vote, may withdraw any subpoena authorized for issuance by it      or authorized for issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman,      acting jointly. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting      jointly, may withdraw any subpoena authorized for issuance by      them.       (b) Depositions:       (1) Persons Authorized To Take Depositions: Depositions may      be taken by any Member of the Committee, designated by the      Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other      person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting      jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other      employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to      the Committee.       (2) Deposition Notices: Notices for the taking of      depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the      Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the      Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff Member or      outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman,      acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time before a      preliminary inquiry, for the purpose of obtaining information      to evaluate unsworn allegations or information, or at any      time during a preliminary inquiry, initial review,      investigation, or other proceeding. Deposition notices shall      specify a time and place for examination. Unless otherwise      specified, the deposition shall be in private, and the      testimony taken and documents produced shall be deemed for      the purpose of these rules to have been received in a closed      or executive session of the Committee. The Committee shall      not initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil      enforcement proceedings for a witness's failure to appear, or      to testify, or to produce documents, unless the deposition      notice was accompanied by a subpoena authorized for issuance      by the Committee, or the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting      jointly.       (3) Counsel at Depositions: Witnesses may be accompanied at      a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.       (4) Deposition Procedure: Witnesses at depositions shall be      examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized      by law to administer oaths, or administered by any Member of      the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded      by any person or persons who are authorized to take      depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a      question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a      document, any Member of the Committee who is present may rule      on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct      the witness to answer the question or produce the document.      If no Member of the Committee is present, the individual who      has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting      jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the      deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time,      seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from      the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may refer      the matter to the Committee or rule on the objection. If the      Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon referral,      overrules the objection, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the      Committee as the case may be, may direct the witness to      answer the question or produce the document. The Committee      shall not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal      enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify or produce      documents after having been directed to do so.       (5) Filing of Depositions: Deposition testimony shall be      transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is      transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall      certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in      his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that      the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The      transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the      chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be      furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices      for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time      limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly,      a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to      correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring      to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the      witness's testimony by submitting a sworn      statement about those facts with a request that it be      [[Page S2898]] attached to the transcript. The Chairman and      Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may rule on the witness's      request, and the changes or attachments allowed shall be      certified by the Committee's chief clerk. If the witness      fails to make any request under this paragraph within the      time limit set, this fact shall be noted by the Committee's      chief clerk. Any person authorized by the Committee may      stipulate with the witness to changes in this procedure. rule 8: violations of law; perjury; legislative recommendations; and                applicable rules and standards of conduct       (a) Violations of Law: Whenever the Committee determines by      majority vote that there is reason to believe that a      violation of law may have occurred, it shall report such      possible violation to the proper state and federal      authorities.       (b) Perjury: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears      falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to      the Committee does so under penalty of perjury. The Committee      may refer any such case to the Attorney General for      prosecution.       (c) Legislative Recommendations: The Committee shall      recommend to the Senate by report or resolution such      additional rules, regulations, or other legislative measures      as it determines to be necessary or desirable to ensure      proper standards of conduct by Members, officers, or      employees of the Senate. The Committee may conduct such      inquiries as it deems necessary to prepare such a report or      resolution, including the holding of hearings in public or      executive session and the use of subpoenas to compel the      attendance of witnesses or the production of materials. The      Committee may make legislative recommendations as a result of      its findings in an initial review, investigation, or other      proceeding.       (d) Applicable Rules and Standards of Conduct:       (1) No initial review or investigation shall be made of an      alleged violation of any law, rule, regulation, or provision      of the Senate Code of Official Conduct which was not in      effect at the time the alleged violation occurred. No      provision of the Senate Code of Official Conduct shall apply      to, or require disclosure of any act, relationship, or      transaction which occurred prior to the effective date of the      applicable provision of the code.       (2) The Committee may conduct an initial review or      investigation of an alleged violation of a rule or law which      was in effect prior to the enactment of the Senate code of      Official Conduct if the alleged violation occurred while such      rule or law was in effect and the violation was not a matter      resolved on the merits by the predecessor Committee.  rule 9: procedures for handling committee sensitive and classified                                materials       (a) Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive materials:       (1) Committee Sensitive information or material is      information or material in the possession of the Select      Committee on Ethics which pertains to illegal or improper      conduct by a present or former member, officer, or employee      of the Senate; to allegations or accusation of such conduct;      to any resulting preliminary inquiry, initial review, or      investigation by the Select Committee on Ethics into such      allegations or conduct; to the investigative techniques and      procedures of the Select Committee on Ethics; or to other      information or material designated by the staff director, or      outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall      establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the      unauthorized disclosure of Committee Sensitive information in      the possession of the Committee or its staff. Procedures for      protecting Committee Sensitive materials shall be in writing      and shall be given to each Committee staff Member.       (b) Procedures for Handling Classified Materials:       (1) Classified information on material is information or      material which is specifically designated as classified under      the authority of Executive Order 11652 requiring protection      of such information or material from unauthorized disclosure      in order to prevent damage to the United States.       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall      establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the      unauthorized disclosure of classified information in the      possession of the Committee or its staff. Procedures for      handling such information shall be in writing and a copy of      the procedures shall be given to each staff Member cleared      for access to classified information.       (3) Each Member of the Committee shall have access to      classified material in the Committee's possession. Only      Committee staff Members with appropriate security clearances      and a need-to-know, as approved by the Chairman and Vice      Chairman, acting jointly, shall have access to classified      information in the Committee's possession.       (c) Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive and      Classified Documents:       (1) Committee Sensitive and classified documents and      materials shall be segregated in secure filing safes.

As soon as possible, and in no      event later than 10 days after receipt by the Office of a      request for review or the Office's filing of a request for      review with the Committee, the Office shall transmit to the      Committee the full and complete record of the hearing board      connected with the decision for which review has been      requested. The Chief Clerk of the Committee shall promptly      serve notice of the Committee's receipt of the record on all      parties. [[Page S2901]] Rule 4. PROCEDURES UPON RECEIPT OF A REQUEST FOR REVIEW                       OF A HEARING BOARD DECISION       4.1 Briefs and Arguments.       (a) Petitioner brief. A party who filed a request for      review, or the Office if it requested review, may file a      brief in support of its position. The brief shall be filed      with the Committee and a copy served on any other party and      the Office, if it requested review, within 10 days of the      filing of the request for review with the Office, or the      Committee if the Office requested review.       (b) Respondent brief. A party may file a brief in response      to a petitioner's brief. Such respondent brief shall be filed      with the Committee and a copy served on any other party and      the Office, it the Office filed a request for review, within      15 days after service of the petitioner brief. If no      petitioner brief is filed, such respondent brief shall be      filed within 20 days of filing of the request for review. The      Office may file a respondent brief only if it failed a      request for review.       (c) Reply brief. Any reply brief shall be filed with the      Committee and served on all parties and the Office if it      requested review, within 5 days after service of the      respondent brief to which it replies. No one may file a reply      brief who did not file a petitioner brief.       (d) Alternative briefing schedule. With notice to all      parties and the Office, if it requested review, the Committee      may specify a different briefing schedule than that      prescribed by subsections 4.1 (a), (b) and (c).       (e) Additional briefs. At its discretion, the Committee may      direct or permit additional written briefs.       (f) Requirements for briefs. Briefs shall be on 8\1/2\ inch      by 11 inch paper, one side only, and 15 copies shall be      provided. No brief shall exceed 50 typewritten double spaced      pages, excluding any table of contents, list of authorities,      or attached copies of statutes, rules, or regulations.      Footnotes shall not be used excessively to evade this      limitation. All references to evidence or information in the      record must be accompanied by notations indicating the page      or pages where such evidence or information appears in the      record.       (g) Oral argument. At the request of a party or the Office,      the Committee may permit oral argument in exceptional      circumstances. A request for oral argument must specify the      circumstances which are asserted to be exceptional.       4.2 Remand.       (a) Only one Remand. There are two kinds of ramand. The      Committee may remand the record respecting a decision, or it      may remand the case respecting a decision, but in no event      can there be more than one remand with respect to a decision      of a hearing board. If the Committee remands the record      respecting a decision, there can be no further remand of any      kind with respect to such decision. If the Committee remands      the case respecting a decision, there can be no remand of any      kind with respect to a hearing board decision issued      following remand. A Committee decision remanding to the      hearing board shall contain a written statement of the      reasons for the Committee decision.       (b) Remand of the Record. Within the time for a decision      under subsection 308(d) of the Act, the Committee may remand      the record of a decision to the hearing board for the purpose      of supplementing the record. After the hearing board has      supplemented the record as directed by the Committee, the      hearing board shall transmit the record to the Office, and      the Office shall immediately notify the parties of the      hearing board's action and transmit the supplemented record      to the Committee. The Committee retains jurisdiction over a      request for review during remand of the record, and no new      request for review is needed for further Committee      consideration under section 308 of the Act. A record shall be      deemed remanded to the hearing board until the day the      Committee receives the supplemented record from the Office,      and the Committee shall transmit a written final decision to      the Office not later than 60 calendar days during which the      Senate is in session after receipt of the record as      supplemented on remand. The Committee may extend the 60 day      period for 15 days during which the Senate is in session.       (c) Remand of the Case. Within the time for a decision      under subsection 308(d) of the Act, the Committee may remand      the case to the hearing board for the purpose of further      consideration. After further consideration, the hearing board      shall issue a new written decision with respect to the matter      as provided in section 307 of the Act. If the Committee      remands the case to the hearing board, the Committee does not      retain jurisdiction, and a new request for review, filed in      accordance with Rule 3, will be necessary if a party or the      Office seeks review of a decision issued following remand.       4.3 Final Written Decision. All final decisions shall      include a statement of the reasons for the Committee's      decision, together with dissenting views of Committee      members, if any, and shall be transmitted to the Office not      later than 60 calendar days during which the Senate is in      session after filing of a request for review. The period for      transmission to the Office of a final decision may be      extended by the Committee for 15 calendar days during which      the Senate is in session. A final written decision of the      Committee with respect to a request for review may affirm,      modify, or reverse the hearing board decision in whole or in      part. The Committee may decide not to grant a request for      review of a hearing board decision. The Committee will serve      a copy of any final decision on all parties.        Rule 5. Hearing Board Referral of Testimonial Objections       5.1 Procedure for Ruling on Testimonial Objections. If any      witness to a hearing board proceeding appearing by subpoena      objects to a question and refuses to testify, or refuses to      produce a document, a hearing board may refer the objection      to the Committee for a ruling. Such referrals may be made by      telephone or otherwise to the Chairman or Vice Chairman of      the Committee who may rule on the objection or refer the      matter to the Committee for decision. If the Chairman or Vice      Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, overrules the      objection, the Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee as      the case may be, may direct the witness to answer the      question or produce the document. The Committee, or the      Chairman or Vice Chairman, shall rule on objections as      expeditiously as possible.       5.2 Enforcement. The Committee may make recommendations to      the Senate, including recommendations for criminal or civil      enforcement, with respect to the failure or refusal of any      person to appear or produce documents in obedience to a      subpoena or order of a hearing board, or for the failure or      refusal of any person to answer questions during his or her      appearance as a witness in a proceeding under section 307 of      the Act. The Office shall be deemed a Senate committee for      purposes of section 1365 of Title 28 of the United States      Code.                      Rule 6. MEETINGS AND VOTING       6.1 Quorum, Proxies, Recorded Votes. A majority of the      members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for      purposes of issuing a decision under section 308 of the Act,      and for purposes of hearing oral argument if such argument is      permitted. Proxy votes shall not be considered for the      purpose of establishing a quorum, nor for purposes of      decisions under section 308 (c) and (d) of the Act. Decisions      of the Committee under section 308 (c) or (d) of the Act      shall be by recorded vote.       6.2 Meetings. Meetings to consider matters before the      Committee pursuant to the Act may be held at the call of the      Chairman or Vice Chairman, if at least 48 hours notice is      furnished to all Members. If all Members agree, a meeting may      be held on less than 48 hours notice.                 Rule 7. CONFIDENTIALITY OF PROCEEDINGS       Confidentiality. The final written decision of the      Committee shall be made public if the decision is in favor of      a Senate employee who filed a complaint or if the decision      reverses a decision of the hearing board which had been in      favor of the employee. The Select Committee may decide to      release any other decision at its discretion. All testimony,      records, or documents received by the Committee in the course      of any review under these rules shall otherwise be deemed      ``Committee Sensitive Information'' and subject to the ``Non-     Disclosure Policy and Agreement'' as prescribed in Rule 9 of      the Committee's Supplemental Rules of Procedure.                    Rule 8. AUTHORITY TO DISCIPLINE       Official Misconduct. None of the provisions of the Act or      these rules limit the authority of the Committee under S.      Res. 338, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964), as amended, to      otherwise review, investigate, and report to the Senate with      respect to violations of the Senate Code of Official Conduct,      or any other rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the      conduct of individuals in the performance of their duties as      members, officers, or employees of the Senate.                               ____________________
