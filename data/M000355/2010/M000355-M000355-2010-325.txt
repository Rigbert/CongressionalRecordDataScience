 President, a little earlier today, the President signed the Democratic health spending bill into law, and he used the occasion to point out a number of things he wants people to know about it. Now he will travel around the country, talking up the bill to a skeptical public. Clearly, Democrats in Washington still do not get it. Americans already know what is in this bill. That is precisely why they do not like it.  Most Americans out there are not celebrating today.
