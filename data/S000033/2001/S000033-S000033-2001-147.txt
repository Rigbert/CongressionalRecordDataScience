 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I am asking that these statements be printed in the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.    On Behalf of Blake Kinkaid, Craig Stevens, and Brittany Chandler               regarding tobacco prevention--may 7, 2001       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Now we are going up to the Northeast      Kingdom and the Northeast Kingdom Youth Services. Who is      going to begin?       BLAKE KINKAID: Blake Kinkaid.       BRITTANY CHANDLER: Brittany Chandler.       CRAIG STEVENS: Craig Stevens.       BLAKE KINKAID: That's a pretty tough act to follow, you      guys. I have been watching it. The whole Napster thing. That      is awesome. The cannabis thing. It is kind of hard to follow      up on, but Josh, the whole tobacco thing killed a lot more      people. He said that cannabis hadn't. Tobacco kills one      person every fourteen seconds, different related disease such      as cancer, heart disease, or anything like that. My dad, he      has been a smoker ever since he was 14. And it has been a big      shock to me. Last night, he was put in the hospital because      of his heart. He is 40 years old. He just turned 40, and he      is having heart problems through all the smoking. It scared      the crap out of me, because it is exactly what my grandfather      did when he was on his deathbed. Well, emphysema. He had      smoked all his life too. And I just realized: Oh, my god! I      wonder how many other people have to go through this every      day. And it is really hard. and our group, we belong to a      group called OVE, Our Voices Exposed, that helps get the      prevention world for tobacco. Brittany is a new member who      just started, and Craig is with me from the beginning. And we      help put out the word about prevention, such as we give kids      an alternative activity to do to keep them out of trouble.      And Craig will elaborate on it.       CRAIG STEVENS: We are going to be having a dance coming up      this Friday.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Try to speak a little bit louder. We      don't have a mike. Sorry.       CRAIG STEVENS: We have going to have a dance this Friday,      and we have had--what?--three dances in the past.       BLAKE KINKAID: Five.       CRAIG STEVENS: Five. We had five dances. We have had      sliding parties, bowling, pizza parties. We have had a whole      lot of stuff I can't remember.       BLAKE KINKAID: We have had cookouts at Lake Willoughby and      Harvey's Lake sometimes. We have had jamborees down there in      the summer, having a battle of the bands, and we had a      haunted house that brought over 300 people. Everything we do      has a nonsubstance theme. We have these things to try to keep      kids off tobacco, and we try to give them something to do. I      found the biggest cause of smoking and all other substance      use in boredom. that is why I started, just boredom, pretty      much.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Brittany, do you want to add anything?       BRITTANY CHANDLER: Well, most of my friends smoke, and I      have noticed that my friends that do smoke, most of them      don't do activities and stuff. And so they have nothing to do      with their time, and just sit around and smoke and      everything. And most of the people are around people that      smoke, like their parents and stuff.    On Behalf of Danielle Harvey, Andrea Shahan, and Stephanie GrayRegarding OPPOSITION TO PARENTAL NOTIFICATION FOR ABORTION--May 7, 2001       DANIELLE HARVEY: This year, the Vermont House has discussed      the question of making parental notification for abortion a      requirement. We feel that this would be making a big mistake.      Having to tell your parents you are sexually active is hard      enough; having to tell them that you are pregnant as a result      could be dangerous, maybe even life-threatening. For this      reason, as well as others, some girls delay in telling their      parents about the predicament, which could cause some major      health risks, such as: When someone goes out of state to      avoid parental involvement laws, they are putting themselves      at risk during the trip home, because there may be long      stretches where medical care is not readily available.      Parents who are opposed to abortion Might force their      daughters to carry the babies to Term, regardless of any      possible or known health or life risks. Or a woman who is      pregnant and a few months short of her 18th birthday may wait      until she is 18 to have the abortion. A delay of even five      days can cause major complication in a procedure. If the      government and the state of Vermont, as well as the national      government, wants what is best for the nation's youth, they      should leave parents out of a girl's decision to have an      abortion. The decision is hard enough to make on her own, and      adding parents to the situation makes it almost impossible.       STEFANIE GRAY: If a child is forced to tell her parents      that she is pregnant, then her parents would know that she is      sexually active. Most of the time, parents don't approve.      Finding out she is sexually active and pregnant could cause      verbal or physical abuse by her parents. The girl's parents      may force her to go through with the pregnancy, or they may      even kick her out. Family breakdown is a major result from      girls telling their parents that they're pregnant and want an      abortion. Girls that don't have a good relationship with      their parents to begin with will probably make it worse and      risk abuse. Families with good relationships don't need the      law, because they are supportive. Then again, you might lose      the family trust. In unsupportive families, the law will be      ineffective because the families would be more likely to be      abusive and add to the family's problems.       ANDREA SHAHAN: Some supporters of parental notification      concede that some parents can become abusive when they learn      their daughter wants to receive an abortion, and they have      offered an option of going before a judge, instead of their      parents, to get permission to receive an abortion. This      option is known as the judicial waiver. Women who live in      sparsely populated areas usually have difficulty receiving a      judicial waiver, since easy access to a judge is not      possible. Women who live in large cities, however, have easy      access to courthouses, therefore not making it fair to many      women in the U.S. In receiving a judicial review,      confidentiality is not guaranteed. Many teens lack the      knowledge and experience of court procedures to obtain a      waiver. Students who need to attend their hearings will not      be able to do so during school hours. Many of the court      judges are very strongly pro-life. Even though the Supreme      Court requires judges to issue a waiver if the teen is mature      or if an abortion is in her best interests, several judges      still deny them a waiver. Judge Nixon, of the District Court      in Tennessee estimated that, even under the best      Circumstances, the judicial waiver process would take 22 days      to complete. This becomes a significant problem, given the      time-sensitive nature of pregnancy, and the risk involved in      later abortions. Representative Sanders, we oppose any      efforts to put into effect parental notification under      Vermont law, and we hope that you will oppose any efforts at      the federal level as well. Thank you, Mr. Sanders.                               ____________________
