Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my esteemed colleague, Mr. Tom Coburn's amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. His amendment restores funding to local schools which receive funding from the Department of Education to support the special educational needs of Alaska Native or American Indian students. While Mr. Coburn's amendment does not restore the Office of Indian Education, it provides for program funds within the Department of Education to schools who provide academic tutoring, personal counseling, career counseling and other services to Alaska Native and American Indian students who are at risk. As a former educator, I believe it is vital that native students be given a fair opportunity to achieve their highest potential. I urge my colleagues to vote for the Coburn amendment to restore $52 million for the Department of Education program funding to schools who help disadvantaged children meet high standards.
