 President, the Senator from Kentucky just told us that he wants dialogue with Russia, he wants diplomacy with Russia, and that he thinks it is important that we communicate with Russia. I agree. Who disagrees with that? There is not one word in this resolution that suggests that the United States of America should not aggressively engage in diplomacy with Russia to ease the tensions that exist between the two countries. What the Senator said is totally irrelevant to what is in this resolution.  What this resolution says is that we are going to tell Russia: Stop interfering in our elections.  What this resolution is about is telling Russia to stop interfering with the elections in democratic countries all over the world.  What this resolution is about is saying that we should implement the sanctions overwhelmingly voted for by Congress.  What this resolution is about is that we will not accept interference with the ongoing investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  What this resolution says is that the President must cooperate with the investigation of Mr. Mueller.  That is what this resolution is about. It has nothing to do with ending diplomacy with Russia at all. That is inaccurate.  I would hope that, if not today, in the very near future, Republicans will join Democrats and do the right thing in our effort to preserve American democracy.
