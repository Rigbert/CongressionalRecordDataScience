President, I rise to recognize the life work of Mr. Tom Campbell as he retires from Dow Agrosciences after more than 40 years of dedicated service. Tom will leave a legacy of leadership and a belief in the unlimited potential of American agriculture.  Mr. Campbell joined the Dow Chemical Company agriculture division in 1965 as a field representative servicing corn and soybean producers in Illinois and Missouri. From there, he transferred to Louisiana to work with producers of sugar cane, rice, soybeans, sweet potatoes, cotton, strawberries, timber, and livestock. He moved to Hawaii in 1973 as manager for the company's Hawaii operations where he worked with sugar cane, pineapple, and fresh fruit producers as well as customers of product groups Dow served. In 1975, Mr. Campbell was moved to Midland, MI, to manage the market introduction of a new insecticide into the cotton and corn markets in North America. Transferring to Dallas, TX, he then managed product sales for Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Montana, North and South Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. He then returned to Michigan to manage the marketing of agricultural products serving the rangeland and industrial vegetation markets of North America.  In 1989, he became the Federal Government Affairs manager, based in Washington, DC. In this capacity, Mr. Campbell has been responsible for Federal legislative activities, interfacing with governmental agencies on regulatory matters, continued involvement and cooperation with domestic trade associations, and support to business development in other countries. Mr. Campbell held this position until his retirement on December 31, 2005.  On the home front, Tom and his wife Lynda have raised two sons, been members of the St. John's Episcopal Church of McLean, VA, and are active in numerous community groups and boards, from the Langley High School Boosters Club to their local homeowners association.  In this business, there are people who tell you what you want to hear and people who tell you what you need to hear. Tom Campbell has always been someone who tells me and other Members of Congress what we need to hear, and I thank him for that.  The reason that I mention all these things, the reason that Mr. Campbell has had such a long and rich career, of course can be traced back to his roots on a wheat and cattle farm in Mitchell County, KS, and the bachelor's degree in animal science he earned at Kansas State University. Kansans join me in celebrating the many accomplishments of Tom Campbell.                          ____________________[Page S508]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     THE RETIREMENT OF TOM CAMPBELL
