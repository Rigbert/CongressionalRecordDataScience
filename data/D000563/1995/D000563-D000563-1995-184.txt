Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I stand in strong support of the Callahan-Clayton amendment. This 502 program is critically important to lower-income working families and smalltown America. The gentleman from Alabama is right. There are people waiting in line for a piece of the American dream. We have got to not only add the money that was suggested, but keep looking for more. I will be working with the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen] to accomplish that, and I thank my colleague for his leadership as well as the gentlewoman from North Carolina.
