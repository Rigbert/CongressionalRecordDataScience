President, I thank my friend from the Northwest. We worked it out so I could talk a little bit about Medicare and taxes as well.  Before Senator Enzi leaves, I just want to tell him he is someone who gives public service a good name. We have spent a lot of time working together on a variety of issues, such as tax reform, and particularly this idea of transition rules. I just want to tell the Senator how much I appreciate the way he approaches problem solving. I would say to colleagues that what I have not been able to figure out for the 10 years this debate has gone on is how we are going to make this work for America's innovators and small businesses. Let me give just a couple examples and be very brief.  What concerns me most about the bill as it is written today is State revenue collectors, under this legislation, in effect, will be outsourcing their jobs to America's small businesses, America's innovators. If the bill passes in its present form, those small businesses, our innovators, are going to spend their time trying to figure out how to collect all these taxes across the land rather than creating jobs. I don't think that is anything any of us want to do, Democrats or Republicans. That is point No. 1.  Second, I wish to talk about the international implications of this bill. Senator Murray and I and others, including Senator Baucus, are very close to the border. What concerns me, especially after the legal analysis I received from the Congressional Research Service, is I think the way this bill is going to work, people are going to end up calling it the shop Canada bill or maybe the shop Mexico bill or, what is even more ominous, the shop China bill. I wish to describe exactly why that is the case using the legal analysis from the Congressional Research Service.  The proposal, of course, requires American businesses to collect sales taxes on behalf of 45 State revenue collectors, but it imposes no such burden on foreign retailers that sell into the United States. So an Oregon business would have to collect taxes for New York, but Chinese firms wouldn't have to collect taxes for any State. Washington State businesses would have to collect taxes for Idaho, but Canadian firms are under no such obligation. I ask my colleagues: What is fair about sacking these American small businesses, these entrepreneurs, which are adding so much value to the new economy, to make it even more difficult for our small businesses to compete with Canadian sellers and European sellers and Chinese sellers? This bill as written is going to be a huge boon, for example, for the idea of setting up online businesses in Canada.  Small businesses all across the country, especially those that are near the border, in my view, would have every financial incentive to incorporate there. For the life of me, I don't see how that could be good for the American economy or fair to American firms that, for a variety of reasons, are not capable of moving.  Senator Alexander was spot on in terms of talking about how we should look to States rights--I am certainly interested in that--but let's not do it so that in a globalized economy, we make it even tougher for American innovators to compete.  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a legal memorandum that was prepared for me by the Congressional Research Service that describes in great detail the unfairness the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act would create for American firms in a global economy.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Congressional Research Service,                                                    July 23, 2012.     To: Senator Ron Wyden; Attention: Jayme White     From: Steven Maguire, Specialist in Public Finance, 7-7841;          Jeanne Grimmett, Legislative Attorney, 7-5046; Erika          Lunder, Legislative Attorney, 7-4538     Subject: Analysis of Possible Modifications to the          Marketplace Fairness Act, S. 1832.       This memorandum responds to your questions about the      ``Marketplace Fairness Act,'' (S. 1832). The Marketplace      Fairness Act (MFA) would modify current law to allow state      tax authorities to compel out-of-state vendors to collect      sales and use taxes. Your office asked CRS to: (1) analyze      the impact of expanding the MFA to require foreign sellers to      collect and remit sales tax; (2) identify legislative      proposals to achieve this and assess if these are consistent      with international trade rules; and (3) suggest other taxes      that could be collected and remitted if MFA were to become      law.       Generally, extending state sales and use tax collection      authority beyond international borders could be complicated      both administratively and legally. Under current law, states      may only impose sales and use tax collection responsibilities      on out-of-state sellers of goods and services to in-state      persons if the seller has a ``physical presence'' in that      state. This nexus standard is required by the Commerce Clause      of the U.S. Constitution. When no physical presence exists,      then the state sales and use taxes would apply to these      transactions, though remittance of the tax would fall to the      in-state buyer to the extent prescribed by state law. So,      when the seller does not have a physical presence in the      taxing state, the buyer is typically responsible for      remitting the tax to the state.       For example, consider a consumer in Virginia who purchases      a camera over the Internet or by phone from a retailer based      in New York state. The camera retailer does not have an      outlet or a physical presence (substantial nexus) in      Virginia. The New York retailer is not required to collect      New York sales taxes because the transaction does not occur      at the retail outlet and the customer is not a resident of      New York state. And, the retailer is not required to collect      the Virginia sales tax because the retailer has no physical      presence in Virginia. The Virginia consumer, however, is      required to remit the use tax to the state.       Under its authority to regulate commerce, Congress has the      power to authorize state action that would otherwise be an      unconstitutional burden on interstate or foreign commerce, so      long as it is consistent with other provisions in the      Constitution. The Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA), if enacted,      would be an example of Congress exercising that power. Under      the MFA, Congress would authorize states to shift the burden      for sales and use tax collection from the in-state consumer      to the out-of-state seller as long as the state had either      adopted the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA)      or if the state implemented ``minimum simplification      requirements.'' If either criteria are met, then the state      could impose sales     and use tax collection liability on any remote vendor if the      sale was sourced to that state under the sourcing rules in      the SSUTA or the act. Neither set of sourcing rules are      restricted to physical presence. So, for the states meeting      either criteria, the bill would essentially change the nexus      standard under the Commerce Clause by removing the      requirement that the seller have a physical presence in the      taxing state. While the bill would expand the authority of      these states to impose sales and use tax collection      obligations on remote vendors, it does not provide the states      with additional enforcement mechanisms or authority. As      discussed below, states could have difficulty in enforcing      the law with respect to foreign vendors with little U.S.      presence. CRS was not able to find any legislative proposals      that would provide such a mechanism. Since no specific piece      of legislation has been proposed, the following discussion of      possible trade agreement implications is only a general one.       Removing the ``physical presence'' requirement does not      mean that all remote vendors would be subject to the state      collection responsibilities. First and foremost, nexus is      also required by the due process guarantees of the Fourteenth      Amendment. Unlike the Commerce Clause's nexus requirement,      Congress may not change the standard required by the      Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, even if MFA were enacted into      law, states could still not impose sales and use tax      collection responsibilities on entities that did not have      sufficient contact with the state required for due process.      Furthermore, it is possible that other domestic laws could      also limit the ability of states to impose the collection      obligations. For example, state law might contain exceptions      or other provisions that limit or remove the liability in      some cases.       With respect to international law, in general, the United      States, or a subdivision thereof, could tax a sale by a non-     U.S. merchant to a person in the United States without      running afoul of what has been considered to be a consensus      view of international law regarding a nation's jurisdiction      to prescribe tax laws. As set out in the Restatement (Third)      of Foreign Relations Law:       A State may exercise jurisdiction to tax a transaction that      occurs, originates or terminates in its territory or that has      a substantial relation to the state, without regard to the      nationality, domicile, residence, or presence of the parties      to such a transaction.       The Restatement further explains that taxes on transactions      that occur, originate or terminate in a state ``include      sales, value-added, excise and severance taxes, as well as      export taxes and customs duties.'' It further notes that      ``states impose sales and excise taxes or customs duties on      transactions in or touching the state, regardless of the      relationship between the participants and the state,'' but      that ``[a]n excise or tariff . . . may be imposed on a person      participating in a transaction by reason of that person's      relationship to the taxing site even though the transaction      occurs outside the state's territory.'' This latter principle      would appear to have relevance for Internet or mail order      transactions involving non-U.S. vendors, where the sales      transaction itself may legally be sited outside the United      States but the purchaser is located within this country.      Further, under international law, if a state has jurisdiction      for prescribing a rule of law, it also has jurisdiction to      enforce that rule, be it through judicial or nonjudicial      means.       At the same time, regardless of its status under      international law, a requirement that places the burden of      collecting the tax on a non-U.S. vendor with no ties to the      United States or a particular U.S. state other than the sales      themselves would seemingly pose practical problems with      regard to its implementation. It appears difficult to      envision a workable mechanism by which the United States      could compel such a vendor in a foreign country to collect a      U.S. tax. In this regard, punitive trade measures, such as      prohibiting the importation of products from foreign      companies that fail to collect the tax, would appear to raise      issues under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994      (GATT 1994). For example, GATT Article XI:1 generally      prohibits the imposition of quantitative restrictions on      imports from other WTO Member countries and a U.S. measure      violating this provision would need to be justified under one      of the general exceptions set out at GATT Article XX. It may      be that, for practical purposes, implementation of a tax      collection requirement imposed on non-U.S. vendors that in      fact have no nexus to the U.S. state imposing the tax may      call for some sort of reciprocal agreement between the United      States and countries in which such vendors are legally      constituted. Whether such an agreement is feasible,      however, is far from clear and beyond the scope of this      memo.       Finally, some have noted that U.S. based retailers may      respond to the expanded state tax collection authority by      shifting operations outside the U.S. to avoid the collection      burden. The costs of moving operations and increased shipping      costs, however, would seem greater than any benefit conferred      by avoiding the collection burden.       With regards to your second question, national measures      involving the imposition and collection of taxes on Internet      and catalog sales of products would implicate international      trade obligations involving trade in goods and possibly trade      in services. Regarding a tax itself, Article III:2 of the      General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994)      prohibits a WTO Member from imposing a sales, excise, or      other tax on an imported product in excess of the tax imposed      on the like domestic product. In addition, tariffs on      products imported into the United States from non-U.S.      vendors would be subject to GATT Article II, which prohibits      the United States from exceeding the negotiated or ``bound''      rates for particular products contained in the tariff      schedule that the United States has submitted to the World      Trade Organization (WTO) under Article II. Also, as noted      above, quantitative restrictions on the importation of      products from WTO Member countries are generally prohibited      under GATT Article XI: 1. GATT Articles III and XI are      generally incorporated into U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs)      such as the NAFTA. In addition, FTA parties are subject to      the tariff rate and tariff reduction commitments made in the      FTA regarding goods originating in the territories of the      parties.       WTO obligations in the General Agreement on Trade in      Services (GATS) apply to ``measures by Members affecting      trade in services'' and thus, were a U.S. tax collection      requirement placed on non-U.S. vendors to qualify as such,      the GATS would come into play. For GATS purposes, the measure      may be at the federal, state, or local level. According to      the WTO Appellate Body, the phrase ``affecting trade in      services'' is intended to give the GATS ``a broad reach'' and      ``the term `affecting' . . . indicates a broad scope of      application.'' Here, the Appellate Body upheld a WTO panel      interpretation of the phrase ``measures by Members affecting      trade in services'' finding that ``no measures are excluded a      priori from the scope of the GATS as defined by its      provisions.''       ``Trade in services'' would be involved if foreign vendor      were considered to be a service provider--likely a provider      of retail services--and the Internet or catalog sale fell      within one of the modes of providing a service covered by the      GATS. Internet or catalog sales may constitute either cross-     border provision of a service or the consumption of a service      abroad, i.e., the provision of a retailing service from the      territory of the vendor into the territory of the U.S.      consumer, or the consumption of a retailing service in the      territory of the vendor by a U.S. consumer. If the measure      were in fact covered by the GATS, the United States would be      subject, inter alia, to the GATS most-favored-nation (MFN)      obligation, meaning that it would need to accord to the      services and service suppliers of any other WTO Member      treatment no less favorable than it accords to the like      services and service suppliers of any other country.       In addition, the United States has made a sectoral      commitment under the GATS with respect to retailing services      where these two modes of service supply are concerned, thus      implicating additional GATS obligations. Thus, to the extent      that catalog or Internet sales constitute a retailing      service, and the service is provided cross-border or consumed      abroad, the United States would be subject to GATS      obligations involving market access and national treatment of      services and service providers of other WTO Members in the      retailing sector. Market access commitments generally involve      prohibitions on various types of quantitative restrictions,      such as limitations on the total value of service      transactions in the sector in the form of a numerical quota.      The GATS national treatment obligation requires that,      regarding all U.S. measures affecting the supply of services,      the United States must accord to services and service      suppliers of any other WTO Member treatment no less favorable      than that it accords to its own like services and service      suppliers. U.S. free trade agreements also contain      obligations involving trade in services, including MFN      obligations and national treatment obligations that are not      premised on specific sectoral commitments.       While U.S. trade agreements do not appear to expressly      address a situation where a foreign service provider of one      agreement party is required by another agreement party to      collect sales, excise or similar taxes on sales made by the      former in the territory of the latter, the obligations      described above would be relevant if a case can be made that      the requirement is covered by the GATS or the services      chapter of an FTA. Further, were a quantitative restriction      placed on retail sales services by a foreign service provider      to U.S. consumers as a punitive measure for non-collection of      sales taxes, GATS market access commitments may well be      implicated. As is the case with the GATT, a measure that      violates a GATS obligation may be justified under a GATS      general exception if all the requirements of the exception      are met.       Regarding your third question, the proposed MFA is narrowly      focused on sales and use taxes and would not allow for states      to use this new authority for the collection of any other      taxes:       No obligation imposed by virtue of the authority granted by      this Act shall be considered in determining whether a seller      or any other person has a nexus with any State for any tax      purpose other than sales and use taxes.       The MFA also expressly provides that:       Nothing in this Act shall be construed as--       (1) subjecting a seller or any other person to franchise,      income, occupation, or any other type of taxes, other than      sales and use taxes,       (2) affecting the application of such taxes, or       (3) enlarging or reducing State authority to impose such      taxes.
