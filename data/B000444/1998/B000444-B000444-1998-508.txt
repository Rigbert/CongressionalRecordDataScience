 He threw a lifeline out because the Europeans threw no lifeline out, because the Europeans didn't do what my friend from New York is encouraging them to do. They did not step forward. They were irresponsible in their unwillingness to invite the Balts to become part of the European Community. They finally, about a month and a half ago, at the same time they kicked Turkey in the teeth, extended a belated invitation that is somewhat attenuated. But that is the reason the President did that.  We are looking for stability. Stability. I don't want anyone in the Balts, I don't want anyone in Ukraine, I don't even want anyone in Belarus, which is still a totalitarian country, concluding that there is no hope. I don't want to falsely hold out hope for them. The reason why, I assume, the President said what he said relative to the Balts was to dampen, not to inflame the debate here about whether or not the Balts were being shortchanged by not being brought in. I have just been handed something by my staff here, and I have been here so long I need glasses. It must be very insightful.
