Few duties and few votes are as enduring and as consequential as deciding on a nomination for the premier jurist of the United States in our Federal court system. We have had 43 Presidents in our Nation's history. We have only had 16 Chief Justices of the United States. In fact, only slightly under two dozen Members of the Senate have ever voted on the question of a Chief Justice.  We have had full and fair hearings. We have had a constructive debate. This process has been a credit to the Senate and to the Judiciary Committee. I commend especially Senator Specter of Pennsylvania, our chairman, and all of the members of the committee on both sides and their staffs for the detailed, sometimes grueling, preparation that evaluating a Supreme Court nomination requires.  I am sure people understand when I refer to the committee's Democraticstaff.
