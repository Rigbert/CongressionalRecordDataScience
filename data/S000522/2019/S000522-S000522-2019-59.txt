Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close.  I want to, first of all, thank the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon) for her very eloquent statement and for her deep concern for the State of Israel. I thank her for that leadership.  I would also like to thank, in closing, Mr. Deutch, Mr. Wilson, Chairman Engel, Ranking Member McCaul, and the Foreign Affairs Committee membership for their bipartisan work, and the staff, to ensure that the United States and Israel can work together to respond to shared challenges.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
