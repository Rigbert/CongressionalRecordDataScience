Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague Ed Markey and members of the Massachusetts delegation for holding this Special Order in honor of Senator Kennedy. I rise today just to say thanks to Senator Kennedy and to the Kennedy family.  During the sixties, I had an opportunity to meet President Kennedy, in June of 1963, when I was only 23 years old, and then to see him at the end of the March on Washington when he invited us back down to the White House. I got to know Robert Kennedy, the Attorney General, meeting with him in his office and campaigning with him in Indiana, Oregon, and California.  I have known Senator Ted Kennedy for a long time. He was a very special man, a very special friend. I remember long before I came to Washington as a Member of Congress on an occasion we needed him to speak at a fundraiser for nonpartisan voter registration efforts in the South. He answered our call without hesitation. He spent time among us, honoring not just men and women of means, but everyday people and their little children.  Senator Kennedy, this extraordinary man, was an elegant man who walked with kings, but never lost the common touch. As a colleague, he was generous and committed. He was our leader, our champion, our shepherd. He took up the causes of those who were weak and tried to make them strong. He stood tall and spoke with passion for all of those who have been left out and left behind; the people who had no voice in America.  Ted Kennedy never lost hope. He demanded justice for people of color when it came to civil rights and voting rights, and he also took a stand for seniors and for those with a different sexual orientation and for the disabled.  Senator Kennedy was a man who lived his faith and tried to act on it every single day by doing good to help the least among us. At some of the most tragic and difficult moments in this Nation's history, Senator Kennedy had the capacity, had the ability to gather his strength and lead us toward a more hopeful future.  As a Nation and as a people, he encouraged us to build upon the inspirational leadership of his two brothers and use it to leave a legacy of social transformation that has left its mark on history.  I would say tonight, Mr. Speaker, and to members of the Massachusetts delegation and to Patrick and to other members of the Kennedy family, Senator Kennedy was so thoughtful and so considerate. He was one of the most sharing, caring, giving human beings that I have ever met.  During July 2006, when the Senate was about to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, he invited me over to the other side of the Capitol to be his guest on the Senate floor. When the last vote had been tallied, he gave me a copy of the tally sheet. Then he suggested that we walk out into an adjoining room, and he showed me the desk where President Lyndon Johnson had signed the original act on August 6, 1965.  He had a photographer to take a picture of the two of us standing near that desk. A few days later, I received the most beautiful copy of that picture with an inscription from Senator Kennedy. It is hanging on the wall in my home in Atlanta. I will always cherish it as long as I live.  I remember in 1977, Senator Kennedy came to Atlanta and we hosted a little reception for him at my home. He met a few of our friends: my wife, Lillian, and our son, John Miles. He spent so much time playing and talking with my young son, who was not quite a year old.  Senator Kennedy had a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love that never forgot the spark of divinity that runs through us all, no matter whether you were his closest friend or his fiercest adversary.  A brilliant light has gone out that uplifted not just America, but the entire world community. During his life, Senator Kennedy touched so many of us with his brilliant light. He touched more than Members of Congress, but also ordinary people. He touched our President and the leaders of tomorrow.  The spark of light that he gave to each one of us still burns brightly, and it is our duty, our obligation to continue his legacy and pass that light on to unborn generations.  Senator Kennedy will be deeply missed but not forgotten, and his legacy will live on in all of us. He was a wonderful friend. He was a wonderful friend, a wonderful colleague. He was like a brother.                              {time}  2045
