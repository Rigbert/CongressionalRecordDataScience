 Let's face it, Mr. Speaker, people across the country are not very happy, and they are, frankly, so tired of Washington games. They know that we have a divided government. They don't want a deal; they want a solution.  Yes, they want to reform unemployment; yes, they want to extend the payroll tax deduction; and, yes, they want a doc fix. Without the doc fix, we put, literally, millions of Americans in jeopardy of decent health care because their physicians are not going to have the proper reimbursement from Medicare.  But coming from the State of Michigan, I know that what Americans want most are jobs. This bill, the Republican alternative, provides jobs for Keystone, 20,000 shovel-ready jobs in a $7 billion private investment right away; boiler MACT regs, something that will protect as many as 200,000 businesses across the country; and spectrum, the sale of the spectrum will create literally perhaps as many as 50,000 to 100,000 jobs as well.  The last Congress didn't deal with the budget, and we spent the first couple of months of this year dealing with what we thought was Lucy and the football: bringing up a continuing resolution, watching it be extended for a week or 2, and then coming back with another one. If we don't deal with these issues today, we're going to have the same trouble in the next year, in the next couple of months.  So let's stop playing Lucy and the football. Let's get a real solution to a problem that Americans want us to solve. Please support the Republican alternative on this and respect the wishes of the House.
