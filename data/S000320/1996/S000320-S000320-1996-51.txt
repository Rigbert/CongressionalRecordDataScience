 President, I thank the Senators, both the Senator from Ohio and Wisconsin.  The language the Senator is attempting to restore here is a hot political topic, to say the least. The debate about it will, no doubt, be one of the main points the media reports in the bill. It will make, no doubt about it, the papers and the nightly news, if it is adopted.  This amendment is great political rhetoric. We all have talked about too many political appointees in the past, depending on who was the President of the United States. Right now, there are about 2 million civil employees in the executive branch of Government. Political appointees are responsible for final decisionmaking there, as we know. We might not always like what they do, but how many of us can say we have not questioned actions of the career bureaucracy? Do we want to have a system like Great Britain and Japan and others, in which their career bureaucracy runs the Government? I hope not. Political appointees, on the other hand, are accountable. They are accountable for the decisions they make. I believe, overall, the civil bureaucracy is not.  The American people, I think, deserve accountability from their Government officials. By reducing political appointees and increasing the size and the power of a faceless bureaucracy, we are reducing accountability. Do we want to do that? We may need to adjust where they are, but is one-tenth of 1 percent too much for political representation? I hope not. I hope my colleagues, at the proper time, will vote against the motion to table this amendment, as I agree with the Senator from Ohio, this is not the time and this is not the place.
