President, in June of this Year, I introduced S. 1293, the Criminal Spam Act, together with my friend Senator Hatch and several of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. In September, the committee unanimously voted to report the bill to the floor. Two weeks ago, the Senate adopted portions of the bill as an amendment to S. 877, the CAN SPAM Act. The bill has been cleared from the Democratic cloakroom for weeks.   Unfortunately, this important measure is hung up on the Republican side because of an anonymous ``hold'' by some Republican Senator.   The Criminal Spam Act targets the most pernicious and unscrupulous spammers--those who use trickery and deception to induce others to relay and view their messages. Ridding America's inboxes of deceptively delivered spam will significantly advance our fight against junk e-mail.   Why would anyone want to prevent passage of this important legislation? It is bipartisan. It is non-controversial. It enjoys broad support from businesses, consumer groups, and civil liberties groups alike. The administration has only good things to say about it, and I know of no individual or organization that opposes it.   The answer must be that someone on the other side of the aisle is playing politics with this bill, holding it up for some reason that has nothing to do with it--or for no reason at all.   We could pass the Criminal Spam Act today, the House could act quickly and we could start prosecuting the worst of the worst spammers without delay. Instead, a single Republican Senator is allowing these individuals to continue to flood the Internet with their unwanted ads.   The Internet is a valuable asset to our Nation, to our economy, and to the lives of Americans. We should act now to secure its continued viability and vitality.                          ____________________
