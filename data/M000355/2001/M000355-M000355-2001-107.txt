 President, today I rise to pay tribute to a great American, Major General Michael W. Davidson for his 32 years of meritorious service to our Nation. On June 16, 2001, Major General Davidson will retire from the service, and I know my colleagues join me in expressing our gratitude for his many contributions.  Major General Davidson began his career as an enlisted member of the Army 32 years ago. Since that beginning, he served his Nation in the Active Duty Army, U.S. Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. His diligence and commitment to the United States Army did not go unnoticed, he was eventually promoted to the rank of two-star General Officer. In this capacity, General Davidson served a three year term as the first ever Assistant to the Chief Joint Chiefs of Staff for National Guard Matters.  During his tenure as Assistant to the Chief Joint Chiefs of Staff for National Guard Matters, Major General Davidson provided considerable insight and made lasting contributions regarding the integration of the Nation's Reserve Component forces into the planning and strategies of the United States Armed Forces. Major General Davidson's comprehensive knowledge of the Reserve Component and its capabilities as well as insightful analysis of our national security concerns were invaluable assets and set the tone for this new position. I am confident that all who follow Major General Davidson will benefit tremendously from his example.  Perhaps even more than his distinguished service, Major General Davidson is justifiably proud of his loving family. He and his wife Jo Ann have three children, twins Megan and Claire, both 22, and Brian, age 15. General Davidson and his family make their home in my hometown of Louisville, KY. Although he lives and was educated in Louisville, Major General Davidson's true allegiance is a few miles down the road in Lexington, or perhaps more specifically, Rupp Arena. Like so many others in the Bluegrass, The General is a huge supporter and fan of Kentucky Wildcat Basketball and I can hope that the next phase of his life will afford him many opportunities to enjoy the Wildcats in person.  In addition to catching as many Big Blue games as possible, Major General Davidson plans to busy himself with consultation work and teaching at the college level. Clearly, his commitment to service will endure.  Michael Davidson's time in uniform may be drawing to a close, however his record of dedicated service will continue for many years to come. On behalf of this body, I thank him for his dedication and contributions to this nation, and sincerely wish him and the entire Davidson family the very best in his retirement.                          ____________________
