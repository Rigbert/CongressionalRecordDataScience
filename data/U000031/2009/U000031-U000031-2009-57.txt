This team of young ladies, lead by 24-year Mustang Coach Pat Norman, has put in endless hours of hard work and dedication making them the first program west of Ann Arbor and Saginaw to win a Division 1 Women's Soccer State Title since the debut of women's soccer in 1971.  Winning a state championship is a memory that will last a lifetime. It is a remarkable achievement that few teams ever experience, and it is a legacy that will live with the 2009 Lady Mustangs forever. This young team, lead by captains Shannon Bennett, Lauren Brown, and Courtney Havens-Mitchell, played a close game against the Utica Eisenhower Eagles and came out victorious beating the Eagles 3-2 in overtime.  It is an honor to pay tribute to the entire Lady Mustang team: Lindsey Arnett, Mara Bennett, Shannon Bennett, Samantha Bowdirch, Lauren Brown, Lunden Carpenter, Natalie Hall, Katie Hamilton, Courtney Havens-Mitchell, Shelby Humphries, Jaime Morton, Taylor Peterson, Lindsay Shafer, Charlie Socia, Meghan Sokolowski, Colleen Unsworth, Katelyn Weissert, Paige Wester, and Jordan Wolf. We are so proud of all of you.  On behalf of all the residents of southwest Michigan, congratulations again to the Lady Mustangs, Coach Norman and the entire Portage community--you are an inspiration to us all. It is Portage Central Pride at its finest. Go Mustangs!                          ____________________
