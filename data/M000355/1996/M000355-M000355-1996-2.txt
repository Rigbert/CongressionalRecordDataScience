 I am pleased to say that his interpretation is correct. The Conference Committee intentions were to make clear to AID that it strongly disagrees with the agency's proposal to phase out ASHA over the next 2 fiscal years. There is broad agreement in both the Senate and the House that this program should be continued at levels close to those of the recent past. As for the fiscal year 1997 grant cycle in particular, we expect AID to make grants of at least $17.6 million. So, although the conferees did not retain the specific language of the amendment by the Senator from Michigan, we certainly concur with its spirit.
