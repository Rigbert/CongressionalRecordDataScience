President, I rise today to honor Marine LCpl. Joseph L. Nice from Nicoma Park, OK, who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country on August 4, 2004. This fourth-generation soldier died defending the freedom he enjoyed and fighting to ensure it for others.  Lance Corporal Nice moved to Nicoma Park, OK from Newark, NJ, in 1998. He was a gifted young man--a musician, artist and sportsman, who used these gifts in the marching band and on the soccer team at Choctaw High School. From the age of 5, he had longed to follow in the footsteps of his father, his grandfathers, and his uncle in serving in the military. After weighing this tradition and putting on hold his plans to study law, Joseph Nice decided to join the Marine Corps in June 2003.  Lance Corporal Nice was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force stationed at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, CA. His unit was deployed to Iraq in February 2004, where Lance Corporal Nice and his fellow Marines faced daily attacks in the Anbar province. During one of these attacks on August 4, 2004, Joseph Nice was killed.  I represent the State of Oklahoma in paying my condolences to the family of this American hero. A friend of his said about him: ``If you had a problem, he was always there for you.'' Through his service in Iraq, LCpl Joseph Nice demonstrated his worthiness to receive this highest compliment. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends today.                       army spc. sonny g. sampler  Mr. President, we also pay homage to Army SPC Sonny G. Sampler from Oklahoma City, OK, who died in the name of freedom in Iraq on 8 July 2004. He moved to Oklahoma City from Altus, OK and began attending John Marshall High School.  Specialist Sampler saw the Army as an opportunity for focus and direction and joined in 2001. He was deployed to Iraq with 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division based in Schweinfurt, Germany. In serving his country, Sonny Sampler did not shy away from his other duties. In the words of Maj. Gen. Douglas Dollar, ``This young man was willing to go to a strange land and fight for people he didn't know.'' It is the same young man who sold some belongings to pay for a flight from Germany back to the United States at Christmas to surprise his mother. Such a family man is to be much valued.  Specialist Sampler was tragically killed when he was searching the Iraqi National Guard Headquarters for survivors, following an allied attack. When the ruins underwent an attack by insurgents, Sonny Sampler and five other U.S. soldiers died. He was 23 years old.  Our thoughts and prayers are with this American hero's family and friends at this very difficult time. We should never cease to be proud of this man.                         SGT DANIEL LEE GALVAN  Mr. President, we also pay homage to Sgt Daniel Lee Galvan, who joined the Army to realize his childhood dream of working with helicopters. Earlier this year, Sergeant Galvan made the ultimate sacrifice for his country--his life. Sergeant Galvan was a dedicated defender of America who followed his father into the military. For this service and his sacrifice, I am proud to honor him in the Senate today.  Daniel Galvan was born in Fort Ord, CA, but later moved to Moore, OK, where he joined the Army reserve after high school but enlisted in 1996 to fulfill what he saw as his calling to be a soldier. Though he knew a career in the military would enable him to provide for his family, the paycheck was never his primary motivation. In the words of his wife, Sonya, ``He joined because he believed in the cause. He believed in the military. And he was proud to wear the uniform and honored to be an American.'' Sergeant Galvan was a helicopter crew chief with the 2nd Battalion (Assault), 25th Aviation Regiment, 25th Infantry Division (Light), based out of Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.  On August 12, 2004, the Black Hawk helicopter that was transporting Sergeant Galvan and fourteen other soldiers in Afghanistan developed mechanical problems and crashed near the Pakistani border. The fourteen others were wounded, but Daniel Lee Galvan, an honorable Oklahoman and example for us all, paid the ultimate price. Sergeant Galvan left behind his wife as well as two children, his daughter Audrey, 13, and his son Joseph, 11. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family for the loss of such a special man.  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I ask that we pay tribute to Sergeant Galvan and the men and women like him, who know the true meaning of service and sacrifice. These men and women have tasted freedom, and wish to ensure that freedom for those who have never experienced it. I honor the memory of our sons and daughters who have died for this noble cause, and especially the memory of Oklahoma's son, Daniel Lee Galvan.                        cpl nathaniel t. hammond  Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of a brave young American who gave his life defending the Nation. He felt a call to serve his country, to be part of something bigger than himself, and for that call he paid the highest price.  Cpl Nathaniel T. Hammond was assigned to the Marine Reserves' 2nd Battalion, 24th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division in Chicago. Nathan wasn't a native Oklahoman--he was born and raised in Brighton, MO, where he graduated from high school in 1998 and then joined the Marines, but he lived in Tulsa and had trained with the Anti-Tank Training Company, a Marine Reserve unit, in Broken Arrow.  On November 8 in Babil province, Iraq, he was killed in an insurgent attack. He gave his life for the freedom of millions of Americans, and also for the peace and prosperity of the Iraqi people only now beginning to recover from decades under a totalitarian regime.  Corporal Hammond had a long-held desire to serve the military as a member of the Special Forces, but even as a member of the Marine Reserve, he was ``doing what he wanted to do and what the loved to do,'' according to a childhood friend and fellow soldier. His parents have described how Nathan evinced the selfless attitude toward service to country that is so evident in all our military men and women.  We are all glad Nathan Hammond was willing to serve. His loss is grievous to all of us. Our thoughts are with his parents and the rest of his family back in Missouri. At the same time, we recognize his valor and commitment. It is for men like Nathan Hammond that I am proud to be a part of this great country. He was a special soldier, a true Oklahoman, and a true American.                        pfc nachez washalanta ii  Mr. President, I honor the memory of a courageous young Oklahoman who died while defending his Nation. Marine PFC Nachez Washalanta II grew up in the great State of Oklahoma, went to school in Ardmore and Silo, and joined the Marines in April 2002.  The road wasn't always smooth for Wash, as his fellow Marines called him. He grew up in a foster home with four other boys, and got his GED instead of graduating from high school. Eventually, Private Washalanta found a home with the United States Marine Corps. He was the driver of a light-armoredvehicle, and although he sometimes complained that he joined the Marines to fight and not to drive, he got his chance in Iraq.  Private Washlanta was a member of the 1st Light-Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force from Camp Pendleton, CA. He paid the ultimate price. When you think about these five great Oklahomans, as well as others around the country, and some 1,100 who have lost their lives, it is a shame that so many people in America do not understand what these soldiers understand.  Mr. President, I have the honor of being, I guess, the second or third ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Consequently, I may have made more trips over to Iraq and Afghanistan than anyone else. I am always approached by these young people. They say: Why is it, Senator, that the people back home don't appreciate what we are doing? These people are dedicated, and they know exactly what they are doing. Unfortunately, we have a media that tries to demean everything they are doing. And I give the assurance to these young people that even though it might be that the networks, CNN, and the New York Times and the Washington Post do not know and appreciate what they are doing, we do, the real people of America. And they are heroes.  I think most of our young people realize our country is facing the greatest risk it has ever faced. This is not conventional warfare. This is not something that is predictable. Sometimes I say I look back wistfully at the days of the Cold War where we had two superpowers, and they were predictable. We were predictable, they were predictable. This is totally unpredictable, but it is a war that has to be won. I pay homage not just to those Oklahomans I mentioned today, but all who are there and many who have paid the ultimate price for our freedom right here in this country.
