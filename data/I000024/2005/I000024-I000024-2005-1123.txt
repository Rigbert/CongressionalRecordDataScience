President, as we have said, we are on the substitute, our committee substitute. That will be the one that will receive amendments. We have invited Members to come to the floor with their amendments.  While we are waiting for those to come to the floor, I will go over what is before us section by section. Then when someone comes in for the purpose of offering an amendment, I will be glad to stop and then yield to that a person.  I first ask if the ranking minority member, Senator Jeffords, had any comments to make before we go on to amendments.
