Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to encourage Americans to purchase long-term insurance and address the growing cost to the Medicaid program of long-term care services.  The Long-Term Care Insurance Incentives and Consumer Protection Act of 1996 provides incentives to buy long-term care insurance and assistance in paying for long-term care.  This measure helps families afford the cost of long-term care services by treating payments for long-term care services as medical expenditures eligible for the same tax deduction as other health care services--deductibleto the extent total medical expenditures exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income.  The measure encourages families to buy long-term care insurance to cover future long-term care costs by providing a direct tax deduction for long-term care insurance premiums, without respect to the 7.5 percent of AGI floor that applies to other medical expenditures.  It revises the tax treatment of employer-provided long-term care insurance to encourage employers to make this coverage available to their employees.  It provides this new coverage beginning January 1, 1997.  The legislation helps protect consumers from unfair or abusive policies and marketing practices by providing this favorable tax treatment only for long-term care insurance plans that meet consumer protection standards.  The standards require the use of standardized benefits and terminology and a standard outline of coverage to make comparison shopping possible. They prohibit plans from requiring a hospital stay before coverage of long-term care services or imposing other unnecessary limits on when or from whom a patient can receive services; and prohibit a plan from discriminating against patients by providing a lesser standard of coverage for specific illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, mental illness, or HIV.  The standards also require that consumers be offered the option of purchasing inflation protection so that the value of their benefits does not erode and become inadequate over time; provide a right to cancel a new policy within 30 days and receive a full refund of any premiums paid; and provide a partial return of premiums if a policy lapses before the death of the insured person.  In addition, the standards prohibit cancellation of coverage except for failure to pay premiums, fraud, or misrepresentations by the insured; and provide group policyholders an option to continue or convert coverage that would otherwise terminate because the person is no longer a member of the group.  This legislation will reduce Medicaid's future outlays by encouraging Americans to buy long-term care insurance rather than looking to Medicaid for this coverage. Long-term care takes up one-third of the Medicaid budget. More than half of all nursing home care is paid by Medicaid, along with a significant amount of home and community-based long-term care. As more people purchase insurance to cover their long-term care needs, fewer people will need to rely on Medicaid for that coverage.  Mr. Speaker, this measure provides stronger consumer protection standards than the similar legislation previously considered on the House floor, including stronger nonforfeiture benefits so that people do not lose everything they paid in if they must stop making payments before they obtain any benefits. This will increase consumers' willingness to buy a product that they may not need for 20 years or more.  In addition, this measure provides a stronger incentive to purchase long-term care insurance by allowing taxpayers to take the tax deduction for premiums without having to first exclude medical payments equal to the 7.5 percent of AGI. For many taxpayers, the 7.5 percent exclusion that must be met before expenses become deductible under the GOP bill virtually eliminates the value of the tax deduction. My legislation allows premiums to be deducted directly, without a 7.5 percent exclusion, which increases the incentive to obtain long-term care insurance.  Mr. Speaker, the number of senior citizens in our Nation will grow substantially in the first part of the 21st century as the baby boom generation retires. Between 1980 and 1990, the 65-and-older population grew by one-fifth. During that time, while the entire U.S. population of all ages was growing by one-tenth, the over-80 population grew by one-third. The Bureau of the Census estimates that there will be 31 million people over age 80 in 2050, around the same number as the total number of people over age 65 today.  These are the people most likely to need long-term care. An expansion in long-term care insurance coverage now can ease the burden on government to provide the care that will be needed later.  I urge my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of this bill to encourage Americans to purchase long-term care insurance and help reduce our future Medicaid long-term care costs.                          ____________________
