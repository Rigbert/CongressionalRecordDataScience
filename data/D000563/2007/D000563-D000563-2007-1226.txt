President, I rise today to submit legislation expressing support for the creation of a commemorative stamp to promote public awareness of Down syndrome. I start by saluting those who are celebrating World Down Syndrome Day, and by thanking Senator Cochran for his support, as well as the National Down Syndrome Society, the Arc of the United States, the National Association for Down Syndrome, and the Central Illinois Down Syndrome Organization.  Awareness begins with facts. According to the National Association for Down Syndrome, Down syndrome is a genetic condition that causes delays in physical and intellectual development. Individuals with Down syndrome have 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. It is the most frequently occurring chromosomal disorder. Down syndrome is not related to race, nationality, religion, or economic status. It is a condition that impacts our entire society.  Children with Down syndrome are prone to health complications such as congenital heart defects, infection, respiratory, vision and hearing problems, and other medical conditions. Yet, they have their own gifts, and can often lead independent lives. While children with Down syndrome may face relatively greater challenges in areas such as memory, they often have particular strengths in areas such as social knowledge.  A testament to the fighting spirit and abilities of individuals living with Down syndrome resides near me in Springfield, IL. Diana Braun is an amazing woman. She survived an abusive family, scattered siblings, and institutional living to emerge as an Illinois leader and advocate for people with intellectual disabilities. She is president of People First and a member of the Illinois Council on Developmental Disabilities. She currently serves on the board of the Illinois Arc and works as a personal assistant to her friend and fellow activist, Kathy Conour. Together, they travel to Washington almost yearly to meet with their elected officials. She is a remarkable human being by any standard, and we in Illinois are proud that she has chosen to lead and advocate in our State. She and those for whom she advocates deserve our support.  The United States Postal Service has done a remarkable job of raising awareness, and in some cases money, for many worthy causes. This cause could not be more worthy, or in greater need of attention. There are more than 350,000 people living with Down syndrome in the United States. One in every 733 babies is born with Down syndrome. These births impact millions more--parents, siblings, friends, educators, and employers.  A commemorative stamp is the least that we as a body can do to spread awareness and provide support for this universal issue. Many Down syndrome support groups make a point of noting that people with Down syndrome are more like other people than they are different. They are different in that they are gifted with that rare strength that comes from adversity, and the compassion that comes from understanding the fight. I salute these individuals, their families, and everyone who supports them. I hope that the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Commission will do the same.                          ____________________
