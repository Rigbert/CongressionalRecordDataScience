But in response to the gentlelady's question, it's certainly my intent as the majority leader, dealing with the majority leader in the Senate, to urge him to take up the bill, to pass the bill, and it will be my recommendation to President Obama that he sign the bill, because I believe it is a bill which responds to the concerns of the American public regarding the accountability for their money, transparency in how it is spent, and a focus on some of the issues on Main Street that were, frankly, not addressed by the previous TARP money.  So, for all of those reasons, I am hopeful the Senate will pass it, I am hopeful the President will sign it, I am hopeful that it will be law. But, as I said earlier, the good news from my perspective is that in discussions, as I understand it, with Mr. Frank, and I'll yield to him in just a second, that the administration has indicated that even if the Senate doesn't pass it, they intend to focus on those, I think, very important and salutary requirements in Mr. Frank's bill.  I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.
