Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I deeply appreciate all of the comments from my friends on the other side of the aisle about what a great bill this is. I thank them for that. It is a great bill.  But what we have seen here with this great bill and this necessary bill being brought up in order to protect judges and their families and court personnel is another example of why this House has sunk into partisan politics. Partisan politics should have nothing to do with whether or not we give the judicial conference the authority to redact personal information necessary toprotect the safety of judges and their families. But nonetheless, we have heard from three Members on the other side of the aisle in basically making a partisan attack.  Mr. Speaker, there is a time for partisan politics and there is a time to deal with the people's business. This bill deals with the people's business. I appreciate the support from the folks on the other side of the aisle, but, Mr. Speaker, this was not the vehicle to launch a partisan attack, and I am sorry that they chose to do so.  I urge support of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
