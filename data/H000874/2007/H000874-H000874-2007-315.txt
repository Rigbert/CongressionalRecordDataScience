Speaker, I want to pay my respects, and I know the respects of all others in this House, to the nine Charleston, South Carolina, firefighters who lost their lives this week while fearlessly and courageously discharging their duties, and offer my condolences to the families and friends who lost loved ones in this great tragedy: Captain Billy Hutchinson, Captain Mike Benke, Captain Louis Mulkey, engineer Mark Kelsey, assistant engineer Brad Beaity, assistant engineer Michael French, firefighter James Drayton, firefighter Brandon Thomas and firefighter Melven Champaign. They made a commitment to one of our Nation's highest callings, a calling to service in the face of great danger, and a call to honor a tradition of heroes.  These fallen firefighters, Mr. Speaker, represented more than 100 years of service to the people they swore an oath to protect. And the dedication with which they lived their lives is something our Nation will not soon forget.  John Kennedy once said: ``The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment, but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy. A man does what he must, in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures, and that is the basis of all morality,'' Kennedy concluded.  In their final moment, Mr. Speaker, these nine men taught us what true morality is really all about, a love and heartfelt concern for one's neighbors that provides the strength to rush into the breach while others are rushing from it, and a sense of responsibility that will not allow a man to stand idly at times when his help is most needed.  Today, Mr. Speaker, the thoughts and prayers of a grateful Nation are with the families and friends of these nine courageous men, firefighters, heroes. May their legacy of valor, gallantry, and service be something that lives on in our country forever.                          ____________________
