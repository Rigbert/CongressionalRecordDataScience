Owens), my fine colleague, for his special order this evening.  Madam Speaker, I was listening to the gentleman in my office and I was motivated to come down here when he was talking about the minimum wage and the struggle of people from our country to earn a decent living.  I wanted to engage the gentleman in a colloquy, if I might, based on a speech that was made over the weekend and reported in the gentleman's home city of New York City by none other than the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan.  The story was reported in my local paper back home, the Toledo Blade, because he was talking about workers in our country and saying that, and I quote from the article, ``pockets of workers in America sometimes have to suffer for the national economy to get stronger.'' It was very interesting and, Madam Speaker, I would like to include that article for the Record at this point.   Madam Speaker, I ordered a copy of his speech today, and I have read it, because he was speaking to a group in Texas and he was talking about NAFTA. He was talking about how successful it has been.  I was very interested in the gentleman's remarks on minimum wage because Mr. Greenspan, in his speech, argues that international trade has lifted the standard of living of people in this country. I guess I wanted the gentleman to comment whether it is his view that some of the trade arrangements that we have locked ourselves into have been beneficial to the standard of living and to working families' incomes in this Nation. From what the gentleman was saying about the minimum wage, something is not working here.  Obviously, all boats are not being lifted. What was interesting to me about Mr. Greenspan's remarks, in fact, when he said who had to suffer as a result of our trade agreements, he only said workers. He did not say shareholders. He did not say chief executive officers. He did not say executive assistants. He did not say managers.                [From the Toledo Blade, April 17, 1999]Greenspan Contradicts U.S. Trade View--Competition is the Goal, He says       Washington (NYT).--Alan Greenspan waded into the debate      over trade policy yesterday, denouncing protectionist      pressures and arguing that pockets of workers sometimes have      to suffer for the national economy to get stronger.       The Federal Reserve chairman did not address the biggest      question on the trade agenda, the possible entry of China      into the World Trade Organization. But he outlined a broad      case for eliminating trade barriers and warned that attempts      to halt the development of a more global economy are futile      and harmful.       Mr. Greenspan's influence could help the Clinton      administration as it seeks to complete a deal with China and      win congressional approval for the pact.       But Mr. Greenspan criticized the administration for framing      the benefits of trade in what he called the wrong way. The      point of expanding trade is not to create jobs, Mr. Greenspan      said, contradicting the President's main argument for why the      United States should open new markets.       Rather, Mr. Greenspan said, trade forces the United States      to become more competitive, and to use its resources--people,      technology and money--in the most productive way.       The Fed chairman took the administration and Congress to      task for taking what he called an overly narrow view of trade      relations.       ``I am concerned about the recent weakening of support for      free trade in this country,'' Mr. Greenspan said in a speech      to business executives and foreign ambassadors in Dallas.       ``Should we endeavor to freeze competitive progress in      place, we will almost certainly slow economic growth overall      and impart substantial harm to those workers who would      otherwise seek more effective long-term job opportunities,''      he said.       Mr. Greenspan spoke after 10 days of debate within the      administration and throughout Washington over how hard to      push for a deal that would put China under the international      rules of trade.       Last week, Mr. Clinton backed away from a deal with China's      prime minister, Zhu Rongji, despite sweeping concessions from      the Chinese on a variety of trade issues. Mr. Clinton      concluded that he would not be able to win approval from      Congress because lawmakers are unhappy with China over      accusations that it has violated human rights, spread nuclear      weapons, and spied on American weapon programs.       But after criticism from business leaders, Mr. Clinton      restarted talks with China.                              {time}  2000  My own view, and perhaps the gentleman would want to comment on this, if we look at our trade deficit with Mexico, now nearly $16 billion a year, making more down there than we are able to sell. They ship their goods here, we do not get as much down there, their people cannot afford to buy; our people lose jobs.  China, which is an issue we are going to be discussing here, $50 billion, $60 billion in trade deficits. The poor workers in China are making 10 cents an hour, and yet we have the downward ratcheting of wages and benefits in this country, which force us to come to the floor here to ask for an increase in the minimum wage.  I just wanted to come down to the floor and to introduce this news article where Mr. Greenspan contradicts U.S. trade views and criticizes Congress. I am mystified why we might be concerned. I thought the gentleman might want to add something to his earlier remarks.
