Speaker, as an officer of the Congressional Steel Caucus, I am pleased to call your and my other colleagues' attention to a dynamic force in steel-framed housing: the Northern Indiana Building with Steel Alliance. This innovative collaboration is the result of an alliance between northwest Indiana's five major steel companies--U.S. Steel, Bethlehem Steel, LTV Steel, Inland Steel, and National/Midwest Steel--the Northern Indiana Public Service Co., Ivy Tech State College, Dietrich Industries Inc., Unimast, Inc., and Dale/Incor Industries. This alliance is the first public/private partnership in the Nation with a concentration on steel-framed housing. The Northwest Indiana Forum is the glue that holds the alliance together.  The alliance will promote steel-framed housing to builders this evening, September 27, 1995, at the Builders Dinner, which will be held at the Radisson Star Plaza in Merrillville, IN.  Northwest Indiana should be a national showcase for steel housing. This region represents the largest concentration of steel production in North America, and Indiana's First Congressional District leads the Nation in steel production. Since we're No. 1 in steel production, it makes perfect sense that northwest Indiana should be No. 1 in steel-framed housing. In fact, to promote the use of steel for housing, I've cosponsored a resolution that would authorize a demonstration of steel housing on the Capitol grounds.  The use of steel for housing is not only good for our domestic industry, it's smart. First, steel provides affordable and high quality construction materials. Second, steel is resistant to termites, vermin, and fire, and resilient in natural disasters. Finally, since steel is America's most recycled material, steel-framed houses help to conserve natural resources.  Steel-framed housing is one of the fastest growing markets in the industry. The demand for light gauge, galvanized steel for residential applications saw an enormous growth in 1994. There was a total of 40,000 steel-framed houses constructed in 1994, compared to only 13,000 in 1993. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, about 525,000 tons of steel will be used in steel framing for homes in 1995. Another 275,000 tons will be used in roofing. As a result, these steel-framed houses will allow our steel mills to produce 1.5 to 2 million additional tons of steel in which $1.3 to $3.6 billion will be generated. Moreover, these special houses will provide 6 million man-hours of work, or 2,900 new jobs.  The goal of the Northern Indiana Building with Steel Alliance is to eventually capture 25 percent of the residential applications market. Their hope is that this will be achieved as builders become more familiar working with steel and its inherent benefits. Key components of the regional initiative include assistance to builders with special seminars and training programs through Ivy Tech; cooperating with the Housing Futures Institute at Ball State University to develop new alternatives in housing technologies; and assisting local Habitat for Humanity sponsors to promote steel framing in homebuilding projects.  Representatives of the steel companies participating in the alliance include: Jon Oram, Bethlehem Steel; Scharlene Hurston, Inland Steel; James Stoyka, LTV Steel; John Walsh, Midwest/National Steel; and Ed Charbonneau, U.S. Steel.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate these innovators, along with the other participants of the Northern Indiana Building with Steel Alliance, for taking the first step in lighting the fire that will fuel the American homebuilding market, as well as the economy of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
