 President, today I would like to join my fellow Kentuckians in Simpson County as they celebrate their bicentennial anniversary. Along our Commonwealth's southern border with Tennessee, Simpson County is home to two centuries of rich history and cultural heritage. Today, I would like to mark this impressive milestone.  The county was named in tribute to a brave Kentuckian who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation in the Battle of the River Raisin during the War of 1812, Captain John Simpson. A prominent Kentucky lawyer and state legislator, Simpson served as the speaker of Kentucky's House of Representatives in 1810 and 1811. The following year, Simpson was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, but postponed taking his seat to join the Army, where he was killed serving our young Nation.  The county's rich history and fertile land has helped grow a strong agricultural tradition, with tobacco, corn, and hay planted in the soil. Interestingly, Simpson County was also known as a popular dueling ground in its earliest days. The county's proximity to the state line apparently drew a number of prominent individuals for these so-called affairs of honor. Even Sam Houston, the future President of the Republic of Texas and U.S. Senator, is said to have fought and won a duel there in 1826.  As with many communities throughout Kentucky, Simpson County residents were sharply divided during the American Civil War. Residents served on both sides of the conflict, and troops skirmished in the area following attacks on two trains on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad lines in 1863. The war left a long-lasting impact on Simpson County's economy and post-war recovery.  For many years, residents thrived from a primarily agricultural economy. In fact, Simpson County was known as one of the largest mule markets in the world. Midway through the 20th century, local leaders sought to expand the county's economy with the help of the completion of I-65, which runs through Franklin, the county seat and its largest city. That growth continues to this day.  Residents have planned a year full of festive events for Simpson County's bicentennial year. In remembering their proud history, they will also celebrate the community's great potential ahead. With the leadership of Judge Executive Mason Barnes and other dedicated Kentuckians, this vibrant community will continue to succeed in our Commonwealth. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in marking 200 years of Simpson County heritage and wishing them well for many more prosperous years to come.                          ____________________
