President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the Improving Access to Assistive Technology for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 2004. This important legislation reauthorizes the Assistive Technology, AT, Act, which helps States strengthen their capacity to address the assistive technology needs of individuals with disabilities and supports loan and device demonstration programs, for six years.  This legislation improves current law in several ways which will help individuals with disabilities gain access to the assistive technology devices and services that will help them lead full and productive lives. Importantly, the legislation removes the sunset provision included in the last reauthorization and increases the minimum State allotment to $500,000, ensuring that all States can continue this vital work. Assistive technology devices and services are increasingly necessary, particularly as our population ages and for soldiers returning from battle with injuries that used to be life ending.  I am particularly pleased that this legislation contains language I sought to address areas of need that I heard from assistive technology users, providers, advocates, and administrators in my State of Rhode Island. First, the bill enhances training activities to improve the capacity of local education,early intervention, adult providers, and employers to assess, implement, and integrate AT devices. Secondly, funding is authorized for inventing and developing new AT devices and adapting, maintaining, servicing, and improving existing AT devices. Finally, the bill makes great strides to promote interagency coordination and collaboration to effectively deliver assistive technology devices and services.  I want to thank Senators Gregg, Kennedy, and Harkin for working so closely with me and my staff on this bill. It is my hope that we will be able to maintain this same cooperative, bipartisan spirit in which this bill was crafted as the reauthorization process moves forward.                                 ______                                       By
