 President, the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] is aggressively pursuing regulation of property insurance practices, supposedly because of the Federal Fair Housing Act [FHA]. HUD takes the position that the FHA, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and other similar factors, authorizes HUD to regulate property insurance practices that purportedly affect the availability of housing. I strongly disagree with this interpretation by the FHA. I do not believe that HUD has the authority to regulate the insurance industry, let alone have any recognizable expertise in this area.  HUD's insurance-related activities are directly contrary to the longstanding position of Congress that the States should be primarily responsible for regulating insurance. In the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, Congress expressly provided that, unless a Federal law specifically relates to the business of insurance, that law shall not interfere with State insurance regulation. The FHA, while expressly governing home sales and rentals and the services that home sellers, landlords, mortgage lenders, and real estate brokers provide, makes no mention whatsoever of the service of providing property insurance. Moreover, a review of the legislative history shows that Congress specifically chose not to include the sale or underwriting of insurance within the purview of the FHA.  HUD's assertion of authority regarding property insurance is a major threat to State insurance regulation. In August 1994, HUD announced that it was undertaking a new rulemaking that would prescribe use of the disparate impact theory in determining property insurer's compliance with the FHA. Although HUD has stalled on the promulgation of such disparate impact rules, it remains firm in its position that the disparate impact test applies under the FHA, and that the FHA applies to insurance.  Under the disparate impact theory, statistics showing that a practice has a disparate impact on a particular protected group may suffice to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, without any showing of discriminatory intent. The use of this theory may be appropriate in certain contexts, but in the area of insurance, it is wholly inappropriate and, in fact, potentially harmful.  The disparate impact theory assumes unlawful discrimination based solely on statistical data. Thus, under a disparate impact approach, statistics showing differences in insurance coverages by geographic area, wholly attributable to different risks in those areas, could be assumed to reflect racial bias merely because of a correlation between race and geographical locations.  The application of the disparate impact test to property insurance practices could undermine the ability of State regulators to ensure, as they are required by law to do, that the companies under their jurisdiction remain solvent. If insurers accept loss exposures to protect themselves against charges of disparate impact, or if they classify risky loss exposures as lower-risk exposures for this purpose, they may incur financial problems, because premiums collected may be far lower than the amount needed to cover losses incurred, and policy holders' surplus will have to be used to pay claims. If an insurer engages frequently in such improper underwriting, its surplus can be drained to the point of insolvency.  It is precisely for the purpose of preventing insolvencies while providing a means to make insurance more available that the States have adopted Fair Access to Insurance Requirements [FAIR] plans. HUD's disparate impact approach is flatly inconsistent with these congressionally authorized plans. Generally, the FAIR plans make property insurance available to applicants who have been rejected by the voluntary insurance market so that higher risks may be allocated equitably among insurers operating in a State. The FAIR plans thus help to preventindividual insurer insolvencies by providing for risks to be spread among all property and casualty insurers.  HUD's disparate impact approach fails to take account of the careful balancing of objectives reflected in the FAIR plans. Indeed, HUD's approach completely ignores the key difference between unfair discrimination and sound insurance underwriting practices that take the actual condition of the property into consideration. Clearly, it is unfair to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or handicap. But what HUD fails to recognize is that it is not unfair--indeed it is legally required by the States--for an insurer to evaluate the condition of the property and determine the risk. State insurance statutes not only deem these risk assessments to be legal, but indeed require them to prevent unfairness.  States and the District of Columbia have laws and regulations addressing unfair discrimination in property insurance. The State legislatures have debated and enacted a wide variety of antidiscrimination provisions to ensure that an insurer does not use race or other improper factors in determining whether to provide a citizen property insurance. The States are actively investigating and addressing discrimination where it is found to occur. In light of these comprehensive protections against discrimination, HUD's insurance-related activities are yet another example of unnecessary and duplicative Federal bureaucracy.  Let HUD enforce FAIR, and let the States regulate the insurance industry.                           ____________________
