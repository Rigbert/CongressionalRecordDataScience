 For instance, biotechnology is spurring the development of proteins that will be capable of manufacturing biological structures on the nano-scale. This technology will allow the development of nano-electronics such as micro-transistors and silicon chips. In the area of photonics there is potential for developing new micro-optical switches and optical micro-processing platforms.  Researchers recently discovered a first of its kind carbon-silicon compound in freshwater diatoms. This discovery promises to open the door to understanding the molecular process of biosilicification, or the ways plants and animals build natural structures. This understanding may lead to applications ranging from low cost synthesis of advanced biomaterials to new treatments for osteoporosis.  These are only a few examples of advances made through the interface between biotechnology and nanotechnology. I just want to confirm this legislation should help facilitatethe synergy between the biological sciences and material sciences.
