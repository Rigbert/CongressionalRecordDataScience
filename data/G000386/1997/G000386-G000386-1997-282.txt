 President, there is no dispute that a lot of drugs reach this country through Mexico. Not we, not the administration, not Mexico challenge this fact. Just as clearly, we must be concerned about this traffic in illegal drugs. We must be concerned for what this poisonous trade is doing to our country and to our kids. We must be concerned for what the drug money that results from this trade is doing to build criminal empires able to challenge and corrupt whole countries. For these reasons, the United States and Mexico have a shared interest in stopping an illegal trade that is so damaging to both our peoples and our institutions.  Mexico acknowledges its responsibility to help in combating the production and transit of illegal drugs. The production and transit of these drugs are illegal under Mexican law. Mexico is a party to a variety of international agreements to stop these practices. It also has bilateral agreements with the United States to the same effect. Thus, by solemn agreement, Mexico, along with most others countries, is committed in principle and practice to taking effective action to stop illegal drug production and transit.  The United States has a long and deeply intertwined relationship with Mexico, a relationship that is very important to both countries. Whether for good or ill, we are linked to Mexico and Mexico to us. Thus, we must be particularly thoughtful in how we treat that relationship.  The resolution I am offering today does not amend the certification process. It does not change the President's decision to certify Mexico--today. What it does do is send a clear, strong message from Congress that, while we have heard many promises, we have seen little action. And actions--appropriate actions--are paramount. While a change in the certification process may be necessary, doing so without taking the time to hold hearings or look at the possible solutions is hasty. We need to consider our next steps carefully.  There has been a lot of discussion in the last few days on what to do about Mexico. The discussion has tended to go from conditions that proposed to go too far, in my judgment, to approaches that do not go far enough. Clearly, striking the right balance on this important issue is not easy. In my view, however, we must lay down benchmarks with a clear time frame for deciding what Congress regards as the minimum we expect. After all that has been said and done in the last several days, to do less falls shy of doing anything.  My resolution affords the Congress the time to make a reasoned determination about what to do. It requiresthe Administration to base its decision next March 1 on a specific set of measurable benchmarks. In brief, my proposal requires progress on nine specific issues. These include progress on establishing an interdiction network of radars, progress on extradition, progress on dealing with corruption, steps to resolve carry weapons, steps to reach a maritime agreement, and steps to resolve refueling rights.  I believe that this approach and these measures give us the reasonable terms of reference for how to proceed. This approach gives us the opportunity and time to develop the cooperation on the drug issue that I believe we all want.  This resolution outlines both the concerns that have been expressed by Congress and what we expect Mexico to accomplish before March 1, 1998. Not rhetoric, but actions. We ought to proceed with care before we take steps to fundamentally alter the United States-Mexican relationship. But we must keep faith with our responsibilities to the public.                          ____________________
