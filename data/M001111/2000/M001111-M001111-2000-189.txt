 President, I come to the floor today as part of my on-going work to ensure that the city of Seattle gets the money it should receive for security costs incurred during the 1999 World Trade Organization Ministerial.  Mr. President, I have been working with the city of Seattle, the administration, and others on this issue for more than a year and let me say that I welcome Senator Gorton's interest in this topic earlier today.  Actually, back in 1994, I worked to resolve a similar problem associated with Seattle's hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. In 1994, working with the Clinton administration, we were able to provide thecity of Seattle with close to $1 million for APEC related costs.  Mr. President, for the record, I want to walk my colleagues through some of the history of the issue of the funding of the WTO that was discussed on the floor earlier today.  From the moment Seattle was awarded the WTO Ministerial meeting, I worked with the city of Seattle and others to ensure Seattle was given an opportunity to successfully host the WTO. For almost a year, I met with the city, the Seattle Host Organization, our Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and others within the executive branch. At every opportunity, I stressed the importance of supporting the city of Seattle in its efforts to provide the necessary security arrangements to the delegates and other WTO visitors.  The Clinton administration--in its fiscal year 2000 budget--requested $2 million in State Department money for WTO related expenses. This request was formulated months before a U.S. host city for the WTO was selected. From the very beginning, the Washington congressional delegation and WTO organizers in Washington state realized this request would be inadequate.  Beginning in March of 1999, with my appropriations request letter to the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations subcommittee, I encouraged the Congress to provide $5 million to the State Department for WTO related expenses. And I urged the Congress to essentially earmark one-half of this money for Seattle to meet a portion of the WTO security expenses.  The Senate Commerce, Justice, State bill did provide the State Department with $5 million for WTO related expenses, but the House version did not. During the conference report, I worked with my Washington state congressional colleagues to protect the $5 million in new WTO money.  Unfortunately, the original CJS conference report did not provide new money. Instead, it said the State Department could take up to $5 million for existing accounts and move them over to be used for WTO expenses.  When I saw that language, I was concerned. To me, it increased the likelihood that the State Department would not assist Seattle with WTO security related costs. Fortunately, as often happens with appropriations bills, the final product is a compromise between the Congress and the administration.  On several occasions, I continued to express to the administration the need for securing $5 million in new money--rather than relying on the State Department to move old money around.  Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter dated September 28, 1999.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 28, 1999.     Hon. Judd Gregg,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the          Judiciary, Senate Appropriations committee, The Capitol,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Gregg: As you know, the World Trade      Organization (WTO) Ministerial will be held in Seattle later      this year. The Seattle Host Organization is busy preparing to      host the largest trade meeting ever held in the United      States. About 5,000 official delegates from 135 nations as      well as thousands of reporters, demonstrators and other      interested parties will converge on Seattle to participate in      WTO Ministerial events. In addition, President Clinton and      numerous heads of state are expected to attend the meetings      and play an active role in the Ministerial.       The City of Seattle and other local law enforcement      officials are spending considerable time and resources      preparing for the numerous security issues associated with      the high-profile event. The Senate-passed fiscal year 2000      Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Act provides $5      million to the State Department for WTO-related expenses.      This is the only federal contribution directed to the WTO      Ministerial. The House bill, unfortunately, did not include      any federal commitment for WTO expenses. In conference, I      strongly encourage you to protect the Senate's $5 million WTO      appropriation. Additionally, I urge you to include the      following report language in the conference report.       ``Requested Conference Report language: The conference      recommendation directs that $5 million be made available from      this account for the costs associated with hosting the World      Trade Organization conference in Seattle, WA and that 50% of      such funds be allocated for reimbursement, through the City      of Seattle, of local law enforcement and fire agencies for      costs incurred in providing security for the meeting,      including costs for overtime and motorcade expenses.''       I look forward to your continued attention and support for      this important issue.           Sincerely,                                                     Patty Murray,                                                     U.S. Senator.
