 President, if the motion to table is not agreed to, the next amendment will be the modified Domenici amendment because he will be recognized at that point for an opportunity to offer the modification that, normally, Senate comity would allow. So that will be the next amendment if the motion to table is not agreed to.  Senator Domenici and Senator DeWine will offer the modification they have been trying to get consent to offer and that will be the next amendment presumably voted on in the morning, depending upon what the instructions of the majority leader are.  How much time remains?
