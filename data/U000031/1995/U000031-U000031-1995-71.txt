Speaker, in the last Congress, I called attention to some of the unintended effects of the Federal Superfund Program. I pointed out that Superfund's draconian liability provisions were undermining job creation in older manufacturing areas by discouraging the redevelopment of previously used industrial sites.  We came close to fixing this problem in H.R. 3800, the Superfund reauthorization bill cleared by the Committees on Commerce and Public Works last year. It did not become law, however, and the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Tauzin, and I are introducing ``The Lender and Fiduciary Fairness in Liability Act'' today so that no momentum will be lost in the effort to repair this broken program.  Throughout America there are previously used industrial sites lying fallow because lenders and investors are afraid that owning or renting such sites will make them liable for the costs of cleaning up messes they did not make. Under Superfund, owners and operators of property requiring cleanup are assumed to be responsible for contamination found on or in such properties. In some cases, institutions that loaned money for the acquisition of such properties can be held liable, too.  This shadow of liability hanging over previously used industrial properties often makes it impossible to sell property or to secure financing for acquiring and redeveloping it. Potential investors won't invest and lending institutions won't lend so long as Superfund threatens either liability, the loss of collateral value or both.  The safe alternative in such cases is to avoid the previously used ``brownsites'' in central cities and historic manufacturing areas in favor of virginal ``greensites'' far away. It is simply safer to develop a cornfield on the periphery than to redevelop a downtown site. A Michigan State legislator described the net effect of this process thusly: ``Urban devastation, and jobless workers, are left in the cities. With development forced outward, lots of open space and farmland gets gobbled up. There are tremendous public costs to provide new roads and services. And the old urban sites are not cleaned up--they just sit there!''  Mr. Speaker, I doubt that such results were intended by the authors of Superfund. In fact, I doubt that a single Member of this House or the other body even suspected such results when the statute creating Superfund was enacted in 1980 and extensively amended 6 years later. Nonetheless, more than a decade of court decisions and administrative interpretations have brought us to this point. The program is doing more harm than good in much of the country and we have a responsibility to get it back on track.  The bill my distinguished friend and I are introducing this evening addresses the redevelopment of contaminated sites in two ways. First, it shelters from Superfund liability innocent landowners who acquire property subsequently found to be contaminated. Second, it shelters lenders and lending institutions from Superfund liability unless they actively participate in the management of an organization subsequently found liable.  It is important to recognize that neither of these concepts is new. Superfund law currently exempts innocent landowners from liability and shelters lenders via the ``secured creditor exemption.'' The problem is that the law does not provide the executive and judicial branches with sufficient guidance on its implementation. Whether a given party qualifies for the innocent landowner or secured creditor exemption is virtually impossible to determine at the beginning of the process. One must take his or her chances and hope that EPA or the courts will make the appropriate interpretations later in the process. With Superfund cleanups averaging $30 million per site, this simply presents too much risk for potential redevelopers and those who provide the capital they need.  This bill strengthens the existing by clarifying the specific steps a party must take in acquiring and financing previously developed properties. It lets no polluters off the hook. Those who contaminate will be just as liable after passage of this legislation as they are today.  Similar legislation garnered more than 300 cosponsors in the last Congress and became part of a bill reported unanimously by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join Mr. Tauzin and me in this effort.                          ____________________
