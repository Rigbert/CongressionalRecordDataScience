 President, I wish to bring to your attention to a remarkable Vermont family.  The Marvin family has an incredible family tie to Vermont and to one of the State's best known products--maple syrup. David Marvin founded Butternut Mountain Farm in 1972 on land his father purchased in Johnson, VT., in the 1950s.  David Marvin has a strong and enduring commitment to an iconic Vermont industry. Through careful stewardship, and with the help of his wife Lucy, he has built a company renowned for quality maple products.  The family produced maple syrup, grew Christmas trees and consulted on timber management. Today, David's children, Ira and Emma, are integral to the operation, which includes more than 80 employees, maple syrup from 300 Vermont farms, and a 75,000 square-foot facility in Morrisville, VT. Butternut Mountain Farm is more than just a producer of maple syrup; it has also become an effective marketer of a treasured product of Vermont.  The family and the company have been recognized for their success. Just a decade after the company's founding, for example, Butternut Mountain Farm was named Vermont State Tree Farm of the Year and National Tree Farm of the Year by the American Forest Institute.  The Marvins are encouraging a culture of conservation. Their Morrisville operation is increasingly relying on renewable energies and energy efficiency. The family has also developed a pay structure that seeks to reward employees with flexible hours, to help reduce commuting costs, and a fair wage.  It is also worth noting that the Marvin family's business plays a crucial role in supporting the jobs of countless Vermonters throughout the state who produce maple syrup which is bottled by Butternut Mountain Farm.                          ____________________
