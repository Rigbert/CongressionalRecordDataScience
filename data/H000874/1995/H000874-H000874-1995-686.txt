Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the National Young Leaders Conference as it celebrates it 10th anniversary. Students participating in the National Young Leaders Conference [NYLC] can be described as ``Cream of the Crop'' and ''Part of America's Melting Pot'' because they're among the brightest and best young minds from across the country and represent a broad range of cultural, racial, and economic backgrounds.  From the State of Maryland alone, over 800 young leaders have participated in this culturally diverse program. Over 100 have been from my district which extends from the Chesapeake Bay to the Washington metropolitan area. I know that my colleagues relish each opportunity to meet with student constituents who have traveled to Washington to learn more about government and citizenship.  Sponsored by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council, the NYLC attracts high school students who demonstrate scholastic excellence and exhibit leadership potential. Only the most talented and motivated students are selected for a conference unique in curriculum and opportunities for young leaders to interact with today's national leaders.  Perhaps the most enduring of conference benefits is the opportunity for students to exchange ideas with their peers from all parts of the country. The NYLC is often a student's first taste of the competition in the world beyond their high school doors. Because of the high caliber of students involved, substantive debate on contemporary issues is the norm rather than the exception at the NYLC.  The curriculum is designed to challenge the minds of young leaders and to expose them to the wealth and diversity of opinions prevalent in their generation. While engaged in simulations addressing complex issues facing today's leaders, NYLC students learn about the other students' culture, perspectives, dreams, and aspirations.  In the stimulating environment provided at the NYLC, students gain new confidence in presenting their own viewpoints and learn the value of understanding their peers' diverse backgrounds and the importance of listening to their opinions. My hat's off to the Congressional Youth Leadership Council, on this their 10th Anniversary, for inspiring and motivating our Nation's next generation of leaders!                          ____________________
