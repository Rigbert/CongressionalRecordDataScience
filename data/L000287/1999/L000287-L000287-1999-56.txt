Let me thank my friend and colleague and each of you for all of the kind words and everything that you have said tonight. But you must keep in mind, I was only one participant in a struggle. It was a community of participants, not a leader but just one individual in a community of individuals participating in a movement. I think our trip has brought us closer together.  I ran into Mrs. Martin Luther King, Jr. last Sunday at church. She said to me, ``John, I was so moved, I was deeply moved, I can never tell you how moved, to see all those Members of Congress in Selma, Alabama during the first weekend in March.''  I think that is why we have to go back. I am glad our colleague, Congressman Earl Hilliard from Alabama, has extended an invitation for us to come back for the 35th anniversary of the march from Selma to Montgomery. We must go back. Because I think in this process, we help America to become a circle of brothers and sisters, what I like to call, really in the movement what we call a band of brothers and sisters, a circle of trust. We build a sense of community. We move toward that period and that place of laying down the burden of race. I think as we move into the next century, we have to be the leaders, saying that as a Nation and as a people, we must lay down the burden of race. It is too heavy a burden for us to bear. I think what we have displayed tonight with the help of our good friend Doug Tanner and Faith and Politics, that it is something that we can share, not just with each other but back in our districts, in our States and for the whole Nation. If we can build just pockets of the beloved community, here on Capitol Hill, here in Washington, maybe we can build it around America, and maybe we can bring peace to the world community.                              {time}  2130  Madam Speaker, I think we got to keep it going, and this should not be the end, it should be just the beginning.  Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, I just want to say I know there are a lot of Members who are sitting in their offices reading mail and probably signing mail and doing all kinds of work, and what I would say:  The invitation has been extended to Members for next year to go to Selma to celebrate the 35th anniversary, and if there are Members who care about race relations in America, and if there are Members who care about improving race relations in America, and if there are Members who care about really improving race relations in their own State, in their own district, I hope they will talk to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) or any of the rest of us about the opportunity to go to Selma next year and celebrate, commemorate, the 35th anniversary. It is a great opportunity, and it is a great learning experience.
