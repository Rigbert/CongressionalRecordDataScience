 I am confused. Why is certification--I have never heard of a certification on the part of the President in a sense of the Senate. Explain that to me. Explain how a sense of the Senate requires a formal certification from a President. Like I said, I have been here a while. That is a new one.  So you mean the President can say, when we pass this, ``You know, Bingaman and Conrad are good guys, they're my buddies and allies, but I'm not going to pay attention to them; I'm not going to certify anything''? Can he just say, ``I'm not going to certify it''?
