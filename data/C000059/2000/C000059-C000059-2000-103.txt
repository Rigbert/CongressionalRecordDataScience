Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, this is a simple amendment which requires that a seller be a willing seller. This is as simple as that. Everyone here agrees that that is what they want. They want willing sellers. Well, then, I would suggest that they accept this amendment.  The fact that a list can be made up of sellers' property somewhere, trust me, will have an adverse effect on the values of that property. And then to have the Government come back and negotiate to acquire that property from a so-called willing seller in itself is quite remarkable in this country.  I think that this is a workable way to resolve this issue. I would hope that my colleagues would support this, and this would make it I think a much better bill.
