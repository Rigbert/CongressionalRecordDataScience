Opening the doors of opportunity to all who have something to contribute has been a key to America's success as the world's strongest economy, and as the world's most successful democracy. Our cultural diversity is a pillar of our strength, and the promise of equal rights is a fundamental freedom of our democracy. Today, the House passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007, which would further promote and protect our country's diversity and every American's civil rights by further protecting Americans from discrimination in the workplace.  This important legislation would prohibit workplace discrimination by making it illegal to fire, refuse to hire, or refuse to promote employees simply based on a person's sexual orientation. Currently, Federal law provides basic legal protection against employment discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin or disability but not sexual orientation. Discrimination on the basis of certain personal characteristics has no place in any workplace or in any State, and it is long overdue for Congress to extend American employees these protections. This legislation has broad support not only from civil rights groups but also from leading American corporations, because they understand that there is no place for discrimination in our workplaces.  I commend the House for passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007, and I look forward to the Senate taking up this measure without delay.                          ____________________
