Well, Mr. Chairman, let me just say that this is cut from one of the largest expenditures in the United Nations appropriations, that is, to the contributions to international organizations. I think the American taxpayer in general is not willing to increase this account by 19.4 percent at a time that the gentleman from Virginia admits that the U.N. is doing something that is unconscionable and that should not be acceptable.  When we have other countries that are complicit, apparently, in this graft-type program of oil for food, along with what appears to be a reluctance of the United Nations to cooperate, we need a signal. I would hope this $20 million would be spent for science and research, because I chair the Subcommittee on Research.
