Mr. Speaker, in 1992 the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council established, and the Secretary of Commerce by regulation began implementing, the western Alaska community development quota (CDQ) program. Over the past nine years, the CDQ program has made a valuable contribution to improving economic and social conditions in the small Alaska Native villages on the coast of the Bering Sea that participate in the program.  In 1994 a question was raised whether the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) authorized the Council to establish and the Secretary to implement the CDQ program. In response, in 1996 I sponsored a provision that the 104th Congress enacted as section 111 of the Sustainable Fisheries Act that amended the Magnuson-Stevens Act to explicitly authorize the CDQ program.  The provision--section 305(i)(1) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act--settled the authorization question; however, it does not provide guidance to the Secretary for implementing the CDQ program, nor does it authorize the state of Alaska to assist the Secretary to implement the program or establish the terms and conditions for the state's participation.  In addition, over the past nine years the business activities of the six groups that the eligible communities have organized to participate in the CDQ program have become increasingly sophisticated. Initially, each CDQ group simply contracted with an existing fishing company to harvest the share of the total allowable catch of Bering Sea pollock that the group was allocated. In exchange, the group received a royalty payment from the company, as well as employment opportunities for village residents and other local economic development benefits. However, today the CDQ groups are participating in all Bering Sea directed fisheries through substantial equity interests in established fishing companies. In addition, in 1998 when it enacted the American Fisheries Act the 105th Congress created a loan program--contained in section 211(e) of the American Fisheries Act--that encourages CDQ groups to make additional investments.  It is important that the implementation of the CDQ program reflect these new realities. For that reason, Congress needs to provide the Secretary, the CDQ groups, the fishing companies in which the CDQ groups own equity interests, and the state of Alaska clear guidance regarding how the CDQ program should be implemented.  Last October I introduced H.R. 5565 whose enactment would have amended section 305(i)(1) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act to provide that guidance. Unfortunately, there was not enough time for the U.S. House of Representatives to consider H.R. 5565 prior to the adjournment of the 106th Congress. For that reason, I today am reintroducing the legislation in the 107th Congress.  Mr. Speaker, this bill identifies that the objectives of the CDQ program are to provide eligible western Alaska communities the fair and equitable opportunity to participate in Bering Sea fisheries that Magnuson-Stevens Act National Standard 4 requires, and to assist eligible communities to achieve sustainable long-term diversified local economic development. The bill requires the Secretary to allocate to the CDQ program the same percentages of the total allowable catches and guideline harvest levels of Bering Sea directed fisheries that Congress through section 206 of the American Fisheries Act and the Secretary by regulation already have allocated to the program.  In 1998 Congress directed the National Academy of Sciences to study, and then to report to Congress regarding, the CDQ program. In 1999 the National Research Council delivered that report and, in part, recommended that the process through which the state of Alaska assists the Secretary in implementing the CDQ program should be clarified.  Pursuant to that recommendation, this legislation establishes a process for implementing the CDQ program. The bill I am introducing today establishes the terms and conditions for the state of Alaska's assistance to the Secretary in implementing the program. The bill also affords the CDQ groups an opportunity to decide among themselves the percentages of each Bering Sea directed fishing allowance that each group will harvest during a fishing year. If the CDQ groups cannot agree, the bill affords the groups an opportunity to jointly develop the criteria that the Secretary shall apply to allocate fishing opportunities among the groups (as well as for the state of Alaska to apply in developing its recommendations to the Secretary regarding the allocation of fishing opportunities).  On October 4, 2000 the General Counsel of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a legal opinion that concluded that the text of the definition of the term ``CDQ project'' in 50 CFR 679.2 is ambiguous regarding whether programs and activities of fishing companies in which CDQ groupsown equity interests are ``CDQ projects''. For that reason, this bill defines the term ``CDQ project'' to clarify that a program or activity that is administered or initiated by a subsidiary, joint venture, partnership, or other entity in which a CDQ group owns an equity interest is not a ``CDQ project'' over which the Secretary may assert oversight authority if the program or activity is funded by the assets of the subsidiary, joint venture, partnership, or other entity, rather than by the assets of the CDQ group. The definition also clarifies that a program or activity that is administered or initiated by a CDQ group is not a ``CDQ project'' over which the Secretary may assert oversight authority if the program or activity is not funded by revenue that, during the duration of a community development plan, the group derives or accrues from harvesting the share of the percentage of the total allowable catch or guideline harvest level of a directed Bering Sea fishery that the Secretary authorized the group to harvest when he approved the group's plan.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, in response to my introduction of H.R. 5565, at its December 2000 meeting in Anchorage the North Pacific Fishery Management Council voted to organize a committee to review the Secretary and the state of Alaska's administration of the CDQ program and to identify needed changes. I am pleased that the Council did so, and I look forward to considering the committee's suggestions. However, the committee's work is not a substitute for action by Congress.                          ____________________
