Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, not just my colleague but my classmate. We came to the Congress together in 1987. I want to thank her for her leadership. I want to thank her for never giving up or giving in but for keeping the faith.  Now, I don't come to the well that often, but I come because I remember reading someplace that Benjamin Franklin, a Founder of this Nation, once said, ``It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question authority,'' and he made sure the right to dissent is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. So today I rise to question the right of House Republicans to institute fines which may violate the First Amendment and have a chilling effect on Members who disagree with the proceedings of this body.  House leadership denied the will of the people to bring strong gun violence legislation to the floor. As a last resort, we staged a sit-in here in the well to give voice to their mandate. As Members of Congress, we have a sworn duty to speak up and to speak out if we do not believe the action of this body represents the will of all Americans.  We should never, ever give up the right to protest for what is right, what is good, and what is necessary. We were elected to stand on the courage of our convictions. We were not sent here to run and hide. We must use our votes, our voices, and the power vested in us by the people of this Nation to speak the truth as we see it, regardless of the penalties.
