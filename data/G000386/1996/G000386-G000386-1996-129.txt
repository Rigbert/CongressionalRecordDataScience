  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                        Washington, June 28, 1996.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: Nearly one year ago, then Majority      Leader Senator Bob Dole sent to you the name of Ann Jorgensen      to fill a     Republican vacancy at the Farm Credit Administration. Her      name has yet to be sent to the Senate for confirmation. I      strongly support her nomination and ask that you send her      name to the Senate as soon as possible.       The Farm Credit Administration is facing significant issues      with regard to the Farm Credit System. It can best address      these issues with a full complement of members on its Board.      Ann Jorgensen has the background and experience to deal with      these issues knowledgeably and thoroughly. As a former member      of the Iowa Board of Regents, business owner, current member      of the Iowa Department of Economic Development Board, author,      and farm wife, she would bring a wealth of much needed      experience to the Farm Credit Administration.       I stand ready to assist you with this nomination.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senator.                                                                    ____                                       Office of the Governor,                                  Des Moines, Iowa, July 18, 1996.     Hon. William J. Clinton,     President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to highly recommend Ann      Jorgensen of Vinton, Iowa, for a Republican position on the      board of the Farm Credit Administration. It is my      understanding that former Majority Leader Bob Dole sent you      her name last year.       Ann Jorgensen is an individual I have called on many times      to serve the State of Iowa. She is currently on one of our      most important state boards, the Iowa Department of Economic      Development board. She has also served on the Interstate      Agricultural Grain Marketing Commission, the Iowa Alcoholic      Beverages Commission, the State Board of Regents, and the      Iowa Arts Council. Her service in all of these capacities has      been exemplary.       I am confident that Ann Jorgensen would be a fine addition      to the board of the Farm Credit Administration as she has an      extensive background in agriculture and agribusiness.       The Farm Credit Administration has a very important role in      overseeing the Farm Credit System, which is a significant      source of capital for rural America. As this board deals with      some critical issues in the years ahead, it is important that      the board have a full slate of members.       Ann Jorgensen has my highest recommendation.           Sincerely,                                                Terry E. Branstad,     Governor of Iowa.                                                                    ____                            National Corn Growers Association,                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 1996.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the farmer members of the      National Corn Growers Association, I urge you to send to the      Senate the nomination of Ann Jorgensen of Iowa to serve on      the Farm Credit Administration Board. The Board has been      without a third member for more than a year. If the      nomination does not proceed soon, it will not be possible to      complete Senate confirmation before this Congress adjourns.       The Farm Credit Administration Board serves a critical role      in regulating the Farm Credit System and ensuring an adequate      and flexible flow of money into rural areas. This statutory      responsibility will be ever more important as farmers and      their lenders refine the skills necessary to manage both      production and price risk.       Ann Jorgensen is especially qualified to make certain that      the Farm Credit System achieves its statutory goal of making      credit available to farmers and ranchers and their      cooperatives and for rural residences. Her impressive resume      includes a strong, personal background in production      agriculture, business development, and trade, as well as,      extensive experience in rural economic development. This      unique combination is exactly the mix rural America needs to      continue to share in the country's economic recovery.       We strongly urge you to nominate Ann Jorgensen as soon as      possible, to restore the Farm Credit Administration Board to      its full complement of three members.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Northey,     President.                                                                    ____                                 American Soybean Association,                                     St. Louis, MO, July 15, 1996.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: The American Soybean Association      respectfully urges you to nominate Ann Jorgensen of Iowa to      fill the vacant position on the Farm Credit Administration      Board. Unless this nomination is sent to the Senate soon, it      will be impossible to complete the confirmation process      before Congress adjourns.       The Farm Credit Administration Board plays a critical role      in regulating the Farm Credit System and in ensuring adequate      credit is available to production agriculture and other      borrowers in rural America. These functions are particularly      important during the current period of volatile commodity      prices, as farmers, ranchers, and their lenders manage      increased risk and finance future production costs.       We know Ann Jorgensen to be a highly qualified individual      who would be a valuable member of the Farm Credit      Administration Board. Her extensive background in production      agriculture and rural economic development is ideally suited      to the task of overseeing the Farm Credit System. Her      experience and perspective would perfectly complement the      qualifications of the other members of the Board.       The American Soybean Association strongly urges you to      nominate Ann Jorgensen, and to bring the Farm Credit      Administration Board up to its full complement of three      members.           Sincerely yours,                                                        John Long,     President.                                                                    ____                                     Iowa Soybean Association,                               West Des Moines, IA, July 15, 1996.     Hon. William J. Clinton,     President, The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: I would like to take this opportunity      to offer the support of the Iowa Soybean Association (ISA)      for the appointment of Ann Jorgensen to fill the vacant      position on the three member board of the Farm Credit      Administration.       Ann Jorgensen understands agricultural economics and      possesses the entrepreneurial spirit that has built a      successful business. Her many credentials include membership      on the Board of Regents for the State of Iowa and numerous      Iowa economic development boards. She is a community leader      and a recognized volunteer. Additionally, Senators Grassley      and Harkin support her nomination and are confident that she      would be a credible candidate for Senate confirmation      hearings.       ISA reaffirms its support for Mrs. Jorgensen, but would      also like to communicate the need to have all positions      filled on the Farm Credit Administration's Board. These are      extremely volatile times for farmers and it is important      financial institutions that are a part of the Farm Credit      System have the direction to keep agriculture a successful      industry.       Again, thank you for the opportunity to offer ISA's support      for the appointment of Ann Jorgensen.           Sincerely,                                              Douglas P. Lindgren,     President.                                                                    ____                                  Iowa Farm Bureau Federation,                                    Des Moines, IA, July 29, 1996.     Hon. Bill Clinton,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: I would like to take this opportunity      to offer support for the appointment of Ann Jorgensen of      Garrison, Iowa, to fill the vacant position on the three-     member board of the Farm Credit Administration.       This position has been vacant longer than it should be and      is a concern of the agriculture community. Whatever the      reason for this position not being filled it is more      important than ever, because of the new farm bill and the      environment that it will create, that a full board be in      place.       Ann Jorgensen is an extremely talented and articulate      person who has a broad experience base that would be helpful      in this position. Number one, she is a successful farmer but      also has served on many state boards that needed her      excellent judgment abilities. Ann also has what I consider a      critical skill needed in any form of business or government      institution and that is common sense judgment.       I sincerely ask that you consider Ann for the board      position. This position needs to be filled and the      agriculture community will be well served to have Ann fill      that position.           Sincerely,                                                   Ed Wiederstein,     President.                                                                    ____                                      Norwest Bank Iowa, N.A.,                                   Des Moines, IA, August 8, 1996.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear President Clinton: As you review the candidates to      nominate for the Republican vacancy at the Farm Credit      Administration, there is one name that should rise to the top      of the nomination list. Ann Jorgensen, whose name was      submitted to you a year ago by former Majority Leader Bob      Dole, is one of Iowa's foremost agricultural leasers; she is      a woman who has devoted her life to championing farm issues      on the local, state and national levels.       Ann's credentials for this position speak for themselves.      She is a farm owner, an agri-business owner, an economic      development leader, a renowned consultant and an author and      columnist for agricultural publications. Ann is a true      visionary who relies on her extensive experience in the ag      industry to articulate, anticipate and analyze farm issues.      Her established contacts, solid reputation and first-hand      knowledge would make her an exceptional addition to the board      of the Farm Credit Administration.       The Farm Credit Administration only stands to benefit from      the addition of a member of Ann's caliber. Thank you for your      consideration in this matter.           Warm regards,     H. Lynn Horak.                                    ____________________
