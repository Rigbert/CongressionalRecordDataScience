He spoke about how he felt and why he did not feel that we should amend the Constitution on this point:       I am offended when I see the flag burned or treated      disrespectfully. As offensive and painful as this is, I still      believe that those dissenting voices need to be heard. This      country is unique and special because the minority, the      unpopular, the dissenters and the downtrodden, also have a      voice and are allowed to be heard in whatever way they choose      to express themselves that does not harm others. The freedom      of expression, even when it hurts, is the truest test of our      dedication to the belief that we have that right . . .       Freedom is what makes the United States of America strong      and great, and freedom, including the right to dissent, is      what has kept our democracy going for more than 200 years.      And it is freedom that will continue to keep it strong for my      children and the children of all the people like my father,      late father in law, grandfather, brother, me, and others like      us who served honorably and proudly for freedom.       The pride and honor we feel is not in the flag per se. It's      in the principles that it stands for and the people who have      defended them. My pride and admiration is in our country, its      people and its fundamental principles. I am grateful for the      many heroes of our country and especially those in my family.      All the sacrifices of those who went before me would be for      naught, if an amendment were added to the Constitution that      cut back on our First Amendment rights for the first time in      the history of our great nation.       I love this country, its people and what it stands for. The      last thing I want to give the future generations are fewer      rights than I was privileged to have. My family and I served      and fought for others to have such freedoms and I am opposed      to any actions which would restrict my children and their      children from having the same freedoms I enjoy.  Many thoughtful and patriotic veterans object to this attempt to legislate patriotism. Those who testified before the Committee did not have to prove their patriotism. They are automatically, by their service to this country, true patriots. They spoke in eloquent terms about the importance of respect and love for country coming from the heart of a citizen or a soldier, not being imposed from without by the government.  I have thought so many times when I have been in countries where dictators rule to be able to say to them, do you have laws that require everybody to respect the symbols of your country, and they say, of course we have laws and we will prosecute anybody who doesn't obey the laws and respect the symbols of our country.  I say, we are better in our country. We don't need the laws. We are a nation of a quarter of a billion people and our people respect the symbols of this great nation and what it stands for, without having to have the ``flag police'' on the corner, without having to have laws passed by Congress. They do it because they honor those symbols.  For the same reason, my family and I fly the flag proudly at our home in Vermont. We know it is protected by the people of Vermont. We also know that it would probably be a very foolish thing for anybody to step foot on the property to do any damage to that flag. But we don't have to worry about it. People drive by, smile and wave. They know what a proud symbol it is and how proudly we fly the flag.  I remember what Senator Bob Kerrey, the only recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor currently serving in the United States Congress, said last year: ``Real patriotism cannot be coerced. It must be a voluntary, unselfish, brave act to sacrifice for others.'' Senator Kerrey reminded us that in this country we believe that ``it is the right to speak the unpopular and objectionable that needs the most protecting by our government.'' Speaking specifically of the act of flag burning, he added: ``Patriotism calls upon us to be brave enough to endure and withstand such an act--to tolerate the intolerable.''  The late John Chafee, a distinguished member of this body and a highly decorated veteran of World War II and Korea, pointed out that just as forced patriotism is far less significant than voluntary patriotism, a symbol of that patriotism that is protected by law will be not more, but less worthy of respect and love. He said: ``We cannot mandate respect and pride in the flag. In fact, in my view taking steps to require citizens to respect the flag, sullies its significance and symbolism.''  James Warner, a decorated Marine flyer who was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese for six years, has made this point in graphic terms. He wrote:       I remember one interrogation where I was shown a photograph      of some Americans protesting the war by burning a flag.      ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country protest      against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''       ``No.'' I said, ``that proves that I am right. In my      country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that      people disagree with us.'' The officer was on his feet in an      instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto      the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting      I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his      eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten      the satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the      burning flag, against him . . .       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish      those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate      America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to      hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? . . .      Don't be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon we have.  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent to have the James Warner editorial printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     When They Burned the Flag Back Home--Thoughts of a Former POW                          (By James H. Warner)       In March of 1973, when we were released from a prisoner of      war camp in North Vietnam, we were flown to Clark Air Force      base in the Philippines. As I stepped out of the aircraft I      looked up and saw the flag. I caught my breath, then, as      tears filled my eyes, I saluted it. I never loved my country      more than at that moment. Although I have received the Silver      Star Medal and two Purple Hearts, they were nothing compared      with the gratitude I felt then for having been allowed to      serve the cause of freedom.       Because the mere sight of the flag meant so much to me when      I saw it for the first time after 5\1/2\ years, it hurts me      to see other Americans willfully desecrate it. But I have      been in a Communist prison where I looked into the pit of      hell. I cannot compromise on freedom. It hurts to see the      flag burned, but I part company with those who want to punish      the flag burners. Let me explain myself.       Early in the imprisonment the Communists told us that we      did not have to stay there. If we would only admit we were      wrong, if we would only apologize, we could be released      early. If we did not, we would be punished. A handful      accepted, most did not. In our minds, early release under      those conditions would amount to a betrayal, of our comrades      of our country and of our flag.       Because we would not say the words they wanted us to say,      they made our lives wretched. Most of us were tortured, and      some of my comrades died. I was tortured for     most of the summer of 1969. I developed beriberi from      malnutrition. I had long bouts of dysentery. I was infested      with intestinal parasites. I spent 13 months in solitary      confinement. Was our cause worth all of this? Yes, it was      worth all this and more.       Rose Wilder Lane, in her magnificent book ``The Discovery      of Freedom,'' said there are two fundamental truths that men      must know in order to be free. They must know that all men      are brothers, and they must know that all men are born free.      Once men accept these two ideas, they will never accept      bondage. The power of these ideas explains why it was illegal      to teach slaves to read.       One can teach these ideas, even in a Communist prison camp.      Marxists believe that ideas are merely the product of      material conditions; change those material conditions, and      one will change the ideas they produce. They tried to ``re-     educate'' us. If we could show them that we would not abandon      our belief in fundamental principles, then we could prove the      falseness of their doctrine. We could subvert them by      teaching them about freedom through our example. We could      show them the power of ideas.       I did not appreciate this power before I was a prisoner of      war. I remember one interrogation where I was shown a      photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning a      flag. ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country      protest against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''       ``No,'' I said. ``That proves that I am right. In my      country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that      people disagree with us.'' The office was on his feet in an      instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto      the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting      I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his      eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten      the satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the      burning flag, against him.       Aneurin Bevan, former official of the British Labor Party,      was once asked by Nikita Khrushchev how the British      definition of democracy differed from the Soviet view. Bevan      responded, forcefully, that if Khrushchev really wanted to      know the difference, he should read the funeral oration of      Pericles.       In that speech, recorded in the Second Book of Thucydides'      ``History of the Peloponnesian War,'' Pericles contrasted      democratic Athens with totalitarian Sparta. Unlike the      Sparatans, he said, the Athenians did not fear freedom.      Rather, they viewed freedom as the very source of their      strength. As it was for Athens, so it is for America--our      freedom is not to be feared, for our freedom is our strength.       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish      those who burn our flag. What better way to hurt them than      with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread freedom. The flag      in Dallas was burned to protest the nomination of Ronald      Reagan, and he told us how to spread the idea of freedom when      he said that we should turn American into ``a city shining on      a hill, a light to all nations.'' Don't be afraid of freedom,      it is the best weapon we have.
