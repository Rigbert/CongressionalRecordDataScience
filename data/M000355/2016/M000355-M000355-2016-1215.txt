 President, at a time when the prescription drug opioid epidemic is tearing families and communities apart in our country, it is clear we need strong leadership at the FDA. This is an agency that can play a leading role in addressing the crisis through its drug-approval process, but it is also an agency that has been rightly criticized for not recognizing the severity of such a significant problem and for not taking greater action to address it.  Today we will consider the nomination of someone who I think can help lead the agency in a new direction. I recently met with Dr. Califf and raised my concerns and desire for the FDA to take a more assertive role in addressing this serious epidemic. He shared with me his proposed plan for dealing with the issue and for establishing a necessary cultural shift over the agency. I plan to support his nomination today, and I look forward to working with him.  That said, I have proudly led many efforts over the years to push the FDA to take a stronger approach when it comes to ending today's prescription opioid epidemic. I don't plan to let up now. The FDA should expect continuous, rigorous oversight in the way the agency addresses this epidemic in the future.                          ____________________
