  Our Republican friends want to investigate the role that campaign contributions might have played on President Clinton's China policy. Well, we should investigate that issue fully and fairly, but we should also investigate the role that campaign contributions play in our tobacco policy, our health care policy, our tax policy, our banking policy, and many other policies that we deal with.  Big money interests are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process, and the wealthiest \1/4\ of 1 percent provide over 80 percent of campaign contributions. More and more millionaires are running for office while the middle class and working families are voting less and less and participating in lower numbers.  Let us have the guts to pass real campaign finance reform, and let us do it now.
