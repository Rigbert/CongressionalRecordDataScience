President, I am following with great interest the work of the U.S. Commission on Affordable Housing and Health Facility Needs for Seniors in the 21st Century, a Congressionally established panel co-chaired by Nancy Hooks of New York and Ellen Feingold of Massachusetts. Through a series of coast-to-coast field hearings, the ``Seniors Commission'' has launched an important nationwide dialogue on senior housing and health care issues, and the public policy challenges America is facing with the aging of the baby boom generation.  The Seniors Commission is due to deliver its recommendations to Congress by June 30, 2002. I am hopeful that the work of this panel will help to produce a more effective, coordinated and efficient approach to housing and health services for seniors. Americans--young and old--can learn more about the commission and share their views with the commissioners by viewing the Seniors Commission's website--www.seniorscommission.gov.                          ____________________
