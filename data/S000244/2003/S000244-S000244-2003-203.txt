Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I wish the Democrats would get their facts straight before they come to the floor. First, any entity, individual or corporate, that is in bankruptcy is in Federal court and all claims go there: Enron, WorldCom, anybody else that is in bankruptcy.  Secondly, page 16 of the bill, which I will send over to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sandlin), provides specific exemptions for the removal of class action cases to Federal court for all the types of corporate wrongdoing that he said on the floor.  Read the bill, be accurate in your arguments, and support it.
