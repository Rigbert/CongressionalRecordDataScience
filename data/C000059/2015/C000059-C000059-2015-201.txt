Chairman, I make a point of order that the amendment proposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill.  The amendment is not in order under section 3(d)(3) of House Resolution 5, 114th Congress, which states:  ``It shall not be in order to consider an amendment to a general appropriations bill proposing a net increase in budget authority in the bill unless considered en bloc with another amendment or amendments proposing an equal or greater decrease in such budget authority pursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI.''  The amendment proposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill in violation of such section.  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order?
