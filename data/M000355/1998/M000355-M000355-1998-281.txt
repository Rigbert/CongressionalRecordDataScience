 KYL. I am happy to yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am not sure I ought not to propound this question to the Senator from Indiana.  It is my understanding that this morning the President announced sanctions and trade reductions, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, against certain Russian companies. Is it the understanding of the Senator from Arizona that that is the kind of sanction that might not be allowed under the Lugar amendment?
