 There are many millions of children around the world who deserve our concern and our compassion. I hope those who are expressing this feeling about Elian Gonzalez will not stop at that, will decide that we can do more to help many others in small ways and large ways combined. I hope next week the leadership of the Senate does not bring this matter before us. I will oppose it. I will support the resolution from the Senator from Connecticut. I think it is sensible. It answers the basic question with the most basic family value. Where should Elian Gonzalez be? He should be with his father, his last surviving parent. The trauma that he has been through I think, I hope he can endure. I hope he will be a strong little boy. I hope he will grow up and reflect on his experience in the United States, remembering that there were people who loved him in this country as well, and there certainly are.  Let me close by saying that I hope Cuban Americans will consider this for a moment. I don't believe the action they have taken relative to Elian Gonzalez has increased the popularity of their cause at all. Many people are confused and bewildered that they would fight a foreign policy battle on the back of a 6-year-old boy.  I think we should learn a lesson from history. There was a time when Eastern Europe was under Soviet domination.  There was a time when we considered them to be victims of a Communist regime. We decided in the latter part of the last century that the best way to change that government and that mindset in Eastern Europe was to open the doors wide, let them see the rest of the world, let them trade with the United States and Europe, and let them understand what democracy was all about, let them see what freedom meant in their daily lives, and, you know, it worked.  We saw the Berlin Wall come down. We saw countries such as Poland, under Soviet domination for 40 years, emerge into a democracy and an economy that is an inspiration to all. Can't we learn the same lesson when it comes to Cuba? If we open the doors and allow Cubans to come to the United States to visit, to work, to trade, to engage in cultural and educational exchanges, is there anyone who can doubt that will lead to a new Cuba? Is there anyone who doubts that kind of exchange, instead of this isolationism, will force the political change we have been waiting for for over four decades?  I don't think that change will come about by granting citizenship to Elian Gonzalez. That one little boy will become just a tragic footnote in history. He has endured enough in his short life. I hope this Senate doesn't add to the burden he now has to carry--the memory of seeing his mother drown at sea. I hope the leadership of the Senate will think twice before they allow us to become party to what has become a sad chapter in the history of this country.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
