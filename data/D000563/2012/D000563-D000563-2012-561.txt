President, reserving the right to object, we have the bill before us relative to the tax subsidies given to major oil companies--it gives $4 billion a year to companies that registered $137 billion in profit last year. It is such a popular measure that moving to it attracted a 92-to-4 vote in the Senate. We are trying to bring that to closure and get a vote on it. I know the Senator has an amendment she feels is valuable. I don't know the merits of it. I wasn't on the floor to hear the entire explanation. We have just gone through a transportation bill on which for more than a week we entertained an amendment on contraception on that side of the aisle.  We wish to, if we can, limit amendments to relevant issues, and limit them in number and try to actually pass a bill in the Senate, which would be almost historic. I hope we can do it in a bipartisan way. I invite the Senator from Alaska to join us in a conversation about that. Until we can reach agreement on that, I am afraid I have to object.
