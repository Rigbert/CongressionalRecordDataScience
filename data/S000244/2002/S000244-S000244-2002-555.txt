 Mr. Speaker, I also support H. Con. Res. 311, recognizing the Civil Air Patrol for 60 years of distinguished service to the United States.  Mr. Speaker, the Civil Air Patrol was established on December 1, 1941, days before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Today it provides an important service to our country by performing search and rescue missions, assisting law enforcement with antidrug operations, and helping the FAA to monitor airports.  The Civil Air Patrol deserves our support, praise, and thanks. With this concurrent resolution, we recognize itfor the important role it has played in our Nation.
