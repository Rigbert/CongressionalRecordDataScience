Chair, I rise today to recuse myself from consideration of H.R. 5, the Protecting Access to Healthcare, PATH, Act.  I have long supported medical liability reform as a way to control rising health care costs and save taxpayer money. I also have deep concerns regarding the establishment of the Independent Payment Advisory Board and the potential it has to restrict access to health care services. However, because of my holdings in at least two corporations that would benefit directly if H.R. 5 is enacted into law, I have concerns that my involvement could present a conflict with my private economic affairs. While my participation in legislative consideration of H.R. 5 would not appear to violate current House Rules and established precedent, I want to dispel any appearance of conflict. I therefore recuse myself from consideration of this legislation.                          ____________________
