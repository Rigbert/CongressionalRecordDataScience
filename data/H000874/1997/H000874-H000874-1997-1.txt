Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding.  I rise, Ed, on behalf of myself, but also on behalf of the Minority Leader, Dick Gephardt; our Whip, David Bonior; the Chairman of our Caucus, Vic Fazio, and the Vice Chairman of our Caucus, Barbara Kennelly, and all the other leadership and Members on our side of the aisle.  Ed Nichols has chosen well for the Eastern Shore. Now, I represent the Western Shore, and Wayne Gilchrest is not here, but I am sure that Wayne would swell with pride and be delighted, Ed, that you are going to spend many years of full enjoyment of not only the Shore, but of the many recreational opportunities it has. As the gentleman from Wisconsin has said, and the majority leader said, a house full of relatives and friends.                              {time}  2330  Far too often, as I have said so many times on this floor, the public turns on C-Span and they see confrontation. Sometimes they even see vitriol directed at one another.  What they do not see often enough is the human relationships of which the gentlewoman from Washington [Ms. Dunn] spoke. What they do not see is the commitment and dedication of the folks who sit at the desk and stand on the floor to ensure that in the context of the confrontation of philosophies and ideas, that there is a semblance of order which allows us to do the people's business, which allows this people's House to act in the finest traditions of democracy. It is people who, as has been said before, like Ed Nichols, dedicated to his country, dedicated to this institution.  Ed Nichols has served under 5 Speakers of the House: Speaker Albert, Speaker O'Neill, Speaker Wright, Speaker Foley, and now Speaker Gingrich. He has served, as my colleagues can tell from listening to the comments made by both sides of the aisle, by Members more liberal, by Members more conservative, he has dealt with each of us in an evenhanded, positive fashion, reaching out to us to assist us in representing to the very best of our abilities the people of our constituencies. And in so doing, he has made a very significant and lasting contribution to the strength of this country and the strength of this institution.  Ed, we will miss you from this floor. We will not forget you. We hope you will return often for that smile and the warm word, the handshake, the nod of encouragement. It meant a great deal to all of us. God bless and Godspeed.
