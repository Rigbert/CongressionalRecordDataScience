President, this amendment has been cleared on both sides. This is the one that originally we had several years ago concerning the Lord's Resistance Army in Africa and the showing that we have a policy in this country to bring this man down, the man called Joseph Kony. And we want to renew this so that we will have this pending again. It doesn't change anything that is going on at the present time except it keeps our policy in effect; that we are after the Lord's Resistance Army, and we will do what we have been doing in the past until it is completed.  So I ask my colleagues to adopt this amendment.
