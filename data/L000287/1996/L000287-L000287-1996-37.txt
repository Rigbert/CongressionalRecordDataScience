Mr. Speaker, let me say to my colleague from Georgia, Mr. Linder, I will not be harassed, bullied, or silenced. I know the rules of this House as well as the gentleman. But the gentleman knows, I have learned in my life that there are times when the rules must be challenged to confront an injustice. I will not sit down or keep silent until the report is released to the American people.  Last week Newt Gingrich brought an ice bucket to this floor to demonstrate a small savings achieved in the House. It is strange indeed that those savings are approximately the same amount as the cost of the report by the outside counsel. Now the Speaker and the Republicans in this House want to put the outside counsel's report on ice and it is wrong, just plain wrong.                          ____________________
