 Millions of people rely on child care to be able to work, and increasingly, to look for work, while others are responsible for older parents or disabled family members. Child and dependent care is a critical issue and a large expense for many American families.  Across the country, annual prices for full-time child and dependent care have increased dramatically. The average price for full-time care for a toddler is approximately $7,000 according to the National Association of Child Care Resources and Referral Agencies--infants cost even more. My state of Wisconsin is among the highest, with an average cost of $12,000. Meanwhile, the out-of-pocket cost of caring for an aging parent or spouse can easily exceed $6,000 a year.  To lighten the financial burden for working individuals, Congress created the Dependent Care FSA. A Dependent Care FSA enables individuals to put aside a set amount of money each year to help pay for eligible dependent care expenses for children under the age of 13, or others who can be claimed as a dependent, including a parent or spouse. The money set-aside is pretax, thus reducing a person's taxable income.  My legislation will improve the Dependent Care FSA by increasing the exclusion amount to $7,500 for families and indexing it to inflation on an annual basis. Increasing this amount to reflect the changing times will provide more financial relief to parents raising children and/or caring for adults. The legislation would also allow individuals to roll over any unused funds to the following year. Under current law, each household is permitted to set aside up to $5,000 annually pre-taxed. The $5,000 limit has been in effect since 1986, even though the cost of care has risen significantly since then.  I am pleased that employers are increasingly recognizing the need to address dependent care issues in the workplace by offering Dependent Care FSAs. It is my hope that Congress will raise the current Dependent Care FSA limit to better reflect the changing workforce and help individuals plan and pay for the care they need at home as they earn a living.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.                          ____________________
