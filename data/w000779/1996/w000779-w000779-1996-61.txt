I was not. It just seems to me, as the Senator has indicated, that it is time to act. Before I came to the Congress and served in the House where we served together, I was head of a senior citizens group, a great panel. I had not run for public office before. I had never been involved in public office. When we started that senior citizens group we said we are going to focus on the good ideas that help people. We do not care whether they are Democrat. We do not care whether they are Republican. We are just going to focus on the ideas that help people. I think that is what Dr. Ganske did when he took this up in the House, a Republican physician, who said that what we need to do is help people. We certainly are not helping people by having these gag rules that keep people from knowing about their rights much.  So the House, as we have discussed, and in the committee on a unanimous basis, said we are going to stand up for the patients, we are going to stand up for the providers, the vast majority of doctors who are honest and ethical, and want to tell their patients about their rights. And it made great bipartisan progress.  That is what I want to do here. I know the Senator from Nebraska has been trying to help me for the better part of 24 hours. I want to yield to him.
