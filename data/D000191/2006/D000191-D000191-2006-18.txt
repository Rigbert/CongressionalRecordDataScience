  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, headline today, Bush initiates Iraq policy review separate from Baker's group. Now, this might be good; it might be bad. Remember, the Bush administration ignored the advice of the State Department Middle East experts about postwar Iraq. He actually ignored the intelligence agencies, the real experts, as opposed to the phony group Dick Cheney put together. Is he now again going to end-run real experts who are going to give us real choices on how to extricate the United States from Iraq, get our troops out of the middle of a civil war and begin to have those people take care of their own problems?  Only time will tell, but this does cause tremendous concern that suddenly he is going to appoint yet another group in his own administration. It seems like he may want to counterbalance or pick and choose among the real recommendations. Hopefully, they are not going to give us another vacuous document like they did a year ago, the so-called national strategy for victory in Iraq, which has been an abysmal failure.                          ____________________[Page H8657]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                              {time}  1200                   BUSH INITIATES IRAQ POLICY REVIEW  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
