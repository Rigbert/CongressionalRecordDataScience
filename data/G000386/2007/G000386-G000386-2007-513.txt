 President, I welcome the new Presiding Officer to the Senate. I look forward to working with him as a new Senator. I hope he enjoys his time in the Senate.  I am back here again today, as I was yesterday, to talk about the Medicare drug benefit. Yesterday I spoke about how the benefit uses prescription drug plans and competition--with emphasis upon competition--to keep costs down for our senior citizens. I spoke about how well that system of competition that is in the prescription drug bill has been working for the last 2 years of its operation. Today I want to get to the crux of this debate and a debate that is going to take place a few days from now in this Chamber, the so-called prohibition on Government negotiation with drugmakers.  Opponents of the Medicare drug benefit have misrepresented what we call the ``noninterference clause'' language. That language doesn't prohibit Medicare from negotiation with drugmakers. It prohibits the Government from interfering in negotiations that are actually taking place.  Much of this debate hinges on a convenient lapse of memory that I am going to emphasize during my remarks about the history of the noninterference clause. So today I want to take my colleagues on a little trip down memory lane. For our first stop on memory lane, I would like to read something. This is a quote from someone talking about their very own Medicare drug benefit proposal:       Under this proposal, Medicare would not set prices of      drugs. Prices would be determined through negotiations      between private benefit administrators and drug      manufacturers.
