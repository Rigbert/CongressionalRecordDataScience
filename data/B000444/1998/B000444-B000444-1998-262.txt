 President, I have been here 25 years. The chairman of the full committee knows that there may have been, and there are people who have been, more effective people in pursuing arms control than the Senator from Delaware but none more consistently and more fervently than the Senator from Delaware.  This is not the place for this amendment. This is a treaty. This is a treaty. It is a treaty about expanding NATO. One of our colleagues on the Republican side, I was told earlier, had an amendment on the Kyoto environmental treaty saying we could not--I am told; I did not see it; but I am told he had been talked out of it, I believe--that we could not expand NATO unless Kyoto was dealt with.  Another one has an amendment that may come up here tonight dealing with--I believe, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, at least he was talking about an amendment relating to a position I know the chairman shares, which I do not share, relating to strategic defense initiatives. This is not the place for that.  Secondly, I find it absolutely fascinating that some of the very Senators who have come to the floor and said, look, what we want to do here is we want to slow down passage, stop passage, or slow down new members coming in, because we are fearful it is going to offend the Russians or the Russians are going to get upset--a legitimate concern. But then they comealong and say, and by the way, before--before--we can deposit these instruments, the Russians have to agree to cut their tactical nuclear weapons, or whatever.  Now, that is giving to Russia a veto power over expansion in NATO.
