 President, we are all aware that drug use has decreased overall in the last 15 years. One of the principal reasons for this is that we were successful in slowing the rate of experimentation and use among our young people. However, drug use is up dramatically among the young in the general population. Children as young as eight and nine are being confronted with the decision of whether or not to try drugs. This raises the possibility of a new epidemic of use and addiction. As you know, much is already being done to help children make the right decision. Prevention education is provided by various anti-drug groups, but these groups can't be effective in their teachings if prevention education does not begin at home. It is vitally important that parents make the time to school their children on the dangers of drug use and abuse.  Throughtout the years, research has been done on whether or not kids listen to their parents. The fact is kids do listen. It is clear that parents have influence in the choices their children make. The problem is, when it comes to drugs and alcohol, not all parents see a need to influence their child's decision or are aware of how serious the problem is. Some are ambivalent about their own past use. Some are in denial about what's happening. And why is that? A survey by the Partnership for a Drug Free America shows that less than a quarter of the parents questioned even acknowledge the possibility that their child may have tried marijuana. Unfortunately, of those parents surveyed, 44 percent of their children actually did experiment with marijuana. If parents aren't aware of the reality of the situation, how can they prepare the 6 out of every 10 teenagers who are offered drugs each year.  The problem isn't that the parents don't care. It is that they don't know. Parents underestimate the reality of drugs. As a result, they seldom if every talk to their kids about drugs. According to a recent PRIDE survey, only 30 percent of students reported that their parents talked to them often or a lot about drugs. This seems unfortunate when we look at evidence that shows drug use 32 percent lower among kids who said their parents talked with them a lot about drugs. The harsh reality is that 94 percent of parents say they talked to their teens about drugs, yet only 67 percent of teens remembered those discussions. Even more disturbing is a public opinion poll by the American Medical Association that illustrates that 43 percent of parents believe children using drugs is a serious national crisis, yet only 8 percent believe it is a crisis in their local schools, and 6 percent in their local communities.  Today, on behalf of Senators DeWine, Sessions, and Coverdell, I am introducing legislation that would bridge the gap between parents and the realities of youth drug use and abuse. The Drug Free Families Act would promote prevention education for parents. The goal is to promote cooperation among current national parent efforts. The kind of parent collaboration that the Drug Free Families Act proposes would unite parents at the national level to work with community anti-drug coalitions in the fight against drugs. It would not only help to educate parents, but help them convey a clear, consistent, no-use message. Through the Drug Free Families Act, we can give parents the resources necessary to educate our youth on the dangers of drugs.  It is clear that parents need assistance in educating kids on drug use and abuse. Parents, not Government, are the key to addressing the drug problem. We need to help them. I urge my fellow Members to support the Drug Free Families Act.  From my own experience in my State of Iowa, holding, as I did in 1998, more than 30 town meetings on the issue of drugs, one of the things I learned from the young people--junior high and high school young people who came to my meeting--was, in their own words, a statement on their part of somewhat frustration with their own families, that their families were not telling them about the dangers of drugs. There was even the suggestion from some young people that what we need is a parent education project so parents would be better at setting boundaries for kids, the necessity of listening to kids, but most importantly on the issue of drugs: As a parent, get the message out to young people about the dangers of drugs.  I got the feeling very definitely from young people of my State that they knew more about drugs, even more about the dangers of drugs and the availability of those drugs, than their parents do. I think the surveys I have pointed out today to justify the Drug Free Families Act justify and back up what the young people of my State of Iowa told me in those hearings last year.                                 ______                                       By
