 Speaker, what this legislation is about speaks to the priorities of the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich] and the Republican leadership, and those priorities are wrong.  Mr. Speaker, at a time when millions of Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to locate affordable housing, should we be making major cuts in our housing programs which will result in higher rents for the working poor and increased homelessness? The answer is no.  At a time when people from one end of this country to the other are worried about the impact of pollution and pesticides in our air, our water, and in our food, should we be making devastating cuts in environmental protection? The answer is no.  Mr. Speaker, at a time when millions of our veterans, the people who put their lives on the line to defend this country, are today unable to receive the health care and the other benefits which they have been promised, should we be laying the groundwork in this legislation for a 7-year budget which makes devastating cuts to our veterans programs? The answer is no.  Mr. Speaker, this country must move forward toward a balanced budget, but we should not do it on the backs of our veterans, the elderly, the children, the middle class, and the poor.
