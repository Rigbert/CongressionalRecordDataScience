Chairman, I would like to give my commitment, too. I would like to work with the gentleman from Colorado. This is an important issue. I believe it has got merit, but we have got to make sure that it is designed just the right way.  I want to say it is probably the lateness of the timing of the amendment when it came forward. It is my understanding the gentleman may withdraw the amendment--I would appreciate that--and allow us some time to really get together and see if there might be another day.
