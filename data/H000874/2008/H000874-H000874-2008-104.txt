Speaker, I thank the chairman.  Frequently I rise in support of a bill and congratulate the chairman. It is always warranted to do that; but in this case, it is particularly warranted. No Member has worked harder or longer in a more complex context than has Chairman Frank, working with Secretary Paulson of the administration, with Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bachus, and Mr. Shelby. While I know there may not be full agreement, I know there has been the opportunity to work together. I want to congratulate Mr. Frank who has been lionized in the press, properly so, for his expertise on the subject matter and for his political skill in bringing this matter to the floor today in a fashion that will see its passage.                              {time}  1530  Mr. Speaker, when it comes to economics, none of us, none of us is an island. Our prosperity is always, and always will be, bound up with the prosperity of our neighbors. And nothing has proved that more than the mortgage crisis that is rocking our economy today.  Yes, it has reached to the heights of Wall Street to threaten huge banks and the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  But the crisis began close to home. It began with millions of families who have seen their subprime mortgage rates jump out of reach, sometimes because they didn't understand the repercussions but often because they were misled by unscrupulous, unregulated lenders. The consequences will be felt close to home.  Home prices are set to decline for the second year running, the first time that has happened since the Great Depression. And communities are facing a vicious cycle of foreclosures, falling property values, declining property tax collections, cutbacks in city services, rising crime, and more foreclosures. The American public rightfully expects us to act. So the bill that we debate today isn't simply about helping hundreds of thousands of Americans keep their homes, as vital as that objective is. It's about stabilizing an entire economy.  We have talked about a stimulus bill. This is a very important component of the stimulus of our economy. As Fed Chairman Bernanke put it: ``Doing what we can to avoid preventable foreclosures is not just in the interest of lenders and borrowers. It's in everybody's interest.'' It's in our economy's interest.  I couldn't agree with him more. And that's why I'm proud to stand in support of this Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act.  This legislation will enable at least 400,000 homeowners, that's 400,000 families, to refinance their homes, switching from risky subprime mortgages to safer loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration.  Now, it's not about a bailout. Lenders will have to take losses, and borrowers must agree to share with the government any profit from the resale of a refinanced home. That's right, it's appropriate, and this bill contains it.  The bill also helps stabilize communities that are reeling from foreclosures and declining property values by helping States and cities buy up foreclosed properties. Not just will the homes in question be bought up. Entire neighborhoods will be protected.  Furthermore, this bill creates a strong, independent regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I have observed often that one of the problems in our economy has been that over the last 7\1/2\ years, we have taken the referee off the field. This bill reinstates a vigorous referee.  It also gives the Treasury Department temporary authority to extend credit to the GSEs, should they require it. The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that there is ``probably better than a 50 percent chance,'' and I quoted that, that this authority will not be used. But even if it is not, this bill will go a long way toward shoring up confidence in our financial markets.  Mr. Speaker, there is barely a Member in this body whose constituents have not felt the pain of the housing crisis, whether the personal crisis of losing a home or the ripple effect set off by each foreclosure. The needs of our constituents outweigh the demands of ideology. That's always true, of course, but at moments like this, we feel that truth more acutely than usual.  So I hope that my colleagues will put partisanship aside and do the right thing for our economy, for our neighbors, and for our country.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me read the Statement of Administration Policy. One of the things I want to congratulate Mr. Frank and Secretary Paulson on is the bipartisan way in which they have worked on a daily basis. I know they have talked daily. I have talked to Secretary Paulson, I think, weekly. But on a daily basis to make sure that we had a bipartisan administration-Congress response to the crisis that confronts us. I read from the Statement of Administration Policy, which is dated July 23, at 12:25, just a few hours ago. I know all my colleagues will want to listen intently to what the administration says we ought to be doing:  `` . . . the temporary Treasury authorities and GSE reform provisions are too important to the stability of our Nation's housing market, financial system, and the broader economy not to be enacted immediately. For these reasons the administration supports passage of H.R. 3221, as amended.''  America will be pleased when, in a bipartisan way, the administration and Congress act together to face a crisis confronting our citizens and our country. I urge my colleagues to vote for this critically important piece of legislation.
