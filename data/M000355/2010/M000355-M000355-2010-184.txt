 Mr. Neikirk is the president and general manager of Paul's Discount in Somerset, KY. Paul's Discount has become a local institution in the region, and this month celebrated its 50th anniversary of operations.  The land that Paul's Discount now sits upon was purchased by Joe's ancestor, Franklin Neikirk, and his spouse for 500 cords of wood in 1856. Joe's parents, Paul E. and Frances R. Neikirk, opened the first discount store in south-central Kentucky on that land 104 years later in the early spring of 1960.  Founder Paul Neikirk passed away in 1974. Today Joe runs the store with his wife Jamie. The original store occupied only about 1,800 square feet and had three employees. Today, Paul's Discount boasts more than 20,000 square feet of selling space, plus three warehouses.  They offer sporting goods, hardware, automotive goods, clothing and crafts. Joe's glad he's still in the same original location, saying, ``You can't duplicate the atmosphere of this building.'' Judging by the crowd that turned out for the 50th anniversary, he must certainly be right.  The Commonwealth Journal recently published an excellent article about Paul's Discount, the Neikirk family's legacy and the 50th anniversary celebration that I would like to share with my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        [From the Somerset Commonwealth Journal, June 13, 2010]     50 Years of Service--``Unique'' Paul's Discount--A Pulaski Gem                   (By Tricia Neal, CJ Staff Writer)       Paul's Discount has always had a steady stream of      customers, but yesterday, the customers came in droves--     packing the parking lot and spilling out onto Ky. 2227 to      help president and general manager Joe Frank Neikirk and his      employees celebrate 50 years in business. Paul's Discount,      opened in 1960 by Joe's parents, Paul and Frances Neikirk, is      described by Joe as a ``unique'' store--offering sporting      goods, hardware, automotive goods, clothing, and crafts.       What started as an Army surplus store with three employees      has evolved into a sprawling, multi-department retail store      with 30 employees, all of whom Joe says help make Paul's what      it is. ``God has blessed us with good employees at every      level, from department managers to cashiers,'' he said.       Some of Paul's Discount's employees have worked in the      store for nearly 30 years. Joe himself worked in his parents'      store while he was in high school and college--and even      earlier, he recalled, passing out baby chickens to customers      at Easter.       ``Customer service is the big thing about Paul's,'' Joe      said. ``You actually get somebody to ask you if you need      help.'' That kind of friendly service is what brings      customers from Pulaski and surrounding counties--and even,      Joe says, from northern Kentucky, southern Ohio, and from      other points east and west.       Paul Neikirk opened Paul's Surplus on his ancestors' land      north of Somerset in 1960. In the beginning, the shop--the      first discount store in south central Kentucky--occupied only      about 1,800 square feet of space. Paul passed away in late      1974. At that time, his brother, Lyle Neikirk, took over      management of the business. Lyle retired about 14 years      later, leaving the shop in the hands of Paul's sons, Joe and      Randy Neikirk.       Joe continues to manage the store, which now offers more      than 20,000 square feet of selling space plus three      warehouses, but he says his job has been made easy by those      who surround him. ``Today, my wife, Jamie, and I run the      store. She does human resources, the employees do most      everything else, and I handle whatever is left,'' he said.       ``Our employees are almost self-sufficient.'' While the      merchandise available at Paul's is constantly changing, Joe      hopes the store's quality customer service and its atmosphere      will keep customers loyal.       ``We could never open another Paul's,'' Joe said. ``You      can't duplicate the atmosphere of this building.'' Joe adds      that his employees help create the atmosphere there.       While many things have remained the same at Paul's      throughout the years, the current management is making sure      the business keeps current. Paul Neikirk never would have      imagined that his little shop would eventually be accessible      to millions on the Internet. Now, the business can be found      at www.paulsdiscount.com and on Facebook. ``That's part of it      nowadays,'' Joe said. But he still believes customers      appreciate a good, old fashioned brick and mortar shopping      experience.       ``People still like to come to a store and look at what      they're buying,'' he said. Paul's Discount is located on Ky.      2227, just north of SomerSplash water park. Ky. 2227 is part      of the former North U.S. 27, and was once the most highly      traveled road in the county. The store is now a little more      out-of-the-way than it once was, but Joe says the change in      traffic patterns hasn't hurt his business.       ``Many local people were lost for a while,'' Joe recalled.      ``We were really dead for a couple of weeks. But people find      their way. . . . It was an incredible risk (to stay in the      same location). I thought it would affect us a lot more than      it has.'' Store hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Mondays through      Saturdays.                          ____________________
