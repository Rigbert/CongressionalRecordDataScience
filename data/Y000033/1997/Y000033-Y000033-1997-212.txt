Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against section 303 of the bill under clause 2 of Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.  This section applies a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service policy of waiving certain aspects of the Endangered Species Act to the repair of flood facilities in certain Federal disaster areas. Under the existing ESA, the President may waive certain aspects of the law for rebuilding facilities after a disaster.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife policy is the Presidential ESA waiver for 43 counties in California. Section 303 extends this policy nationwide, thus broadening the existing Presidential ESA waiver. The waiver of existing lawhas been construed to mean a provision changing existing law under precedents of the House: Deschler chapter 26, sections 24.5, 34.14 and 34.15.  In addition, the amendment alters existing waiver authority of the President under the current ESA by limiting his authority to 2 years; under current law, this waiver is unlimited. Imposing a restriction on the authority of the President is also a provision changing existing law under the precedents of the House because it restricts executive discretion to such a degree as to constitute a change in policy rather than a matter of administrative detail. Deschler chapter 26, sections 64-79.  The language was reported from the Committee on Appropriations on Thursday, April 28, 1997. Therefore, this is a provision changing the existing law, which, as reported in the general appropriation bill, is in violation of clause 2, Rule XXI.  I ask the Chair to sustain my point of order.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Shaw). Are there any Members present who wish to be heard on the point of order?  If not, for the reasons stated, the point of order of the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young] is sustained.  The Clerk will read.  The Clerk read as follows:                               CHAPTER 4                       DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR                       Bureau of Land Management                              construction       For an additional amount for construction to repair damage      caused by floods and other natural disasters, $4,796,000, to      remain available until expended, of which $3,003,000 is to be      derived by transfer from unobligated balances of funds, under      the heading ``Oregon and California Grant Lands'', made      available as supplemental appropriations in Public Law 104-     134: Provided, That the entire amount is designated by      Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section      251(b)(2)(D)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit      Control Act of 1985, as amended.
