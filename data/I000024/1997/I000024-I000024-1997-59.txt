President, I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 408, the House companion to the tuna-dolphin legislation. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to its consideration and all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 39 as passed by the Senate be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill then be considered read a third time and passed, with the motion to reconsider laid on the table.
