President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:10 today Senator Edwards be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes, with the time coming from the time controlled by the Senator from Michigan, that the Senator from Michigan be permitted to speak for 5 minutes following Senator Edwards, and that I be permitted to speak for 5 minutes immediately prior to the 5:30 vote.
