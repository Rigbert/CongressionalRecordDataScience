What the Senator from Tennessee has described is our answer. This bill avoids that problem. This bill simplifies that situation.  We are down to 46 States with the defined goods and the defined sales tax. That is more reasonable for the retailers than running the risk, as the Senator suggests, that this goes back to the Supreme Court, and 20 years after the fact they say: It is wide open. If Congress is not going to act, the Internet retail community has now matured to a point where they should be able to collect sales tax in every taxing entity where a person resides.  I believe that is a much more complex and challenging situation.
