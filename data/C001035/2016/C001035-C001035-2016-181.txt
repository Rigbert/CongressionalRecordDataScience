President, today I wish to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Town of Weld, ME. Known today as a gateway to the rugged and beautiful Western Maine Mountains, Weld was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today.  Weld's incorporation on February 8, 1816, was but one milestone on a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, Maine's Western Mountains were the hunting grounds of the Abenaki Tribe. The reverence the Abenaki had for the natural beauty and resources of the region is upheld by the people of Weld today.  The early settlers at what was called Webb's Pond Plantation were drawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and fast-moving waters, which they turned into productive farms and busy mills. The wealth produced by the land and by hard work and determination was invested in schools and churches to create a true community.  Weld is a town of patriots. Its namesake, Benjamin Weld, was a hero of the American Revolution. Ninety-three townsmen answered freedom's call during the Civil War; more than 20 gave their lives preserving our great Nation. The veterans memorials at the town library stand in silent tribute to those who have defended America throughout our history.  Weld also is a town of involved citizens. The active historical society, volunteer fire department, and library are evidence of a strong community spirit. The planning and volunteerism that have gone into this yearlong bicentennial celebration are evidence that Weld's spirit grows only stronger.  This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years; it is about human accomplishment and an occasion to celebrate the people who for more than two centuries have worked together and cared for one another. Thanks to those who came before, Weld has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
