 I am very pleased that Miss Rayle, who is a resident of Mechanicsville, Maryland and my constituent, has now earned the right to compete in the 71st Annual All-American Soap Box Derby national championship on July 26 in Akron, Ohio. Courtney has worked tirelessly to earn such a noteworthy win; due to her hard work, the victory marks the seventh time someone from the Rayle family has won the Greater Washington Soap Box race. This year will be the 19th time a member of the Rayle family will race in Akron. Courtney joins Jimmy Rayle Sr., Billy Rayle, Jimmy Rayle Jr., and Jeff Rayle in a long tradition of excellence in this sport. As Courtney now looks to compete for the national soap box title, I, along with the people of Maryland, wish her the best of luck.  The origin of soap box derby racing dates back to 1934 when a photographer for the Dayton Daily News in Ohio, Myron E. Scott, saw boys racing engineless cars down a hill, inspiring him to organize a race and award the winner with a ``loving cup.'' The venue was later moved to Akron--the site of today's national derby championship--on account of the numerous hills. With the hard work of countless civic organizations, a permanent track site for the youth racing classic was created in Akron with the assistance of the Works Progress Administration (WPA).  The All-American Soap Box Derby is the second-oldest racing event in the Nation--second only to the Indianapolis 500. This event has been called the greatest amateur racing competition in the world, and it is an excellent opportunity for contestants from all around the country to learn building skills while gaining a real sense of accomplishment. Congratulations to all of this year's competitors, and congratulations once again to Miss Courtney Rayle.                          ____________________
