President, first of all, let me make a comment on something totally unrelated to the subject of the day, which is that we have a significant bill coming up that the occupant of the chair and I have put together. It is called the pilots' bill of rights. The reason I want to say something about it is it is getting toward the end of the week. It happens a week from today--the largest gathering anyplace in the world of pilots who will get together in Oshkosh for the big event. I have been going to that for 32 consecutive years. We have probably the most significant piece of legislation we have ever introduced at Oshkosh. We are going to have literally thousands--I am talking about 200,000 pilots who are single-issue people.  I have been a pilot for 50 years. I know how these people think. The pilots' bill of rights is going to offer an opportunity to these people, who might be accused of something by the FAA, to have access to the evidence against them. It is something that everybody is for. As a matter of fact, it is something that--I haven't said yet, but I just heard that the air traffic controllers are supporting this effort. So we are going to have a lot of people. We already have 34 cosponsors.  The reason I want to say this, I know not many Members are listening, but a lot of staffers are. Pilots are single-issue people. They are going to want to know who is cosponsor of the bill. We will be talking for a period of 2 hours in two different settings. We will have literally thousands of pilots there.  I encourage very strongly people who may be listening to us right now to have their Members look at this carefully. As I say, pilots are single-issue people, and this is their issue. I did this twice--once in 1994, when we were able to use the population at Oshkosh to push over the top the first product liability bill that changed our manufacturing of aircraft from a major importer to a major exporter. That all happened at Oshkosh.  Another time it happened was with Bob Hoover, whom I think would be considered to be the best pilot in America today. He is up in years, but this guy had a problem that we helped him with, an emergency revocation. We did it in Oshkosh.  I hope we get a lot more people who are interested in general aviation, andparticularly if you are on the general aviation caucus and you are not on this bill. There are going to be an awful lot of questions.                         Cut, Cap, and Balance  Let me make a few comments about the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act. I can remember coming to the floor standing at this podium about 15 years ago, and this was during the Clinton administration. I came here because the Clinton budget for the entire country at that time was $1.5 trillion. I came down and stood here and said: How is it possible to sustain a level like $1.5 trillion? That was to run the United States for the entire year of 1996.  Now I think the outrage this year is that in President Obama's current budget, the deficit alone was $1.65 trillion. In other words, the deficit alone, right now, is greater than what it took to run the entire country for a period of a year in 1996.  That is something we can't continue doing. I believe the spending has gone so out of line that it is not believable. It is not possible for people to think this could be happening. President Obama has managed to increase Federal spending by over 30 percent, to an average of $3.6 trillion a year--$3.6 trillion. I was complaining about $1.5 trillion, and this is just 15 years later.  Is anybody listening out there? Does anybody really care? Maybe since I have 20 kids and grandkids I am a little more sensitive to the fiscal destruction of this country. This has caused our national debt to increase by 35 percent. Today, we have to borrow 40 cents for every dollar we spend. It just happened. This is something that we have to address.  I think we are so wrapped up now in saying how are we going to get this done by this deadline of August 2. I remind everybody of something that most people don't know, and it is a shock. They think this is the first time in the Obama administration that we have talked about increasing the debt limit. It is the fourth time. He keeps coming up with trillions of dollars of deficit each time--$5 trillion in three budgets. Believe me, it is not anybody else in this Chamber. It is not in the other Chamber, the House. It is one person--the President--who has come out with his budget. He signs it and sends it to us.  Well, that is a total of $5 trillion over the last three budgets. Some may think it is just not possible that this could be happening. This is the fourth time he wants to increase the debt limit.  This is the strategy: Go out and spend all this money like drunken sailors, and then come right up to the last minute and say the world is going to come to an end unless you increase the debt limit. You have to stop someplace, and I decided the last time he did this that I was going to stop unless we had some type of discipline.  The only discipline out there is the cut, cap, and balance budget amendment. I think we need to look at this carefully because if you stop and put this down--what I normally do on something like this is say: How does this affect the average person? This increase in debt just in this period of time would be $11,000 for every man, woman, and child--an increase from the time this President took office. That is an increase, and the total amount of debt they would owe would be $46,000. That is the day they are born. Happy Birthday.  Well, over the past several weeks, we have talked about what to do about the debt limit. I have looked at the three major plans out there. Looking carefully, the problem I have with the plan that has come up--called the Gang of 6, or the Gang of 7 depending on which group you are looking at--is that it has some intangibles in there.  For example, the military cuts--it doesn't say where they are, but we are talking about it--almost $1 trillion over a period of 10 years.  I am on the Armed Services Committee. I can tell you that I don't know where that will come from until they come up with more specifics--and they might do it, and it might be plausible. As it is right now, the cut, cap, and balance legislation is the only one I have seen that would really work. I haven't been involved in all these discussions. A lot of people are certainly working to try to come up with answers, the ones going to the White House every other day talking with the President. I don't happen to be one of those. My major concern right now--and I will at least mention this, because I have done several shows today to try make people understand--is, yes, the deficit and the spending, all that is terrible, but what is equally as bad--and that nobody knows about--is what is happening in terms of the regulations. We have all these programs this administration has tried to pass. I would say the main one that people are familiar with is cap and trade. Remember the old thing that has been going on for 10 years now--the cap and trade? That would cost the American people somewhere between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. That is a huge thing. Bringing that figure down to every taxpaying family in my State of Oklahoma, it would be a little over $3,000 a year, and you get nothing for it.  According to the President's own Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa Jackson, when I asked her on the record if we were to pass any of these cap and trade bills, would it reduce CO2 emissions--assuming you want to reduce CO2 emissions--she said no, because this is only applying to the United States. Let me carry it one step farther. As we run out of ways to create energy in America, we will have a job flight from our manufacturing base, which would have to go to places such as China, India, and Mexico, where they do not have any emission restrictions. So, if anything, it would increase emissions.  I am very proud of the Senate, because now we have perhaps, at the very most, 24 votes to pass cap and trade. So what does the President do? He says: Fine, we will do it through regulations. So, through regulations, he is attempting to do that. And we will hear next week of another example. In fact, there are six major areas where regulations are costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. Another one he is going to announce next week is going to be a tightening in the standards on MACTs, and it is one that is going to cost in the neighborhood of $90 billion each year. So in just two of these regulations you have $400 billion a year in costs to the American people. People just aren't aware of that.  Some smart guy in my office went back and said: You know, you are not the first person to be concerned about the cost of these regulations. Politicians don't talk about it because no one understands it. But Ronald Reagan, back in 1981, said this:       Overregulation causes small and independent businessmen and      women, as well as large businesses, to defer or terminate      plans for expansion.  That is what he said. And then he said:       I have asked Vice President Bush to head a cabinet-level      task force on regulatory relief.  That was the first Bush he was referring to there. So they realized it back then, the cost of overregulation. But it has gotten to the point now where it is every bit as important as the spending problem.  But we are talking about the spending problem right now, and there is nothing complicated about it. When you spend more than you take in, you go into debt, and we can't keep doing that forever. We keep getting these budgets from the President each year--three budgets now totaling a greater increase in debt than all Presidents since George Washington combined. Nobody seems to understand and no one seems to care that we can't keep doing that. We are going to have to do something about it for future generations. I think we are going to do it. I hope when this vote comes up--and I think it has been set for tomorrow--on the cut, cap, and balance legislation, it will be something that will be seriously considered, particularly by people who are coming up for reelection in 2012. They need to be thinking about this, because this will be a huge issue. To stand here on the floor and not vote for a balanced budget amendment--during this crisis we are facing now--is something everyone will have to answer to.  So while the caps we talk about in the cut, cap, and balance legislation would be over a period of time, it is no good unless you have some kind of enforcing mechanism. This bill we will be voting on tomorrow, I understand, does have that enforcement mechanism. It has sequestration. These are automatic cuts, so that if Congress decides it is going to spend above the caps that areallowed, then automatic sequestration goes into effect. It works. It is enforceable.  We have watched spending go up. I am reminiscing here that this has been going on for a long time. People are saying: Well, we are not going to be able to pass a cut, cap, and balanced budget bill because they have been trying to pass a balanced budget amendment for some 40 years or so and they haven't been able to do it. I think this is a unique time that is different than the past 40 years. This is the first time I have seen where the average person knows we can't sustain this thing. We can't go from a budget running the United States of America from $1.5 trillion and then all of a sudden it is $3.5 trillion under just one President. You can't continue to do that.  I remember way back many years ago, when I was in the State legislature, there was a great Senator named Carl Curtis from Nebraska. Carl Curtis was quite elderly at that time, and he had been trying to do a balanced budget amendment for probably 20 years at that time. This was back in the 1970s. He came to me in the State legislature in Oklahoma and said: I have an idea. The argument they use against a balanced budget amendment is that three-fourths of the States would never ratify it. So, he said: Let's preratify a budget balancing amendment.  He was kind of a genius. I happened to be the first State legislator he approached, and he asked me to take it on as a project. So the State of Oklahoma was the first State in history to preratify a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It was kind of fun. Then it was so popular that others started doing it, and we got right up to the three-fourths but couldn't quite get over that. But that is something that took place many years ago.  This is something we know is not easy, it is something that is difficult to do, but we now have another chance. It is the first time we have had a chance where the majority of the people, by polling, are expressing their outrage and stating that we are going to have to do something. Even though we have raised the debt limit countless times, this is the one time it is getting all this attention, and it is getting this attention because we all know we have something that is no longer sustainable. So we have another chance at the balanced budget amendment provision in the cut, cap, and balance bill, and it would prevent the debt limit from being raised until Congress sends one of the three balanced budget amendment proposals to the States for ratification. In other words, the amendment would have to pass both Chambers by two-thirds majority before the debt limit is allowed to increase. This makes sense. It is a permanent solution to our problem.  Within 5 years of ratification, the amendment would require Congress to pass a balanced budget every year, and it would cap total spending at 18 percent of GDP. Right now it is above 20 percent of GDP, so it is even lower than the caps we have had before. It would also require a two-thirds majority to raise taxes. We all know conditions could change--we could be in a war--so this does have a deficit provision which I think is very responsible. The balanced budget amendment is the only reform that will put our Nation on a true path for permanent fiscal stability. It will force comprehensive and real changes to the Federal Government and its spending priorities. If it is ratified, it would avert the risk of a debt crisis. In short, it would put our Nation on a path to limited government it has not seen in years. So I think this is the opportunity.  We have three different opportunities coming up. We have heard about the proposal by the Republican leader and by, I think, the majority leader. That might be some kind of last effort, and maybe that is what we will be considering. But the first and the best and the easiest--and the most fiscally responsible--is the cut, cap, and balance bill. So we will have that opportunity tomorrow. It is very significant we take advantage of that opportunity. I am not the pessimist most people are. I think we have a shot at this thing. If the American people are watching carefully, we could pass this thing.  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
