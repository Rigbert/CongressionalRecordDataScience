My conclusion is different than his, however. My conclusion is that I would be invited if they were having them. I do not think they are having them, but I may be in error, Mr. Leader. If the gentleman will check on that and let us know whether or not, in his terms, a formal conference has been held or is scheduled to be held on the Labor-Health bill, it will be news to me. But I would appreciate that information, and I appreciate the gentleman's offer.  Madam Speaker, last week the gentleman and I had a discussion about these conferences. On the Labor-Health bill, we are very concerned about the Labor-Health bill's funding as the gentleman knows. In the No Child Left Behind, the President was very strong on the No Child Left Behind. We believe in that bill, that that is short about $8 billion. Does the gentleman have any information as to whether or not such sums may be added to the Labor-Health bill to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act?  Mr. DeLAY. The gentleman knows that we have a strong disagreement as to whether the No Child Left Behind has been fully funded or not. From my perspective, it has been fully funded. I know the gentleman, and I think every Democrat voted against the bill because they wanted more funding. We have that disagreement. As far as what the conference is ultimately going to have, I am not advised. I could not tell the gentleman today if there has been any agreement on whether we are going to give more money than fully funding the No Child Left Behind.
