Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 9, the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.  H.R. 9 amends and reauthorizes the Voting Rights Act for an additional 25 years, several provisions of which will expire on August 6, 2007, unless Congress acts to renew them.  I was proud to lead Republican efforts to renew expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act in 1982, and I am pleased to have authored this important legislation to do the same thing a quarter century later.  The Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965 to address our country's ignoble history of racial discrimination and to ensure that the rights enunciated in our Constitution become a practical reality for all.  Since its 1965 enactment, the VRA has been reauthorized in 1970, 1975, 1982, and 1992, each time with strong bipartisan support. The right to vote is fundamental in our system of government, and the importance of voting rights is reflected by the fact that they are protected by five separate amendments to the Constitution, including the 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th amendment.  However, history reveals that certain States and localities have not always been faithful to the rights and protections guaranteed by the Constitution, and some have tried to disenfranchise African American and other minority voters through means ranging from violence and intimidation to subtle changes in voting rules. As a result, many minorities were unable to fully participate in the political process for nearly a century after the end of the Civil War.  The VRA has dramatically reduced these discriminatory practices and transformed our Nation's electoral process and makeup of our Federal, State, and local governments. Since its enactment, the VRA has been instrumental in remedying past injustices by ensuring that States and jurisdictions with a history of discrimination address and correct those abuses, and, in some instances, stopping them from happening in the first place.  Section 5 prohibits States with documented histories of racial discrimination in voting from changing election practices and processes without first submitting the changes to the Department of Justice or the District Court for the District of Columbia. Section 5 has helped ensure minority citizens in these covered jurisdictions to have an equal opportunity to participate in the political process.  As a result of section 5 and other provisions of the Voting Rights Act, minority participation and elections as well as the number of minorities serving in elected positions has increased significantly, and many of our colleagues who are here today are personal embodiments of those changes.  Last summer, I along with Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Conyers and Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Watt pledged to have the VRA's temporary provisions reauthorized for an additional 25 years. Over the last 7 months, the Judiciary Committee on the Constitution examined the VRA in great detail, focusing on those provisions set to expire in 2007.  In addition to gathering evidence of ongoing discriminatory conduct, the subcommittee examined the impact that two Supreme Court decisions, the Bossier II and Georgia v. Ashcroft decisions, have had on section 5's ability to protect minorities from discriminatory voting changes particularly in State and congressional redistricting initiatives.  Based upon the committee's record, and let me put the books of the hearings of this committee's record on the table, it is one of the most extensive considerations of any piece of legislation that the United States Congress has dealt with in the 27\1/2\ years that I have been honored to serve as a Member of this body. All of this is a part of the record that the Committee on the Constitution headed by Mr. Chabot of Ohio has assembled to show the need for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.  H.R. 9 includes language that makes it clear that a voting change motivated by any discriminatory purpose cannot be precleared, and clarifies that the purpose of the preclearance requirements is to protect the ability of minority citizens to elect their preferred candidates of choice. These changes restore section 5 to its original purpose, enabling it to better protect minority voters.  In addition, H.R. 9 reauthorizes section 203 for an additional 25 years, ensuring that legal, taxpaying, language-impaired citizens are assisted in exercising their right to vote. And, in my opinion, this is particularly important in elections where ballot questions are submitted to the voters. The committee record that formed the basis for this legislation demonstrates that, while the VRA has been successful inprotecting minority voters who are historically disenfranchised in certain parts of the country, our work is not yet complete. Racial discrimination in the electoral process continues to exist and threatens to undermine the progress that has been made over the last 40 years.  In fact, the extensive record of continued abuse compiled by the committee over the last year, which I have put on the table here today, echoes that which preceded congressional reauthorization of the VRA in 1982, and which led me to make the following observations during the committee's consideration of the VRA reauthorization legislation then:  ``Testimony is quite clear that this act has been the most successful civil rights act that has ever been passed by the Congress of the United States. The overwhelming preponderance of the testimony was that the Voting Rights Act has worked. It has provided the franchise to numerous people who were denied the right to vote for one reason or another. It has provided a dramatic increase in the number of minority-elected officials in covered jurisdictions. I think that very clearly demonstrates the need for an extension. The hearings also very clearly showed that the creativity of the human mind is unlimited when it comes to proposing election law changes that are designed to prevent people from voting.''  By extending the VRA for an additional 25 years, H.R. 9 ensures that the gains made by minorities are not jeopardized. Like the preceding reauthorization efforts, this bill has strong support from Republicans and Democrats alike, including that of Speaker Hastert and Minority Leader Pelosi. H.R. 9 is also supported by many prominent religious and civil rights organizations.  Mr. Chairman, among the keepsakes of my public service that I most cherish is one of the signing pens President Ronald Reagan used when enacting the 1982 Voting Rights Amendments into law. When considering their vote on the legislation now before the House, I would urge my colleagues to reflect upon President Reagan's eloquent remarks on this occasion:  ``Yes, there are differences over how to attain the equality we seek for all our people. And sometimes amidst all the overblown rhetoric, the differences seem to be bigger than they are. But actions speak louder than words. This legislation proves our unbending commitment to voting rights. It also proves that differences can be settled in a spirit of good will and good faith.  As I've said before, the right to vote is the crown jewel of American liberties, and we will not see its luster diminished. The legislation that I'm signing demonstrates America's commitment to preserving this essential right. I'm proud of the Congress for passing this legislation, and I'm proud to be able to sign it.'' Ronald Reagan, in August of 1982.  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to stand here with my colleagues, as I did then, to ensure that voting rights remain protected for an additional 25 years. Let Congress again make America proud by passing this historical and vital legislation without amendment.      Remarks on Signing the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982       June 29, 1982.--Well, I am pleased today to sign the      legislation extending the Voting Rights Act of 1965.       Citizens must have complete confidence in the sanctity of      their right to vote, and that's what this legislation is all      about. It provides confidence that constitutional guarantees      are being upheld and that no vote counts more than another.      To so many of our people--our Americans of Mexican descent,      our black Americans--this measure is as important      symbolically as it is practically. It says to every      individual, ``Your vote is equal; your vote is meaningful;      your vote is your constitutional right.''       I've pledged that as long as I'm in a position to uphold      the Constitution, no barrier will come between our citizens      and the voting booth. And this bill is a vital part of      fulfilling that pledge.       This act ensures equal access to the political process for      all our citizens. It securely protects the right to vote      while strengthening the safeguards against representation by      forced quota. The legislation also extends those special      provisions applicable to certain States and localities, while      at the same time providing an opportunity for the      jurisdictions to bail out from the special provisions when      appropriate. In addition, the bill extends for 10 years the      protections for language minorities.       President Eisenhower said, ``The future of the Republic is      in the hands of the American voter.'' Well, with this law, we      make sure the vote stays in the hands of every American.       Let me say how grateful I am to these gentlemen up here,      the Members of the House and Senate from both sides of the      aisle, and particularly those on the Senate Judiciary      Committee, for getting this bipartisan legislation to my      desk.       Yes, there are differences over how to attain the equality      we seek for all our people. And sometimes amidst all the      overblown rhetoric, the differences tend to seem bigger than      they are. But actions speak louder than words. This      legislation proves our unbending commitment to voting rights.      It also proves that differences can be settled in a spirit of      good will and good faith.       In this connection, let me also thank all the other      organizations and individuals--many who are here today--who      worked for this bill. As I've said before, the right to vote      is the crown jewel of American liberties, and we will not see      its luster diminished.       The legislation that I'm signing is the longest extension      of the act since its enactment and demonstrates America's      commitment to preserving this essential right. I'm proud of      the Congress for passing this legislation. I'm proud to be      able to sign it.       And without saying anything further, I'm going to do that      right now.       [At this point, the President signed the bill.]       It's done.       Note: The President spoke at 12:15 p.m. at the signing      ceremony in the East Room at the White House.                                  ____           Statement of Administration Policy, July 13, 2006  H.R. 9--Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting          Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006       The Administration is strongly committed to renewing the      Voting Rights Act, and therefore supports House passage of      H.R. 9. The Voting Rights Act is one of the most significant      pieces of civil rights legislation in the Nation's history,      and the President has directed the full power and resources      of the Justice Department to protect each citizen's right to      vote and to preserve the integrity of the Nation's voting      process. The Administration is pleased the House is taking      action to renew this important legislation. The      Administration supports the legislative intent of H.R. 9 to      overturn the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 decision in Georgia v.      Ashcroft and its 2000 decision in Reno v. Bossier Parish      School Board.                                  ____                                          Leadership Conference on                                                 Civil Rights,                                                      May 3, 2006.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: On behalf of the Leadership      Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest,      largest, and most diverse civil and human rights coalition,      we write to express our strong support for H.R. 9, The Fannie      Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights      Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. LCCR deeply      appreciates your leadership and the leadership of      Representatives John Conyers (D-MI) and Mel Watt (D-NC) in      sponsoring this important legislation. H.R. 9 is critical to      ensuring the continued protection of the right to vote for      all Americans.       The Voting Rights Act (VRA) is considered by many to be our      nation's most effective civil rights law. Congress enacted      the VRA in direct response to evidence of significant and      pervasive discrimination taking place across the country,      including the use of literacy tests, poll taxes,      intimidation, threats, and violence. By outlawing the tests      and devices that prevented minorities from voting, the VRA      put teeth into the 15th Amendment's guarantee that no citizen      can be denied the right to vote because of the color of his      or her skin. The VRA was initially passed in 1965 and has      been renewed four times by bipartisan majorities in the U.S.      House, and signed into law by both Republican and Democratic      presidents. In the 41 years since its initial passage, the      VRA has enfranchised millions of racial, ethnic, and language      minority citizens by eliminating discriminatory practices and      removing other barriers to their political participation. In      doing so, the VRA has empowered minority voters and has      helped to desegregate legislative bodies at all levels of      government.       Throughout the 109th Congress, during ten oversight      hearings that considered the ongoing need for the VRA, the      House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution found      significant evidence that barriers to equal minority voter      participation remain. The oversight hearings examined three      of the VRA's key provisions that are set to expire in August      of 2007: Section 5, which requires that certain jurisdictions      with a history of discrimination in voting obtain federal      approval prior to making any changes affecting voting, thus      preventing the implementation of discriminatory practices;      Section 203, which requires certain jurisdictions to provide      language assistance to citizens who are limited-English      proficient; and Sections 6 through 9, which authorize the      federal government to send observers to monitor elections for      compliance with the VRA.       The evidence gathered by the subcommittee revealed      continuing and persistent discrimination in jurisdictions      covered by Section 5 and Section 203 of the VRA. The      oversight hearings found that a second generation of      discrimination has emerged that serves to abridge or deny      minorities their equal voting rights. Jurisdictions continue      to attempt to implement discriminatory electoral procedures      on matters such as methods of election, annexations, and      polling place changes, as well as through redistricting      conducted with the purpose or the effect of denying      minorities equal access to the political process. Likewise,      the oversight hearings demonstrated that citizens are often      denied access to VRA-mandated language assistance and, as a      result, the opportunity to cast an informed ballot.       H.R. 9 is a direct response to the evidence of      discrimination that was gathered by the subcommittee. It      addresses this compelling record by renewing the VRA's      temporary provisions for 25 years. The bill reauthorizes and      restores Section 5 to its original congressional intent,      which has been undermined by the Supreme Court in Reno v.      Bossier Parish II and Georgia v. Ashcroft. The Bossier fix      restores the ability of the Attorney General, under Section 5      of the Act, to block implementation of voting changes      motivated by a discriminatory purpose. The Georgia fix      clarifies that Section 5 is intended to protect the ability      of minority citizens to elect their candidates of choice.      Section 203 is being renewed to continue to provide language-     minority citizens with equal access to voting, using more      frequently-updated coverage determinations based on the      American Community Survey Census data. The bill also keeps      the federal observer provisions in place, and authorizes      recovery of expert witness fees in lawsuits brought to      enforce the VRA.       The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy and      the VRA provides the legal basis to protect this right for      all Americans. We know that you are committed to timely      Congressional action to renew and restore this vital law and      we commend you for your leadership in introducing and      sponsoring The Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta      Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments      Act of 2006.

U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 700,000 members of      the Laborers' International Union of North America, I      strongly urge you to support the reauthorization of the 1965      Voting Rights Act. Failure to pass a clean reauthorization of      this key civil rights legislation will remove critical      protections which protect voters from discrimination and      disenfranchisement.       The House Judiciary Committee, passed the reauthorization      with strong bipartisan support. By passing this clean      extension of the ``Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta      Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments      Act of 2006, H.R. 9'' the House will be safeguarding voters'      rights.       It is especially important that the House retain language      which ensures that states and counties get federal approval      before changing election laws and procedures, to provide      language assistance to citizens, and provisions which protect      the Attorney General's authority to monitor and observe      elections. Renewal of these vital pieces of the Voting Rights      Act is necessary to protect minority voting and to allow full      participation by minorities in the voting process.       In order to protect the rights of all voters, we urge you      to support a clean reauthorization of H.R. 9, and to oppose      any amendments that might weaken the bill's historical      protections by allowing discriminatory practices to occur or      by putting up political barriers at the voting booths.       With kind regards, I am           Sincerely,                                            Terence M. O'Sullivan,     General President.                                  ____                                              Department of Social                                  Development and World Peace,                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2006.     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,     Speaker of the House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Speaker: On behalf of the United States Conference      of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), I write to urge prompt action on      the House floor for HR 9 The Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks,      and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and      Amendments Act of 2006. This important legislation was      reported to the House by the Judiciary Committee under the      leadership of Chairman Sensenbrenner with overwhelming      bipartisan support. As a co-sponsor of the bill, you know      that reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act is necessary to      preserve and protect the right to vote for all Americans.     Under your leadership this vital legislation can be brought      to a timely vote in the House of Representatives.       The Catholic bishops have a longstanding commitment to      civil rights, including the right to vote. ``No Catholic with      a good Christian conscience can fail to recognize the rights      of all citizens to vote,'' wrote the Administrative Board of      the National Catholic Welfare Conference (predecessor of the      USCCB) in 1963. Portions of the Voting Rights Act were last      renewed in 1992, with the support of the USCCB. The USCCB has      continually emphasized the importance of voting and the right      and responsibility of each citizen to vote, and has      encouraged dioceses, parishes and other Catholic institutions      to participate in non-partisan voting registration efforts.       The right to vote is essential to our democracy and HR 9      protects this right. I know that you are committed to timely      Congressional action to renew and restore this vital law and      I commend you for your leadership in co-sponsoring The Fannie      Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights      Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. Please use      every resource to bring the bill up for consideration in the      House of Representatives as soon as possible.       Thank you for considering my request.           Sincerely,                                  Most Rev. Nicholas DiMarzio,                                               Bishop of Brooklyn,     Chairman, Domestic Policy Committee.                                  ____                                                    June 21, 2006.     F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Judiciary Committee, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.     John Conyers, Jr.,     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers: I      write today to express my strong support for a clean      reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. I urge you to      oppose both amendments that will be offered to the bill on      the floor today. Those amendments would weaken the Voting      Rights Act and take it away from its original purpose and      intent.       This bill, appropriately named to honor civil rights      legends Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King,      is a powerful statement of America's continuing resolve to      put racial discrimination on the ash heap of history.       The Voting Rights Act is a national treasure. It is the      cornerstone of civil rights legislation. This law has been,      historically, the product of broad bipartisan support. You      deserve to be commended for once again facilitating broad      consensus through hard work, research of the facts, and a      spirit of unity.       It is vital that the bipartisan consensus achieved by the      Judiciary Committee be preserved as this legislation is      considered in the House today. I strongly urge all Members to      support the work of the Committee and this carefully crafted,      bipartisan bill.           Sincerely,     J.C. Watts, Jr.                                  ____                                                     June 6, 2006.     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Hastert and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf      of the undersigned organizations and our members nationwide,      we write to urge expedited consideration of legislation to      reauthorize expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act.      Section 5, Section 203 and Sections 6 through 9 of that Act      help protect the right of every eligible citizen to vote      without discrimination. These safeguards must not be      permitted to expire and reauthorization is a key legislative      priority for our organizations during the 109th Congress.       The Voting Rights Act is rightly considered one of our      nation's most effective civil rights laws and has      strengthened the protections of the Fifteenth Amendment of      the Constitution. In the 41 years since its initial passage,      the Voting Rights Act has enfranchised millions of racial,      ethnic, and language minority citizens by breaking down      barriers to their political participation. It has helped to      build inclusive communities by ensuring that all citizens      have an opportunity to participate equally in the electoral      process.       Three key provisions of the Voting Rights Act are set to      expire on August 6, 2007. Section 5 requires jurisdictions      that previously maintained a voting test or device that      coincided with low voter registration and turnout to      ``preclear'' changes in their voting practices or procedures      with the U.S. Department of Justice. Section 203 requires      jurisdictions with a concentration of Native American,      Alaskan Native, Asian, or Hispanic voters with limited      English proficiency to provide language assistance; and      Sections 6-9 authorize the U.S. Attorney General to appoint      federal election observers to document and deter unlawful      conduct.       These sections have had the cumulative effect of reducing      and preventing racial and language discrimination against a      significant number of citizens and have helped increase      minority participation in elections for candidates at all      levels of government. While substantial progress has been      made since passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, it has      not yet resulted in the elimination of voting discrimination.      Congress must renew the enforcement provisions of the Voting      Rights Act.       Enforcement alone, however, is insufficient to fully      protect minority voters from discrimination and promote      access to the electoral process. Achieving the purposes of      the Voting Rights Act requires an ongoing partnership among      all levels of government and investment of resources to fully      integrate minority voters into our electoral process and      break down barriers to participation. This is not an      exclusive duty of state and local officials; the federal      government should provide necessary funding and technical      assistance to assist states, counties and cities in improving      the effectiveness of outreach and assistance to minority      voters and to assist in meeting the needs of all voters who      require assistance to participate in our democracy.       We urge you to promptly renew the expiring provisions of      the Voting Rights Act. Further, we look forward to working      with you and other members of Congress as well as the      Election Assistance Commission and the U.S. Department of      Justice in an ongoing commitment to improving participation      in our democratic process and meeting the needs of minority      voters.       We thank you for your leadership on this issue.
