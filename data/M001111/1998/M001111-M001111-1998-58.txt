 President, it is imperative that we preserve Pakistan as an export market for our wheat. Washington State wheat growers need this bill. Our wheat prices right now are beneath the cost of production. Our growers and the rural communities they support are, frankly, losing the shirts off their backs.  There are now 3,500 wheat farms in eastern Washington; that is 3,500 wheat families. These families are the backbone of our rural economy. In Douglas, Lincoln, and Adams Counties, in Ritzville and Garfield, our growers need export markets like Pakistan so they can keep going. Every day we are losing family farms, and it is imperative that we do something about it.  This bill doesn't just affect farmers, it affects our truckers, it affects our ports, it affects our barge operators, and all of their families as well.  Given the evolving market forces in south Asia, it is really critical that we pass this bill today to give wheat growers in Washington State, the Northwest, and the Nation the chance to compete with other suppliers who are just waiting to take our customers.  No one condones the actions of either Pakistan or India earlier this year. The proliferation of nuclear weapons must not be allowed. The Arms Export Control Act of 1994, passed overwhelmingly by Congress, and requires that sanctions be imposed on these nations.  But the original act excluded food and humanitarian assistance. Unfortunately, the export credit guarantee programs of USDA essential to sale of food to poorer nations like Pakistan were not excluded.  Last month, during committee consideration of the Agriculture appropriations bill, I passed an amendment to explicitly exclude these export credit guarantees, most notably the GSM-102 program, from the sanctions.  Unfortunately, because of recent developments here on the floor, this amendment on agriculture will not be enacted into law soon enough to prevent the loss of this important export market.  Pakistan recently announced that they will tender for 350,000 metric tons of white wheat on July 15 for an August shipment. Without access to the GSM-102 credit guarantees, United States wheat producers will not sell a single kernel of wheat to Pakistan.  In recent years, Washington state wheat producers, in fact, Pacific Northwest growers, have sold more than one-third of their wheat to Pakistan. Washington state and other Pacific Northwest states produce almost exclusively white wheat, making Pakistan out number one export market.  Washington wheat needs this export market. This is a $300 million market for Washington wheat.  If we do not enact this legislation by July 15, we will lose not only the ability to bid on this tender, but potentially the entire Pakistan market, as other nations step in to fill the void.  That is why we are bringing this amendment as a stand-alone piece of legislation this afternoon.  If we do not pass this bill and preserve this important wheat market, the United States reputation as a reliable supplier of high quality wheat will be weakened and our competitive advantage in the global marketplace undermined.  That is why this Congress must act now.  Mr. President, I have a number of items that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record: A letter from Sandy Berger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, in support of my amendment; remarks of the President in a radio statement on wheat exports in support of the legislation; a statement by the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, in support of the legislation; a letter from the National Association of Wheat Growers in support of this legislation; and a letter from the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture in support of this legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              The White House,                                   Washington, DC., June 11, 1998.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: Thank you for your leadership in      addressing the question of Agriculture Department export      credit programs that may be affected by the imposition of      sanctions on Pakistan and India under section 102 of the Arms      Export Control Act. As you know, in implementing the      sanctions we are endeavoring, whenever possible, to minimize      the humanitarian impact on the people of India and Pakistan.       With this purpose in mind, the Administration supports the      legislative language in the bill, introduced today by you and      Senator Roberts, which would amend the Arms Export Control      Act to create an exception for ``credit, credit guarantees,      or other financial assistance provided by the Department of      Agriculture for the purchase or other provision of food or      other agricultural commodities.'' We further support your      efforts to move such legislative language as expeditiously as      possible.           Sincerely,                                             Samuel R. Berger,                                    Assistant to the President for     National Security Affairs.                                  ____                                                  The White House,                                Office of the Press Secretary,                                                    June 11, 1998.     For Immediate Release:     Remarks of the President in a Radio Statement on Wheat Exports       ``Today, I announced my support for Senator Murray's      legislation to ensure that American farmers can continue to      export wheat to Pakistan and India under the Department of      Agriculture's export credit program.       In implementing sanctions against India and Pakistan, we      are trying, wherever possible, to minimize the humanitarian      impact on the people of those countries. We have long      believed that food should not be used as a weapon to      influence other nations.       Farmers in the United States provide a significant      percentage of Pakistan's wheat imports. Cutting off that      supply would only hurt the citizens of Pakistan and American      farmers without furthering our important goals of      nonproliferation of atomic weapons. We hope this amendment is      passed as quickly as possible.''                                  ____Continuing Agricultural Export Credits to India and Pakistan  [From Radio Address of Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, June 12,                                  1998]       When India and Pakistan recently conducted underground      tests of their nuclear weapons, they crossed a line with the      United States that requires a firm, no-nonsense response.      This Administration has imposed tough sanctions that we      support and that are required by law.       But the law also has called into question the fate of U.S.      agricultural export credits. Export credits promote the sale      of U.S. farm products to buyers in countries facing economic      difficulties. These credits, which come at no cost to U.S.      taxpayers, have enabled our farmers and ranchers to sell      several billion dollars worth of food and fiber around the      world. Without these credits, our exports would decline, as      would our farm income, and areas in Asia and other parts of      the world would be more unstable because economically      troubled countries would have a harder time buying food.       While India makes only nominal use of these export credit      programs, Pakistan is another story. They are the third      largest market for U.S. wheat, and the top market for white      wheat. Last year, Pakistan purchased 81 million bushels of      U.S. wheat, almost all through export credit guarantees. And,      so far this year, these credits have made possible $162      million in U.S. wheat sales to buyers in Pakistan.       Unfortunately, as Congress wrote the arms control act,      these sales may soon be in jeopardy. By law, this      Administration could be forced to suspend these credits.       For humanitarian reasons, we should not use food as a      weapon to influence other nations. From an economic      perspective, it's important to show that the U.S. is      committed to being a reliable supplier of agricultural      products. And, for all practical purposes, the ones who will      be punished most by this action would be U.S. wheat farmers      who already have been beaten up by low prices.       This Administration will resist any action that would lead      to a de facto grain embargo, and I do not believe the arms      control act was written with that end in mind. We need to act      quickly to protect these export credits. Fortunately,      legislation now before the Congress--authored by Senator      Patty Murray, of Washington, and Senator Pat Roberts, of      Kansas--would do just that. This Administration strongly      supports this bill which would separate agricultural trade      from American's non-proliferation efforts.       For our world to be stable and secure in the next century,      we need strong international arms control efforts, but we      also need a strong agricultural trading system that is      capable of getting enough food to people around the world.      Both are essential ingredients to peace and stability, and      neither should be sacrificed to the other.                                  ____                                           National Association of                                                 Wheat Growers                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1998.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: We are writing in strong support of      the ``India-Pakistan Agricultural Credit Sanction Exemption      Bill''. It is our understanding that this bill will provide a      narrow exemption for food and food credit programs from any      possible sanctions resulting from Section 102(b) of the Arms      Export Control Act against the nations of India and Pakistan.      Further, this limited exemption is consistent with the      existing statutory exemption for commercial agricultural      loans.       Pakistan is the third largest wheat export market for the      United States. In 1997-98, Pakistan imported 2.2 million      metric tons. Wheat is the major staple of the Pakistani diet      and inadequate inventories could cause social unrest. In      1997, wheat shortages led to the collapse of the political      system. Such unrest could lead to the ouster of the current      government or worse, a military strike at India. We see food      as a means to protect the political stability of Pakistan.       Indian is subject to the same sanctions as a result of its      nuclear tests, however, it does not participate in the USDA      export credit guarantee program nor is it currently a major      importer of U.S. wheat. Nevertheless the narrow exemption      expressed in the ``India-Pakistan Agricultural Credit      Sanction Exemption Bill'' should be applied equally.       Thank you for your leadership in advancing the view that      food should not be used as a weapon of foreign policy. We      would also like to express our appreciation for your brave      effort to reverse the tide of unilateral economic sanctions.      Currently, eleven percent of the world wheat market is off      limits to U.S. producers due to the imposition of unilateral      economic sanctions. The addition of Pakistan and India to the      sanctions list would further disadvantage U.S. wheat farmers      and drive down already low wheat prices. It is our experience      that most sanctions serve no one but our competitors and do      little, if anything, to improve the behavior of the offending      government. We pledge to work with you and the bill's co-     sponsors to reform our unilateral sanctions policy and exempt      food and other humanitarian assistance from the U.S.      sanctions arsenal.           Sincerely,                                                       Bill Flory,     President.                                  ____                                     National Association of State                                   Departments of Agriculture,                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1998.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: On behalf of the nation's      commissioners, secretaries and directors of the state      departments of agriculture, I am writing to express our      strong support for your amendments to exempt certain      Department of Agriculture programs from sanctions under the      Arms Export Control Act. Prohibitions against U.S.      agricultural exports will only serve to hurt U.S. farmers.       As you know, the GSM-102 credit program is extremely      important to U.S. agricultural exporters. It serves as a      safety net for reluctant exporters by guaranteeing financing      for the sale of U.S. agricultural commodities to certain      foreign markets. The recently imposed sanctions against      Pakistan do not exempt such programs as the GSM-102 program,      virtually cutting off that market to U.S. agricultural      products. Many of our nation's farmers rely upon Pakistan as      a market for their products under the GSM-102 program.       Given the recent crisis in Asia, which has had a      substantial impact on U.S. agricultural exports, now is not      the time to cut off another key market for U.S. farm      products. Senator Murray, we appreciate your efforts on      behalf of U.S. agriculture. NASDA does not believe that      foreign policy should serve to ban the export of U.S.      agricultural products.           Sincerely,                                             Richard W. Kirchhoff,                                 Executive Vice President and CEO.
