  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, 45 days from today, temporary funding for the surface transportation trust fund expires. Despite the fact that we have 140,000 bridges that need repair or replacement, 40 percent of the road surface needs substantial investment, and a $70 billion backlog in our mass transit systems for a state of good repair, the support drops to zero in 45 days. We need an unimaginable amount of money to fund that for the next 5 years. We need $120 billion.  Where could we find $120 billion? Well, tomorrow the Republicans are going to repeal the remains of the estate tax. That is that two one-hundredths of 1 percent of estates that are worth more than $10 million, under the Republican plan, will pay no taxes when they leave that money to their kids--no taxes. It costs $270 billion to give that tax relief to two one-hundredths of 1 percent of the families in this country.  How about we spend that money rebuilding the Nation's infrastructure, put hundreds of thousands of people to work, benefit all of America with better roads, with safe bridges, with transit systems that don't kill people because of their state of bad repair? Even the wealthy might benefit from that, although they don't use the system because they fly above it in their helicopters and they don't notice from the backseat of their limousines.                          ____________________
