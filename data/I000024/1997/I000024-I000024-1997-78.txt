 It would be awful difficult to try to express my beliefs on this in 2 minutes. I would only say that this euphoria that we seem to enjoy around here that there is no threat is one that is of more concern to me than anything else we talk about.  When you say, can we afford it, I often wonder can we afford not to do it. The whole argument that has been made on this space-based amendment by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has been that right now there is nothing targeted at the United States. And I know the President has said in his State of the Union Message that there is nothing targeted at the United States for the first time in contemporary history when in fact we do not have any way of knowing that.  I suggest you might remember the hearings on Anthony Lake when he was trying to become the Director of Central Intelligence. We made a very conclusive point that right now there is no way of telling. There is no verification. I would suggest you remember what Gen. John Shalikashvili said. He said there is no verification process. Then he went on to say, ``But I can tell you we don't have missiles pointed at Russia.''  That is really comforting, isn't it, to think it is just kind of a gentleman's agreement that you do not aim at us and we will not aim at you. But let us assume that we could verify today or at the beginning of this debate that there is nothing aimed at the United States. It can be retargeted in a matter of minutes.  I would like to quote from Gen. Igor Sergeyev, the Commander in chief of the Russian Strategic Forces. He said, ``Missiles can be retargeted and launched from this war room mostly in a matter of minutes.''
