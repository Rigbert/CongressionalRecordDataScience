 President, this morning we will resume consideration of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. Under the consent agreement reached last night, the time until 11:45 this morning will be divided for debate in relation to the two pending AgJOBS amendments. At 11:45, we will proceed to two cloture votes on those amendments. Following those votes, the Senate will recess until 2:15 for the weekly policy luncheons. We will return then to the supplemental bill this afternoon, and as a reminder there will be two additional cloture votes today.  If cloture is not invoked on either of the AgJOBS amendments, then at 4:30 today we will have another cloture vote in relation to the Mikulski visa amendment. Upon the disposition of that amendment, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the underlying emergency appropriations bill.  As the majority leader stated last night, it is hoped that the Senate will invoke cloture this afternoon on the underlying bill. This is the only way of assuring that this important bill will be completed this week. I remind all of our colleagues that if cloture is invoked on the bill, it will still be open for debate and amendments for up to 30 more hours.  It is clear we have a lot of work to do over the course of today and tomorrow.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Page S3865]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
