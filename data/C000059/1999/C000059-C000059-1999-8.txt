Chairman, I had to work hard to get the lowest prices, the best workers, and the most bang for my buck. If I was not competitive I risked going out of business, plain and simple. This is the American way. H.R. 1402 would revert us back to a dairy market system that is quite simply anti-American, anti-business, and anti-consumer.  I have some of the most efficient and successful dairy farmers in this country, probably the largest dairy district in the United States. They watch their expenses, they make a great product, and if given the chance, they would be highly successful in an unregulated market.  We are just talking about a modest change here today, Mr. Chairman. We are just trying to change a system thatprices milk based upon the distance from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. What business in America would do that? I would encourage all Members to take a close look at this.  With current technology and transportation, it has changed this country and we no longer need to run a system that way. Oppose H.R. 1402 and let us get back to the American way.
