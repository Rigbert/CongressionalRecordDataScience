And, to say, when the Senate saw what we did in the House, they hung a portrait of Hattie Carraway, the first woman elected to the Senate, over on the Senate side.  So the road has been a very long road, even here inside the Capitol, which is supposed to reflect the history of the American people. We know as women, at the founding of our republic, as with slaves, we were considered three-quarters of a person, and it was not until 1920 with adoption of the 19th amendment to our Constitution were we considered full persons. And it was not until the Married Women Property Acts were passed in the State of New York in the late 1800s that in fact women began to emerge from the shackles that had held them in bondage for all of recorded history.  I congratulate my dear friend from California, Congresswoman Woolsey. I thank the chairman of the Committee. Thank you for bringing us into the 21st century.
