 I get the feeling--maybe because it is the Christmas season and I want to believe it--there is a growing recognition that rail service in our neck of the woods, as well as other parts of the country, are as essential to our interests as water is to the far west. It is as essential.  I thank my colleagues for their commitment and absolutely close by saying to Senator Byrd that I appreciate the fact that he understands, maybe better than anyone in this place, when another colleague cares about an issue that he believes is absolutely indispensable for his region. I thank him for acknowledging that.  I thank him for his--it is no new commitment; he has always been committed to Amtrak--acknowledgment of that and for his continued pledge of commitment to Amtrak. With this combination of the majority leader, the Democratic leader, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, if we cannot get it done, then shame on us.  I thank all of my colleagues. Sorry to have taken so much time, but as my colleagues said all day, this is a big, big, big, big deal to me personally, to my State, and I think to the Nation.  I yield the floor.
