I would like to ask the Chair, does this mean, then, that if a community loses jobs to China, 2,000 people in Salina, Ohio, out of work because Huffy Bicycle moved to China, that that community would not be eligible for Economic Development Administration assistance? Is that the effect of the gentleman's rejection of my request to include this amendment in the bill?
