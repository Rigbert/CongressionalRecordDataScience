 The aging of our military air refueling tanker fleet has become a critical military operations issue-one that requires a bold solution now. The Air Force's fleet of over 500 KC-135 air refueling tankers is, on average, more than 40 years old. In fact, the oldest of these tankers--100 KC-135E models--are close to 45 years in age. New 767 air refueling tankers are already under development and could begin replacing the KC-135 Es within 2 years. There would be no up-front development costs to the military.
