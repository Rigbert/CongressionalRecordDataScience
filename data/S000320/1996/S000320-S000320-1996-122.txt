 I regret that the Senate funding levels are constrained and that it has been difficult to identify funds for a number of worthwhile courthouse projects. As we proceed to conference with the House, I intend to work closely with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania to obtain funds for site acquisition and design, as requested by the Administration. The Erie project has been approved for funds by the Senate in previous legislation and thus deserves our best efforts.
