 President, yesterday afternoon, President Clinton announced his decision to fully normalize relations with Vietnam. I rise today to offer my strong support for this initiative.  I believe it is time for the United States to close the final chapter on a sad history with Vietnam, and open a new chapter with the optimism that a mutually beneficial relationship is now warranted, appropriate, and possible.  Mr. President, last year in response to Vietnam's heightened efforts to help account for the American servicemen lost in the war in Southeast Asia, President Clinton ended our economic embargo of Vietnam. At that time, many argued that ending the embargo would halt Vietnam's efforts to help us locate these men.  In fact, Mr. President, just the opposite has occurred, and Vietnam has actually strengthened its efforts to resolve POW/MIA cases.  By normalizing relations with Vietnam, we will continue on this path of mutual participation and strong efforts to account for these men, and increase our access to evidence in Vietnam.  The Veterans of Foreign Wars, which represents over 600,000 Vietnam veterans, now supports normalizing relations with Vietnam. They are optimistic that normalizing relations will in fact further progress on accounting for POW/MIAs in Southeast Asia.  A senior-level Presidential delegation, including Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord and Deputy Secretary for Veterans Affairs Hershel Gober, visited Vietnam in May to review the four categories the President laid out for examining progress on the POW/MIA issue; their findings were highly reassuring.  The Vietnamese government provided them with valuable new information, including analyses, maps, and witness data, that will help in reaching the fullest possible accounting of POWs and MIAs.  Mr. President, we made a commitment to the Vietnamese government. The Bush administration laid out specific goals that the Vietnamese would have to meet as conditions for normalization, and the Vietnamese have worked diligently to meet them. We should keep our commitment.  A sad truth of war is that many who courageously fought and gave their lives for the sake of freedom will never be located. The distinguished Senators from Arizona and Massachusetts, who have provided outstanding leadership on this issue, have pointed out that efforts to account for MIAs in Vietnam have been far more extensive than similar efforts after any previous war:  They emphasize that of the approximately 2,000 Americans who remain technically classified as missing-in-action, only 55 cases still hold serious questions, and all of these cases have been investigated at least once.  Mr. President, we must remember that there are over 8,000 remaining MIA cases from the Korean war and 78,000 from World War II, as noted by the Wall Street Journal. And the Vietnamese, who have made great strides in accounting for our MIAs, must live with the knowledge that 300,000 of their own people remain unaccounted for, according to the Vietnam Veterans for Reconciliation, a group of veterans who, although now involved in an array of fields from law to public policy, volunteer their time to try and resolve MIA cases.  All United States military personnel who have been involved in efforts with Vietnam to account for MIAs and POWs, including General John Vessey, who has led these efforts, state unequivocally that Vietnam's cooperation has been extensive.  Of course, the families and loved ones of the missing deserve our strongest efforts to know what happened to these brave Americans. But I believe that, at this point in time, 22 years after the United States withdrew from Vietnam, to normalize relations will be the best way to reach whatever closure to these cases is realistically possible.  Mr. President, normalizing relations with Vietnam will not only further our interests in accounting for our missing servicemen, it will serve other important United States interests in the region as well, particularly by advancing U.S. commercial interests in Asia.  The Pacific Rim holds 60 percent of the world's population today. It is the fastest growing trade area of the world, with many strong and dynamic economies. The Vietnamese economy has been growing at a rate of 8 percent a year and foreign investment in this nation has been rapidly increasing, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Just last month, the European Union announced an expansive economic agreement with Vietnam, including providing Vietnam with most-favored-nation status. This agreement will give the EU a substantial edge in trading in one of the world's fastest growing markets. And the EU is not alone: a total of 160 countries, including all of our major trading partners, enjoy full diplomatic relations with Vietnam.  With a population of over 70 million and enormous economic potential, Vietnam could become a major market for American services and products. Already, dozens of major United States companies are establishing a presence in Vietnam. But until now, they have been unable to reach their full potential.  Some of the companies involved in setting up ventures in Vietnam are Caterpillar, Inc., Proctor and Gamble, Boeing, Eastman Kodak, IBM, Lockheed Martin, and McDonnell Douglas. And the list goes on and on: Citibank, Nike, General Electric. In fact, over 100 companies belong to the Coalition for U.S.-Vietnam Trade, which endorses fully normalized relations. These companies are awaiting the opportunity to invest in Vietnam's dynamic economy.  Mr. President, for Americans, these opportunities mean more jobs at home. One of the great benefits of this new chapter in United States-Vietnamese relations will be that ordinary Americans will benefit economically from the trade that will result.  There is an additional benefit that will flow from fully normalized relations with Vietnam. Greater contacts and expanded trade will put the United States in a better position to encourage respect for human rights and democracy in Vietnam. Increased cooperation and contact will lead to a more active exchange of ideas.  As we saw with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, when the barriers began to come down, Western ideas about democracy and freedom soon took hold. So too, with Vietnam: as the American and Vietnamese peoples come into greater contact with each other, the people of Vietnam will benefit by enjoying greater democratization.  Mr. President, today is a day of hope and optimism for the United States and Vietnam. Today, we put the tragedies of the past behind us and begin to work together to build a better relationship. Our children, and the children of Vietnam, will have a brighter future because of this decision. I commend President Clinton for taking this bold step.                          ____________________
