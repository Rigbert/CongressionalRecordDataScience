 President, I am very glad that this debate is taking place before this body. Having had an opportunity on two separate occasions to push concepts similar to what is in this legislation to accomplish the same goal in maybe not exactly the same way, I am glad that we are here today and that there is a bipartisan effort to get this legislation passed. I think being truly bipartisan is a continuation on these issues of guaranteeing some health insurance to people who can afford it--things that we have tried to accomplish before in a bipartisan fashion.  I respect Secretary of Treasury Bentsen because when he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee he had proposals which I think were bipartisan with the ranking Republican at that time included in H.R. 11, a major tax bill. And those health insurance provisions went through without any debate on the floor of this body because they were accepted as things that should be done. To see that happen was good. Obviously, President Bush vetoed that bill because he did not like the tax provisions that were in it.
