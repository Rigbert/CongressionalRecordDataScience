President, that is very kind of the Senator from West Virginia. My statement is quite lengthy. So if the Senator from West Virginia, in light of his commitment, would like to precede me, I would be more than happy to have him do so. I would encourage him to go ahead. Then the Senator from Connecticut has graciously said he would allow me to go next. We are all so nice around here.
