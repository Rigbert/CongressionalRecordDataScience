President, I came to the floor and asked unanimous consent for two bills from the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee--I did not ask that the bills be passed, only that they be brought to the floor and considered. I talked to Senator Reid of Nevada about this and wanted to give Senator Reid the option to determine the amount of time in the debate, in consultation with the Republican minority.  At that time, just as this morning, a Republican Senator--in that case, Senator Larry Craig of Idaho--objected. Why? Well, they objected because they did not want us to move to issues involving America's veterans. I think our veterans deserve to have legislation such as the bills I have asked to be considered.
