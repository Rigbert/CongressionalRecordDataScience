President, I would like to recognize and honor an exemplary Oregonian family who will soon gather for their 125th family reunion. Family reunions are difficult to organize and even harder to make longlasting traditions. Nonetheless, since 1891 the children of Hanson and Lavina Stevens have managed to hold yearly family reunions, with the exception of one missed reunion during the First World War--truly an amazing feat.  In many ways, the history of the Stevens family is the history of the State of Oregon. In 1852, the Stevens family decided to take advantage of the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850, which encouraged settlement of the Oregon Territory. Hanson and Lavina Stevens, their eight children and a wagon loaded with vital supplies traveled the treacherous Oregon Trail.  Twenty-two other wagons traveled alongside the Stevens family and undertook the Oregon Trail's most dangerous migration year ever recorded. While all of the other families decided to stop near Fort Bridger, WY, in search of gold, Hanson Stevens concluded that mining camps were not suitable for raising his family. Instead, the Stevens, like thousands of other pioneers, chose to settle in Oregon. They chose the ``Promised Land.'' Ever since, the Stevens and their descendants have contributed to the territory and then the State of Oregon.  In June of 1891, the entire family gathered for the birthday of the family patriarch at the time, Isaac Stevens. That tradition continued on each year, and eventually turned from a birthday party into a more formal family reunion.  Today the Stevens decedents are six clans strong, and they rotate the responsibility for hosting their memorable reunions. This year the Ringo Clan will be hosting the 125th reunion on July 19, 2015 at Champoeg Park in St. Paul, OR.  The family tells me that each year the various clans all give a report to the family, and the details are recorded in a leather-bound journal. As you can imagine, this journal traces not just the history of the Stevens family but also provides a view into the history of Oregon and the United States.  And that is part of what makes family reunions so wonderful. They don't just connect us to the aunts, uncles and cousins we don't see very often; they also connect us to our past, our heritage. Family reunions are a place to share family lore, shared values, and traditions.  I am thrilled to recognize the Stevens family 125th annual reunion. I hope to see the Stevens family tradition continue for many, many years to come.                          ____________________
