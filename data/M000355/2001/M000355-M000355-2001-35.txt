 The short answer to Senator Voinovich's inquiry is that Senator Leahy and I strongly support the funding levels for Serbia and Montenegro that are recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee, and that will be our position in the Conference.  Those of us who closely follow developments in the Balkans appreciate the many challenges that reformers in Serbia and Montenegro face each day, and we note the progress that has been made in the past year alone. As Senators Voinovich and Helms have stated, many challenges lie ahead, including the need to address the troubling and complex issues of corruption and legal reform. I think we all agree that America must be clear in our support of these reform efforts. Senator Leahy and I believe that the carefully drafted provisions in our bill, and the funding levels we recommend, do just that.
