 President, earlier this month, the Senate voted to help families affected by lead poisoning in Flint as part of the Water Resources Development Act, or WRDA. We are glad to see that progress is being made in the House as well to pass a WRDA bill that also includes help for Flint families. I have worked closely with Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to encourage that progress, and I made it clear to them that I was extremely serious, and I just mentioned that again to Senator Stabenow--very serious about defending the Senate position in conference and ensuring that Flint funding remains in the final bill.  We have a path forward to getting our work done, and if we keep working together, we will.
