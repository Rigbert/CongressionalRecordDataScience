Chairman, first, I wanted to say to the gentleman from Indiana that I appreciate the way he has addressed this issue. It seems to me that all Members should want to see more dollars devoted to the drug approval process and less to bureaucracy, and I think we can agree on that on a bipartisan basis.  We do need comprehensive FDA reforms. I have introduced legislation towards this end. I know a number of our colleagues have as well.  We ought to be pushing for tighter time lines to get products out, save money, save time, and on this matter of off-label drug uses, I think we can come up with a policy that ends FDA's censorship over important medical journal articles and at the same time protects consumers.  For example, what I have proposed is we say that these journal articles would be made available, but the FDA, if they found questions in a journal article, would be in a position to add additional information so this would supplement what was out in a journal article.  This, I found, has been acceptable to industry. It has been acceptable to the cancer groups that the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. McIntosh] has correctly discussed. This is the kind of constructive work we can do on a bipartisan basis.  I want to tell the gentleman from Indiana, I am very pleased that he has kept his amendment on the question of freezing front-office dollars.
