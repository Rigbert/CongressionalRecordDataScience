President, on Monday morning at 1 a.m., I voted no on the cloture motion to the latest Reid managers' package, which was only made available Saturday, because I am adamantly opposed to this $2.5 trillion government-run health care system with its $\1/2\ trillion increase in taxes on Americans and nearly $\1/2\ trillion in cuts to Medicare to help pay for it. I am opposed to public financing of abortion this bill allows. I am opposed to a facade of health care reform that in no way seriously addresses tort reform and will only increase premiums and the cost of health care for all Americans. I am opposed to the special deals for only certain States in this bill to buy off votes. I am opposed to the special deals for only certain States in this bill to buy off votes. I am opposed to the increased burden of at least $26 billion on States including Oklahoma mandated under this bill. I am opposed to no serious effort at all to include any amendments from Republicans. Republican amendments to block tax increases, block cuts to Medicare, impose tort reforms, try to impose some kind of discipline on the government take-over of health care in this country, among other amendments and motions have failed by nearly party-line votes. I am opposed to this bill, and most importantly, the American people are opposed to this bill. They know this bill is a complete disaster. The next few votes leading up to the final vote on this package are all procedural votes, and I will be opposed to themall. But all 60 Democrats will vote for them. Democrats do what they are told. The votes include accepting this new Reid managers' package, cloture on the original Reid substitute, accepting the original Reid substitute, cloture on the underlying bill, and finally the final passage of his colossal mistake. Since I am opposed to each one of these votes, I will not remain in Washington to vote against these procedural maneuvers since that will have the same effect as voting no, and will return to vote against final passage of this bill.                          ____________________
