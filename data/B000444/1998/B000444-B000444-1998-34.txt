 President, I rise today to submit a resolution to designate October 16, 1998 as ``National Mammography Day.'' Since 1993, I have introduced similar measures, and each year the Senate has gone on record in support of the value of mammography by approving this resolution.  The American Cancer Society estimates that 178,700 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998, while 43,500 women will eventually succumb to the disease this year. However, despite these horrifying numbers, the cure for breast cancer continues to allude us.  Experts therefore agree that early detection and treatment are a woman's best defenses in the fight against this killer. Mammograms can reveal thepresence of small cancers up to 2 years before regular clinical breast examinations or breast self-examinations [BSE], reducing mortality by more than 30 percent.  Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting sets aside one day in the midst of ``National Breast Cancer Awareness Month'' to encourage women to receive or sign up for a mammogram. In doing so, we can educate our nation's mothers, sisters, and friends on the importance of early detection through mammography and prevent more women from dying from this disease. I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing mammograms as a key element in the fight against breast cancer.                          ____________________
