 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 29. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then proceed to a period of morning business for up to 30 minutes, with the first 15 minutes under the control of Senator Hutchison or her designee and the second 15 minutes under the control of the minority leader or his designee; provided that following morning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 2800, the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.
