President, I rise today along with my colleagues, Senators Collins, Sarbanes, Chafee, Schumer, Akaka, Carper, Dodd, and Corzine to introduce a piece of legislation we believe establishes a framework for ending long-term homelessness in the United States. There is a growing consensus around the country that fifteen years after the passage of the McKinney-Vento Act, we now know how to help communities break the cycle of repeated and prolonged homelessness. Federal dollars, combined with local efforts, can help bring an end to this problem. The CommunityPartnership to End Homelessness Act of 2002 is intended to realign the incentives in the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act so that communities are rewarded for initiatives that will prevent and end homelessness, instead of receiving Federal funding for programs that maintain the status quo.  During the past year, the Urban Institute estimates that at least 2.3 million, and perhaps as many as 3.5 million people, have been homeless. On any given day in the United States, at least 800,000 people are homeless, including about 200,000 children. Homelessness has an especially devastating impact on these children. If they are able to go to school, it is well documented that homeless children face increased challenges, such as learning disabilities and emotional and behavioral problems.  This year's U.S. Conference of Mayors report on ``Hunger and Homelessness in America's Cities'' finds that requests for emergency shelter by families increased by 22 percent. Unfortunately, over half of all these requests for housing assistance went unmet. In my State, the Rhode Island shelter system provided more nights of shelter this past year than at any point in its history.  Locally and nationally, several trends seem clear. First, despite the economic boom in the 1990s, homelessness has increased. Second, increasing numbers of families with children are being forced into our emergency shelter system. In March of this year, the Washington Post, reported that there had been a 25 percent rise in homelessness in Fairfax County, Virginia during the past four years, and most of that increase consisted of homeless families. Third, a relatively small number of long-term homeless persons continue to utilize a disproportionate number of the bed nights in our Nation's shelters.  When it was created in 1987, the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act was intended to be an emergency federal response to the ``crisis'' of homelessness. Instead, it has become a safety net for low-income households who are inadequately served by mainstream programs such as Section 8 and Medicaid. Too often, mainstream programs are shifting the cost and responsibility for housing and a variety of support services to emergency homeless assistance programs.  To reverse this trend, the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act of 2002 would focus federal funds on projects and programs that are helping to prevent and end homelessness. This legislation also would allow maximum local creativity in addressing homelessness by consolidating multiple HUD McKinney-Vento programs into one program with a list of eligible activities.  Our bill would also provide incentives for communities to build permanent housing for the disabled and for non-disabled families. It would encourage the creation of homelessness prevention programs, and it would promote comprehensive and inclusive local planning. Finally, it would require greater program accountability through the use of outcome-based performance evaluations.  The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act of 2002 is endorsed by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the Corporation for Supportive Housing, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, the National Equity Fund, Inc., the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the McAuley Institute and the Enterprise Foundation.  We need to find the will and the resources to eradicate homelessness in this country. The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act is only the beginning. The needs of homeless individuals and families fall within the jurisdiction of many federal departments and congressional committees. Thus, I believe additional legislation is going to be necessary in order to require Federal agencies such as HHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs to work with HUD in a more coordinated manner towards achieving this goal. I am committed to addressing this crisis, and I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this bill and other homeless prevention efforts.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2573       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Partnership to End      Homelessness Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       Section 102 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act      (42 U.S.C. 11301) is amended to read as follows:     ``SEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       ``(1) the United States faces a crisis of individuals and      families who lack basic affordable housing and appropriate      shelter;       ``(2) assistance from the Federal Government is an      important factor in the success of efforts by State and local      governments and the private sector to address the problem of      homelessness in a comprehensive manner;       ``(3) there are several Federal Government programs to      assist persons experiencing homelessness, including programs      for individuals with disabilities, veterans, and youth;       ``(4) homeless assistance programs must be evaluated on the      basis of their effectiveness in reducing homelessness and      transitioning individuals and families to permanent housing      and stability;       ``(5) States and units of general local government      receiving Federal block grant and other Federal grant funds      must be evaluated on the basis of their effectiveness in--       ``(A) implementing plans to appropriately discharge      individuals to and from mainstream service systems; and       ``(B) reducing barriers to participation in mainstream      programs, as identified in--       ``(i) a report by the General Accounting Office entitled      `Homelessness: Coordination and Evaluation of Programs Are      Essential', issued February 26, 1999; or       ``(ii) a report by the General Accounting Office entitled      `Homelessness: Barriers to Using Mainstream Programs', issued      July 6, 2000;       ``(6) an effective plan for reducing homelessness should      provide a comprehensive housing system (including permanent      housing and, as needed, transitional housing) that recognizes      that, while some individuals and families experiencing      homelessness attain economic viability and independence      utilizing transitional housing and then permanent housing,      others can reenter society directly through acquiring      permanent housing;       ``(7) supportive housing activities include the provision      of permanent housing or transitional housing and appropriate      supportive services in an environment that can meet the      short-term or long-term needs of persons experiencing      homelessness as they reintegrate into mainstream society;       ``(8) homeless housing and supportive services programs      within a community are most effective when they are developed      and operated as part of an inclusive, collaborative, locally      driven homeless planning process that involves as      decisionmakers persons experiencing homelessness, advocates      for persons experiencing homelessness, service organizations,      government officials, business persons, neighborhood      advocates, and other community members;       ``(9) homelessness should be treated as a symptom of many      neighborhood and community problems, whose remedies require a      comprehensive approach integrating all available resources;       ``(10) there are many private sector entities, particularly      nonprofit organizations, that have successfully operated      outcome-effective homeless programs;       ``(11) Federal homeless assistance should supplement other      public and private funding provided by communities for      housing and supportive services for low-income households;       ``(12) the Federal Government has a responsibility to      establish partnerships with State and local governments and      private sector entities to address comprehensively the      problems of homelessness; and       ``(13) while the results of Federal programs targeted for      persons experiencing homelessness have been positive, the      multitude of such programs calls for unification and      simplification of the process by which nonprofit      organizations, State and local governments, and the private      sector apply for funds.       ``(b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--       ``(1) to provide funds for programs to assist individuals      and families in the transition from homelessness, and to      prevent homelessness for those vulnerable to homelessness;       ``(2) to consolidate the separate homeless assistance      programs carried out under title IV (consisting of the      supportive housing program and related innovative programs,      the safe havens program, the section 8 assistance program for      single-room occupancy dwellings, the shelter plus care      program, and the rural homeless housing assistance program)      into a single program with specific eligible activities;       ``(3) to allow flexibility and creativity in rethinking      solutions to homelessness, including alternative housing      strategies, outcome-effective service delivery, and the      involvement of persons experiencing homelessness in      decisionmaking regarding opportunities for their long-term      stability, growth, and well-being;       ``(4) to ensure that multiple Federal agencies are involved      in the provision of housing, health care, human services,      employment, and education assistance to persons experiencing      homelessness, as appropriate for the missions of the      agencies, through the funding provided for implementation of      programs carried out under this Act and other programs      targeted for persons experiencing homelessness, and      mainstream funding, and to promote coordination among those      Federal agencies, including providing funding for an      Interagency Council on Homelessness to advance such      coordination;       ``(5) to create a unified and performance-based process for      allocating and administering funds under title IV;       ``(6) to encourage comprehensive, collaborative local      planning of housing and services programs for persons      experiencing homelessness; and       ``(7) to focus the resources and efforts of the public and      private sectors on ending and preventing homelessness.''.
