President, today I introduce the Liquefied Natural Gas Safety and Security Act of 2005.  The siting of liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals is an issue that has taken on critical importance for me and for the people of Rhode Island in recent months, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is now considering proposals by KeySpan Energy and Weaver's Cove Energy to establish LNG marine terminals in Providence, RI and Fall River, MA, respectively.  I recognize that natural gas is an important and growing component of NewEngland's and the Nation's energy supply, and that imported LNG offers a promising new supply source to complement our domestic natural gas supplies. In a post-September 11 world, however, we must consider the substantial safety and security risks associated with siting LNG marine terminals in urban communities and requiring LNG tankers to pass within close proximity to miles of densely populated coastline.  The LNG Safety and Security Act would address these concerns by improving FERC's siting process, requiring closer collaboration between FERC and the Coast Guard, and protecting States' permitting rights under Federal and State law.  First, the bill would improve FERC's approval process for LNG terminals. Instead of reviewing proposed LNG projects on a first come-first served basis, the bill would require FERC to work with states and the Coast Guard to pursue a regional approach to LNG terminal siting, including a review of offshore and remote sites and a determination of how many LNG terminals a region needs. To address the substantial new costs faced by state and local agencies responsible for security and safety at the LNG terminal and along shipping routes, the bill would require the developer to create a cost-sharing plan describing direct cost reimbursements to these agencies. To make sure that FERC addresses all relevant safety and security issues in its Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for an LNG terminal--and that the public has access to this information before FERC makes a final decision--the bill requires FERC to await the completion of an Incident Action Plan by the Coast Guard before issuing a Final EIS. It would require FERC to incorporate the non-security sensitive components of the Incident Action Plan into the Final EIS, including all safety and security resource requirements identified by the Coast Guard.  Second, to ensure that States continue to have the authority to establish meaningful safety and security standards and to protect their fragile coastal environments, the bill requires FERC to comply with Federal laws that may be enforced by States, including the National Historic Preservation Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act; clarifies the right of a State to review an application to site an LNG facility under any of these laws; and establishes that FERC has no authority to preempt a State permitting determination under federal or state law.  Third, to ensure that the Department of Transportation's safety standards for LNG terminals truly encourage remote siting as Congress intended, the bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue new regulations establishing standards to promote the remote siting of LNG terminals.  Finally, to protect coastal communities along LNG shipping routes, the bill requires the Coast Guard to issue regulations establishing thermal and vapor exclusion zones for vessels transporting LNG, based on existing DOT regulations for LNG terminals on land.  I again want to emphasize that I recognize LNG's important role in the energy infrastructure of Rhode Island and the Nation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure reliable supplies of natural gas to our homes and businesses without siting LNG import terminals in densely populated urban areas. I am confident that we can achieve this goal by requiring FERC and other federal agencies to explore a broad list of alternatives--including offshore LNG facilities--to bring more natural gas to our communities while minimizing the risk to our citizens.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 684       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Liquefied Natural Gas Safety      and Security Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. SITING OF LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS IMPORT FACILITIES.       Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b) is      amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(d)(1) Before issuing an order authorizing an applicant      to site, construct, expand, or operate a liquefied natural      gas import facility, the Commission shall require the      applicant, in cooperation with the Commandant of the Coast      Guard and State and local agencies that provide for the      safety and security of the liquefied natural gas import      facility and any vessels that serve the facility, to develop      a cost-sharing plan.       ``(2) A cost-sharing plan developed under paragraph (1)      shall include a description of any direct cost reimbursements      that the applicant agrees to provide to any State and local      agencies with responsibility for security and safety--       ``(A) at the liquefied natural gas import facility; and       ``(B) in proximity to vessels that serve the facility.       ``(e)(1) In this subsection, the term `region' means a      census region designated by the Bureau of the Census as of      the date of enactment of this subsection.       ``(2) Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of      this subsection and annually thereafter, the Commission      shall--       ``(A) review all applications for the siting, construction,      expansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas import      facility in a region that are pending with the Commission;
