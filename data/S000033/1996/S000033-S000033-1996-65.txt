 Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, it is a national disgrace that large numbers of people in this country, including many elderly people, go cold in the wintertime. That is not what this country is supposed to be about. It is especially stupid that we have a situation where people are living in extremely energy inefficient homes. They lack storm windows, they have cracks in their walls, and they have inadequate heating systems so that the little amount of money that they have that goes into heat ends up being used very inefficiently.  The weatherization program is an intelligent, cost-effective program. It saves money and it helps a lot of people. I commend the authors of the amendment.
