Madam Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Chairman Pombo) and the gentleman from Texas (Chairman Barton) for their fine work on a good piece of legislation that starts our process in becoming independent, providing energy policy, which I have heard none from the other side. Remarkably, when I hear people talking about new innovative ideas, they do not tell me what ``new'' is.  We are fossil-fuel oriented, and I will admit to that. And we are also dependent, and we have to admit to that. And we are talking about an area that is not pristine, an area, in fact, that should be developed that is 74 miles from the pipeline, an area that we have developed already in Prudhoe Bay, and we can see the great damage that is done up there.
