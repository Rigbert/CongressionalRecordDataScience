President, I thank Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for considering this amendment. For purposes of clarification, it is my understanding that this amendment will decrease funding from the National Oceanic and Atomospheric Agency(NOAA) Procurement, Acquisition and Construction account by $500,000, specifically from the ``Norman Consolidation Project,'' and add the same amount, $500,000, to the International Trade Administration, Trade Development account for International Trade Processing Center Programs in McCain County, Oklahoma. Is that how the Senator from New Hampshire understands this amendment?
