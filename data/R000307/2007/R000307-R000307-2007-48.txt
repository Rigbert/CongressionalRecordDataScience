President, I wish to honor the city of Lenexa, KS. On May 8, Lenexa, which is known as the City of Festivals for the numerous festivals and events it hosts each year, will mark its 100th anniversary. This grand event will be part of a weeklong community celebration of history and culture.  Lenexa was platted in 1869 by French-born civil engineer Octave Chanute, who, in addition to designing the original Hannibal Bridge over the Missouri River in Kansas City, also served as a mentor to the Wright Brothers in their quest for flight.  Lenexa was named for Na Nex Se, a highly respected, hard-working Shawnee Indian woman, the daughter-in-law of Chief Black Hoof. Thirty-eight years later, on May 8, 1907, Lenexa was incorporated as a City of the 3rd Class.  In Lenexa's earliest days, people from various backgrounds and cultures came together to form this great city. With a population of approximately 300, the young community boasted a healthful location, graded schools, three churches, suburban train service, excellent telephone service, and an electric railway station.  Today, Lenexa has grown to a population of 46,000 residents and enjoys a healthy business base and is considered a city of choice for a variety of high-tech and bioscience companies. The city also is looked to as a leader in local government initiatives, including watershed management and public safety.  Lenexa cherishes its rich history, heritage and culture, and with this celebration marking the city's 100th anniversary, Lenexa honors its past while looking forward to the future. I congratulate Lenexa and its residents, and I wish them an outstanding second hundred years.                          ____________________
