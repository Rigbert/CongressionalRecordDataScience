 I would just very briefly make the following point ahead of him.  Another way of looking at the way the Senate is being run that affects Democratic Senators:  Democratic House Members from Oregon have had 12 rollcall votes on their amendments, but Oregon's Democratic Senator does not have any--none. Democratic House Members from Virginia have gotten 11 rollcall votes on their amendments, but Virginia's two Democratic Senators have gotten none--zero. Democratic House Members from Colorado have gotten seven rollcall votes on their amendments, but the Democratic Senators from Colorado have gotten none--zero. Democratic House Members from California have gotten 37 rollcall votes on their amendments, but California's Democratic Senators have gotten none--zero.  So that is the condition of the Senate today. It is not just affecting the Republican minority, but the Democratic majority as well.  I see Senator Alexander is on the floor. I yield the floor.
