President, let me say at the outset that I salute Senator Enzi from Wyoming. He has shown extraordinary leadership and political courage to bring this issue to the floor. The last time we had a serious conversation about health care for American families and businesses was in that one brief shining moment when the Democrats were in control and brought the Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor; otherwise, during the time that I have served in the Senate, we have run away from this issue. I salute Senator Enzi. Although I disagree with his bill, and I will explain why, I admire his political courage and vision to report a bill from his committee and bring the issue to the floor. I have said that before the press, I have said it at home, and I want to say it on the floor on the Record. Although we may disagree on approach, I respect him very much for being willing to bring this complex and politically controversial issue to the floor.  I think if you put it up for a vote as to when a week ends in America, we might not reach a consensus. There are some people who would argue: Why, a week ends on Friday night. That is the end of the week. Others say: No, a week ends on Sunday night. But what we have found is that Health Care Week in the Senate ends at 2:30 on Wednesday afternoon because that is when the Republican majority leader came to the floor and filled the tree, which means closed down amendments on the health care debate.  The Republican majority leader felt there were only two issues relevant to health care in America. The first was the issue of medical malpractice and preempting the States that traditionally regulate medical malpractice. For I believe the fourth time, Senator Frist offered the medical malpractice bills at the beginning of the week, and they failed again, this time failing to even attract a majority of the Senators supporting either bill that he brought. Then the Senator moved to the health care issue before us: small business health insurance. Then the majority leader came today, having given us all of about a day and a half to consider this issue, and said that is the end of the story. No more amendments. We are not going to consider any other health care amendments in the bill before us. We are closing down the Senate when it comes to health care issues.  That is interesting because what the Republicans have done is to close down debate on stem cell research. Senator Frist came to the floor and said: We don't want Christmas tree amendments. Christmas tree amendments--stem cell research. I don't know if Senator Frist has been back in his State. I have. They have roundtable discussions about stem cell research. They sit at a table surrounded by men and women who have their hopes pinned on medical research, those who are suffering from juvenile diabetes and the serious problems that come with it--a mother who gets up several times during the course of the night to wake her young daughter and to test her blood to see if she needs insulin, if she needs to eat something; another family with a young man with Lou Gehrig's disease who has reached the point now where he cannot communicate. All he can do is sit in his wheelchair, this young man in his 20s, with tears rolling down his face, as his mother says: Senator, please, please do something about stem cell research. It may not save him, but it may save someone else. Parkinson's disease--to have my colleague and closest friend in Congress, Lane Evans, a young man stricken with Parkinson's, forced to end his congressional career, who had the strength to come to the floor last year in the House and beg for stem cell research and others suffering from Parkinson's and spinal cord injuries. Think of those people whose lives have been compromised and slowed down because of these injuries. All they want is a chance for a vote on stem cell research.  This President has prohibited stem cell research beyond a single line of available stem cells and has virtually closed it down as a Federal undertaking. We have decided, as a matter of Federal policy, that we will not do this research. We have been asking for over a year for a vote on the floor of the Senate on stem cell research. We were heartened when the Senate majority leader, Senator Frist, came to the floor in July of last year and said: I may be switching my position, he said, but I am going to support stem cell research. It meant so much because we respect him, a heart transplant surgeon, a man with his medical credentials, to break from the President on this issue, on stem cell research and say he would join us in the fight. But how disheartening to hear today as the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from Tennessee refer to debate on stem cell research as not relevant to health care. Not relevant. It may not be relevant to their lives, but it is relevant to the lives of thousands of Americans.  We in the Senate know what is at stake. If we don't bring this matter up for a vote this week on stem cell research, the chances of seeing the bill before the end of the year are slim to none. When we think of all of the families counting on us to step up for stem cell research, I want to ask you, Mr. President, isn't this worth a fight? Isn't this worth a fight on the floor of the Senate, to make sure that we get a vote this week on stem cell research, for the people who are counting on us, whose lives are compromised and broken because of disease and illness? Isn't this worth a fight in Health Care Week? Obviously, not on the other side of the aisle. They have declared stem cell research not relevant to Health Care Week.  And what else? They have decided that Medicare prescription Part D is not an important part of Health Care Week. Medicare prescription Part D, where some 9 million Americans in 5 days, if they don't sign up for this program, will face a lifetime penalty. Medicare prescription Part D is a program written by pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies, a program which has been one of the worst that has ever been dreamed up on Capitol Hill. When we want to take a few moments to fix some basics and take the penalty off seniors, the Republican leadership says, now, wait a minute. That is not relevant to a Health Care Week debate. Prescription drugs for 9 million seniors, that is not relevant to a health care debate.  Of course, we have heard Senator Dorgan of North Dakota repeatedlyasking for the opportunity to reimport drugs into the United States so that people have a fighting chance to pay for the drugs that keep them alive. He has been stopped by the Bush administration. He has fought for this opportunity to bring this issue to the floor time and again and insists on it this week in Health Care Week, and the Republican leadership has said, affordable prescription drugs coming in from foreign countries is not relevant to Health Care Week.  So, Mr. President, I think you can understand why many of us come to the floor at this point disappointed. First, we were encouraged by Senator Enzi's decision to bring this matter forward, and then when Senator Frist said we are going to make it not just the Enzi bill, it will be Health Care Week, we finally said: Here is our chance, a chance for all of the people who have been waiting on us and who have been counting on us. Well, that chance was snuffed out at 2:30 this afternoon with Senator Frist's procedural motion. Health Care Week turned out to be too good to be true.  It is interesting as well when we consider the basic underlying issue of health insurance. Do you know what the two competing issues are on health insurance? It is very basic. I don't have to explain it to my colleagues in the Senate, and I will tell you why. The proposal that I and Senator Blanche Lincoln have brought to the floor of the Senate to make available to every business across America is exactly the same health insurance that Members of Congress have. If it is good enough for Members of Congress, we think it is good enough for American families. But I listen as Senator Enzi and Republicans stand up and talk about what a terrible idea this would be, to offer to every American the same kind of health insurance that Members of Congress and Federal employees have. Well, if it is so bad, I wonder how many of them have decided not to sign up for it themselves. My guess is they have all signed up for it.  Do you know why it is so good? It is not a government plan. It is a plan administered by the Government at less than 1 percent administrative cost that offers private insurance plans to Federal employees and their families, retirees, and Members of Congress. Private insurance offered by the Government. It is so good that it has worked for 40 years.  Now we have the Republicans coming to the floor, Senator Enzi and others, saying what a terrible idea this is, the same health insurance that protects the Senator arguing against it. You have to ask yourself why, if it is so good for us, can't we offer it to American families? Instead, Senator Enzi has come forward with a plan which makes dramatic changes, not to the health insurance we might offer to the uninsured but in reducing protection, reducing coverage, and increasing costs for people who are already insured. If you thought to yourself for a moment, that is an interesting debate on health insurance, but I am not worried about it, I already have my plan, think twice, because the Enzi bill which he brings before us is going to make your health care less valuable, less protection, and more cost. That is the Enzi plan. That is unnecessary and unfair.  Let me tell you what two organizations have to say about Senator Enzi's proposal, his health insurance plan. You might expect I am going to read something that has some political ring to it. Who is this organization that Senator Durbin is quoting? They must have some political agenda. I would like to quote from a letter, dated May 10--today--from the American Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society is hardly a political organization. How do they describe the Enzi bill before us?       It is our view that the basic construct of this legislation      is fatally flawed and therefore, we ask you to oppose it,      regardless of the amendment process on the Senate floor.      Consumers will be at the risk of losing important cancer-     related protections such as guaranteed insurance coverage of      colorectal cancer screening and clinical trial participation.  They go on to say:       It is our view that the Enzi bill will not result in      increased access to quality care for most people.  That is from the American Cancer Society.  Now let me go to another letter, and you decide whether this is a political organization. It is the American Diabetes Association. The American Diabetes Association believes that:       The proposed approach in the Enzi bill is fundamentally      flawed and must be opposed in all forms in order to protect      your constituents with diabetes. Any preemption or weakening      of State laws is a major threat to the well-being and lives      of people with diabetes and should not be acceptable to the      Senate.  And listen to these statistics: Every 24 hours, 4,100 people in America are diagnosed with diabetes--4,100 every 24 hours. There are 230 amputations from diabetes every day in America. There are 120 people entering end-stage kidney disease programs, and 55 people go blind every day from diabetes. We lose 613 Americans daily and 225,000 annually due to this epidemic. Diabetes continues to grow by more than 8 percent each year. And listen to this: One in three of our children will be diagnosed with diabetes in their lifetime--one in three of our children will be diagnosed with diabetes in their lifetime.  They go on to say:        . . . we cannot allow for any loss of ground in this      battle.  Signed by the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer. They say:       Accordingly, we ask you to stand with us in full opposition      to [the Enzi legislation], no matter which cosmetic changes      may be proposed on the floor.  This is a stark and clear choice for the Members of the Senate, what we offer to small businesses and Americans presently uninsured: the same quality health insurance that protects our families as Members of Congress have or we offered them a watered down health insurance program that has been rejected by the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the American Association of Retired Persons, the AFL/CIO, AMA, the American Nurses Association--I could go on for three pages of health groups in America that reject the Enzi approach because it will reduce coverage.  We know what the problem is. It has been a long time since we have even taken up this issue. During that period of time, we have seen the number of uninsured Americans grow from 37 million in 1993 to 46 million today--46 million uninsured Americans. But this is the wrong medicine. This Enzi bill will put the insurance companies, not the doctors, in charge of health care. People will be worse off, with less protection.  Yesterday, Senator Kennedy and I went down to a press conference a few blocks from here. A beautiful young lady came up. She was from Cleveland, OH. She brought her guide dog with her and she told the story about how her diabetes, untreated, resulted in her blindness--young, beautiful lady. She said: I didn't have coverage for it in my health insurance, and as a result my life is much different. She said: I almost died. I am lucky to be alive and thankful to be alive. But when you talk about diabetes protection, you are talking about that young woman and others who could be just like her.  Another young woman came to speak to us and told us how she was a young mother, healthy as could be, but tired from raising those three little kids. Somebody suggested to her to get a mammogram. She thought about it because she had a history of breast cancer in her family, but she said to herself: How much is it going to cost?  They said: $250.  She said: We don't have that. I need $250 for my kids.  She said to her husband: Check the health insurance and see if it covers mammograms.  Her husband called her the next day and said: You can get the test the next day for free.  This beautiful young woman went to get a mammogram and learned within 24 hours that she had the earliest stage of breast cancer. They did a lumpectomy. She went through months of chemotherapy.  She said: I lost my hair, but I got through it all and I am here and I am alive and I am safe and I am going to be a mother for these kids for a long time to come.  So when we talk about cancer screening in health insurance, I don't think that is deluxe care. I don't think that is luxury care. I don't think that is going overboard. Whether it is prostate screening, colorectal screening, ormammograms, that is basic preventive medicine that saves lives and spares suffering and cuts the cost of health care.  Unfortunately, many of those benefits are casualties in the Enzi approach. As I travel around Illinois, health insurance is the No. 1 issue and has been for years for businesses large and small, labor unions, individuals, families, parents whose kids reach the age of 23 and they finally realize: They are not going to be under my policy. How are they going to be covered?  Between 1993 and 2003, annual premiums Americans paid for health insurance in that 10-year period increased by 79 percent. Employer contributions to their employee insurance increased by 90 percent. These premium increases make it tough for businesses to survive and offer health care protection.  Let be me give an example of one family I know, Jim and Carole Britton. They own the Express Personnel Services in my home town of Springfield, IL. They are good folks, good hard-working businesspeople. They have 24 employees. They pay 85 percent of their employees' premiums. They want to keep doing it. They really believe it is the right thing to do.  Like many small business owners they shop for a small business policy every year because premium costs keep going through the roof. They have been forced to raise the deductible to keep premiums manageable. Last year, the deductible doubled from $500 to $1,000. To save money, Jim and Carole offered a health savings account, which many on the other side of the aisle think is the salvation, a health savings account. I won't go into it in detail, but it is a perfect health insurance plan if you are wealthy and never expect to get sick. They offered it. One of their employees decided they would sign up for a health savings account. That employee now regrets the choice because his wife is pregnant and he wishes he had better, real health insurance coverage.  To those who say solving the health insurance problem is too complicated or too expensive, look beyond the obvious. We already have the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. It has worked for 40 years for every Member of Congress and 8 million Federal workers. Small business owners and their employees deserve nothing less.  I, along with my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Blanche Lincoln, have introduced legislation to give small businesses affordable choices among private health insurance plans and expanded access to coverage. We call it the Small Employers Health Benefits Plan. We presented it to Senator Enzi. It has been a while now, a few months ago, that we said to him: Take a look at it. You know what this plan is all about. You live with it. We all live with it. We love it. It is a wonderful plan that has competition and real choice from private insurance.  We didn't convince him. I am sorry we didn't. Maybe someday we will. We will keep working on it. But let me tell you why we think it is important, why there are many advantages to the Federal employees program model. This chart spells them out.  Nationwide availability. It covers Federal employees from one coast to the other. Young and old, rich and poor, black, white, and brown, healthy and sick, every Federal employee is covered by it.  Consumer choice. There are more than 278 private insurance companies that bid for this Federal employee coverage. For these private insurance companies, they believe this is a good deal, to get in a pool of people this large.  Group purchasing discounts for small employers: In our bill, we create one nationwide purchasing pool of small employers and self-employed people, which means they can fight for premium discounts just like the Federal Government.  Low administrative costs: Do you know what it costs the Government to run the health insurance program for 8 million Federal employees? Less than 1 percent a year. Some of these plans we are talking about that private businesses have to turn to charge 25 to 30 percent administrative costs each year. You wonder why the costs go up? They are making more money, charging for administration. We don't have the administrative overhead. We use private insurance plans already there.  There is strict oversight and regulation in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. We know it works. We like it so much that every single one of us is protected by it.  Two economists have examined our proposal, Dr. Len Nichols of the nonpartisan New America Foundation, and Dr. John Gruber, Ph.D, from MIT. They estimate that our bill could save small businesses between 27 percent and 37 percent on health care premium costs every year, just offering to these small businesses the same health insurance deal that Members of Congress and Federal employees currently receive.  That means Jim and Carole, whom I mentioned earlier, currently offering a policy for a family of four that costs $10,000 a year and paying $8,500 of the premium, could save anywhere from $3,000 to $3,100 as employers and $400 to $500 for each employee. That is before any tax credit, which we propose in our bill, for low-wage workers.  Under our plan, premiums would not be government subsidized, but employers will receive an annual tax credit for contributions made on behalf of workers making $25,000 or less per year.  There is a big debate in this town about tax cuts. If you read the morning paper, you may have noticed the chart on the front page of the Washington Post. The new tax cut proposal from the Bush administration, when it comes to capital gains and dividend incomes, is a very generous proposal to a very small group of Americans. Let me tell you what I mean.  If you are making less than $75,000 a year, the Bush tax cut proposal, warmly embraced by the Republican majority in the House and Senate, means about $100 a year in tax breaks. There is that old $100 check they wanted to give you last week for your gas bill. Here it comes again. That is your tax cut if you are making less than $75,000.  But the same Bush Republican tax cut proposal which will come through Congress now gives to those who are making $1 million a year in income almost $42,000 in tax cuts. I don't recall receiving a single letter from a millionaire saying: Would you please give me a tax cut?  They are insistent on it. We must do this. We have to give them a break. But when Senator Lincoln and I suggest giving a tax cut to a business that offers health insurance to low-income employees: Oh, that is a terrible Federal subsidy. How could you consider doing that?  Senator Thune from South Dakota came to the floor yesterday and said it was going to cost us $78 billion over 10 years. Today he came and said it would cost $73 billion. We are gaining some ground. But the bottom line is there is no estimate in that range, anywhere near that range. My challenge to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you believe in tax cuts, why wouldn't you believe in tax cuts for small businesses that provide health insurance for their employees? Isn't that closer to the American dream than a $42,000 tax cut for somebody making $1 million a year? I think it is fairly clear. Obviously they don't.  There are more than 26 million Americans making less than $25,000 a year working in small businesses; 12 million, 40 percent of them, have no health insurance. Is it valuable for America that these people who get up and go to work every day in the small shops and small businesses across our country have health insurance.  I go around Illionis and talk to all kinds of different groups--downstate in my home area, small towns, rural areas, the big city of Chicago. Whenever I say to people: Wouldn't it be part of the American dream that every American had health insurance, it never fails to get a round of applause. That is really an aspiration and a dream which many of us share. We can't reach that dream if we insist on giving tax cuts to millionaires who aren't asking for them and don't provide a helping hand to businesses that are doing the right thing, providing health insurance to low-wage employees.  The tax credit we propose would equal 25 percent of the cost to that business for self-only policies, 30 percent for employees who are either married or single with a child, and 25 percent for family policies. So if a family of four working for Jim and Carole in Springfield make less than $25,000 ayear, there would be an additional savings of $1,874 to $2,172.  Under the Durbin-Lincoln bill, private insurance plans would compete to offer insurance to small businesses, just like they do in the Federal employees program. This chart shows the potential savings that come from the current system and what might occur under the Small Employers Health Benefit Program that Senator Lincoln and I will offer. Currently, many of these businesses, like the one I described, pay 85 percent of insurance costs, so on a $10,000 policy they are paying $8,500.  Look at how it drops for family coverage under the plan we are proposing--to $3,230 for family coverage. It shows the dramatic savings for each business and the opportunity for them to offer real health care.  A lot of people say: Are you talking about a government insurance plan? Let me show you the choices that my wife, Loretta, and I had when it came to health insurance this year as Federal employees and Members of Congress. Look at these plans: There are 13 plans that we had to choose from as Federal employees.  I will tell you what happened to one of my employees. She chose a plan 1 year, didn't like the way they treated her, and when open enrollment came the following September she dropped them and picked up another plan. What a luxury, real competition. You don't treat me right, you don't get my business next year. It is like shopping for a car and having some real choices.  Most small businesses and most Americans have no real choices, so when we come up with this plan, the Federal employees model plan, and those on the other side of the aisle dismiss it as unrealistic, unfair, deluxe, it is exactly the same health insurance coverage they are living with right now.  If it is good enough for us, why isn't it good enough for the rest of America? That is the bottom line.  All Federal employees receive a booklet every year about the choices that are available for coverage. If you want to take an expensive plan, they will take more out of your paycheck. For the basic plan they take less.  I have a lot of young people on my staff. Krista Donahue, my staffer on this issue, gets up and swims every morning. She picks her health plan. She signed up for a very cheap HMO. My wife and I, maybe not in the same physical condition, sign up for more coverage. That is our choice.  That is everyone's choice in the Senate and the House of Representatives and throughout the Federal Government.  What is wrong with giving that choice to America? Senator Enzi's plan does not give that choice to America. This bill we are proposing has been supported by many groups. It isn't just a matter of Senator Lincoln and I coming together.  Look at some of the groups that have endorsed the Lincoln-Durbin plan, or the Durbin-Lincoln plan, depending on whether you are from Arkansas or Illinois: The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatricians, the American Cancer Society, the American Medical Association, the American Osteopathic Association, the American Psychological Association, Consumers Union, Families USA, Federation of American Hospitals, International Chiropractors, March of Dimes, the National Association of Community Health Centers--the list goes on and on.  And the indication is that these men and women and groups that focus their professional lives on health care reject the Enzi approach which offers less coverage and less protection and believe, as I do, that the plan being offered to Federal employees should be offered to businesses across America.  Sadly, the Enzi plan will wipe out benefit requirements.  I will concede that what I am about to say may have changed somewhat in the managers' amendment. To his credit, as Senator Enzi has realized the weaknesses of his legislation, he has added more protection. If I am going to cite something that has been changed in the managers' amendment, I apologize and will stand corrected on the Record. But what I am about to read is based on our best knowledge of what was in the Enzi bill. Maybe it has been changed. I want to give the Senator a chance to correct me, if I misread it.  The Enzi bill will wipe out benefit requirements, including diabetes supplies, mental health coverage, cancer screening, maternity coverage, and child immunizations for 84 million Americans. That includes almost 4 million people in the State of Illinois. The number of Americans who will lose benefit protection under the Enzi plan, S. 1955, each one of these ``stick'' pictures represents 1 million Americans who will lose benefit protection. These are not people who currently have no health insurance. These are people who are gathered here and watching this and have health insurance who think they are part of this debate. Surprise. The Enzi bill has brought you into this debate. Your health insurance is about to be reduced in coverage. The things that you thought you had signed up for, the things that you had bargained for as part of your union that you believe were covered in your plan will be reduced. The coverage will be reduced by the Enzi bill.  His belief is, if we can just lower basic health insurance coverage to a lower level, we can say everybody has it. But what good is it to have health insurance if it isn't there when you need it?  That is the point he missed. If we miss the most basic things in terms of protecting Americans and then sit back and fold our arms and say: Well, we took care of that uninsured problem, sure, we took care of it until someone desperately needs health care and can't afford it because their health insurance plan doesn't cover it.  The idea behind Senator Enzi's bill is if you provide less benefits and less coverage and less protection, it should cost less. That is right. It is reasonable. But if the insurance doesn't cover your illness, if you are left exposed to paying for it out of your own packet, what are you going to do?  One of the ladies who came to our press conference yesterday is a perfect illustration. Her husband had bought a health insurance plan that he thought was a good one, one through an association. He even signed up for a chemotherapy rider on the plan because there had been a history of cancer in his family. Guess what happened. Sadly, he developed virulent lung cancer which required a lot of treatment. They went to their health insurance plan, and they said: We are glad we bought that rider.  Then, in the fine print, there was a limitation on how much they would pay. The poor man lived for years and died an agonizing death. His beautiful young wife from California was there yesterday. When he died, she was left with medical bills of $480,000.  Is that deluxe coverage--what we heard earlier--luxury coverage of health insurance? Would you want to find yourself and your family in a situation where you needed cancer therapy to survive and your plan didn't cover it?  Unfortunately, the Enzi bill moves in that direction, and it doesn't have it. All of the benefit cuts result in about 3 percent to 4 percent savings on premium costs. These are not expensive when they are spread across large populations. They are expensive when they are borne by one family. But if there are millions of people being covered, and a small percentage need it, you spread out the cost. That is what insurance is all about. It is a point that is missed in the Enzi legislation. That is not much of a savings--3 or 4 percent--when you are talking about diabetes, maternity coverage.  Maternity coverage. I know a little bit about that, being the father of three. I can tell you that one of the toughest moments in my life was as a law student--I got married in law school. Yes. We used to do that back in the old days. Loretta was pregnant. The baby came along and she had a serious health problem. We had no health insurance. We went to Children's Hospital in Washington. God bless them. They couldn't have treated us better. They finally said after a while: You are not going to be able to afford to pay this, Durbin. You either sign up for welfare, which you can do because you don't have any income, but get ready to go bankrupt. You won't be able to pay these bills. There is one choice. There is another choice you can consider. You can go to a clinic for people who are uninsured.  Sure enough. I had to leave my law school and cut a class, drive out toMaryland, pick up my wife and our little baby girl and sit in a clinic for hours to get a doctor in rotation--never knowing who you would see and sure you would never see them again. They would ask you all the same questions. Let's go through the history again. You tell them over and over--you want to give them everything.  That is what life is like when you don't have health insurance.  When it comes to maternity care, you have to be careful. I will tell you why.  Twenty-five years ago when I was an attorney working in the Illinois State Senate, it came to our attention that there was a company selling health insurance in Illinois with maternity benefits, but when you read closely, the maternity benefits did not cover the newborn infant for the first 30 days of life. Do you know what that means? In our case, in my family's situation, a situation just like it, that sick baby dramatically in need of expensive care for the first 30 days wasn't covered. We put a provision in the Illinois State law which said you cannot offer maternity benefits saying you will pay for the delivery of a baby unless you cover that baby from the moment it is born. That is a requirement in law.  It makes sense, doesn't it? It would be wiped out as one of the State requirements under Senator Enzi's approach. You can buy maternity care. You may be on your own the first 30 days. Heaven forbid you are in a situation with a sick child--and I have been there. It is no fun at all. It took us years to pay those medical bills. We were glad to pay them, and they couldn't have been nicer waiting to be paid, but there were a lot of anxious moments when this father sat in that waiting room wondering if he would ever get to see a doctor for his little girl.  There was a study in the New England Journal of Medicine in the years after President Clinton required that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program cover mental health benefits. I can't go to a town meeting in my State and mention mental health clinic benefits where I don't have the following occur. I can guarantee you that in any large group this will happen: I will say that health insurance ought to cover mental health benefits--and I think it should. Senator Paul Wellstone, that great champion, used to sit in that back row and stand and beg for health care to cover mental health benefits.  If you mention that at a town meeting in my State or any other State, do you know what happens when the meeting ends? Two or three people are going to wait for you. They will want to talk to you privately. It has happened time and again. They say: Senator, we have a teenage son with a serious mental health problem. We don't know where to turn. We can't get health insurance. There is no coverage for him.  Every time you mention mental health, you find that across America there are people in need of mental health benefits.  When it came to mental health benefits, it was one of the first casualties in the Enzi bill. About 42 States currently offer mental health benefits as part of their health insurance. And that State requirement would be wiped away in the Enzi bill.  Is that deluxe coverage? If you have a bipolar teenage son, a schizophrenic daughter, someone suffering from grave depression in your own household, is that deluxe and luxury coverage? I think it is basic. I think it is what we should be about in America: taking away the stigma of mental disease and offer mental health coverage.  We received letters from organizations such as the American Nurses Association--God bless them--the American Cancer Society, AARP, and the American Diabetes Association. They are all opposed to the Enzi watered-down approach.  In a letter to Congress, 41 attorneys general, including my own attorney general, Lisa Madigan, in Illinois, have publicly opposed this bill.  Another way the Bush-Enzi bill would make people worse off is that it sets Federal rules of how insurers can charge people. I will try to explain what I understand Senator Enzi just did.  Right now in America you can charge health insurance premiums based on a number of factors: Are you well? Are you sick? Are you young? Are you old? Where did you live? What is your injury?  You can be charged different health premiums depending on how you answer those questions. The disparity in health insurance premiums between well people and sick people can be 26 times as expensive for sick people as it is for well people.  There are nine States--most of them in New England, except for North Dakota and Oregon--that have community ratings, which means that everybody in the State of Massachusetts represented by my friend, Senator Kerry, is in the same pool, everybody just like the Federal employees pool. So everyone is charged the same premium, young and old, regardless of their medical history. Senator Enzi comes and says: We just want to change this slightly. We want to be able to say that you can charge five times as much for someone who is sick than someone who is well, even in States with community ratings--five times as much.  They tried that in New Hampshire a few years ago, increasing the premiums for sick people. They dropped their coverage, and 21,000 people were dropped. In a year New Hampshire dropped the plan, saying it is not a good idea. It wasn't a good idea in New Hampshire, and it is not a good idea in the Enzi bill.  That is what is being proposed. Let me show you a study. The Lewin Group, a nonpartisan actuarial firm, shows rates would rise dramatically for businesses with a higher number of older Americans or women of childbearing years.  This shows the average premiums for community-rated States, the average cost per contract. You can see this yellow line. What is happening because Senator Enzi is allowing this divergence and differing amounts of premiums to be charged, you can see a dramatic range of increase that could occur in any given State.  So there is no protection on the upside below 5 to 1. There could be a 5-to-1 difference in premiums charged the lowest rated person in the State to the highest rated person. It is a significant difference.  The Lewin study found that small businesses in strictly regulated States are currently paying the average of $7,738 per month for health insurance for their employees. Under the Enzi bill, businesses with a high number of older people or women of childbearing years would see their premiums increase to more than $20,000 a month, while companies that have a disproportionately high number of healthy, young people would see a decrease in their premiums to $3,096 a month.  Finally, the Bush-Enzi bill will not help the self-employed. Self-employed people are the worst off. They are forced to purchase insurance in the individual market which has the least amount of State oversight. The Enzi bill will take away what little protection self-employed people already have in benefit mandates, which means if you are on your own--you own your little business and looking for health insurance, and you at least know when you are offered a policy it has to provide the basic coverage that your State requires--Senator Enzi wipes that away. It will not give self-employed people a way to pool with larger businesses.  The Enzi bill prohibits self-employed people from being pooled with larger businesses, so they miss out on the discounts of the larger groups. Right now, we believe the realtors who are pushing the Enzi bill ought to step back and take a close look at that provision and ask themselves what percentage of the membership of realtors across America is self-employed. The coverage and protection is not there for you. This may sound good for their members until they take a look at the policy and there is no protection.  Individuals would be pooled with other individuals, so they may save on marketing costs, but they will be priced the same way they are today: individually. Under the Enzi bill, self-employed people can still be denied coverage if their State law permits it, and they can be charged exorbitant rates based on their health status, gender, age, or industry.  Diane Ladley of Aurora, IL, is self-employed and has a chronic condition called fibromyalgia, which causeschronic pain and fatigue. She has been denied insurance in the individual market. She is currently cutting her pills in half because she cannot afford them.  The Bush-Enzi bill will do nothing to help Diane. Even if she joins an association health plan, an insurer could deny her coverage. If she is offered coverage, insurers will still be able to exclude her current condition or charge an amount so high she could not afford it.  The Lincoln-Durbin bill would allow Diane to be pooled with other small businesses in one national pool. She would have access to the same negotiated discounts as all other small businesses in the pool.  We can make health insurance for small businesses more affordable without slashing benefits or charging people who need insurance even higher prices. My bill, with Senator Lincoln, is an example of how it can be done. It is a reasonable approach.  I will come back to my starting point as I close my remarks because I know there are other Senators in the Senate waiting to speak. This is a matter of simple justice. If Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives take advantage of the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program because they believe it is fair and right for their families, why won't they offer that same opportunity to other Americans who need health insurance? Why should we give ourselves the status of a privileged class when it comes to health insurance? Why should we say that people across America shouldn't have the same protection our wives and our families have? We ought to offer them in good faith an approach that is the same as our own. If this health insurance we use is good enough for Members of Congress, it is good enough for American families.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Wyoming.
