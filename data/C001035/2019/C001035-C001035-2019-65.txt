President, I am delighted to commend Fruit Street Elementary School in Bangor, ME, on being named a 2019 National Blue Ribbon Exemplary High Performing School. Serving 325 students from pre-K through third grade, this outstanding school is one of only 362 schools across the country this year to receive Blue Ribbon recognition from the U.S. Department of Education.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  The Blue Ribbon designation continues a tradition of quality education in Bangor. The graduation rates and assessment test scores for the town's K-12 school district consistently are among the highest in the State of Maine.  Fruit Street Elementary School's mission statement, ``A high quality education is attainable by all of our students who will receive the encouragement and opportunities to develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that prepare them for citizenship in a global society,'' is carried out daily. Students focus on the core values of fairness, citizenship, respect, and caring. The core curriculum has a strong focus on math, literacy, science, and social studies, with special programs that recognize each student's individual learning style.  At Fruit Street, rich and diverse learning opportunities are a part of every child's experience, from art and music, to library skills and physical education. The school involves all students in extracurricular activities, which helps forge a strong school community where students are connected and encouraged to pursue their interests. Throughout the curriculum, students are also taught to use technology both effectively and responsibly.  Faculty, parents, and community members are committed to both academic excellence and each child's social, emotional, and physical health. Faculty work to ensure an effective learning environment and to develop strong and collaborative relationships with parents and community members. An active parent-teacher organization supports enriching educational activities and promotes excellence and innovation by funding special projects and initiatives.  I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Fruit Street Elementary School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to build students' confidence and generate momentum for learning. I congratulate the entire school community for this outstanding achievement.                          ____________________
