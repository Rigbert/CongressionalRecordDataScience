 Mr. President, I just want to make a couple points.  First of all, an increase in the Federal match under Medicaid was part of the Centrist Coalition's economic recovery package we considered. It was part of virtually every version. It had widespread support. It was supported by the administration. It did not make it into the final package. But this is not a new idea. This is an idea with widespread bipartisan support.  The second point I want to make is in response to an argument made by my friend and colleague from Oklahoma. My friend from Oklahoma said Medicaid spending does not get cut in economically good times. In fact, it is countercyclical. In good times, far fewer people qualify for Medicaid. In fact, Federal and State spending on Medicaid declined dramatically during the 1990s, when the economic times were good.  So there is a countercyclical aspect of Medicaid. It does go down when times are good and the program is less needed.  Now times are not good. There are more people in need of assistance from the Medicaid Program. We know 40 million Americans rely on this program.  What we are trying to do is preserve this essential, vital health care program that provides services and care to the most vulnerable and needy in our society. That is the motivation behind our proposal. It is not to bail out the States, it is to help the States, our partners, provide essential services.
