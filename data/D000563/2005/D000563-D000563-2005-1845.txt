It is hard to believe the Senate budget resolution for the budget of the United States of America has been summarized for our consideration on the floor into 65 pages: 65 pages for a budget in excess of $2 trillion. This, of course, is a budget resolution which just describes things in the most general terms. You have to really dig into this and you have to understand some of the subtleties of this resolution to understand its importance. This really will chart the path for spending by our Federal Government for the next fiscal year, beginning in October. It is a critically important document because this budget defines our priorities and tells us what we can expect in terms of our Nation's spending.  Like the President's budget, this budget from the Republican-controlled Senate Budget Committee will make deficits and the debt worse and not better. Like the President's budget, this budget is dealing in fantasy not in fact. It does not include a penny, not 1 cent to implement President Bush's privatization of Social Security. I do not believe that is a concession by the Republicans that this unpopular idea is dead. But it is an admission by the Republicans, who put this together, that they cannot pay for the President's privatization plan on Social Security.
