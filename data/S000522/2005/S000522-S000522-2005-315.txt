Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 195) recognizing the 60th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day and the Liberation of Western Bohemia.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 195       Whereas the final major offensive in the European theater      of operations during World War II, known as the Liberation of      Western Bohemia, was fought from April 25, 1945, to May 8,      1945, with Victory in Europe (VE) Day declared on May 8,      1945;       Whereas the Liberation of Western Bohemia was the closing      offensive of World War II, which decisively contributed to      the ultimate capitulation of the German Third Reich;       Whereas on May 4, 1945, General George S. Patton gave the      order for the American Third Army, consisting of 18 divisions      and 500,000 men, to resume the Allied offensive into Western      Bohemia;       Whereas on May 5, 1945, the Third Army liberated the city      of Plzen (Pilsen), the western-most city in then-     Czechoslovakia;       Whereas on May 6, 1945, as Americans entered Pilsen,      flowers were strewn along the paths and into the vehicles of      the troops, while young girls and old men and women ran to      kiss the soldiers;       Whereas during the communist era, Czechs celebrated their      liberation from Nazi Germany on May 9 of each year in      commemoration of the Soviet liberation of Prague; however,      after the 1989 ``Velvet Revolution'', the date of      commemoration was moved to May 8 of each year;       Whereas thousands of American veterans of the Liberation of      Western Bohemia have traveled to Pilsen in the years since      the liberation to honor their fallen comrades;       Whereas the people of the Czech Republic, symbolizing their      friendship and gratitude toward the American soldiers who      fought to secure their freedom, have graciously hosted      countless veterans groups over the years;       Whereas between April 25 and May 9, 2005, some 50      communities across the western part of the Czech Republic      will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of their liberation      by United States, Czech, and Belgian soldiers under the      command of General Patton;       Whereas the citizens of Pilsen will dedicate a statue of      General Patton which will be unveiled on the town square on      the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Pilsen,      commemorating the Liberation of Western Bohemia by United      States Armed Forces during World War II; and       Whereas the friendship between the United States and the      Czech Republic is strong today in part because of the      Liberation of Western Bohemia: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved,  That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the Liberation of      Western Bohemia in the European theater of operations during      World War II which culminated in an Allied victory that      assured the defeat of Nazi Germany and ended the War in      Europe two weeks later;       (2) honors those individuals who gave their lives during      the Liberation of Western Bohemia;       (3) encourages the President to issue a proclamation      calling upon the people of the United States to honor the      veterans of the Liberation of Western Bohemia with      appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities;       (4) reaffirms the bonds of friendship between the United      States and the brave citizens of the Czech Republic; and       (5) seeks to continue building a great future between our      countries.
