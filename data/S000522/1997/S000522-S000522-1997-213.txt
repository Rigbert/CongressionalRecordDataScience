Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a good friend and great public servant--Monmouth County Clerk Jane Clayton--who just recently retired from her position after 16 years of dedicated service.  Monmouth County, NJ, has had the great benefit of having Mrs. Jane Clayton as our county clerk from 1980 to just a few weeks ago. Jane took that office and transformed it into the fiscally conservative success that it is today--all the while ensuring that our rich history and record of efficient services remains intact for our children, grandchildren, and their children to enjoy.  Before serving Monmouth County as clerk, Jane was a county freeholder in the late 1970's. She has held a variety of offices before county clerk--including serving on the boards of the County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, the County Detention Center, the County Planning Board, and the Monmouth Museum Board of Trustees.  Over the years, Jane and I have worked on countless projects together. Particularly momentous to both Jane and me was the unique effort between the county and Federal levels of government to acquire an absolutely beautiful mural of the Battle of Monmouth for the headquarters of the Monmouth County Library. This project was especially important, as the Federal Government rarely works with an individual county to provide them with such things as the artwork that we now have in Monmouth County.  Jane has also been successful in getting modern technology to improve the records system for the county archives. As Monmouth County was host to Revolutionary War Battles--such as the Battle of Monmouth--we have a wealth of history that needs to continue to be available for all who wish to learn more about our great area.  Jane has been given countless awards for her numerous years of service--including honors from the March of Dimes, the Monmouth County Fireman's Association, and the Monmouth Council of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Jane has a record of excellence that many in central New Jersey are thankful for.  Monmouth County is a great area with many different communities and neighborhoods. From our part of the Jersey Shore, to towns like Millstone and Allentown, Jane pleased nearly everyone in her service as county clerk.  I'm already missing Jane Clayton, as she retired on December 31, 1996 after many years of hard work. I respect Jane for not only her topnotch performance as county clerk--but also her knowledge and involvement in Monmouth County.  We have a lot to be thankful for in Monmouth County: Great little towns, good roads, great services, excellent land management, good businesses, and a county clerk second-to-none.  Thanks again, Jane, for everything you've contributed to Monmouth County. I look forward to seeing you back home--because I know that you'll still be a staple of the Fourth District. From all of us in the Fourth District and Monmouth County--Jane--best wishes and know that your hard work is and will always be deeply appreciated.                          ____________________
