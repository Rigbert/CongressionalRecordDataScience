Speaker, the gentleman mirrors my words. When people would ask me when we are going to conclude, I would say we are going to conclude when we finish our work. Now, finishing, I guess, one's work is a subjective judgment; but certainly these two pieces of legislation need to get done, and hopefully we can get those done.  If we don't have a further week, this will be the last colloquy. I want to say to my friend that we have been able to work on a lot in the 114th Congress. We have had real substantive differences. We will continue to have those differences. But I look forward to working closely with the majority leader when, in fact, we agree, and when we disagree, to try to work constructively on trying to get to an agreement.  This election has caused us, I think, some real challenges. The election itself was a challenge, and I know we will have a lot more to say on that afterwards.  I want to thank the gentleman from California for the ability to work together and constructively on behalf of the American people where we have been able to do that.  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment and congratulate the gentleman from Maryland on his reelection to whip.  Hopefully, this is our last colloquy for the year, but you know as much as I know.
