Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate we cannot do that.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this joint resolution making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2003.  In consultation with my good friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, and in consultation with the leadership, I am pleased that this resolution ensures that the Federal highway program will continue at the fiscal year 2002 rate of $31.8 billion. This reverses the Office of Management and Budget's surprising decision last week to reduce the highway program to a $27.7 billion rate of operations. This decision was contrary to the Congress's intent that programs be continued at the current rate until final appropriation bills can be agreed to and enacted.  The language in this joint resolution is in no way binding with regard to the final fiscal year 2003 transportation appropriations bill that will eventually be enacted. This year's final highway funding level will be appropriately determined at a later date in the context of House and Senate negotiations on that bill.                              {time}  1900  In the meantime, this resolution ensures that funding for the highway program will continue at the fiscal year 2002-enacted rate of $31.8 billion. This will protect the good-wage jobs and make our infrastructure whole.  Again, I want to stress this has been done with the work of the minority on my committee and myself and the leadership of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, and the Speaker of the House.  We will continue what we said we were going to do. When there is a budget, when there is an appropriation bill, when there are negotiations done, that can be a different date and a different amount. Now we are on the right track to make sure that our highways are continuing to be built and rebuilt, and that our bridges are built and repaired, also.
