Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and my colleague for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, it is a shame and a disgrace. Furthermore, it is really, really sad that the government of the most powerful country in the world is closed. It is closed. It is unbelievable. It is unreal. It is downright embarrassing.  I wonder--I wonder what the rest of the world thinks of us. We go all around the world preaching democracy--one person, one vote--and we will not even give the Members, all of the Members of the House of Representatives, an opportunity to vote on a clean effort, a continuing resolution, to end the shutdown.  Give the Members--please, give the Members, all of the Members, Democrats and Republicans--an opportunity to cast a vote, a free and open vote. That's what our Founding Fathers struggled for. People died for the right to participate. And in the House of Representatives, in this House, the people's House, we will not be provided an opportunity for all of the people to vote.  We must end the shutdown and put our people back to work and keep our economy growing and moving. We don't want to go back, my friends, or stand still. We want to go forward. Let's come together, all of us, Democrats and Republicans, come together and end this shutdown for good. We can do it. We made hard and tough decisions before and we can do it again, and we must do it because it's the right thing to do.
