President, I am pleased to join today with my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, to introduce the Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act of 2009.  This bill addresses a serious problem that is modern day slavery, pure and simple--human sex trafficking. You could almost call it a war, where all too often, children are the casualties.  The statistics on minors involved in sex trafficking are shocking. Experts estimate that over 100,000 children in the U.S. are at risk for prostitution. The average age of entry into prostitution is 12. The children at greatest risk of becoming involved in sex trafficking are what they call ``repeat runaways''--kids who have run away over and over again. They need help right away if they are going to avoid being caught by pimps. One third of run-away children are lured into prostitution within 48 hours of leaving home and 75 percent of minors caught in this web of prostitution have a pimp.  This problem is on the rise because criminal gang members are increasingly turning to pimping. Gang members have discovered that they are less likely to get prosecuted for trafficking a person than trafficking drugs. While drugs can only be sold once, a pimp can sell a person over and over. It is just as lucrative. A pimp can make $200,000 a year on one trafficking victim.  This situation is horrifying and totally unacceptable. The bill I am introducing today will bring a smart strategy that will give some teeth to the efforts law enforcement across the country have made to combat sex trafficking. It will give them additional resources they need to lock up pimps and sex traffickers. It will also help victims break away from their abusers and get the treatment and services they need to take their lives back.  Let us be absolutely clear about this--the pimps who prey upon vulnerable young people are criminals, and they should be put behind bars. The young women, girls, and sometimes boys who are trafficked are not criminals--they are victims of crime. They don't need to be prosecuted. They need all the help they can get to escape the clutches of pimps.  Unfortunately, until now, the government has been a step behind. Right now, it is very difficult for law enforcement officers and prosecutors to build criminal cases and crack down on pimps. The Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act would change that.  Here is how it would work: The bill would establish a pilot project of 6 block grants in locations in different regions of the country with significant sex trafficking activity. The block grants would be awarded by the Department of Justice to State or local government applicants that have developed a workable, comprehensive plan to combat sex trafficking. The grants would require a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach to addressing trafficking problems. Applicants for the grants would have to demonstrate they can work together with local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and social service providers to achieve the goals the bill would set out for them.  Government agencies that get the grants would be required to create shelters where trafficking victims would be safe from their pimps, and where they could start getting treatment for the trauma they have suffered. The shelters would provide counseling, legal services, and mental and physical health services, including treatment for substance abuse, sexual abuse, and trauma-informed care. The shelters would also provide food, clothing, and other necessities, as well as education and training to help victims get their lives on track.  It is going to take this kind of comprehensive plan to finally turn the tables on pimps who, right now, just wait for their victims to be released from jail so they can put them back out on the streets to make money for them. Once those girls are out, they don't come back to testify against their pimps--they're just gone.  This bill fixes that problem by giving the young victims a safe haven. It is only by addressing the needs of these victims that law enforcement officers will be able to work with them to build criminal cases against their pimps. The block grants will also provide for specialized training for law enforcement officers and prosecutors to help them learn how to handle trafficking victims and build trafficking cases.  This bill would also strengthen reporting requirements for runaway or missing children, and authorize funding to the FBI to enhance the National Crime Information Center, NCIC, database, which is where missing child reports are filed. This would give law enforcement officers better information on the children at greatest risk of being lured in to sex trafficking by being able to show a tally of how many times a child has run away, and can flag them as ``repeat runaways'' who are at high risk of being lured into prostitution.  Sex trafficking is a complex issue that requires the comprehensive, wrap-around approach that this bill would deliver. As daunting as this problem is, there are bright examples of how to address the challenge, such as the achievements of Sergeant Byron Fassett of the Dallas Police Department. Just listening to Sergeant Fassett, who spoke at a recent congressional briefing that I hosted, is an education in how to do this right. The lessons he has learned in over 20 years of combating sex trafficking are a primer for how to get victims out of the clutches of pimps and build cases to put pimps away. Sergeant Fassett is not the only officer out there who's attacking this challenge the right way. In my home town of Portland, the officers on the human trafficking task force are doing excellent work. But right now, they simply don't have the resources to crack this problem. The Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act would deliver the training and resources they need.  I want to also thank the many individuals and organizations who attended the briefing and participated in efforts to craft this legislation. I particularly want to acknowledge the Polaris Project and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, for their instrumental roles in this effort.  I look forward to working with Senator Cornyn and other colleagues to move this important legislation forward. There are children out on the streets tonight who shouldn't have to wait for the help this bill can give. Let us end this appalling war on those kids. Let us give them the help they need by passing this piece of legislation with all the speed possible.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2925       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Trafficking Deterrence and      Victims Support Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Human trafficking is modern day slavery. It is the      fastest-growing, and second largest, criminal enterprise in      the world. Human trafficking generates an estimated profit of      $32,000,000,000 per year, world wide.       (2) In the United States, human trafficking is an      increasing problem. This criminal enterprise includes      citizens of the United States, many of them children, who are      forced into prostitution, and foreigners brought into the      country, often under false pretenses, who are coerced into      forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation.       (3) Sex trafficking is one of the most lucrative areas of      human trafficking. Criminal gang members in the United States      are increasingly involved in recruiting young     women and girls into sex trafficking. Interviews with gang      members indicate that the gang members regard working as an      individual who solicits customers for a prostitute (commonly      known as a ``pimp'') to being as lucrative as trafficking in      drugs, but with a much lower chance of being criminally      convicted.       (4) Minors in the United States are highly vulnerable for      sexual exploitation and sex trafficking. As many as 2,800,000      children live on the streets. Of the estimated 1,600,000      children who run away each year, 77 percent return home      within 1 week. However, 33 percent of children who run away      are lured into prostitution within 48 hours of leaving home.       (5) National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted,      Runaway and Throwaway Children, the definitive study of      episodes of missing children, found that of the children who      are victims of non-family abduction, runaway or throwaway      children, the police are alerted by family or guardians in      only 21 percent of the cases. In 79 percent of cases there is      no report and no police involvement, and therefore no      official attempt to find the child.       (6) In 2007, the Administration of Children and Families,      Department of Health and Human Services, reported to the      Federal Government 265,000 cases of serious physical, sexual,      or psychological abuse of children.       (7) Experts estimate that over 100,000 children in the      United States are at risk for prostitution.       (8) Children who have run away from home are at a high risk      of becoming involved in sex trafficking. Children who have      run away multiple times are at much higher risk of not      returning home and of engaging in prostitution.       (9) The vast majority of children involved in sex      trafficking have suffered previous sexual or physical abuse,      live in poverty, or have no stable home or family life. These      children require a comprehensive framework of specialized      treatment and mental health counseling that addresses post-     traumatic stress, depression, and sexual exploitation.       (10) The average age of entry into prostitution is 12.      Seventy-five percent of minors engaged in prostitution have a      pimp. A pimp can earn $200,000 per year prostituting 1      trafficking victim.       (11) Sex trafficking is a complex and varied criminal      problem that requires a multi-disciplinary, cooperative      solution. Reducing trafficking will require the government to      address victims, pimps, and johns; and to provide training      specific to sex trafficking for law enforcement officers and      prosecutors, and child welfare, public health, and other      social service providers. A good model for this type of      approach is the Internet Crimes Against Children task force      program.       (12) Human trafficking is a criminal enterprise that      imposes significant costs on the economy of the United      States. Government and non-profit resources used to address      trafficking include those of law enforcement, the judicial      and penal systems, and social service providers. Without a      range of appropriate treatments to help trafficking victims      overcome the trauma they have experienced, victims will      continue to be involved in crime, unable to support      themselves, and continue to require government resources      rather than being productive contributors to the legitimate      economy.       (13) Many domestic minor sex trafficking victims are      younger than 18 years old and are below the age of consent.      Because trafficking victims have been forced to engage in      prostitution rather than willfully to committing a crime,      these victims should not be charged as criminal defendants.      Instead, these victims of trafficking should have access to      treatment and services to help them escape and overcome being      sexually exploited, and should also be allowed to seek      appropriate remuneration from crime victims' compensation      funds.       (14) The State of New York has adopted a safe harbor law      that establishes a presumption a minor charged with a      prostitution offense is a severely trafficked person. This      law allows the child to avoid criminal charges of      prostitution and instead be considered a ``person in need of      supervision.'' The statute also provides support and services      to sexually exploited youth who are under the age of 18 years      old. These services include safe houses, crisis intervention      programs, community-based programs, and law-enforcement      training to help officers identify sexually exploited youth.       (15) Sex trafficking is not a problem that occurs only in      urban settings. This crime exists also in rural areas and on      Indian reservations. Efforts to address sex trafficking      should include partnerships with organizations that seek to      address the needs of such under-served communities.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.       It is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) the Attorney General should implement changes to the      National Crime Information Center database in order to ensure      that--       (A) a child entered into the database will be automatically      designated as an endangered juvenile if the child has been      reported missing not less than 3 times in a 1 year period;       (B) the database be programmed to cross-reference newly      entered reports with historical records already in the      database; and       (C) the database be programmed to include a visual cue on      the record of a child designated as an endangered juvenile in      order to assist law enforcement officers in recognizing the      child and providing the child with appropriate care and      services; and       (2) funds awarded under subpart 1 of part E of title I of      the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42      U.S.C. 3750 et seq.) (commonly known as Byrne Grants) should      be used to provide programs relating to sex trafficking      education, training, deterrence, and prevention.     SEC. 4.
