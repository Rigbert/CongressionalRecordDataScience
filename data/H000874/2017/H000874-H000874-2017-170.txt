Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for those remarks.  I want to join him in thanking our colleague, Brian Cooper. I am not sure, Brian, that I adopt the sentiments of the majority leader with respect to what Mr. Thomas could and could not do. Apparently he chose not to, and that is good.  But, Brian Cooper, we want to thank you for three and a half decades of service to this House; three and a half decades of service to this House in a role that most people, including Members of this House, would not recognize, but that is critically important to the good management and flow of the people's business through this House.  As the majority leader referenced, he will continue to root for the Baltimore Orioles because he is from Baltimore. He is a Marylander, and we are very proud of him. I want to thank him for his service and wish him the very best in the days ahead.  I now will go to the schedule.                              {time}  1200  By law, under the Budget Control Act, a budget is supposed to be brought to this floor on April 15. The majority leader would quickly observe that neither Democrats nor Republicans have always met that deadline. However, we are unusually late in the budget process, in my view, and despite months of promising to return to regular order, we have not yet done so as it relates to the budget, and the budget has not been marked up in committee, Mr. Speaker.  Monday marked the statutory date by which the Appropriations Committee no longer has to wait to bring bills to the floor of the House because the majority has failed to meet its obligation to pass a budget on time.  Now, again, I want to quickly note that both parties have failed to meet that deadline in times past, but I cannot remember us being as late in the session in getting to the appropriations process, because there really has been no direction from the administration as to what their budget priorities should be, would be, other than the so-called ``skinny budget'' that was sent down, which, in my view, almost every Member of Congress thought was a totally unrealistic, unadoptable, and unworthy budget priority document; and if it were to be adopted, the security of the United States, both abroad and at home, would be put at substantial risk.  So, Mr. Majority Leader, can you provide some indication? I know it is not on the floor next week.  And I want to say that I join with the majority leader. The issue of human trafficking is one of the critical issues that confronts us, as a country, and the global community. It puts millions of young women and young men at risk--and not so young men and women at risk--on a daily basis. It is appropriate that we deal with this issue. Hopefully, we will deal with it, as the majority leader said, in a bipartisan fashion and that we will produce more effective ways to stop and to hold accountable those who put human beings at risk by human slavery.  But can the gentleman tell me when the Budget Committee will mark up a budget and when we will have such a budget considered on the floor?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  As my friend knows, we do expect to receive the formal budget request from the President next week, which, as my friend also knows, is common for the first year of a new administration.  Now, as the gentleman said, maybe this is later, but this is the latest in the history of America that any President has had to wait for a Cabinet, which is always helpful. He still has many more positions to be filled and confirmed, and as that progresses, I think actions will be able to move forward even faster.  But, as is tradition, the Budget Committee has announced its intention to host OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, as the gentleman knows, a former colleague here, to answer questions Members may have about the President's budget request following its release. This will kick off the regular order process of the committee work on crafting an FY 2018 budget resolution.  Likewise, with appropriations, the committee is looking forward to marking up bills through regular order. Now, as soon as action is scheduled for the floor, the gentleman will know that I will notify all Members.
