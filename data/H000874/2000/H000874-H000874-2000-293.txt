Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I think everybody agrees, and the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek) has said, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton) has said, and I certainly agree with what both of them have said, and I have discussed with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), as the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews) said, not only can we fix this, but I would hope we would all pledge, as I will, to fix this.  What the concern is, correct, nobody had any intention to divert from low-economic or medium-income areas assistance. Clearly, it was my intent, I think the intent of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), the intent of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), I know that the assistance here would go, CDBG funds are for, as the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) correctly pointed out, for low- and moderate-income areas.  We need in conference to make sure that that is made very explicit; not implied, explicit. The gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek) is correct. I hope the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) will agree with that. In conference, we will make sure that language explicitly limits such expenditures to areas currently eligible for CDBG.
