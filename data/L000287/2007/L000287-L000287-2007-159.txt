Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Kidney Care Quality and Education Act that I am proud to introduce today with my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Camp. This comprehensive legislation will help educate Americans about how to prevent and delay the onset of kidney disease and ensure high quality care for patients with irreversible kidney failure.  More than 400,000 Americans have kidney failure, which is also known as End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). The only treatment available to these patients is a kidney transplant or renal dialysis. Because there are so few kidneys available for transplantation, most dialysis patients must undergo 3-hour treatment sessions three to four times per week.  Diabetes and hypertension are two of the leading causes of kidney disease. We continue to see the numbers of Americans with these conditions rise, and as a result, we will continue to see more Americans suffering from chronic kidney disease. Statistics show that African Americans are particularly at risk for kidney disease and kidney failure. They make up more than one third of all patients on dialysis in this country. Most alarming, the growth rate of kidney failure among African Americans age 30 to 39 has risen 26 percent since 2000 and it shows no signs of stopping. African Americans have a higher risk of developing the conditions that lead to kidney failure. For example, the American Heart Association reports that more than 40 percent of African Americans have hypertension. African Americans with diabetes experience kidney failure about four times more often than white Americans with diabetes. In addition, African Americans are less likely to receive treatment in the early stages of the disease or to learn about how they can slow the progress of kidney disease.  The Kidney Care Quality and Education Act will help address these issues by improving public awareness about kidney disease and improving access to quality care. The importance of educating our citizens about kidney disease cannot be understated. The Kidney Care Quality and Education Act will provide funding to establish critical educational programs to increase public awareness about kidney disease treatment and prevention. These programs will also help people already suffering from chronic kidney disease and kidney failure, by providing important self-management skills that will improve their quality of life and help them continue their normal activities, such as working. This legislation also takes steps to improve the quality of kidney care by creating a 3-year Continuous Quality Improvement Initiative within the Medicare ESRD Program.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, which also has the support of all sectors of the kidney care community. We should maintain our commitment to Americans with kidney failure by improving the quality of care for these patients and help slow the occurrence of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure.                          ____________________
