If we did nothing else but change that to say these health insurance companies could be held liable in a court of law before a jury of Americans for their decisions on health care, it would have a dramatic overnight impact on their decisions also. They would think twice about denying a doctor's recommendation for a surgical procedure or a hospitalization. They would think twice about delaying these decisions.  I have noticed, and I am sure the Senator from Nevada has noticed as well, many times, poor families I represent in Illinois will get into a struggle with an insurance company to try to get help, for example, for a child with a serious illness or disease, and the struggle goes on for months; ultimately, the family prevails; but during that period of time, the poor child is suffering and the family is suffering. I think that giving those families across America the right to sue health insurance companies and saying to the health insurance companies that, like every other business in America, you will be held accountable for any wrongdoing, is just simple justice. To do otherwise is to suggest that we are going to create some special, privileged class of companies and that, literally, the health insurance companies are above the law. That is not America.
