Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a woman of substance: Betty Morais passed from this life in May 2013, in Toledo, Ohio.  Betty was born in Minneapolis on March 5, 1923, to Esther and Lewis Himmelman. She received her undergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota and her graduate degree from Ohio State University. She worked in New York City of the Army Adjutant General's Office, then made her way to Toledo where she worked for Lasalle & Koch. It was at the downtown department store that she met her husband, Harold. They married in 1950 and together raised three children, sons Peter and Anthony, and daughter Nina. Harold and Betty enjoyed 49 happy years until his passing. Betty met further heartache when her son Anthony passed away a decade later.  Betty spent twenty years as a committed volunteer for the Toledo section of the National Council of Jewish Women, the Junior League and the League of Women Voters. She volunteered with groups assisting children in need and worked for the Economic Opportunity Planning Association of Toledo. Betty's calling, however, was to lead Planned Parenthood of Northwest Ohio.  Betty Morais became the executive director of Planned Parenthood and ably guided the agency for eighteen years until retiring in 1993. Under her leadership, the agency grew from a storefront to its own clinic, expanded educational initiatives and medical services, and growing into the rural areas of the region. She was open, compassionate and a visionary. It was important to Betty to serve people who needed her help. Her efforts brought her recognition from the Junior League, receiving its Community Service Award; the YWCA, receiving its Milestones Award; and the legal aid associations' Community Advocacy Award.  Betty Morais gave fully of herself. She was a pioneer in many ways, and a focused advocate. She has left her mark on our community. We offer our condolences to her family, and hope they may draw strength from Betty Morais' memory and the gift of her life.                          ____________________
