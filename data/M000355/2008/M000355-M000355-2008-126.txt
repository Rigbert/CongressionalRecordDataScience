 President, I am going to take a minute or so of my leader time.  The issue before us, I say to my colleagues, is whether we are going to stay on the Energy bill. I have some optimism based on a conversation I had with the majority leader on the Senate floor earlier this afternoon that we might be able to come up with an agreement to go forward. This is not the time to go off of the No. 1 issue in this country. On every poll you have seen the American people expect us to deal with the energy problem and to deal with it now.  With all due respect to any other matters that might be pending that all of us have an interest in, the question is, what is the most important thing to do in the Senate this week, right now, and it is to stay on energy.  I would urge my friends on this side to oppose cloture. We will get back to this issue later. Let's stay on energy, finish the job, and deal with the No. 1 issue before the American people.
