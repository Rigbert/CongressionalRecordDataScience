Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. The community of Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Bob Wales is one of these individuals. On Thursday, April 10, 2003, Bob will be honored at a retirement reception in recognition of his contributions as the Riverside Assistant City Manager.  Bob received his Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1962. Upon graduation, Bob was commissioned in the U.S. Army and served honorably as a First Lieutenant in Orleans, France until joining the California Division of Highways in 1964. Bob obtained his license as a Professional Engineer from the State of California in 1969. Bob's accomplishments include the design of the 2/210 freeway interchange as well as the design of numerous bridges throughout California.  Bob began his career with the City of Riverside as an Associate Engineer in the Public Works Department in August of 1969. Over the following eight years Bob served as a Senior Engineer and a Principal Engineer.  In 1977, Bob was named Public Works Director and continued in that position for ten years until he was later appointed Assistant City Manager of Development. His duties included the oversight of the Public Works, Planning, Airport and Development Departments, as well as negotiating agreements with private developers and ensuring expeditious processing of key economic development projects.  In 1986, Bob was appointed Executive Director of the Riverside Redevelopment Agency in addition to his other duties. In that position he has contributed to all facets of redevelopment in the City's six project areas. Under his exemplary leadership, the Agency has been involved in hundreds of projects worth millions of dollars including the reopening of the historic Mission Inn, the construction of a California State office building, the redevelopment of a major portion of the east side of Riverside with two large scale retail/entertainment projects and the creation of a Justice Center in the downtown area which brought in a State Court of Appeals, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court, a U.S. Federal District Court and a County Family Law Court.  Bob's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. He has been the heart and soul of many of the redevelopment projects and the vision of the future for Riverside and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
