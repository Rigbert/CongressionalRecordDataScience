 President, I rise today in memory of Stuart Prentiss Herman, a prominent California attorney who passed away recently, in Los Angeles, at the young age of 57 after battling cancer.  Mr. Herman lived his life fighting injustice and discrimination wherever he found it. He was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960's, and began his legal career in 1968 as a trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice.  After his term as a federal attorney, Mr. Herman entered private practice. His legal work was devoted to labor and civil rights law, and he was highly respected throughout the country as a litigator, a mediator, and an arbitrator of complex and significant cases, particularly in the areas of racial discrimination and sexual harassment. In addition to his private practice, Mr. Herman was committed to providing legal services to the less privileged members of our society, and served on the Managing Committee of Bet Tzedek Legal Services, the Southern California Committee of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Board of Directors of the Western Law Center for Disability Rights.  He was also committed to preserving the quality of our legal system, having served on the California State Bar Complainants' Grievance Panel and the Los Angeles Police Commission's discipline panels, and our judiciary, having served on the Los Angeles County Bar Association's Judicial Evaluations Committee and on the U.S. Court of Appeals' Ninth Circuit Task Force on Judicial Reporting.  Stuart Prentiss Herman was an exemplary attorney, having truly dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice for all Americans. I rise today in recognition of all that he accomplished during his lifetime, and in sadness that he passed away at such an early age.                          ____________________
