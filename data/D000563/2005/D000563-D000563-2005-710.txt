President, I would like to clarify for the Record the time periods allocated on the Democratic side to make certain that the Record for tomorrow's debate reflects what the Chair understands is my understanding: That the time on the Democratic side that will be allocated will be from 11 a.m. to 12; from 1 to 2 p.m., from 5 to 6 p.m., and from 6:20 p.m. to 7:20 p.m. During the period through 4 p.m., it is anticipated this will be a period open to anyone desiring to use it. Is that the understanding of the Chair?
