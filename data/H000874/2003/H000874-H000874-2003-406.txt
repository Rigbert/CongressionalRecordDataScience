Leader, in the event there is a vote tomorrow, would I be correct in assuming we would give to Members a minimum of an hour's notice and no vote will be held before noon tomorrow? Is that your thought at this point in time?                              {time}  1315  Mr. DeLAY. Of course. And we would like to give them even more notice than that, but at least an hour before we would actually ring the bells and go back into session would we give Members notice.
