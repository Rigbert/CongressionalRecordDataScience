 And I agree with him we should not be legislating on this appropriations bill. As the ranking member on this committee, I did not chose this evening and this time to have this debate. It was certainly brought before us by the Senator from Texas. And under that I offered my amendment to second degree it. I am not afraid to debate this. But I agree with you. It should not be done on a legislative appropriations bill.  I thank the Senator.
