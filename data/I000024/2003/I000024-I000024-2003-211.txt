President, earlier today I submitted a request to the Senate to be considered with respect to the referral of the nomination of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works for the 108th Congress.  The order reads as follows:       Ordered that, when the nomination for the Assistant      Secretary of the Army for Civil Works is received by the      Senate, it be referred to the Committee on Armed Services,      provided that when the Committee on Armed Services reports      the nomination, it be referred to the Committee on      Environment and Public Works for a period of 20 days of      session, provided further that if the Committee on      Environment and Public Works does not report the nomination      within those 20 days, the Committee be discharged from      further consideration of the nomination and the nomination be      placed on the calendar.  This order has been closely coordinated with both the chairmen andranking members of the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Environment and Public Works. As chairman of the EPW Committee and a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, I thank Chairman Warner and Senator Levin for working with Senator Jeffords and myself.
