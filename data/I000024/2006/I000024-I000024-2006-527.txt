I appreciate very much the Senator's attention. I have been down here since before the bill came up with the intention of being the first one. I yielded to Senator Santorum. We wanted to go back and forth. It was my understanding Senator Carper was recognized and I would be right after him and that time has arrived.  What is the problem?
