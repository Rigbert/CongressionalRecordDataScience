Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Ken Potts who is moving on after having served our community in Southwest Michigan as the director of the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport for 16 years. Ken has a strong bond with the Kalamazoo area as he also received his BS in Aviation Technology and Management and his MBA from Western Michigan University.  Ken's distinguished career began as an intern as at the Kalamazoo Municipal Airport, which would later become the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport. After two stints managing airports in North Carolina and Vermont, Ken returned home to direct the airport where his career started in Kalamazoo--he remained there for 16 years. His other career highlights include being an Accredited Airport Executive by the American Association of Airport Executives and serving as President of the Michigan Association of Airport Executives.  After so many years of great service, I want to be sure that proper recognition was given to Ken; his long career in the aviation field speaks for itself and I think that all of us in Southwest Michigan are quite lucky that we had him aboard for so many years. The presence of an airport in Kalamzoo not only makes travel convenient for our local folks, it also makes our corner of Michigan attractive to businesses that continue to view Southwest Michigan as an ideal place to run their business.  Ken leaves our airport better than he found it. We wish Ken and his family all of the best in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
