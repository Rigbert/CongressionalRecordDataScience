Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  The gentleman from New York unfortunately has got it all wrong. What this bill does is it takes the power away from one State court judge to decide national legal and national economic policy and puts it in the Federal courts where the founders intended it to be when they established the right of Congress to establish diversity jurisdiction.  The second point that I would like to make is why did all of these consumers only get 33-cent checks? It is because the lawyers signed off in the settlement that filled their pockets to overflowing with legal fees and giving 33-cent checks to the clients that they supposedly represented. Now, if those lawyers were a little bit more fighting for their clients and less for themselves, maybe those checks would have been bigger because the fees would have been smaller.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).
