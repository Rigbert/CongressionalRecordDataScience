Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of a warrior for peace. Yitzhak Rabin, a former solider, the former chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Force, put down his gun and decided that sacrifice was necessary to achieve peace.  After fighting Israel's enemies his whole life, Yitzhak Rabin chose to talk to his enemies at the negotiating table. He chose to try and end a conflict that pre-dated the birth of the state of Israel by agreeing to exchange valuable land for the end of all bloodshed.  Yitzhak Rabin knew that war was not the answer. He knew that war does not bring along peace. In his 1994 Nobel Prize acceptance speech he said, ``There is only one radical means of sanctifying human lives. Not armored plating, or tanks, or planes, or concrete fortifications. The one radical solution is peace.''  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to mark the legacy of a leader who not only spoke about peace, but gave his life in the pursuit of peace. His life was taken away from him because he tried to end the bloodshed of his people. Yitzhak Rabin was a leader for peace and today we remember him for that legacy.                          ____________________
