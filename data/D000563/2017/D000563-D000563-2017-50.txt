President, I have the greatest respect for the Senate staff, and I am not trying to say anything negative about them. I was hoping that this could be entered into the Record, and I asked for unanimous consent to enter it, believing that the handwritten portion would show up in the Record. I have since been advised that there will have to be translators and interpreters who will have to decide exactly what this says before it is actually part of the Congressional Record. I think that I have made my point as to where we stand in preparation of tax reform for America.  Thank you.
