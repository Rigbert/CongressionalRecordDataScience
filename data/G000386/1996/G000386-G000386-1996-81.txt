 President, I am going to offer amendments as a combined amendment, amendments that would prohibit the use of money in these subsidies to the maritime companies from being used for lobbying or for campaign contributions. That will be one amendment.  I was going to offer it as two separate amendments, but they are so closely related, I think they should be joined together. On behalf of the amendment I am speaking about now, it would say that these funds cannot be used for lobbying or public education.  For years now, maritime subsidies, such as operating differential subsidies, have funneled money into pro-maritime lobbying organizations. The Maritime Administration has historically calculated a certain amount of the taxpayer subsidies to U.S.-flag carriers to cover funding for organizations such as the Transportation Institute and the Joint Maritime Congress.  I want to make clear to my colleagues that I do not have anything against the Transportation Institute or the Joint Maritime Congress, but it should not be a cost of operation that the taxpayer subsidy is going to be used for. This should be funded by private money. It should not be a cost of doing business figured into the subsidy.  My amendment makes certain that these funds cannot be misused for such lobbying or so-called public education purposes. There is not much that I need to add. The Senate has debated this issue and voted on it on other bills at other times, with the principle of my amendment applicable to the subject matter of that legislation, as my amendment is subject to the maritime legislation.  On November 9, 1995, the Senate voted on a measure to restrict the use of public funds being used for lobbying. So every Senator is on record on this issue. Simply put, taxpayers should not be forced to pay for lobbying by special interest groups.  Then the second part of this amendment would say that funds cannot be used for campaign contributions. Realizing how much maritime subsidies are really maritime union welfare, you can understand why I might argue if you are against taxpayer campaign finance, you should vote in favor of my amendment.  Former Congressman McCloskey, a Republican in the House of Representatives when he served in the Congress, was involved in this issue very deeply because he was high ranking on the subcommittee dealing with maritime. He said that seafarers' per capita campaign contribution ran 500 times the average of the AFL-CIO member. You probably know why. First of all, there are much higher salaries there for it to be paid from. Also, the overburdened taxpayers have helped to some extent, because to the extent there are subsidies involved in the support of the industry, seafarers can afford to be generous with campaign contributions.  My amendment would prohibit this bill, H.R. 1350, the subsidies therein, from being used for campaign contributions. Again, this is a simple proposition. Taxpayers should not be forced to fund the campaign contributions of special interest groups. Congress has already adopted similar campaign contribution restrictions on other funding bills. I hope my colleagues would support this measure, as well.                     Amendments Nos. 5393 and 5394
