Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 578) concerning the Government of Romania's ban on intercountry adoptions and the welfare of orphaned or abandoned children in Romania.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 578       Whereas following the execution of Romanian President      Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, it was discovered that more than      100,000 underfed, neglected children throughout Romania were      living in hundreds of squalid and inhumane institutions;       Whereas United States citizens responded to the dire      situation of these children with an outpouring of compassion      and assistance to improve conditions in those institutions      and to provide for the needs of abandoned children in      Romania;       Whereas, between 1990 and 2004, United States citizens      adopted more than 8,200 Romanian children, with a similar      response from Western Europe;       Whereas the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)      reported in March 2005 that more than 9,000 children a year      are abandoned in Romania's maternity wards or pediatric      hospitals and that child abandonment in Romania in ``2003 and      2004 was no different from that occurring 10, 20, or 30 years      ago'';       Whereas there are approximately 37,000 orphaned or      abandoned children in Romania today living in state      institutions, an additional 49,000 living in temporary      arrangements, such as foster care, and an unknown number of      children living on the streets and in maternity and pediatric      hospitals;       Whereas, on December 28, 1994, Romania ratified the Hague      Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in      Respect of Intercountry Adoption which recognizes that      ``intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a      permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot      be found in his or her State of origin'';       Whereas intercountry adoption offers the hope of a      permanent family for children who are orphaned or abandoned      by their biological parents;       Whereas UNICEF's official position on intercountry      adoption, in pertinent part, states: ``For children who      cannot be raised by their own families, an appropriate      alternative family environment should be sought in preference      to institutional care, which should be used only as a last      resort and as a temporary measure. Inter-country adoption is      one of a range of care options which may be open to children,      and for individual children who cannot be placed in a      permanent family setting in their countries of origin, it may      indeed be the best solution. In each case, the best interests      of the individual child must be the guiding principle in      making a decision regarding adoption.'';       Whereas unsubstantiated allegations have been made about      the fate of children adopted from Romania and the      qualifications and motives of those who adopt      internationally;       Whereas in June 2001, the Romanian Adoption Committee      imposed a moratorium on intercountry adoption, but continued      to accept new intercountry adoption applications and allowed      many such applications to be processed under an exception for      extraordinary circumstances;       Whereas on June 21, 2004, the Parliament of Romania enacted      Law 272/2004 on ``the protection and promotion of the rights      of the child,'' which creates new requirements for declaring      a child legally available for adoption;       Whereas on June 21, 2004, the Parliament of Romania enacted      Law 273/2004 on adoption, which prohibits intercountry      adoption except by a child's biological grandparent or      grandparents;       Whereas there is no European Union law or regulation      restricting intercountry adoptions to biological grandparents      or requiring that restrictive laws be passed as a      prerequisite for accession to the European Union;       Whereas the number of Romanian children adopted      domestically is far less than the number abandoned and has      declined further since enactment of Law 272/2004 and 273/2004      due to new, overly burdensome requirements for adoption;       Whereas prior to enactment of Law 273/2004, 211      intercountry adoption cases were pending with the Government      of Romania in which children had been matched with adoptive      parents in the United States, and approximately 1,500 cases      were pending in which children had been matched with      prospective parents in Western Europe; and       Whereas Romanian children, and all children, deserve to be      raised in permanent families: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) supports the desire of the Government of Romania to      improve the standard of care and well-being of children in      Romania;       (2) urges the Government of Romania to complete the      processing of the intercountry adoption cases which were      pending when Law 273/2004 was enacted;       (3) urges the Government of Romania to amend its child      welfare and adoption laws to decrease barriers to adoption,      both domestically and intercountry, including by allowing      intercountry adoption by persons other than biological      grandparents;       (4) urges the Secretary of State and the Administrator of      the United States Agency for International Development to      work collaboratively with the Government of Romania to      achieve these ends; and       (5) requests that the European Union and its member States      not impede the Government of Romania's efforts to place      orphaned or abandoned children in permanent homes in a manner      that is consistent with Romania's obligations under the Hague      Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in      Respect of Intercountry Adoption.
