President, I am proud to reintroduce the Career and Technical Education for Adult Learners or the CTE for All Act with my colleague, Senator Baldwin.  Our legislation addresses the critical need to expand educational opportunities for working adults with low academic skills. The need for strengthening the skills base for working adults continues to grow. Increasingly, middle-skill and sustainable wage jobs require education beyond high school. Yet, according to U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey data, 12 percent (24 million) of working age adults have less than a high school diploma. Recent Department of Education data show that only 5 percent of adults with less than a high school diploma have any type of postsecondary certificate, certification, or license compared to 27 percent of adults overall. Moreover, an estimated 36 million adults in the U.S. have low skills with nearly one in six having low literacy skills and one in three having low numeracy skills.  Our ability to grow the economy and decrease income inequality will depend, in large part, on our commitment to providing education and training programs to low-skilled adults. These workers are concentrated in fields such as construction, health care, manufacturing, and hospitality. Expanding career and technical education opportunities to these workers could enhance their career trajectories and strengthen their earning potential, fueling economic productivity and growth for the future. Unfortunately, according to the U.S. Department of Education, roughly half of low-skilled workers are not engaged in formal or non-formal learning opportunities. The CTE for All Act aims to change that by ensuring that there are pathways for adult learners in career and technical education programs.  Specifically, our legislation will ensure that programs funded under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act align with adult education programs and industry sector partnerships authorized under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The CTE for All Act requires consultation with the state director for adult education in the development of the statewide plan for career and technical education. The bill calls for career and technical education programs to include low-skilled adults among the special populations targeted for outreach and support and allows states to report separate performance indicators for adult career and technical education students. The legislation makes adult education providers that offer integrated education and training programs eligible to receive career and technical education funding. Additionally, the legislation encourages career and technical education programs to include work experiences for their students of all ages.  We have worked with the adult education community and other stakeholders in developing this legislation. We are pleased to have the support of the National Council of State Directors of Adult Education, the Commission on Adult Basic Education, the National Skills Coalition, and the National Coalition for Literacy.  As a Nation, we are at our best when every person--no matter their starting point--has the opportunity to develop their skills and reach their potential. The CTE for All Act will strengthen the ladder of opportunity for adult learners who work hard every day to provide for their families. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and work with us to include these provisions in the reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.                          ____________________
