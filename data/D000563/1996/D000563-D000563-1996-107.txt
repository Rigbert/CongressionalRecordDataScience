Chairman, I say to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Ney], when our task force looked into Federal disaster policy, we learned that in the 1950's the Federal Government assumed responsibility for 5 percent of the cost of natural disasters. We now assume responsibility for 95 percent of the cost and it adds to our deficit every time.  The policy which the gentleman is trying to subvert would allow people to move back in the flood plain and leave the Federal taxpayers liable and vulnerable again in the event of disaster. I think that is a mistake.  Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gentleman I know what his intent is, to help these families, but bringing them back into harm's way merely increases the exposure of the Federal Treasury and the Federal taxpayers.
