This was our own creation, with British help and some other countries, but primarily American soldiers and American resources. I would ask the Senator from Nevada, is his point on the floor todaythat the bipartisan Senate should not go home for the August recess without taking up this issue? We have spent weeks, the Republican leadership has spent weeks in the Senate on meaningless constitutional amendments and issues that bear little relevance to the daily lives of Americans, but the Senator from Nevada has to feel, as do I, we have an obligation to these soldiers and their families before we leave in August to have a meaningful debate on this floor about how to make certain that we end up in Iraq with our mission truly accomplished. I ask the Senator from Nevada, is that the purpose of his coming to the floor?
