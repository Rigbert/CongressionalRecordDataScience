 In many States, it is already an emergency.  There was a carefully crafted compromise that she and every Democrat on the committee supported. The Senate has not reviewed this new proposal currently being offered today, but Members are serious about funding CHIP.  There is a bill before us that reauthorizes the program for a full 6 years and can be signed into law today. The only thing preventing CHIP's reauthorization from being signed into law today is the Democratic filibuster of the House-passed bill. Therefore, I object.
