Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Hobson substitute and in opposition to the Packard amendment. HIV-AIDS is now the leading killer of Americans ages 23 to 44, who are the core of our work force. Employees' fears about contracting HIV and working with HIV-positive employees undermine productivity in the workplace. That is why companies like RJR Nabisco and IBM provide AIDS education for their employees. However, the Packard amendment would essentially shut down AIDS education in the Federal Government. Under the Packard amendment, a single employee who found AIDS education to be offensive could shut down the program for all employees.  I do not think any employee should have to sit through training they find offensive. That is why I support the Hobson substitute, which allows employees with a moral or religious objection to any training to receive an alternative which is acceptable to them.  The Packard amendment limits HIV-AIDS training to the medical implications of HIV-AIDS and the workplace rights of HIV-positive employees. That means that educators cannot provide medically accurate, appropriate information about how HIV is and is not transmitted.  Under the Packard amendment, all educators could do is to tell people the medical implications of HIV, how sick they will be if they catch the disease, and tell them not to discriminate against people with HIV. The effect of the amendment is to create more fear and discrimination and not less. If an employee asks ``Can I get AIDS from a telephone? Can I get AIDS from a hug? If my co-worker is bleeding to death, how can I help without getting sick?'' the Packard amendment would prohibit AIDS educators from answering these specific questions.
