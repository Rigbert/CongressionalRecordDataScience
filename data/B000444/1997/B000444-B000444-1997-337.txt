 I applaud the President's effort to focus on teen drug abuse, and believe that it is a good response to a disturbing trend that we cannot ignore. We must harness a moral condemnation of drug use by all segments of our population.  I commend Mr. Coker for making a difference, and am grateful for his contribution in the fight against drug abuse.                          ____________________
