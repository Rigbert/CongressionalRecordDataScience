 President, I come to the floor to speak about two different subjects. One of them will be just 1 minute, and that deals with the fact that May is National Foster Care Month. I want to mention a couple of things about foster care because of my work in that area for the last 25 years.  I have often heard from young people that they wish someone had helped their parents so that they could have stayed together as a family. We can work in Congress to improve the foster care system, but, ultimately, kids need a family.  That is why I was proud to support the Family First Prevention Services Act. This bill will help families to stay together by funding proven services and support for parents. As the implementation process continues on this new piece of legislation, I will work to ensure that this legislation succeeds for families across the country, because for two-and-a-half decades I have been hearing from these young people in foster care: I would like to have a home, and I would like to have a mom and dad.                          ____________________
