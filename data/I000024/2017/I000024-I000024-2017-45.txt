President, it is interesting to hear the DACA talk. I think one should take a step back and look and ask: Is it really unreasonable to merely say that so long as we will obey the law, we are going to be all right? I think this President did the right thing when he said: All right, Congress. You take a few months and see if you can come up with some answers. That is a good answer. If that is the case, then that is, maybe, what we should do.                          ____________________
