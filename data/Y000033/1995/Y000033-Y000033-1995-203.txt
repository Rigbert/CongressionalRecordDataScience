Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 2 of House Resolution 197, I call up the Senate bill (S. 395) to authorize and direct the Secretary of Energy to sell the Alaska Power Administration, and to authorize the export of Alaska North Slope crude oil, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.  The text of the Senate bill is as follows:                                 S. 395       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,                                TITLE I     SEC. 101.

EXEMPTION AND OTHER PROVISIONS.       (a)(1) After the sales authorized by this Act occur,      Eklutna and Snettisham, including future modifications, shall      continue to be exempt from the requirements of the Federal      Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.) as amended.       (2) The exemption provided by paragraph (1) does not affect      the Memorandum of Agreement entered into among the State of      Alaska, the Eklutna Purchasers, the Alaska Energy Authority,      and Federal fish and wildlife agencies regarding the      protection, mitigation of, damages to, and enhancement of      fish and wildlife, dated August 7, 1991, which remains in      full force and effect.       (3) Nothing in this title or the Federal Power Act preempts      the State of Alaska from carrying out the responsibilities      and authorities of the memorandum of Agreement.       (b)(1) The United States District Court for the District of      Alaska shall have jurisdiction to review decisions made under      the Memorandum of Agreement and to enforce the provisions of      the Memorandum of Agreement, including the remedy of specific      performance.       (2) An action seeking review of a Fish and Wildlife Program      (``Program'') of the Governor of Alaska under the Memorandum      of Agreement or challenging actions of any of the parties to      the Memorandum of Agreement prior to the adoption of the      Program shall be brought not later than ninety days after the      date on which the Program is adopted by the Governor of      Alaska, or be barred.

(c) With respect to Eklutna lands described in Exhibit A of      the Eklutna Purchase Agreement:       (1) The Secretary of the Interior shall issue rights-of-way      to the Alaska Power Administration for subsequent      reassignment to the Eklutna Purchasers--       (A) at no cost to the Eklutna Purchasers;       (B) to remain effective for a period equal to the life of      Eklutna as extended by improvements, repairs, renewals, or      replacements; and       (C) sufficient for the operation of, maintenance of, repair      to, and replacement of, and access to, Eklutna facilities      located on military lands and lands managed by the Bureau of      Land Management, including lands selected by the State of      Alaska.       (2) If the Eklutna Purchasers subsequently sell or transfer      Eklutna to private ownership, the Bureau of Land Management      may assess reasonable and customary fees for continued use of      the rights-of-way on lands managed by the Bureau of Land      Management and military lands in accordance with existing      law.       (3) Fee title to lands at Anchorage Substation shall be      transferred to Eklutna Purchasers at no additional cost if      the Secretary of the Interior determines that pending claims      to, and selections of, those lands are invalid or      relinquished.       (4) With respect to the Eklutna lands identified in      paragraph 1 of Exhibit A of the Eklutna Purchase Agreement,      the State of Alaska may select, and the Secretary of the      Interior shall convey to the State, improved lands under the      selection entitlements in section 6 of the Act of July 7,      1958 (commonly referred to as the Alaska Statehood Act,      Public Law 85-508, 72 Stat. 339, as amended), and the North      Anchorage Land Agreement dated January 31, 1983.

(g) Section 204 of the Flood Control Act of 1962 (76 Stat.      1193) is repealed effective on the date, as determined by the      Secretary of Energy, that all Snettisham assets have been      conveyed to the State of Alaska.       (h) As of the later of the two dates determined in      subsections (f) and (g), section 302(a) of the Department of      Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7152(a)) is amended--       (1) in paragraph (1)--       (A) by striking subparagraph (C); and       (B) by redesignating subparagraphs (D), (E), and (F) as      subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) respectively; and       (2) in paragraph (2) by striking out ``and the Alaska Power      Administration'' and by inserting ``and'' after      ``Southwestern Power Administration,''.

App. 1622).       (k) The sales authorized in this title shall occur not      later than 1 year after the date of enactment of legislation      defining ``first use'' of Snettisham for purposes of section      147(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to be considered      to occur pursuant to acquisition of the property by or on      behalf of the State of Alaska.     SEC. 104. DECLARATION CONCERNING OTHER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECTS                    AND THE POWER MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS.       Congress declares that--       (1) the circumstances that justify authorization by      Congress of the sale of hydroelectric projects under section      102 are unique to those projects and do not pertain to other      hydroelectric projects or to the power marketing      administrations in the 48 contiguous States; and       (2) accordingly, the enactment of section 102 should not be      understood as lending support to any proposal to sell any      other hydroelectric project or the power marketing      administrations.                                TITLE II     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as ``Trans-Alaska Pipeline      Amendment Act of 1995''.     SEC. 202. TAPS ACT AMENDMENTS.       Section 203 of the Act entitled the ``Trans-Alaska Pipeline      Authorization Act'', as amended (43 U.S.C. 1652), is amended      by inserting the following new subsection (f):       ``(f) Exports of Alaskan North Slope Oil.--       ``(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (6), of this      subsection and notwithstanding any other provision of law      (including any regulation), any oil transported by pipeline      over right-of-way granted pursuant to this section may be      exported after October 31, 1995 unless the President finds      that exportation of this oil is not in the national interest.      In evaluating whether the proposed exportation is in the      national interest, the President--       ``(A) shall determine whether the proposed exportation      would diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum      available to the United States;       ``(B) shall conduct and complete an appropriate      environmental review of the proposed exportation, including      consideration of appropriate measures to mitigate any      potential adverse effect on the environment, within four      months after the date of enactment of this subsection; and       ``(C) shall consider, after consultation with the Attorney      General and Secretary of Commerce, whether anticompetitive      activity by a person exporting crude oil under authority of      this subsection is likely to cause sustained material crude      oil supply shortages or sustained crude oil prices      significantly above world market levels for independent      refiners that would cause sustained material adverse      employment effects in the United States.     The President shall make his national interest determination      within five months after the date of enactment of this      subsection or 30 days after completion of the environmental      review, whichever is earlier. The President may make his      determination subject to such terms and conditions (other      than a volume limitation) as are necessary or appropriate to      ensure that the exportation is consistent with the national      interest.       ``(2) Except in the case of oil exported to a country      pursuant to a bilateral international oil supply agreement      entered into by the United States with the country before      June 25, 1979, or to a country pursuant to the International      Emergency Oil Sharing Plan of the International Energy      Agency, any oil transported by pipeline over right-of-way      granted pursuant to this section, shall, when exported, be      transported by a vessel documented under the laws of the      United States and owned by a citizen of the United States (as      determined in accordance with section 2 of the Shipping Act,      1916 (46 U.S.C. App. 802)).       ``(3) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the      authority of the President under the Constitution, the      International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701      et seq.), or the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et      seq.) to prohibit exportation of the oil.       ``(4) The Secretary of Commerce shall issue any rules      necessary for implementation, including any licensing      requirements and conditions, of the President's national      interest determination within 30 days of the date of such      determination by the President. The Secretary of Commerce      shall consult with the Secretary of Energy in administering      the provisions of this subsection.       ``(5) If the Secretary of Commerce finds that      anticompetitive activity by a person exporting crude oil      under authority of this subsection has caused sustained      material crude oil supply shortages or sustained crude oil      prices significantly above world market levels and further      finds that these supply shortages or price increases have      caused sustained material adverse employment effects in the      United States, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend to the      President who may take appropriate action against such      person, which may include modification or revocation of the      authorization to export crude oil.       ``(6) Administrative action with respect to an      authorization under this subsection is not subject to      sections 551 and 553 through 559 of title 5, United States      Code.''.     SEC. 203. ANNUAL REPORT.       Section 103(f) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act      (42 U.S.C. 6212(f)) is amended by adding at the end thereof      the following:       ``In the first quarter report for each new calendar year,      the President shall indicate whether independent refiners in      Petroleum Administration for Defense District V have been      unable to secure adequate supplies of crude oil as a result      of exports of Alaskan North Slope crude oil in the prior      calendar year and shall make such recommendations to the      Congress as may be appropriate.''.     SEC. 204. GAO REPORT.       The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct      a review of energy production in California and Alaska and      the effects of Alaskan North Slope crude oil exports, if any,      on consumers, independent refiners, and shipbuilding and ship      repair yards on the West Coast. The Comptroller General shall      commence this review four years after the date of enactment      of this Act and, within one year after commencing the review,      shall provide a report to the Committee on Energy and Natural      Resources in the Senate and the Committee on Resources in the      House of Representatives. The report shall contain a      statement of the principal findings of the review and such      recommendations for consideration by the Congress as may be      appropriate.     SEC. 205.

This Title may be referred to as the ``Outer Continental      Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act''.     SEC. 302. AMENDMENTS TO THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LANDS                    ACT.       Section 8(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43      U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)), is amended by striking paragraph (3) in      its entirety and inserting the following:       ``(3)(A) The Secretary may, in order to--       ``(i) promote development or increased production on      producing or non-producing leases; or       ``(ii) encourage production of marginal resources on      producing or non-producing leases; through primary,      secondary, or tertiary recovery means, reduce or eliminate      any royalty or net profit share set forth in the lease(s).      With the lessee's consent, the Secretary may make other      modifications to the royalty or net profit share terms of the      lease in order to achieve these purposes.       ``(B)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act other      than this subparagraph, with respect to any lease or unit in      existence on the date of enactment of the Outer Continental      Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act meeting the requirements      of this subparagraph, no royalty payments shall be due on new      production, as defined in clause (iv) of this subparagraph,      from any lease or unit located in water depths of 200 meters      or greater in the Western and Central Planning Areas of the      Gulf of Mexico, including that portion of the Eastern      Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico encompassing whole lease      blocks lying west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude,      until such volume of production as determined pursuant to      clause (ii) has been produced by the lessee.       ``(ii) Upon submission of a complete application by the      lessee, the Secretary shall determine within 180 days of such      application whether new production from such lease or unit      would be economic in the absence of the relief from the      requirement to pay royalties provided for by clause (i) of      this subparagraph. In making such determination, the      Secretary shall consider the increased technological and      financial risk of deep water development and all costs      associated with exploring, developing, and producing from the      lease. The lessee shall provide information required for a      complete application to the Secretary prior to such      determination. The Secretary shall clearly define the      information required for a complete application under this      section. Such application may be made on the basis of an      individual lease or unit. If the Secretary determines that      such new production would be economic in the absence of the      relief from the requirement to pay royalties provided for by      clause (i) of this subparagraph, the provisions of clause (i)      shall not apply to such production. If the Secretary      determines that such new production would not be economic in      the absence of the relief from the requirement to pay      royalties provided for by clause (i), the Secretary must      determine the volume of production from the lease or unit on      which no royalties would be due in order to make such new      production economically viable; except that for new      production as defined in clause (iv)(aa), in no case will      that volume be less than 17.5 million barrels of oil      equivalent in water depths of 200 to 400 meters, 52.5 million      barrels of oil equivalent in 400-800 meters of water, and      87.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in water depths      greater than 800 meters. Redetermination of the applicability      of clause (i) shall be undertaken by the Secretary when      requested by the lessee prior to the commencement of the new      production and upon significant change in the factors upon      which the original determination was made. The Secretary      shall make such redetermination within 120 days of submission      of a complete application. The Secretary may extend the time      period for making any determination or redetermination under      this clause for 30 days, or longer if agreed to by the      applicant, if circumstances so warrant. The lessee shall be      notified in writing of any determination or redetermination      and the reasons for and assumptions used for such      determination. Any determination or redetermination under      this clause shall be a final agency action. The Secretary's      determination or redetermination shall be judicially      reviewable under section 10(a) of the Administrative      Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 702), only for actions filed within      30 days of the Secretary's determination or redetermination.       ``(iii) In the event that the Secretary fails to make the      determination or redetermination called for in clause (ii)      upon application by the lessee within the time period,      together with any extension thereof, provided for by clause      (ii), no royalty payments shall be due on new production as      follows:       ``(I) For new production, as defined in clause (iv)(I) of      this subparagraph, no royalty shall be due on such production      according to the schedule of minimum volumes specified in      clause (ii) of this subparagraph.       ``(II) For new production, as defined in clause (iv)(II) of      this subparagraph, no royalty shall be due on such production      for one year following the start of such production.       ``(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `new      production' is--       ``(I) any production from a lease from which no royalties      are due on production, other than test production, prior to      the date of enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Deep      Water Royalty Relief Act; or       ``(II) any production resulting from lease development      activities pursuant to a Development Operations Coordination      Document, or supplement thereto that would expand production      significantly beyond the level anticipated in the Development      Operations Coordination Document, approved by the Secretary      after the date of enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf      Deep Water Royalty Relief Act.       ``(v) During the production of volumes determined pursuant      to clauses (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, in any year      during which the arithmetic average of the closing prices on      the New York Mercantile Exchange for light sweet crude oil      exceeds $28.00 per barrel, any production of oil will be      subject to royalties at the lease stipulated royalty rate.      Any production subject to this clause shall be counted toward      the production volume determined pursuant to clause (ii) or      (iii). Estimated royalty payments will be made if such      average of the closing prices for the previous year exceeds      $28.00. After the end of the calendar year, when the new      average price can be calculated, lessees will pay any      royalties due, with interest but without penalty, or can      apply for a refund, with interest, of any overpayment.       ``(vi) During the production of volumes determined pursuant      to clause (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, in any year      during which the arithmetic average of the closing prices on      the New York Mercantile Exchange for natural gas exceeds      $3.50 per million British thermal units, any production of      natural gas will be subject to royalties at the lease      stipulated royalty rate.
