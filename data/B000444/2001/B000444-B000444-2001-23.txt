 President, on October 13, 2001, as part of Comcast's nationwide Day of Service, and in conjunction with Greater DC Cares, several hundred Comcast employees from the Washington, DC area volunteered to clean, landscape, and paint Anacostia Senior High School. In the wake of the tragedy of September 11, the Comcast Foundation has contributed $100 to disaster relief efforts in New York City and at the Pentagon for every employee and family member who participated in the clean-up. Comcast and every participating employee should be commended for their outstanding dedication and commitment to improving their community.  Nationwide, more than five thousand Comcast employees from twenty-six States volunteered their time on Comcast Cares Day. Though it may have been the work of only one corporation and one group of employees, Comcast's community service and the volunteer spirit of its employees represents the best of America.  The best of America can also be seen in other places around our country. Since September 11, Americans have risen to the occasion to aid their fellow citizen. In every city and town across America, individuals have taken the lead in community efforts like the one at Anacostia Senior High School. In my home State of Delaware, corporations such as Daimler-Chrysler, MBNA Bank and the DuPont Corporation have lent a helping hand to assist those in need. Furthermore, fire companies, school children, and individuals from all walks of life have come together providing assistance and comfort to the victims of the horrible September 11 attack.  Not to overstate the case, but there seems to be a renewed spirit of community in America where, not long ago, we seemed more divided by differences than united by common concerns and shared values. Corporations like Comcast and their employees have heard the call. They have pulled together and responded where there is a need and, in the District of Columbia, Anacostia Senior High School was the place. It was not the work that was done there on October 13, or the time and sweat of all those who volunteered, that should inspire us the most, but the overriding sense that all of us working together can make a difference in our communities.  After the tragedy of September 11, Americans responded when we saw the courage and dedication of New York police, firemen, and emergency workers. From their example have come story after story of corporations like Comcast reaching out, taking a lead in their communities, and making a difference. Comcast, The Comcast Foundation, and the dedicated employees who participated in making a difference at Anacostia Senior High School should be commended by all of us in the United States Senate who know how much we can accomplish when we work together.  Yet, this sense of corporate responsibility is not new for the Comcast Corporation. Comcast always has been an active participant in the communities it serves. Whether it is their support of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the Red Cross, or the Easter Seals, Comcast has insisted on excellence notonly in all aspects of its operation, but in its record of public service. This is a testament to the leadership of its founder and Chairman, Ralph Roberts, President, Brian Roberts, and Vice President, Joe Waz. These men serve as role-models in their communities and are true heroes in every sense of the word.  If we learned anything from September 11 it was that the will and resolve of the American people cannot be shaken by those who would use terror as a weapon and religion as a shield. We are strongest and at our best when we are defending American values and the bedrock principles of democracy. If anything changed on September 11 it was a renewed determination for all of us to reach out where and when we can, and to recognize that we are much more united by our common concerns and shared values than divided by our individual differences. Companies like Comcast have recognized a community need, reached out, and made a difference, and they deserve the recognition of a grateful Nation.                          ____________________
