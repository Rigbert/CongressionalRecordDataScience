The ``Talking Water Gardens'' is a high-priority wastewater treatment project in Albany and Millersburg, Oregon that received Recovery Act funds from the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund. Those funds will be used to construct 39 acres of treatment wetlands and reuse the treated water to improve riparian habitat. Unfortunately, a report by two members of the Senate entitled, ``Stimulus Checkup: A closer look at 100 projects funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,'' inaccurately and unfairly criticized this project. Had the two Senators who authored the report called these two Oregon cities to inquire about the project they would have learned that the Talking Water Gardens is a shining example of how Recovery Act funds can be used to improve our aging infrastructure, mitigate environmental damage, and create good-paying jobs. The project also illustrates how a successful public-private partnership can work. I respectfully submit this letter from the City of Albany, which further explains the inaccuracies in the ``Stimulus Checkup'' report on this important project.                                               City of Albany,                                    Albany, OR, December 14, 2009.     Hon. Peter DeFazio,     Rayburn House Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman DeFazio: On December 10, 2009, we learned      that Senator John McCain and Senator Tom Coburn named      ``Talking Water Gardens,'' our wastewater treatment and water      reuse project, in a report that questions the validity of 100      projects funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment      Act. This project is an important, necessary, and high-     priority wastewater treatment project for the State of Oregon      that received funding through the State Clean Water Revolving      Loan Fund program. This project provides sustainable benefits      for the community, the economy, and the environment. We offer      this letter in rebuttal to the ``Stimulus Checkup'' report      dated December 2009.       No one from Senator McCain or Senator Coburn's offices have      ever contacted the City of Albany or the City of Millersburg      regarding the project. The information sources referenced in      the report were never verified with us for accuracy. It      appears that our project was singled out simply because of      the whimsical name, ``Talking Water Gardens.'' The project      will construct roughly 39 acres of treatment wetlands and      reuse the water to improve the riparian habitat on land that      is the blighted site of two defunct lumber mills adjacent to      the old oxbow of the Willamette River. This land has      significant elevation differences, so the treated wastewater      from the Albany-Millersburg Water Reclamation Facility and      the ATI Wah Chang treatment facility will enter the project      at elevations above the wetlands, creating several waterfalls      that will aerate the water. Waterfalls are often referred to      as ``talking waters'' and the name was chosen with children      and the Native American Kalapuya/Willamette River heritage in      mind.       The conclusions of the McCain-Coburn report are inaccurate      and misleading:       (1) The report states that a non-competitive contract was      issued for the construction. This is false. In accordance      with the Oregon Revised Statutes, the cities employed a      construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) procurement      method that is allowed and, in fact, encouraged by the State      to lower public project costs. The process followed a Request      for Proposal and interview process that included evaluation      of both cost     and non-cost elements. Of six proposals received, the      selected contractor represented the best qualified and least      costly.       (2) The report fails to mention that the Willamette River,      one of the 14 American Heritage rivers, has new thermal load      restrictions placed upon treatment plants to protect and      recover threatened and endangered salmon fish species as well      as other water quality regulations.       (3) The report fails to mention that the wastewater      treatment plant serving the cities of Albany and Millersburg      and ATI Wah Chang must construct additional wastewater      treatment capital facilities to comply with the regulations.       (4) The report failed to note that the project is a unique      industrial/municipal partnership, between the cities of      Albany, Millersburg, and ATI Wah Chang with the industrial      partner contributing its share of capital.       (5) The report failed to note that this project provides a      secure and environmentally-sound wastewater treatment      solution for ATI Wah Chang, a major local employer and      significant rare metals industry in the United States. This      project protects the jobs at this industry that would have      been put at risk had a cost-effective treatment solution not      been found.       (6) The report fails to mention that the project is the      least-cost alternative that requires the smallest ratepayer      increases to comply with the regulations.       (7) The report fails to mention that this project received      an Honor Award from the American Academy of Environmental      Engineers for Excellence in Environmental Engineering.       (8) The report failed to say that the project will provide      employment for an estimated 100 people in diverse sectors:      electricians, mechanics, pipe layers, and excavators;      surveyors, engineers and construction managers; raw material      and equipment suppliers for the pipe, pumps, rock, concrete,      asphalt, wiring, steel and other materials; landscapers and      nurseries. These jobs are needed in Linn County, where 15.1%      unemployment far exceeds the U.S. (10.2%) and Oregon (11.3%)      seasonally adjusted rates as reported in the December 2009      Benton/Linn Labor Trends Report for October.       Talking Water Gardens is a shining example of how to      balance the needs of the environment with the needs of cities      and American industries to preserve jobs in these tough      economic times. Many, many people have worked hard to make      this project happen and singling it out for criticism without      verified foundation is shameful at a time when we all need to      be working together.           Sincerely,                                                    Sharon Konopa,     Mayor.                          ____________________
