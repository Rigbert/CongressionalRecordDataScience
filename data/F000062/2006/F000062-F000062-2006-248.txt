 President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators Boxer and Bingaman in introducing an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 National Defense Authorization Act concerning the Park Service's management of Santa Rosa Island within the Channel Islands National Park.  I remain deeply concerned about a provision in the House version of the Defense authorization bill regarding the future use of Santa Rosa Island.  Under a binding court settlement, non-native deer and elk must be removed from the island by 2011.
