Sparks of St. Joseph, Michigan, who is celebrating his 100th birthday.  Mr. Sparks was born in a log cabin with a dirt floor and sod roof in Oklahoma in 1908. He was taken out of school at the age of 14 when he went to work to support his family. He was a member of the ``Greatest Generation'' and served his country with distinction and honor in World War II in the European Theatre.  Mr. Sparks has been a resident of St. Joseph, Michigan for more than 80 years. To say that Tom Sparks is a man who has been active in his community would be a gross understatement. Mr. Sparks has rarely missed a meeting of the St. Joseph City Commission over the last eight decades. He was first elected to serve on the St. Joseph City Commission in 1948 and served as Mayor of his adopted hometown from 1955 to 1963. Even into his 90s--his name appeared on the ballot seeking a seat on the City Commission.  Mr. Sparks retired from the City of Benton Harbor as assistant to the superintendent and a building inspector in 1975 at the age of 67. As part of his birthday celebration, it is fitting he is being recognized by City Commissioners in St. Joseph.                          ____________________
