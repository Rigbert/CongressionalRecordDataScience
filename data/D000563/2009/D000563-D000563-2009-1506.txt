President, I wish to make a statement relative to this anniversary of Lincoln's birth, but I would be prepared first to yield to the Republican leader if he wishes to make a statement.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Illinois. I do have a couple of brief observations.                          ____________________
