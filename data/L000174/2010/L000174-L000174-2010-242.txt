He, with the gracious concurrence of our Chaplain, Dr. Black, has opened the Senate on other occasions. But it is with a great deal of pride for both Marcelle and myself when he is here and has a chance to visit with us. Father Pomerleau is a dear friend of all our family and has been a guide and spiritual leader for our family for decades.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a short bio of him by the University of Portland, which even speaks about his clarinet playing, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             Campus Ministry: Rev. Claude Pomerleau, C.S.C.       Rev. Claude Pomerleau, C.S.C., was born of French Canadian      parents in Newport, Vermont on beautiful Lake Memphermagog,      a lake that connects geographically and spiritually to the      Plains of Abraham in Quebec. He began his academic career      studying engineering and philosophy at Notre Dame followed by      theology in France and Italy. He earned his Ph.D. in      International Relations from the University of Denver in 1975      and has taught at the University of Notre Dame and the      University of Chile. Since 1991, he has served as an      associate professor in the department of history and      political science here at the University of Portland and      became department chair in 1994. Fr. Claude also currently      serves at the Director of the Social Justice Program and is      the Religious Superior of the Holy Cross brothers and priests      at UP. He enjoys traveling and observing the universe, but      especially visiting the University of Chile where he is a      visiting professor in the summer. Fr. Claude is an      accomplished clarinet player, sometimes playing loudly and      late at night in Tyson Hall where he is grateful to be      chaplain to a bunch of wonderfully tolerant students.
