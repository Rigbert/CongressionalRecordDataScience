Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act of 2013. H.R. 2019, authored by my colleague, Gregg Harper, is a bill that will help countless kids and families across the country.  The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act would prioritize funding for the research of pediatric diseases and disorders such as cancer, autism, and Fragile X. It would eliminate taxpayer financings of party conventions, political money, and use these funds instead to expand pediatric research at the NIH Common Fund through their common fund. This bill certainly does put kids first.  You know, Gabriella Miller was a little warrior in the battle against childhood cancer. At only 10 years of age, she had the courage miles beyond her years. A frying pan and a walnut is all you need to understand her brave outlook on life.  When she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she was told that the size of that tumor was about like a walnut; and from then on, Gabriella traveled with her trusty frying pan squashing countless walnuts along the way all over the world.  That is the kind of courage and outlook on life that she had. Advancing health research for millions of young patients who suffer from rare and genetic diseases has got to be a priority. While we have made great strides in the country in finding cures and treatments, we certainly have a great amount of work to do. Included in the work is pushing for research that is going to help uncover cures for pediatric diseases.  In order for clinical trials and other advancements to meet their full potential, adequate resources have got to be directed for pediatric research. The legislation is an example of how much can be accomplished by ending wasteful spending and redirecting those funds towards national priorities like pediatric research.  This effort is going to help families like the Kennedys in Mattawan, Michigan, my constituents. Eric and Sarah have two wonderful little girls, Brooke and Brielle, who have the rare disease called spinal muscular atrophy. Those two little angels, who are fighting SMA with the same vigor and sunny outlook exhibited by Gabriella, are decorated little generals in the effort to boost research for rare diseases and serve as inspiration for every one of us.  The sad reality is that it is often difficult to conduct research into rare diseases due to the small number of individuals with those diseases; but we are working to change that--yes, we are--and provide families with greater hope for a cure and in advances of treatment.  This bill has over 150 cosponsors and is supported by a long list of patient advocacy groups including Autism Speaks, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, and FightSMA.  I wholeheartedly agree with the bill's Democrat sponsor, Peter Welch from Vermont, who recently said last night on CNN:       Can we just put the battle axes down for a while and take a      step forward?  He thinks we can. We need to.  With all of us today with so many diseases, we need to pass this bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.                                 Angelman Syndrome Foundation,                                         Aurora, IL, July 5, 2013.     Hon. Eric Cantor,     Majority Leader, House of Representatives,United States          Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Gregg Harper,     House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Leader Cantor and Congressman Harper: On behalf of the      Angelman Syndrome Foundation, ASF, I write in strong support      for H.R. 2019, the Kids First Research Act. This important      legislation will     expand pediatric medical research activities at the National      Institutes of Health, NIH, by approximately $130 million.      Pediatric research should be a national priority, and ASF      applauds Congressman Harper for his leadership on this issue.      This legislation has the potential to develop treatments and      unlock the cure for thousands of impacted children, including      those with Angelman Syndrome.       Angelman syndrome is a single-gene neurodevelopmental      disorder that is related to autism. Continued research for      pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Angelman      syndrome, will lead to effective treatments that will help      combat the autism epidemic in the U.S. The Angelman Syndrome      Foundation's mission is to advance the awareness and      treatment of Angelman syndrome through education and      information, research, and support for individuals with      Angelman syndrome, their families and other concerned      parties. We exist to give all of them a reason to smile, with      the ultimate goal of finding a cure.       On behalf of ASF, thank you again for your leadership and      for supporting the Kids First Research Act.           Sincerely,                                                     Eileen Braun,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                          ASCO, July 10, 2013.     Hon. Gregg Harper,     House of Representatives,Cannon House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Harper: On behalf of the American      Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), thank you for the      introduction of The Kids First Research Act of 2013 (H.R.      2019). In this difficult budget environment, we are pleased      to see any amount of available funds transferred to vital      medical research and offer our endorsement of the      legislation. We commend this bipartisan effort in      acknowledging that medical research should be a priority for      federal spending.       ASCO is the national organization representing more than      30,000 physicians and other health care professionals      specializing in the treatment and research of both pediatric      and adult cancers. Through its support of research leading to      breakthrough improvements in cancer treatment, the NIH      consistently provides a dramatic return on investment, both      in the form of lives saved and economic growth. Our members      witness first hand on a daily basis the high risk, high      reward research that begins with NIH funding and results in      safer, more effective treatment options for cancer patients.       Given its track record of unmatched successes, we are truly      alarmed by the impact of recent budget cuts to the NIH and      the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Budget stagnation in the      last few fiscal years now compounded by cuts due to      sequestration has led to the lowest number of new grants      being funded at NIH since 1998. This is a devastating blow to      the pace of medical research progress especially since it is      occurring at a time of unprecedented basic and clinical      science discoveries that point to rapid progress against many      cancers. It has put life-saving discoveries on hold, stalled      the careers of the young medical scientists who would be      developing cures, and slowed one of our nation's areas of      historical technology leadership that is also a key economic      driver. Given the human and economic costs of these cuts,      ASCO calls on Congress to repeal sequestration and return to      regular order in budget negotiations. It is urgent that we      prevent the $19 billion in sequestration cuts to the NIH      expected over the next ten years and return the NIH to a      priority position in federal budget negotiations.       The Kids First Research Act is a great step in the right      direction to put the NIH back on a plan for reasonable growth      and can make a difference. Through NIH's time-tested peer      review process, this infusion of $130 million over the next      ten years will turn available dollars into new hope for the      health of America's children and all of our citizens. But it      is important to note that it will not compensate for the      larger cuts in this area of investment that have already      happened and are on track to worsen.       ASCO stands ready to help in your efforts to support      medical research at the NIH. If you have any questions or      would like assistance from ASCO on any issue involving cancer      research, please do not hesitate to contact Amanda Schwartz      at Amanda     [emailÂ protected] or 571-483-1647.

Hudis, MD, FACP,                                       President, American Society     of Clinical Oncology.                                  ____                                                 Bear Necessities,                                  Pediatric Cancer Foundation,                                        Chicago, IL, July 3, 2013.     Re: Kids First Research Act of 2013 (H.R. 2019)     Hon. Gregg Harper,     House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Harper: On behalf of the countless      children waging their courageous battle against pediatric      cancer, we strongly and respectfully urge you to support the      Kids First Research Act of 2013 (H.R. 2019).       This measure will provide much needed additional federal      support to complement ongoing research supported by      substantial private funding from national non-profit      childhood cancer organizations, as well as by the National      Institute of Health and National Cancer Institute. Passage of      this bill will ensure that the investments of both public and      private resources reach their fullest potential by enabling a      critical mass of research and discovery required to culminate      into promising medical treatments that are ``safe and      effective'' for many childhood diseases, including childhood      cancer.       As you may know, one in every 330 children in the United      States develops cancer before the age of nineteen. The      incidence of cancer among children is increasing. Each school      day, enough children are diagnosed with cancer to empty two      classrooms. Depending on the type of cancer and the      development upon diagnosis, approximately 2,300 children will      die from cancer in any given year. The number of children      diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. each year puts more      potential years of life at risk than any single type of adult      cancer. Cancer remains the number one disease killer of      America's children.       There are more than 360,000 childhood cancer survivors of      all ages in the United States. Unfortunately, 74% of      childhood cancer survivors have chronic illnesses, and some      40% of childhood cancer survivors have severe illnesses or      die from such illnesses. Survivors are at significant risk      for secondary cancers later in life. Current cancer      treatments can affect a child's growth, fertility, and      endocrine system. Child survivors may be permanently      immunologically suppressed. Radiation therapy to a child's      brain can significantly damage cognitive function, especially      if given at a very young age. While currently there is very      little in terms of ``safe and effective'' cures for any      particular type of childhood cancer, the underlying genetics      of the disease and recent research breakthroughs make such      treatments foreseeable.       Bear Necessities Pediatric Cancer Foundation thanks you for      sponsoring the Kids First Research Act of 2013 (H.R. 2019)      and we applaud your ongoing commitment to improving the lives      of thousands of children diagnosed with life-threatening      diseases and sparing families from the devastation that these      types of diagnoses cause. We look forward to working with you      to pass this important bill to help ensure a brighter future      for America's children.           Sincerely,                                                Kathleen A. Casey,     CEO and Founder.                                  ____                                        March of Dimes Foundation,                                 Office of Government Affairs,                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 2013.     Hon. Gregg Harper,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Cole,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Peter Welch,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Representatives Harper, Cole and Welch: On behalf of      the March of Dimes, a unique collaboration of over 3 million      volunteers affiliated with 51 chapters representing every      state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, I would like      to express our support for H.R. 2019, the Kids First Research      Act. This legislation would provide a welcome infusion of      resources directed to pediatric research at the National      Institutes of Health, NIH.       Our nation must commit to a sustained investment in      pediatric research to build our future by improving the      health of the next generation of children. As one example,      over 500,000 infants are born preterm in the U.S. each year.      Among those who survive, one in five faces health problems      that persist for life such as cerebral palsy, intellectual      disabilities, chronic lung disease, and deafness. Research      breakthroughs that allow us to reduce the rates of preterm      birth would lead to significant declines in infant mortality      and save millions in healthcare and special education costs.       The March of Dimes takes no position on H.R. 2019's      elimination of the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, but      if this step is pursued, we strongly support directing the      resultant funds to pediatric research. In addition, we urge      Congress and the Administration to work together to find a      balanced approach to deficit reduction that ensures the      necessary resources are available to fund lifesaving research      across the federal health agencies.       Thank you again for your leadership in introducing the Kids      First Research Act. We look forward to working with you to      make pediatric research a national priority.           Sincerely,                                            Dr. Jennifer L. Howse,     President.                                  ____                                          Brooke's Blossoming Hope                              for Childhood Cancer Foundation,                                                December 10, 2013.

Hon. Gregg Harper,     House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Harper: On behalf of Solving Kids'      Cancer, I am writing to express our strong support for your      legislation, the Kids First Research Act of 2013 (H.R. 2019),      which would supply critical funds to the National Institutes      of Health for pediatric medical research.       As you know, cancer kills more kids in the U.S. than any      other disease. Each school day, enough children are diagnosed      with cancer to empty two classrooms. We at Solving Kids'      Cancer believe that Every Kid Deserves to Grow Up. For kids      with the deadliest childhood cancers, including      neuroblastoma, sarcomas and brain tumors, their chances of      ever living long enough to be able to cast their first ballot      are less than 50 percent. This is unacceptable.       Children with cancer need new treatment options today. As      we enter a new era in cancer research with advances in      immunotherapy, innovative clinical trials that harness a      child's own immune system to fight cancer will help change      the future of childhood cancer. But without the necessary      funding, children battling cancer will be left behind, with      limited treatment options.       Solving Kids' Cancer is proud to lend our support of the      Kids First Research Act of 2013 (H.R. 2019). On behalf of the      families and children with cancer, thank you for turning      awareness into action and for helping to change the world for      children.           Sincerely,                                               Scott Kennedy, MBA,                                Co-founder and Executive Director.
