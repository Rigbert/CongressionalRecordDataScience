 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Teresa Snow and Tyler Ryan, high school students at Peoples Academy in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people:       We're both Seniors at Peoples Academy High School in      Morrisville, VT. We're going to talk about improving the      education system, and education opportunities. We basically      gathered these ideas from our own experiences and our own      concerns, and we came up with these topics and ideas.       We believe that all kids should go to pre-school, and at an      early age they should start learning our language, and many      of the words. . . . Being a high school senior, I can't watch      the news and understand what they're talking about, because I      don't believe I've had the right education and background. I      believe that they should learn about the environment and      recycling, what goes where; 'cause, we only got bins in our      classrooms, and maybe when I was in middle school, and kids      throw their trash in the recycling and throw recycling in      trash cans, and they don't really care. You need to know when      you're young where things go and how to take care of this      world.       I think that foreign language should be a requirement.      Because we're in Vermont, we should learn French because      we're close to the Canadian border. People in Arizona and New      Mexico should learn Spanish, because they're near the Mexican      border. We need to learn a foreign language. Tyler wants to      work with architecture, and I guess a lot of the supplies      come from Japan, and . . . he may need to learn Japanese, and      without that readily accessible, then he's not going to be      able to know--he's not going to have the right connections.       For middle school and high school ideas . . . I went to      England as an exchange student a year and a-half-ago, and . .      . they have a different system. They have required classes up      till you're like fifteen, and we could have our required      classes and our credits from 7th through 10th grade. Then      11th and 12th grade you could do job-oriented in your      profession, like singled-out. You can take very, much more      focused classes, become more prepared for, if you don't go to      college, then you have some background of what you want to      do.       We also feel that the teacher:student ratio is really      ``off.'' Kids don't get the attention that they need, so we      thought that excelling students, kids that are getting 95's      in their classes, should have an opportunity of either      becoming independent in that course, and possibly spending      the class period in the library in the school, or using      different resources in like the town libraries, or other      schools' libraries or college libraries. Or they could become      like teachers aides--complete their work and then go around      and help the classroom, 'cause that would help out both      ways: it would help the ratio, the greater student:teacher      ratio. I also think another thing--if you have students      that go to college to become teachers, they should get an      opportunity to do apprenticeships, come to schools to help      with the ratio as well.       And, kids lately are lacking so much desire and interest in      school; it's very, very sad. Like, I could have gone to      college, but I really don't have any desire anymore, right      now. It's something everybody needs; everybody needs a good      education.       Tyler: There definitely needs to be smaller classes; the      classrooms are just way too crowded. The technology is not      there; like, in our school we have one computer/classroom,      and that's definitely not enough, because if you took a class      period to work on a class project, or whatever, it would take      you . . . it would take the class about a month to do a      project over the computer. We think there should be available      money for apprenticeships and trade schools, and better, more      accessible to scholarships . . . for college, because it's      just--the prices are outrageous. We also think that there      should be an education tax, which would be put into high      school kids' paychecks, that would take out a small      percentage to pay for college; and if they decide not to use      that money . . . to go to college, they could put it towards      retirement, or put it into a savings plan, or something like      that.       Congressman Sanders: Both of you have raised some very      interesting points. Let me ask you a couple of question,      because you have raised some issues I hadn't thought about.      The issue, I think, that Teresa and Tyler have talked about,      is that when you go to school as students, in a sense you are      consuming a product, and I was wondering how often students      are consulted about the quality of that product. In other      words, let me just ask you a question: Is it your      understanding that students have access to School Board, in      order to express their views about the quality of the      education they're getting?       Teresa: I know we do [have access] because I was on Student      Council, and they've brought things to the School Board about      having all-day Winter Carnivals; but . . . they don't listen      a lot. I mean, the Student Council were very strong in their      presentation, and they had a lot of good ideas, and things to      back up what they wanted to do, so it was easily passed. But      . . .       Congressman Sanders: So it's not your impression that      students are really consulted in terms of how they feel about      the good or bad parts of their education.       Tyler: I feel that the School Board doesn't even know what      is going on in the school. I've never even seen a School      Board member really in a school. They don't come and talk to      us; they talk to . . . the teachers. And I don't even feel      that the teachers in our school know what the students want      or need.       Congressman Sanders: Well, in terms of student involvement      . . . do you think it might be of interest or importance for      the students to say to the School Board, ``Listen, you're      spending money on us. don't you want to have our opinion      about how well you're doing?       Tyler: Definitely.       Teresa: I definitely think they should get our opinion, and      a lot of times they go to such groups as Student Council or      NHS, and those kids aren't giving the school a problem; it's      not those kids that the teachers and the School Board want to      talk to . . . it's not where the problem is, it's not where      the issues lie.       Congressman Sanders: Okay. Teresa, you raised an issue: you      said that you perceive that some students are not really      interested in learning, they're giving up. Why do you think      that's so?       Teresa: Well, when you're in kindergarten and you're with      these teachers, that want you to play with blocks and you're      having a good time, and you just--teachers don't try to get      you as involved, I don't think, and you just lose interest.      They don't try as hard. They just want to get on with their      class, teach what they're supposed to teach . . .       Tyler: . . . and then finish the class and be done with it.      They don't really care about the students that much.       Congressman Sanders: It sounds to me like the suggestion      you may be making is we've got to figure out a way to involve      the students in the State of Vermont in their own education,      more than is the case. Is that right?       Tyler: Yes.                          ____________________
