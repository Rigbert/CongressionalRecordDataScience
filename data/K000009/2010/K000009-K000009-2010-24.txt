You are from the State of California, a State that's about four times as large as ours, maybe five, with 53 million people. We have over 11 million people in Ohio, but we are a State that has had to grow our way forward, to build our way forward for so many generations. We really aren't federally dependent in the sense that we don't have gigantic bases. We do have Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the city of Columbus, our capital. But the rest of Ohio has to either mine--and Congressman Wilson comes from a part of our State that actually supplies so much of the coal that is shipped to our region and others. We either have to grow in regions like mine--I represent a major agricultural region that abuts Lake Erie's southern shore--or we have to manufacture. We don't really have any choice. So we have to create wealth, basically.  And what's been happening over our country for many decades now is that we are amassing trillion-dollar trade deficits every year, which means all that spending benefits someplace else. Ten percent of the goods that are exported from China go to one company--Wal-Mart. They are a bazaar for Chinese goods.  We look at what you have pictures of up there, vehicles and wind turbines. I was just through a part of my district where wind turbines are going up now. We'd like to manufacture them as well as deploy them. And we are the solar capital of the Midwest--Toledo, Ohio, and northern Ohio. We are one of three centers on the continent, actually. People don't realize that we've built that off of our glass industry, and it is a new age for us. In fact, the largest solar field in Ohio was just dedicated in Upper Sandusky recently, and I have bases in my district--smaller bases, like the F-16 Fighter Wing and the 983rd Engineer Battalion and our Camp Perry--that have deployed solar fields.  So we are trying to move our region into the new energy era, but it's tough. It's really tough because we are on such an unlevel global playing field. Other countries aren't open to our products. And there is no question that unless we reduce that trade deficit and stop outsourcing our jobs to China, Mexico, every other place in the world,we are not going to be able to create a strong middle class and maintain the middle class that we have today.  So I want to commend you for doing this Special Order tonight. We know that our future lies in wealth creation, and it has to come from places like Ohio that have to stand on their own two feet and pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
