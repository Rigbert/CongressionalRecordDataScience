Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize Mr. Paul DeMoura of Swan Sea, MA, who is one of the top collectors of hats and caps in the United States.  Paul has collected hundreds of hats and caps from all over the United States and the world.  Paul's father, Mr. Raymond DeMoura, served in Company ``B'' of the 78th Medical Battalion during World War II. The 78th Medical Battalion acquired the reputation for excellence in its assistance and treatment of the wounded during World War II. Members of the 78th Battalion proudly recount that not one life was lost while tending to the injured and evacuating them from the front lines.  The men of Company ``B'' are the primary source of Paul's hat and cap collection. A very religious individual, Paul says a prayer for each of the men who presents him with a new hat or cap.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Mr. Paul DeMoura for his status as one of the top hat and cap collectors in the United States. I wish Paul and his parents, Raymond and Evelyn DeMoura, all the best the future can bring.                          ____________________
