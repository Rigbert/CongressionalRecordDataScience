President, I ask unanimous consent the letter to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2002.     Hon. Tom Harkin, Chairman     Hon. Arlen Specter, Ranking Member     Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and          Education Appropriations, Senate Committee on          Appropriations, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter: We are      writing to express our strong support for the Low Income Home      Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). We appreciate your      consistent support for this critical program to help low-     income families and senior citizens address high energy      burdens. We recognize the difficult choices that you face      this fiscal year, however, we believe that the strong and      continued growth in households requesting LIHEAP assistance      demonstrates that the funding needed for this program has      never been greater. We respectfully request that you consider      appropriating $3 billion in regular LIHEAP funds for FY2003      and provide advanced appropriations for FY2004.       LIHEAP is a vital safety net for our nation's low-income      households. For many low-income families, disabled      individuals and senior citizens living on fixed incomes, home      energy costs are unaffordable. Without LIHEAP assistance,      low-income families and senior citizens face the impossible      choice between paying their home energy bills or affording      other basic necessities such as prescription drugs, housing      and food. In FY2001, states received $2.25 billion in regular      and contingency LIHEAP funding. Despite this historic level      of funding, it is estimated that states were only able to      serve 17 percent of the 29 million eligible households.      Currently, states only have $1.7 billion available in LIHEAP      funds for FY2002. Sixteen states estimate that they will be      out of funding by the end of March.       We also request advanced appropriations for the program for      FY2004. Advance funding allows states to plan more      efficiently, and therefore, more economically. State LIHEAP     directors begin planning in spring and early summer for the      upcoming year. Without advanced funding, state directors are      unable to plan program outreach or leverage resources as      effectively. Advanced funding will also ensure that states      have the necessary funding to open their programs at the      beginning of the fiscal year in order to provide timely      assistance to low-income families who cannot afford to wait.       We look forward to working with you to secure the necessary      LIHEAP funding to meet the needs of millions of low-income      families. Thank you for your consideration of our request.           Sincerely,         Jack Reed, Susan M. Collins, Olympia Snowe, Carl Levin,            Joseph Biden, Paul D.
