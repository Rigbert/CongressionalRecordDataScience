That is a big issue now. We need these men and women in the Guard and Reserve, even active duty, who have developed the skills, understand the mission, can be combat ready in an instant. We need them to stick around. We need them to reup. If they have been through a bitter experience--personal experience, financial experience, separated from their family--we know it lessens that likelihood. If we want the very best to continue serving, I think this is an incentive for that to happen.
