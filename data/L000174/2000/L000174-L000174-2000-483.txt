President, it is not a question of liberal or conservative. As I recall, when the Democrats were in control of the Senate during 6 years overlapping the Reagan and Bush Presidencies, we voted to confirm about 99 percent of the nominations of President Reagan and President Bush.  Justice Scalia is considered one of the most conservative Members of the Supreme Court. As I recall, he got a unanimous vote from the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe he had a unanimous vote on the floor of the Senate.  Let's not use this shibboleth. We have also had a number of judicial nominees who said they were members of the National Rifle Association and a number who have said they have defended conservative organizations. Inever remember a single one having difficulty being confirmed. Let's not use that.  If we want to assume for the sake of argument that the Ninth Circuit is dominated by liberal activist judges, these critics urge the Senate to reject the confirmation of new judges. They are not letting two basically moderate judges come, thereby adding to the mix. It does not make a great deal of sense to me that they want to keep the court exactly the way it is.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from Judge Procter Hug that points out there are a number of circuits that have far higher reversal rates than the Ninth Circuit.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              United States Courts                                        for the Ninth Circuit,                                          Reno, NV, March 2, 2000.     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: I write on behalf of the      Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to emphasize the importance of      filling the judicial vacancies on this court.       During the four years that I have been Chief Judge of the      Ninth Circuit, we have had up to ten vacancies on the court      of appeals. We now have six vacancies, two have been vacant      since 1996, two since 1997, one since 1998, and one since      1999. It has been very difficult to operate a court of      appeals with up to one-third of our active judges missing. As      you know, I have worked with the White House and the Senate      in an attempt to fill these vacancies in a timely manner, and      I am continuing to do so.       As Chief Judge, I have implored our active judges and our      senior judges, on an emergency basis, to carry a larger      caseload during this interim while the vacancies are being      filled, in order to do our best to avoid building up a      backlog of cases with the consequent delay for the litigants.       Our judges have been most responsive in hearing      considerably more cases than would ordinarily be assigned. I      am very grateful, but I cannot expect the judges to do this,      on an emergency basis, for the indefinite future.       In addition, we have called upon the district judges within      our circuit to serve on panels, as well as visiting judges      from other circuits. However, this is not the ideal way to      perform the services of a court of appeals. The appeals from      the Ninth Circuit should be heard by the judges of the Ninth      Circuit Court of Appeals.       Despite all of these efforts, we do have a backlog of      cases, which principally affect civil cases, some of which      have had to wait a year or more to be heard. My major concern      is that we have had a significant increase in filings this      past year, which considerably exceed the number of cases we      are able to terminate even with this enhanced effort. In the      year ending December 31, 1999, the number of appeals filed      was 9,444, and the number of appeals terminated was 8,047.      This is a difference of over 1,000 cases.       If our six vacancies were filled and those judges were on      our court, it would mean we could decide an additional 800      cases on the merits. If they are not filled, I can anticipate      considerable delay for the litigants of this circuit.       Our court is very pleased that the leadership of the Senate      has committed to hold a floor vote this month on nominees      Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. We have every hope that      they will be confirmed. We would ask, however, that the other      nominees, Barry P. Goode, James F. Duffy, Jr., Richard C.      Tallman, and Johnnie B. Rawlinson receive hearings before the      Judiciary Committee in the near future. It is vital to our      Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.       By the way of emphasizing the need brought about by our      increasing caseload and the importance of filling these      vacancies, I might note a little historical perspective. In      1980, shortly after I came on the court of appeals, we had 23      active judges with a caseload of 3,000 appeals. Today, with 6      of our 28 judgeships vacant, we have 22 active judges to hear      over 9,000 appeals. You can see the importance of      proceeding promptly with the confirmation process.       I might make one other observation--I have noted that the      reversal rate of the Supreme Court in one unusual year, 1996-     97, has assumed some importance in the hearings. Even in that      year, when the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 95%, it was      less than five other circuits--the Fifth, Second, Seventh,      D.C., and Federal Circuits--all with a 100% reversal rate. In      the 1997-98 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 76%,      equivalent to that of the First Circuit's 75%, and less than      the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits' 100% reversal rate. In the      1998-99 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 78%,      equivalent to that of the Second and Federal Circuits' 75%,      and less than the Fifth Circuit's 80%, the Seventh Circuit's      80%, and the Eleventh Circuit's 88% reversal rates.       However, the important point to emphasize, in my opinion,      is that the reversal rate has little to do with the      effectiveness of any circuit court of appeals. For example,      the 13, 14, or 20 cases reversed in a term were out of 4,500      cases decided on the merits in the Ninth Circuit. The      reversal rate in any circuit should also have little to do      with the nomination or confirmation of judges to fill      vacancies on a court.       Our judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will      certainly appreciate any efforts on your parts to afford the      judicial nominees a hearing in the near future and a prompt      vote on the floor of the Senate.           Yours sincerely,                                                 Procter Hug, Jr.,                                                      Chief Judge.
