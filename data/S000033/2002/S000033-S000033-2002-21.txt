  Mr. Speaker, I understand that the big money interests want us to have a free trade agreement with Vietnam because it works in their interest. How wonderful it is for them to throw American workers out on the street so they can move to Vietnam and China and Mexico and pay desperate people 20 cents an hour, and they can make all kinds of profits while American workers lose their jobs. The truth is our current trade policy is a disaster. In the last 4 years under NAFTA and MFN with China and trade agreements with Vietnam, we have lost millions of factory jobs. In fact, we have lost 10 percent of our manufacturing base.  In my small State of Vermont, companies cannot compete against cheap imports. All over this country, companies are running to China and Vietnam to exploit the people in those countries. It is incomprehensible to me that any Member of this Congress who wants to protect American workers would vote against the amendment of my friend from California.
