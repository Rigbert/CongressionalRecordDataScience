Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from New York for yielding me this time.  The gentleman and I were very much involved in the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. No one who was involved in the passage of that act could not know Justin Dart. No one could possibly miss the incredible contribution he made to the passage of that most significant civil rights legislation in a quarter of a century. The gentleman from New York was a key part of the leadership in passing that bill in this House, as was Steve Bartlett, my Republican counterpart, who was assigned by his leadership, Bob Michel, to work with me, I was assigned by Speaker Foley, to work on this bill. Both of us knew that we owed Justin Dart an incredible debt.  Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sense of loss, as well as a sincere appreciation, that I come to the floor to commemorate the passing on June 22 of a dear friend, a personal hero, and a truly extraordinary human being. For nearly 5 decades, Justin Dart, Jr., was one of the world's most courageous, passionate and effective advocates for civil and human rights. He was perhaps best known, as I have said, as the father of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the landmark civil rights law signed by President Bush that opened the door of equality to millions of our disabled brothers and sisters. Many called him properly the Martin Luther King of the disability civil rights movement. He thought of himself, however, in more humble terms, simply as a soldier of justice. But the undeniable moral clarity of his life's work, the inspirational, persistent march for equal treatment, respect and human dignity invites such comparisons.  Dr. King famously said, and I quote, ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' Justin Dart understood that truth and he acted on it, devoting his life to fighting discrimination, empowering the disabled and comforting the dispossessed. Justin Dart was born to privilege, the son of a wealthy industrialist who was a close adviser to President Reagan. His grandfather founded the Walgreen's drug store chain. Yet underachievement characterized his early life. He attended seven high schools and broke Humphrey Bogart's all-time record for demerits earned as a student at the elite Andover prep school.  Then, in 1948, his life changed forever. Just 18 years of age, he contracted polio which left him in a wheelchair for the next 52 years. He did not grieve. In fact, he said, and I quote, ``I count the good days in my life from the time I got polio. These beautiful people not only saved my life, they made it worth saving.''  What an incredible statement for a man struck down in the early prime of his life, serving the rest of his life in a wheelchair.                              {time}  1500  That life was dramatic testimony to the ability he had while some looked at him as having a disability.  Justin went on to earn bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Houston, where he organized an ``Integration Club'' at the then all-white institution. He wanted to become a teacher, but the university withheld his teaching certificate because of his wheelchair use.  In 1963, he started Japan Tupperware and, in just 2 years, the company expanded from three employees to 25,000 employees. Not surprisingly, Justin took severely disabled Japanese out of institutions and gave them paying jobs.  It is also in Japan that he met his wife of 39 years, Yoshiko Dart. What an extraordinary person she is as well.  In 1974, Justin and Yoshiko moved to Texas where they immersed themselves in disability activism; and then in 1981, President Reagan appointed him to be vice-chair of the National Council on Disability. In that position, Justin Dart helped draft a national policy calling for civil rights legislation to end discrimination against people with disabilities, an action which laid the foundation for the Americans With Disabilities Act signed on July 26, 1990.  In the 1980s, Justin also served as head of the Rehabilitation Services Administration, chair of the President's Committee on Employment of People With Disabilities, and chair of the Congressional Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of People With Disabilities. However, despite his various positions and duties, the high point of his 5 decades, 5 decades in the civil rights movement, was the passage of the ADA.  As the lead House sponsor of the ADA, along with the gentleman from New York (Mr. Owens) and a few others, I saw firsthand how Justice crisscrossed the country, at his own expense, building grass-roots support for its passage. As a matter of fact, in the last 16 years of his life, hear this, Justin Dart, on behalf of ADA implementation and ADA passage, visited every State in the Union at least five times. This man in a wheelchair, struck down by polio at the age of 18, in the last 16 years of his life visited every one of the 50 States at least five times on behalf of the cause that was his life.  Its enactment was singular testimony to his ability, his passion, and his determined spirit. Fittingly, President Bush presented Justin with the first pen he used to sign the ADA into law during a ceremony on the South Lawn. Eight years later, President Clinton awarded Justin the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, remarking that Justin had ``literally opened the doors of opportunities to millions of our citizens by securing passage of one of the Nation's landmark civil rights laws.''  Mr. Speaker, the great American humorist Will Rogers once said, ``It is only the inspiration of those who die that makes those who live realize what constitutes a useful life.'' Justin Dart, Jr., has left a legacy of lives touched and hearts changed. We are the beneficiaries of his love, his compassion, and his devotion to equality. It now falls to us, Mr. Speaker, all of us, to carry on the fight and to realize Justin's vision of a revolution of empowerment. That is precisely what we owe the memory of this wonderful man.  Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincere condolences to Yoshiko, his daughters, and his entire family; and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution but, indeed, to do more than that: to keep the faith with this brave and decent human being, humble almost to a fault, giving credit to all around him for that which was accomplished. But all of us knew that in the final analysis, the moral leader of our effort, the inspiration for our work was this great and gentle man, Justin Dart, Jr.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella).
