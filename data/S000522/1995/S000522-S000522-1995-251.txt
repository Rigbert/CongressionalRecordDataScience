Mr. Speaker, last week the states belonging to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe--the OSCE--adopted a statement in Vienna regarding the escalation of ethnic tensions in Macedonia and the events that are causing this escalation. Some members of the ethnic Albania community of that country have sought to open their own Albanian-language university, and the resulting confrontation with the authorities became violent on February 17, leading to the death of one Albanian and the injury of dozens of individuals, including several police officers. Of course, there are now mutual recriminations regarding how the violence started.  As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I want to note and lead my support to the path outlined in the OSCE statement, which calls on all parties to exercise restraint, to strengthen the dialogue and to maintain an open-minded attitude in order to overcome the problems between them. It also indicates the willingness of the OSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities and the OSCE Monitoring Mission in Macedonia to contribute as they can to the alleviation of tensions.  I support this, because the differences which exist in Macedonia today can, in fact, be worked out peacefully. To allow the tensions to worsen unnecessarily not only would be destabilizing to Macedonia, but potentially to an entire Balkan region where there is already too much tension and violence.  In regard to the effort to establish a university in the city of Tetovo, provisions of the OSCE--and specifically the Copenhagen document of 1990--state that national minorities do have the right to establish and maintain their own educational and cultural institutions, as well as unimpeded contacts among themselves and with citizens of other states with common ethnic origin. The Macedonian Government is not obliged to fund, accredit or even recognize this university, but to consider the institution illegal--and to physically destroy last December the building in which it was originally opened--violates the spirit, if not the letter, of these provisions.  Mr. Speaker, if some segments of the Albanian community in Macedonia genuinely have as their objective a solid educational institution for the benefit of the people of their community, they should make sure that education is not used instead to provoke tension or incite violence. While there are ample grounds for criticism of the Macedonian Government, as I have just expressed, there is also reason to believe that minority-related issues, including education, can be satisfactorily addressed in a far less confrontational manner.  I would urge all sides to address education and other minority-related questions through dialogue, and the authorities to move more quickly on needed educational reforms. In the meantime, those ethnic Albanian leaders arrested for incitement during the February 17th incident are entitled to the protection of their rights, and any judicial proceedings should ensure due process in their regard.  [[Page E512]] Mr. Speaker, I would hope that assurances of full protection for human rights could be made and timely reforms could be forthcoming. While I recognize that Macedonia is not a member of the OSCE, Macedonia is not excused from complying with international human rights standards.                          ____________________
