 President, I rise to pay tribute to a Kentuckian who was a coach, athletic director, and teacher to many and a confidant and good friend to even more. Kentucky mourns the passing of Mr. George John Smith of London, KY, who passed away on August 17 of this year at the age of 59.  Known as G.J. to his many players, friends, and fellow baseball fans, Mr. Smith was a Laurel County native born in 1953. He began his coaching career at Laurel County High School in 1977. When he stepped down from that position 26 years later, he was ranked among the winningest high school baseball coaches in Kentucky with over 600 victories.  G.J. was also the athletic director at South Laurel and the Laurel County Board of Education. He was inducted into the Laurel County Sports Hall of Fame and the Kentucky High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame. He was also a member of Mt. Zion Church of Christ.  In college, G.J. played basketball at the University of Kentucky under coach Adolph Rupp. He is survived by his wife Judy; two sons, Cameron and Trey; a sister and brother-in-law, Charlie Jean and Terry Mack; and many other beloved family members and friends.  I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in extending sympathies to the family of G.J. Smith as well as his many friends and players. As the home of Pee Wee Reese and the Louisville Slugger, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has certainly contributed more than its share to America's greatest pastime. I am pleased the legacy of G.J. Smith will be remembered as a part of the Bluegrass State's baseball history as well.  Mr. President, an article describing G.J. Smith's life of achievement recently appeared in the Whitley County-area publication the Times Tribune. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Times Tribune, Aug. 20, 2012]                         G.J. Smith: 1953-2012                    Former Wildcat, Coaching Legend                                Dead at 59                           (By Chris Parsons)       London.--The Commonwealth of Kentucky lost one if its      sports legends Friday when G.J. Smith, former Kentucky      Wildcat and long time Laurel County coach and athletics      director, died of a heart attack at the age of 59.       Smith was considered an ambassador of sports in Laurel      County on many occasions     and his love of student athletes is something he'll always be      remembered for. Though he held many titles in his career, the      one title most common among those that knew Smith was that of      a friend and teacher.       Former South Laurel basketball coach Steve Wright, who      coached under Smith in baseball as an assistant and      basketball when Smith was the AD, said Smith's experiences      and heartfelt dedication is what sticks out to him more than      anything.       ``He's the most fierce competitor I have ever been      around,'' Wright said. ``When you were around him, he just      taught you the value of winning and doing well.       ``The thing I learned from him most was that the kids      always came first,'' Wright added. ``No matter what he did,      he always wanted what was best for the students no matter      what the situation was.''       Wright said one of his fondest memories with Smith was      after South Laurel won the state championship in 2005, when      they shared a special moment after the game.       ``He wasn't a real emotional guy, but after that game he      came over and gave me a big hug,'' Wright said. ``It was a      moment as coach, it was a moment as an AD and it was a moment      as a father and I'll always remember that.       ``We were able to share a dream that we both had,'' he      added. ``It really was like a mountain top for both of us,      and I look back on that because it was a moment that I think      he really enjoyed and could say `my school just won the state      championship.' ''       As a basketball player in his younger days, Smith became      the only player to lead two different teams to the Sweet 16      in consecutive years after he first led Hazel Green in 1970,      and Laurel County after consolidation in 1971, when he was      also named a High School All-American and played for the      Kentucky All-Stars.       Smith's coaching career spanned 26 years, with a career      total of 662 wins, 15 district titles and six region      championships as head coach. Smith's teams never had a losing      season during Smith's tenure and won 30 games six times.       Current Corbin baseball coach Rob Ledington, who played for      Smith in high school and got his first coaching job under      him, said his relationship with Smith was often misconstrued,      yet grew in Smith's later days.       ``Our relationship was a lot stronger than a lot of people      realized,'' said Ledington. ``I got my start in baseball with      him as a player and I got my first coaching job under him.       ``A lot of the stuff that I do as a coach, as a teacher,      and as a father, I learned from him,'' he added. ``Outside of      my immediate family, he was the most influential person in my      life. We've had disagreements, but that's just part of being      a family. It's a sad day for baseball and it's just as sad a      day for me personally.''       As a result of Smith's high-school basketball accolades, he      was a member of Adolph Rupp's famed Super Kitten recruiting      class. While he was at UK, Smith was a part of history twice      as he played in the final games of John Wooden of UCLA (the      1975 NCAA Championship game) and Rupp. Smith said on several      occasions that his favorite UK memory was when the Wildcats      knocked off top-ranked Indiana, 92-90, to end the Hoosiers'      34-game winning streak in the Mideast Regional final game in      Dayton, Ohio.       Arrangements will be handled by House-Rawlings Funeral Home      in London.       The family will hold a visitation after 6 p.m. Monday night      and the funeral will be Tuesday at 11 a.m.                          ____________________
