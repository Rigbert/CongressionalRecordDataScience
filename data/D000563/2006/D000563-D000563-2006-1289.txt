President, let me salute those on the floor who have been so instrumental in bringing us to this point.  I look over and see Senator Martinez, who has worked very hard to find a bipartisan compromise which I now support. I thank him for that leadership.  I say the same of Senator McCain and Senator Graham and so many others who have gathered here today.
