Speaker, I rise today to call for an end to the contested election in the 46th District of California. Enough is enough.  It is unfortunate that our second session is starting out much the same as our first session did. Members of the Republican leadership are publicly making unsubstantiated assertions about illegal voting in the 46th District and about the involvement of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Sanchez).  The facts, however, tell a different story. The facts are that the grand jury investigating this matter for 13 months found no credible evidence on which to base a criminal prosecution, not one, although Hermandad was called a criminal organization in this House on this floor. No conspiracy to commit voter fraud was found. The Orange County District Attorney had a thorough and fair investigation. It yielded no indictments.  The facts are that the Committee on House Oversight asked Secretary Jones to investigate a list. He gave us that list back and he said that he could not vouch for any list because he did not know how it was put together. Let us end this sad event in our Congress' history.                          ____________________
