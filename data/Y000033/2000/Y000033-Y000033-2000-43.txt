Mr. Speaker, I filed a supplemental report yesterday. It changes only a technical error on the cover page of Report 106-801 filed by me on July 27, 2000.  Digressing from my statement. My colleagues in this body, this is a very serious time, and I hope that Members will take the time to listen to both sides of this argument and make a decision by voting favorably on this resolution.  The resolution now before the House reports the refusal of three subpoenaed witnesses to answer questions at hearings of the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources of the Committee on Resources, chaired by the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin). The questions were critical to the committee's oversight.  Every Member of this House, Democrat, Republican and Independent, should support this resolution. If not, we undercut the future capability of this Congress and future Congresses to get information we will need to do our job required by Article One of the Constitution.  The resolution is about whether the authority of a subpoena from a House committee means anything or whether it can be ignored. If Members think a subpoena means something, then they will vote for this substitute resolution. If they think committees, in their oversight roles, not the witnesses, should define the questions at a hearing, then they will vote in favor of reporting the facts relating to the refusal of Ms. Brian, Mr. Berman, and Mr. Banta to answer questions posed by the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin) and her subcommittee.  On institutional grounds alone, every Member, Democrat, Independent, Republican, should support this contempt resolution. Every Member should also support the report on the merits as well.  Mr. Speaker, this all started 18 months ago, when the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin) and I read alarming press reports. These reports detailed government employees within the departments we oversee being paid and using proceeds from a whistleblower lawsuit called Johnson and Shell.  That successful whistleblower suit is now basically settled. It returned over $400 million to the U.S. Treasury. But serious questions about the payments to Federal employees from the whistleblower share of the Johnson and Shell settlements forced us to launch an oversight review in the process. We issued document requests and, as we learned more about the payments, we scheduled hearings.  In those hearings, the gentlewoman from Wyoming exposed details of a secret plan hatched years earlier by a group called POGO, the Project on Government Oversight. The plan was to pay two government oil royalty experts huge, and I mean huge, sums of money from the Johnson and Shell settlement.  POGO used the Federal employees to learn information about the court-sealed Johnson and Shell lawsuit. I repeat, the court-sealed Johnson and Shell lawsuit. And then POGO filed its own suit making the same allegation on top of the Johnson and Shell lawsuit.                              {time}  1030  Settlement proceeds from POGO's share were then funneled to the government insiders.  The gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin) and her subcommittee discovered how POGO had already split nearly a million dollars from Federal employees. She discovered their written agreements. She discovered their plans to take $7 million in total from the whistleblowers' lawful reward. She discovered their plan split the bounty with the Federal Government employees. She discovered how the Department of Justice told POGO not to make the payments. May I stress that again. She discovered how the Department of Justice told POGO not to make those payments.  The Committee experienced major, major stonewalling from those cited inthis resolution while inquiring about the scheme. The culprits say that they, not Congress, determine what the American people will know about the largest payoffs ever accepted by Federal employees. That stonewalling probably constitutes a Federal misdemeanor known as contempt of Congress. A vote by the House is required to begin enforcement and condemn the payoffs, which is why we consider the report and resolution today.  That oversight review included examining whether the two federal insiders, Robert A. Berman of Interior or Robert A. Speir of Energy, sold Government secrets or exercised influence to favor those who paid them.  The Committee on Resources, under its rules, authorized me to issue subpoenas on this manner. After it became clear that the key players would not provide good-faith cooperation to the subcommittee of the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin), I issued subpoenas for important documents. Later, the participants refused requests for voluntary interviews. So I issued subpoenas for witnesses to appear before the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources chaired by the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin).  Those subpoenas did not mean much to the key players in this scandal. They were denied. The gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin) and the subcommittee were very fair. Her subcommittee's oversight, as far as it could go, was an excellent example, I believe, of responsible Government.  Under the statute, if the House adopts this report, the Speaker is authorized to present the facts to the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia.  Consistent with the constitutional separation of powers, we do not weigh the evidence of refusal to comply with subpoenas against the reasonable doubt standard of proof.  Our obligation is to report the facts as we know them. To fail to make this report will surrender authority over oversight to witnesses rather than reserving it to the House as placed by the Constitution.  To put it simply, these parties have left no choice for the Congress. They refuse to comply.  May I remind Members on both sides of the aisle, if they do not adopt this resolution, if they do not adopt this report, if they do not adopt what I am asking today, future Congresses will be thumbed at and told to forget their role as oversight.  These people offered and accepted the largest payoffs ever made by Federal bureaucrats. But they claim the arrogant, self-serving privilege to tell the United States that they may not ask certain questions about their agreement, what they knew, and how they knew it.  They say to us, we will not tell you how we used Government insiders to learn information. We will not tell you how we used Government employees to leach settlements from the true whistleblowers in the Johnson suit. They say, we will not tell you about our secret agreements to make payments to Federal oil policy insiders who helped them.  To protect our mandate as Members of the House, our mandate to gather information and facts needed by the people to legislate and oversee Federal agencies, as I have said before, we, as a Congress, must adopt this resolution. We must stand up for the people's right to know what happened in this payoff.  The substitute resolution I have offered will authorize the Speaker to certify to the U.S. Attorney only the refusal of Henry M. Banta, Robert A. Berman, and Danielle Brian Stockton to answer questions while appearing under subpoena before the Committee. This is done in light of new evidence suggesting that POGO and Banta paid Berman for influencing regulations. And that documentation is in the report. This is a very serious felony.  There is no longer an interest in grouping Mr. Rutter and the other officers or directors of the corporation known as POGO with serious felons. Nor does the Committee on Resources wish to needlessly compound the charges by having Banta and Stockton face two misdemeanor counts each along with the serious charges which now seem certain.  My colleagues will hear that this is all about big oil, it is about a so-called whistleblower. This is nothing to do with the whistleblower. In fact, the whistleblower testified before our committee that the suit was filed on top of his so they could gather the money to be paid to these Federal employees.  It is probably one the most corrupt actions by Federal employees under a sealed document where they issued information that was confidential to, in fact, receive reimbursement.  This is about this Congress and the next Congress and the Congresses in the future. If we do not adopt this resolution, then we have said to ourselves that this Congress no longer counts in seeking the truth.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
