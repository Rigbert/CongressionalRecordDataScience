 He is critical of the Bush administration for not conducting military tribunals more rapidly. I agree with him. I think they should have been tried more rapidly. But thatis the place to try them, right down there in Guantanamo.  If my friend is suggesting it is a good idea to bring these terrorists into the United States and, if convicted, put them in U.S. facilities, the supermax facility has basically no room. There may be one bed. As far as I know, there is no room at supermax.  Not only do we have, if we bring them into the United States--I don't know why I am smiling. This is not a laughing matter. Say what you will about the previous administration, but we were not attacked again after 9/11.
