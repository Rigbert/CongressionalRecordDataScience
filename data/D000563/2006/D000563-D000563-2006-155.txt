I ask of the Senator from Pennsylvania, we understand the Armed Services Committee's jurisdiction on treatment of detainees, military commissions, and the like. If I am not mistaken, I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, when we discuss a fundamental constitutional question, it seems to me that is an appropriate area for the Judiciary Committee to consider the merits of the question. I think I know the answer from what I have already heard in the Senator's previous statements. I hope I can join the Senators in making this request.
