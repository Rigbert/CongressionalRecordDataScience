 President, it is difficult to find words adequate enough to express the emotions of so many Americans, all across the country, as we continue to learn more about the utter devastation of the Gulf Coast region by Hurricane Katrina.  Hundreds of lives have been lost. Thousands more have been ripped apart, as Gulf Coast residents have lost their homes, savings, or possessions. A great American city, New Orleans, has been reduced to a ghost town. In the months ahead we will have much rebuilding to do--although there is no doubt in my mind that the gulf coast will be rebuilt, and rebuilt stronger than ever before.  We have already made great progress towards assisting the Gulf region here in the Senate. In the last several days we have passed over $62 billion in emergency relief.
