Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have long worked with my colleagues from Arizona and other border states to address issues, from health care to crime, that are associated with illegal immigration. In the 107th Congress, I joined Senator Feinstein, Senator Kyl, and a bipartisan group of Senators to reauthorize the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP, to ensure that the Federal Government reimbursed States for the costs wrongly borne by local communities for the incarceration of undocumented immigrants. That bill was based on the premise that control of illegal immigration is principally the responsibility of the Federal Government.  Last November, that legislation was incorporated into the 21st Century Department of Justice Authorization Act. Despite its enactment, States and local governments continue to disproportionately bear the costs associated with incarcerating illegal immigrants. As undocumented aliens take increasingly desperate measures to cross our border with Mexico, the burden borne by States along the Southwestern border continues to grow.  The Federal Government's attempt to stem illegal immigration in Texas and California has made it increasingly difficult to cross the border in these States. Unfortunately, these actions have created a funnel effect, giving Arizona the dubious distinction of being the location of choice for illegal border crossers. Reports suggest that at least one in three of the illegal border crossers arrest traversing the U.S.-Mexico border are stopped in Arizona. Last year approximately 320 people died in the desert trying to cross the border. Additionally, the number of attacks on National Park Service Officers has increased in recent years. Property crimes are rampant along the border, leaving Arizona with the highest per-capita auto theft rate in the nation. Times have gotten so desperate that vigilante groups have begun to form with the goal of doing the job the Federal Government is failing to do.  The situation along our Southwestern border has reached a crisis. I will continue to support legislative initiatives aimed at addressing the problems that stem from illegal immigration. However, I strongly believe that the Federal Government desperately needs innovative legislation to address the source of this problem through a guest worker program. In the absence of guest worker legislation, we must continue supporting important programs, such as SCAAP, that assist the border States where the Federal Government has failed.  Covering the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants is yet another underfunded Federal mandate thrust upon struggling State governments. Less than two weeks ago, States were struck an enormous blow when the funding for SCAAP was cut in half by the FY 2003 Omnibus appropriations bill signed into law by the President. For my own State of Arizona, this means that rather than the $24 million reimbursement Arizona received in FY 2002--which barely covered one third of the actual cost borne by the State--at best Arizona can hope to receive half that amount. Even more disconcerting are recent suggestions that this program should be cut completely, because it does not fit within the mission of the Department of Justice.  I believe that SCAAP is absolutely necessary for all States, particularly those that line our Nation's Southern border. For that reason, Senator Feinstein and I are today introducing the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program Reauthorization Act of 2003. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with Senator Feinstein, Senator Kyl, and Congressman Kolbe, who has introduced the companion to this bill in the House of Representatives, to correct this problem. The bill we are introducing today will extend the authorization of SCAAP through 2010 and to authorize increased funding levels to ensure that States are not shortchanged and funding for this important program continues to increase.  At a time when most states are experiencing the worst budge shortfalls since the Great Depression, the Federal Government must stop shirking the cost for what is truly a Federal responsibility. It is time for us to step up to the plate and reimburse states and local communities for the costs of our failure to adequately address illegal immigration.                                 ______                                       By
