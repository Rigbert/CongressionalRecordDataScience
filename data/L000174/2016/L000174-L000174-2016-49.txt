President, I want to briefly call the Senate's attention to a Vermonter who, more than any other individual, has been responsible for the sport of cross-country skiing becoming a winter pastime and passion for countless Americans of all ages. I count myself and my wife, Marcelle, among them.  There have been many articles written about former Olympic combined skier John Caldwell of Putney, VT, who in 1964 wrote the how-to guide to cross-country skiing, and about his sons and daughter and granddaughter Sophie and grandson Patrick, each of them outstanding cross-country skiers in their own right, two of whom, son Tim and Sophie, have represented the United States at the winter Olympics. Chances are they are not going to be the last Vermonters with the Caldwell name to do so.  I will not repeat what those articles have said, but I ask unanimous consent that one of them, published in the Rutland Herald on February 23, 2014, entitled ``Vt. ski pioneer sustains Olympic spirit,'' be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks. It gives you a pretty good idea of the 87-year-old Vermonter I am talking about.  John Caldwell, known to his many friends as Johnny, is a pioneer and legend in every sense of the words. After the 1952 Olympics, he embarked on a lifelong campaign to teach and coach others to enjoy the sport of cross-country skiing as he did, whether as a simple way to get out in wintertime and experience the snow-filled woods and fields of Vermont or to ski competitively. I think it is fair to say that just about every cross-country skier in this country, from the fastest racers to the recreational ski tourers like me and Marcelle, owes our love of the sport, directly or indirectly, to Johnny. He got us started. He convinced us to not be deterred by up hills or down hills or subfreezing temperatures and to get outside and enjoy a sport that requires nothing more than a pair of narrow skis and poles, a bit of wax, and a love of using your own power to glide silently over the snow.  Johnny has a way with words, and the Rutland Herald article captures a bit of it. He is dry wit who doesn't suffer fools easily, a fiercely loyal Vermonter who I think it is fair to assume finds a lot to like in the words of Robert Frost, whose poem ``New Hampshire,'' a long poem that compares the people, geography, and traditions of various States, ends with these lines:     ``Well, if I have to choose one or the other,     I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer     With an income in cash of, say, a thousand     (From, say, a publisher in New York City).     It's restful to arrive at a decision,     And restful just to think about New Hampshire.     At present I am living in Vermont.''  There is a lot more I could say about John Caldwell, who besides coaching and writing about skiing, among other things taught mathematics for 35 year at the Putney School, has been a longtime gardener and wood splitter and for years was a tireless maker of maple syrup.  But most important are his personal qualities: a devoted husband to his wife, Hester, affectionately known to everyone as ``Hep,'' who he first met at the Putney School 75 years ago; a role model for his children and grandchildren in good times and sad times; an inspiration to everyone who puts on boots and skis and propels themselves forward in all kinds of weather; and an octogenarian who will be out on skis for years to come, even if it is just to cheer on others a fraction his age, who has contributed in exceptional and lasting ways to the sport of skiing, to the Putney community, to Vermont, and to this country.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Feb. 23, 2014]                Vt. Ski Pioneer Sustains Olympic Spirit                          (By Kevin O'Connor)       John Caldwell, the Vermonter who literally wrote the book      on cross-country skiing 50 years ago--his trailblazing 1964      how-to guide reaped the Boston Globe rave ``the bible of the      sport''--stopped writing updated editions after the eighth a      quarter-century ago. Now 85, he's entitled to sleep in.       But the man considered the father of U.S. Nordic is also      the grandfather of 2014 Olympian Sophie Caldwell, 23, of the      Green Mountain town of Peru. That's why he has risen the past      two weeks before dawn to watch the third generation of his      family compete in the Winter Games.       ``Despite what the governor says, and he's a Putney boy, we      don't have high-speed Internet here,'' says Caldwell, who has      been waking in the town he shares with Peter Shumlin as early      as 4 a.m., then driving to his nephew's ski shop down the      road to watch live online races from Sochi.       So much has changed since Caldwell himself competed in the      1952 Olympics, where a lack of television coverage required      family and friends seeking results to await the newspaper the      next day.       ``That was back in the dark ages,'' he says only half-     jokingly. ``When I was racing, nobody knew much about cross-     country, and people hardly knew we were there. Everything is      much, much better than it used to be. All this ease of      communication has helped.''       Caldwell has helped, too--by turning his lowest point of      adversity into a lifetime of achievement.       Some Vermonters may remember his Oslo Winter Games as the      ones where Rutlander Andrea Mead Lawrence became the only      U.S. woman to win two skiing gold medals. But while the late      female legend experienced the thrill of victory, Caldwell      felt the agony of defeat.       ``I was on the combined team--cross-country and ski      jumping--but I was poorly prepared.''       Born in Detroit in 1928, Caldwell had moved to Putney with      his family in 1941. When his high school needed a cross-     country racer for the 1946 state championships, he strapped      on his sister's wooden alpine skis. Continuing on to      Dartmouth College, he borrowed his coach's slats before the      school bought him a pair.       Caldwell tried out and made the 1952 Olympic team. But      knowing little about proper training, he toured too many      Norwegian bakeries beforehand. The onetime 145-pound athlete      weighed 170 by the time he dressed for his event. But that      wasn't why he needed help buttoning his shirt--his shoulders      ached from falling so often in practice.       The rest is history--just not Olympic history.       ``That really inspired me to help better prepare athletes      so they wouldn't be so flummoxed, overwhelmed and thoroughly      thrashed.''       Caldwell started by coaching at his alma mater, the Putney      School, where he worked with such up-and-coming skiers as      Bill Koch, the first U.S. Nordic athlete to win an Olympic      medal (silver in 1976). That, in turn, led him to help the      American team in a succession of Winter Games.       Off the job, Caldwell befriended Brattleboro publishers      Stephen and Janet Greene.       ``They said, `Are there any books on cross-country?' I said      no.''       Soon there was one--his simply titled ``The Cross-Country      Ski Book''--which he updated until its eighth and final      edition in 1987.       Caldwell also nurtured the sport by helping found the New      England Nordic Ski Association and by forging a family with      his wife, Hep, and their four children: Tim competed in the      Olympics in 1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984. Peter raced undefeated      in college. Jennifer made the U.S. ski team. And Sverre      coached the Americans in 1988 and fathered the latest      generation of family champions, Sophie.       John Caldwell has been waking in the dark the past two      weeks to drive to Putney's Caldwell Sport--owned by his      nephew Zach, who's assisting U.S. skiers in Russia, and wife,      Amy--to watch live Sochi races that, because of the time      difference, have started as early as 4:15 a.m.       ``I'm a Luddite,'' he says, ``but I emailed Sophie before      the sprint and said, `Go fast.' ''       Caldwell then cheered her sixth-place finish (the best U.S.      women's Olympic cross-country result ever) before, a week      later, she ended up eighth in the team sprint.       Seen the way skiers collapse after a race?       ``I joke with them, `Are you suffering?' I spell and say it      `s-u-f-f-a-h.' It sounds masochistic, but that's the way it      is. When you do it you hurt, but you feel great afterward--     like when you stop hitting your head against the wall. All of      us must be nuts, but it's a lifestyle, a culture.''       It's the same for the spectator back home.       ``It takes me a long time to recover from these early      mornings,'' the grandfather says.       Even so, after rising this past Wednesday before dawn,      Caldwell still stayed up for his weekly 7 to 10 p.m. bridge      game. Then on Saturday, he was set to watch grandson Patrick,      a freshman at Dartmouth College, compete in the Eastern      Intercollegiate Ski Association championships in Middlebury.       The grandfather of 10 still takes a turn himself. But the      cross-country pioneer says he's going downhill fast--as an      alpine season pass holder at Stratton.       ``A guy who's 88 and I go over together. It's slow getting      the strength back. I got a new hip in May and two new knees      in October. I have a plastic heart valve and fake shoulder,      too.''       So goes life. So much ``s-u-f-f-a-h-ing.'' So much      satisfaction.       ``I'm bionic--and still plugging along.''                          ____________________
