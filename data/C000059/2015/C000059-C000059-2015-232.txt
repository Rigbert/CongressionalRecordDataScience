We need to improve the condition of our national forests. My home of California, as you know, is going through an exceptional drought. Colorado is just not sending enough water down the Colorado River, so you need to help us out a little bit.  This hazardous fuel issue is a huge issue in my area. As you know, we have the blight issue that is just killing trees because we have too many trees in the forests, and it has weakened the forests.  This is a good amendment, and I certainly urge its adoption.
