President, an amendment that was adopted yesterday which I cosponsored with Senator Dodd and which was also cosponsored by Senators Kerry and Murray, aims to address the travesty that has been going on in Guatemala for as long as most of us can remember.  Guatemala is now the only country in Central America still plagued by civil war. It is winding down, but it continues to claim innocent lives, and it is an excuse for continuing human rights atrocities by the Guatemalan Armed Forces, as well as the URNG guerrillas.  But it is the Guatemalan Armed Forces, and their armed supporters, that are guilty of the majority of these crimes. Their victims are students, nuns, journalists, human rights lawyers, union organizers--anyone who dares speak out about Government corruption or Government-sponsored violence.  The estimate of the number of killed and disappeared ranges from 40-70,000, over the past three decades. In any given week, the toll is staggering. Death threats, disappearances, and extrajudicial executions are routine in human rights reports on Guatemala.  Let me describe some recent incidents. In May of this year, nearly 100 bodies were found with signs of torture--an increase in extrajudicial executions by 40 percent, with 195 violent deaths reported.  In June, a teacher was abducted, 21 judges were threatened with death, a 17-year-old street youth was shot to death by a member of the National Police, several bodies of disappeared persons were found, a union leader was abducted, beaten, and raped, a former judge was attacked for the third time with a bomb, high school student leaders were harassed by armed men--who reportedly tried to abduct them, a Congressman was attacked, and the remains of hundreds of people in mass graves were exhumed.  On June 14, several religious organizations and human rights advocates signed a letter to President Clinton, asking that an independent human rights expert be appointed to undertake a full investigation into human rights violations in Guatemala. On Father's Day, a march was organized for children of disappeared parents. ``The father who took care of us was taken away,'' said one of the children at a press conference. ``He did not come back and we never heard from him again.''  For years, the Congress has passed resolutions, written letters, cut off aid. We have tried to get the Guatemalan Army's attention, to no avail. There has been virtually no progress in bringing to justice those responsible for any of the thousands of human rights abuses.  Jennifer Harbury, a U.S. lawyer, lost her husband 3 years ago and has been searching for him ever since. His name is Efrain Bamaca Velasquez. He was murdered after being tortured. There is evidence that a Guatemalan colonel, paid by the CIA, may have been involved in Bamaca's torture and death, as well as the death of American Michael DeVine.  A Guatemalan officer who was convicted in the DeVine case mysteriously escaped from prison the next day, and has not been seen since. Efrain Bamaca's fate remains unknown, and the Guatemalan army has obstructed justice every step of the way. Despite a court order, they have refused to permit a special prosecutor to excavate where Bamaca's body, and the bodies of many others, are believed to be buried.  Mr. President, I am not going to take the time to repeat the details. I have spoken before about the Harbury case, the DeVine case, about numerous other human rights cases in Guatemala over the years.  Guatemala's President de Leon Carpio is doing his best, and he deserves credit for keeping the peace negotiations moving forward, enabling U.N. human rights monitors to take up residence in Guatemala, supporting democratic elections, and taking some steps to improve human rights. But impunity among the army and civil patrols remains the central problem. There is no justice when a member of the armed forces is involved.  This amendment makes it clear who is the problem. It praises President de Leon Carpio, who deserves our support. But it prohibits any assistance to the armed forces and the URNG, any sales of military equipment, and cuts off visas for any member of the armed forces and URNG who are suspected of involvement in human rights violations, or of covering up such crimes.  These restrictions will end when the President certifies that the Guatemalan armed forces are fully cooperating in solving these crimes, and in carrying out the recommendations of the U.N. monitors.  I am not among those who believes that everyone in the Guatemalan army is corrupt, or guilty of crimes. Far from it. I know some honorable, honest Guatemalan officers who are disgusted by what some of their fellow officers do. I also know that there are honorable members of the URNG who are fighting because for years they were excluded from the political process, but that is changing. This amendment is aimed at the bad apples. It is time for all Guatemalans who believe in respecting human rights, in justice, to stand up for it, and to end the impunity once and for all.                          ____________________
