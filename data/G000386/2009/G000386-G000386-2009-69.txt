 . . health care reform.''  I am highlighting this article because the President is also proposing to take away a portion of a person's tax deduction. The President wants to limit the itemized deductions people making more than $250,000 a year can take. The only difference between the two proposals is the medical expense deduction limitation affects people who make less than $250,000 a year--the same class of people the President promised in the election he was not going to increase taxes on.  So, again, do not take my word for it. Data from the Joint Committee on Taxation tells us that in the year 2013, the largest concentration of taxpayers claiming the medical expense deduction will earn between $50,000 and $75,000--people who never thought they were going to have their taxes increased based upon what the President said during the campaign.  The analysis shows, a good number of taxpayers earning between $75,000 and $200,000 also claim the medical expense deduction.  My friends on the other side of the aisle will argue that their government-subsidized tax credit for health insurance will wipe clean any new taxes for those people below 400 percent of poverty. They will also argue that people purchasing insurance through the new exchange will be protected from catastrophic expenses as a result of annual out-of-pocket limits. For this reason, my friends on the other side argue those middle-class taxpayers will not need to rely on medical expense deductions.  I hate to break it to my colleagues, but the Congressional Budget Office--again, that god of Capitol Hill--estimates that in 2014 only 4 percent of Americans will be purchasing exchange insurance and only 3 percent of Americans will be receiving a tax credit. By 2019, when the Reid bill is in full effect, only 7 percent of Americans with exchange insurance will be receiving the tax credit. That leaves a heck of a lot of people below 400 percent of poverty with higher taxes.  What about those individuals and families above 400 percent of poverty? These people earn income below the President's magic $250,000 level, and somehow they do not qualify for this tax credit. What they do qualify for, though, is a tax increase. After all, there is reason why this proposal raises $15 billion over 10 years, and that is a heck of a lot of money.  Let me now turn to the third car of the tax increase express. This car is the high-cost plan tax. The Congressional Budget Office has consistently cited the two most powerful ways to bend the cost curve downward, meaning the cost curve of health care inflation: No. 1 is to cap the tax preference for employer-provided health coverage or the so-called exclusion; and, secondly, Medicare delivery system reforms.  A recent letter sent to the White House by respected economists also contends that placing a limit on high-cost employer plans would slow health care spending and reduce costs.  Well, some of my colleagues have come out squarely in support of a cap on the exclusion. That was an intellectually honest position. My friends, the chairman of the Budget Committee and the chairman of the Finance Committee, took the intellectually honest position. The Democratic leadership, however, has squarely opposed a cap on the exclusion. They argue that a cap on the exclusion would hurt middle-class workers.  But in a sleight of hand, this bill--this 2,074-page bill--and its authors, the Democratic leadership, came up with a proposal that would tax insurance companies for offering high-cost plans. It is a more complicated way of taxing the same workers. It is a sleight of hand because the Democratic leadership knows the tax will be passed through to the worker.  My friends simply did not want to say they were taxing the workers directly. So they have decided to tax those same workers very indirectly. In the end, the worker would be paying the tax, and these workers would be middle-income workers.  Again, do not take my word for it. The Joint Committee on Taxation testified before our very Senate Finance Committee that the high-cost plan tax would be passed on to whom--the workers.  Joint Committee on Taxation data also indicates that in 2019, 84 percent of the revenue generated from the high-cost plan tax comes from--guess who--individuals and families earning less than $200,000 a year, contrary to the President's promise in the last campaign that these folks would not pay any additional tax.  So whether you agree or disagree with the policy of limiting the tax benefit for employer-provided coverage, middle-class workers would see a tax increase.  Let's go to the fourth car of the tax increase express. This car is going to carry two new tax increases. The first tax increase is on workers who contribute to a flexible spending account, better known as an FSA.  Under the current tax laws, a worker may contribute to an FSA on a pretax basis and use those FSA contributions to pay for copays and deductibles tax free. Currently, there is no limit on how much a worker may contribute to an FSA. This 2,074-page bill, put together by Senator Reid, would limit the contribution amounts to $2,500. Statistics show, the average FSA contribution is $1,800 a year. So this $2,500 limit does not sound that bad, right? Well, I say wrong. A great number of workers who have serious illnesses contribute significantly more than $1,800 and, let me say, more than $2,500.  On average--on average--these workers whom I am talking about with serious health problems earn about $55,000 a year. If I were to connect the dots, I would see a tax increase on workers with serious illnesses who earn $55,000 a year. Well, here is how. These workers would now have to pay taxes on their FSA contributions in excess of $2,500. The Democratic leadership is taxing health benefits for the first time ever--at least this benefit for the first time ever.  The second tax increase in this fourth car is the elimination of the taxfree reimbursement for over-the-counter medicine. Under the current tax rules, payments for over-the-counter medicine may be reimbursed taxfree if a worker is covered under a flexible savings account or under a health savings account. This 2,074-page bill takes away that tax benefit.  The fifth car of the tax increase express is the new Medicare payroll taxes. Since the New Deal, the United States has put into place several social insurance programs. They are part of the social fabric of America. Included in those programs are Social Security, unemployment insurance, and Medicare. They are all founded on the social insurance concepts. As Senator Moynihan, when he represented New York, used to remind us, to ensure their constitutionality, these programs were designed to be financed with payroll taxes instead of insurance premiums. But to maintain the closest appearance possible to social insurance, the payroll tax looks a lot like a premium for insurance.  This analogy is very intentional. It is not accidental. It is bedrock to the sustainability and universality of socialinsurance programs that we all support: Social Security on the one hand, Medicare on the other.  The Reid amendment breaks that precedent, muddies the premium analogy, and could start us on a tax-hike-only journey to dealing with our unsustainable entitlement programs.  Let me explain that. The way the payroll tax works now is that every worker pays in based on his or her salary, wages, or small business income. That is a single, simple, and consistent tax base. Also, one tax rate applies to that payroll tax base. Now, for the first time--for the very first time--an additional second tax rate will apply to the payroll tax base. Also, for the first time in the almost 45-year history of this great social insurance program, we have before us a proposal that creates a marriage penalty in the payroll tax. Now think of the negative comments you get from a marriage penalty from grassroots America. So here we have a proposal that creates such a marriage penalty in the payroll tax. In other words, some married couples will be paying higher payroll taxes due solely to the fact that they are married. A tax on marriage? This is a direct result of this addition to the second tax rate.  Here is another matter that boggles the mind. The second tax rate kicks in if your wages exceed $200,000 if you are single and $250,000 if you are married. These dollar thresholds are not indexed. They are not indexed, so what happens then when you have inflation?  Another tax where the tax base is not indexed is the AMT. That ought to bring back all the horror stories about not indexing something timely when you first pass it. I think every Member of Congress knows that is an annual problem for us. In the late 1990s, commentators called the AMT the tax system's ``ticking timebomb.'' Fortunately, my friend, the chairman, and I started to diffuse this bomb in the 2001 tax legislation. It appears that my friends on the other side of the aisle have created another tax system ticking timebomb problem.  Finally, we have a caboose of this tax increase express. The caboose is the individual mandate penalty tax. It is a tax. It can be called a penalty, but it is a tax. All you have to do is have the IRS collecting it, as it does, and you know it is a tax. President Obama does not want to acknowledge that the penalty for failing to maintain a government-approved health insurance program is a tax, but it is right here in black and white. The Reid bill amends the Tax Code by adding a new excise tax. It is payable by those Americans who do not purchase government-approved health insurance.  I ask unanimous consent to place section 1501 of the Reid amendment in the Record, which adds this new excise tax to our tax laws.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           Subtitle F--Shared Responsibility for Health Care                   PART I--INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY     SEC. 1501. REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM ESSENTIAL                    COVERAGE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) In general.--The individual responsibility requirement      provided for in this section (in this subsection referred to      as the ``requirement'') is commercial and economic in nature,      and substantially affects interstate commerce, as a result of      the effects described in paragraph (2).       (2) Effects on the national economy and interstate      commerce.--The effects described in this paragraph are the      following:       (A) The requirement regulates activity that is commercial      and economic in nature: economic and financial decisions      about how and when health care is paid for, and when health      insurance is purchased.       (B) Health insurance and health care services are a      significant part of the national economy. National health      spending is projected to increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or      17.6 percent of the economy, in 2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in      2019. Private health insurance spending is projected to be      $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical supplies,      drugs, and equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce.      Since most health insurance is sold by national or regional      health insurance companies, health insurance is sold in      interstate commerce and claims payments flow through      interstate commerce.       (C) The requirement, together with the other provisions of      this Act, will add millions of new consumers to the health      insurance market, increasing the supply of, and demand for,      health care services. According to the Congressional Budget      Office, the requirement will increase the number and share of      Americans who are insured.       (D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage by      building upon and strengthening the private employer-based      health insurance system, which covers 176,000,000 Americans      nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar requirement has      strengthened private employer-based coverage: despite the      economic downturn, the number of workers offered employer-     based coverage has actually increased.       (E) Half of all personal bankruptcies are caused in part by      medical expenses. By significantly increasing health      insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the other      provisions of this Act, will improve financial security for      families.       (F) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of      1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act      (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government      has a significant role in regulating health insurance which      is in interstate commerce.       (G) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health      Service Act (as added by section 1201 of this Act), if there      were no requirement, many individuals would wait to purchase      health insurance until they needed care. By significantly      increasing health insurance coverage, the requirement,      together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize      this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk      pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health      insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating      effective health insurance markets in which improved health      insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not      exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold.       (H) Administrative costs for private health insurance,      which were $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of      premiums in the current individual and small group markets.      By significantly increasing health insurance coverage and the      size of purchasing pools, which will increase economies of      scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions of      this Act, will significantly reduce administrative costs and      lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential      to creating effective health insurance markets that do not      require underwriting and eliminate its associated      administrative costs.       (3) Supreme court ruling.--In United States v. South-     Eastern Underwriters Association (322 U.S. 533 (1944)), the      Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance is      interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation.       (b) In General.--Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of      1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new      chapter:        ``CHAPTER 48--MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE``Sec. 5000A.
