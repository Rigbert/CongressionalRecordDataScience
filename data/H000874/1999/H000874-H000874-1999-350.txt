Speaker, I rise today to celebrate with the Saint Maries Optimist Club as they recognize the lives and labors of our local law enforcement community.  Mr. Speaker, It has been said: ``Encouragers need to be encouraged!'' I can think of no greater group today to applaud than our men and women who wear blue everyday to protect our communities and promote peace on a daily basis.  In July 1965, former Optimist International President, Carl Howen, recognizing the need to bridge the gap between police officers and the community, initiated the ``Respect For Law'' program and tonight, the Saint Maries Optimist Club continues to honor those who serve us in law enforcement.  Mr. Speaker, as you well know, it has been reported that every 40 seconds a child is reported missing. According to a study by the U.S. Justice Department, 359,000 are kidnapped every year. These statistics are staggering and although numbers can be misleading we must no longer tolerate adults abducting or abandoning our adolescents! This is just one of the countless stressors that our law enforcement officers and officials have to deal with on a daily basis. The ``Respect For Law'' educates parents and communities of the pitfalls that plague our society (i.e. drugs, theft, arson, violence, battery, rape and murder).  On a positive note, crime in St. Mary's County has decreased 15% since 1998, and much of the credit can be attributed to Lt. Doug Slacum of the Maryland State Police (Leonardtown barracks) and St. Mary's County Sheriff, Richard Voorhaar. I would like to recognize Mr. Tom Slaughter, ``Respect for Law'' chairman and Rich Fry, President of St. Maries Optimist Club and their colleagues whom annually applaud the service and sacrifice of St. Mary's finest! My friend, Ms. Mary Whetstine of Mechanicsville has played a pivotal role as the Lt. Governor for zone 5 and I am pleased by the efforts of our law enforcement team of the Sheriff's Department, State Police and our prosecutors. For the record, the six law enforcement agencies represented this evening are the Maryland State Police, Department of Natural Resources, Sheriff's Department, Department of Corrections, NAS Police Department and St. Mary's College Department of Public Safety.  At this moment, I would like to mention and pay tribute to Deputy Keith Fretwell of the St. Mary's Sheriff's Department who recently passed away in his prime of a brain tumor. I attended Deputy Fretwell's funeral and his commitment to St. Mary's County will be the benchmark for all recruits to follow in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and the remainder of my colleagues to reflect with admiration and appreciation of those who serve and have served in the respective districts of which we are so fortunate to represent in Congress.                          ____________________
