 Mr. Speaker, all too often we take for granted the folks who are prepared to put their own lives and safety at risk to save others from harm's way, not only those of us who work on Capitol Hill, but those who visit their Capitol. So I know that round of applause was heartfelt and deeply meant, and we thank them.  I yield to the majority leader before I ask him a question on the schedule.
