Can you tell him that the Senate didn't adopt the budget? With all due respect, I don't vote in the Senate.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate individuals and their words. I just want to make sure people are held accountable for their actions. Yes, there was an omnibus on the floor, not anything on this side of the aisle wanted.  We passed all 12. We did our job. We did our job just like we promised. Unfortunately, the Senate--and it wasn't the majority over in the Senate, it was the minority--wanted to hold it hostage the same way they did when they wanted to shut down the government.  I think the American public deserves more and deserves better. That is why I think we need to reform the 1974 Budget Act, and I think this floor will see a great debate. I think both sides of the aisle would like to see it reformed. I just hope that the American public will not only hear the words but see the action in the votes to back up what people say.
