 Yesterday, we advanced what will be the 31st circuit court nomination to be confirmed so far during the Trump administration.  As I discussed yesterday, Eric Miller has a distinguished record in both public service and private practice. He holds degrees from Harvard and the University of Chicago, and his legal experience includes holding prestigious clerkships on our Nation's highest courts. Yet, rather than take my word for it, I urge my colleagues to consider the endorsements of those with whom the nominee has studied and worked.  For example, 54 members of the University of Chicago Law School's class of 1999, with their wide-ranging views on politics and judicial philosophy, have offered a ringing endorsement for Eric Miller. In a letter to our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, they cite Mr. Miller's ``diligent work ethic, his keen legal mind, and his deep consideration for every legal issue he confronts.'' All in all, his classmates--many of whom have also been his colleagues over the years--say that Mr. Miller is ``extraordinarily well qualified to serve as a Federal judge.''  I urge each of my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm this fine nominee soon.                          ____________________
