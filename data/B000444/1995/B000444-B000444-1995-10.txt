 President I rise in opposition to this bill, which I feel represents yet another attack on our Nation's resources and our environmental protection laws.  Our greatest legacy to our children and our grandchildren is the world which we leave to them. Simply put, this bill shortchanges future generations of Americans.  I want to commend my colleagues, particularly Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, who have made some progress toward improving this bill.  First, and foremost, I want to acknowledge that the outcry from the taxpayers of this country has been heard: After months of wrangling, this bill finally restores the moratorium on the processing of mining claims, contained in last year's bill.  Without this freeze, gigantic, foreign-owned mining companies would be permitted to purchase Federal land, loaded with gold, silver, and other precious metals, for as little as $2.50, due to an outdated 1872 law still in effect.  Only $2.50 for an acre of land and all the gold underneath it is an outrageous ripoff for the taxpayers of this country.  Though the bill's language will still permit the processing of hundreds of applications which are now pending, this freeze will prevent even more companies from receiving this golden giveaway.  I also support the funding contained in this bill for the North American wetlands conservation fund.  This valuable public-private partnership, has enabled Federal and State wildlife officials, and conservationists in my home State of Delaware, to develop dozens of wetlands and wildlife habitat protection plans. It is cost-effective, matching funds are required, and it deserves our support.  Despite these few bright spots, much in this bill troubles me.  This legislation cuts our efforts to move away from fossil fuels, toward cleaner, renewable fuels, such as solar energy. Energy efficiency standards are also relaxed. The end result: a continuation of our growing dependence on foreign oil.  This conference report also prohibits listing additional species as threatened or endangered and prohibits designating and protecting critical wildlife habitat.  Delaware has 9 animal species, and 16 plant species, which are candidates for Endangered Species Act listing, and I am concerned that this provision will hasten their extinction.  An unsustainable amount of logging will also be permitted in the Tongass National Forest, a great temperate rainforest in southeastern Alaska.  With Christmas fast approaching I can understand a certain amount of sentiment for expedited logging. But we are not talking about a few Christmas trees here.  Under this bill, up to 418 million board feet of timber will be sold in 1996 and 1997--an allowable logging level which is 44 percent higher than the cutting average over the previous 10 years. This plan is locked in, and no changes are permitted.  The conference report also contains a legislative rider which allows the construction of a telescope on Mt. Graham, near Tucson, AZ, despite the fact that this development will likely harm an endangered species.  Putting the merits of the proposal aside, an appropriations bill is not the right location for reforming the Endangered Species Act.  Lastly, this bill expands the number of recreational activities permitted in the new Mojave preserve in California. If you plan to go hiking in the Mojave this summer, be forewarned, the Park Service may be forced to open this wilderness to motorized vehicles and aircraft.  In sum, Mr. President, this bill falls far short of adequately protecting our natural resources. Under this legislation, our dependency on foreign oil grows, endangered species are threatened, our environmental laws are disregarded, and Americans are left poorer.  President Clinton has announced his intention to veto this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.                          ____________________
