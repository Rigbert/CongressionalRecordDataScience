 I refer, for example, to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and I will quote from it and then put the whole editorial in the Record.  I ask unanimous consent that articles in opposition to her be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Sept. 4, 2002]                            The Wrong Judge       Priscilla Owen, President Bush's latest nominee to the      United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, has      been at times so eager to issue conservative rulings in cases      before her on the Texas Supreme Court that she has ignored      statutory language and substituted her own views. This      criticism comes not from the ``special interest groups'' she      has charged with misstating her record, but from Alberto      Gonzales, President Bush's own White House counsel. Mr.      Gonzales, who served with Justice Owen on the Texas high      court, once lambasted her dissent in an abortion case for      engaging in ``unconscionable . . . judicial activism.'' Mr.      Gonzales says today that he nonetheless supports the      elevation of Justice Owen. We do not.       In choosing a nominee for the Fifth Circuit--the powerful      federal appeals court for Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana--     President Bush has looked to the extreme right wing of the      legal profession. Even on Texas' conservative Supreme Court,      Justice Owen has distinguished herself as one of the most      conservative members. A former lawyer for the oil and gas      industry, she reflexively favors manufacturers over      consumers, employers over workers and insurers over sick      people. In abortion cases Justice Owen has been resourceful      about finding reasons that, despite United States Supreme      Court holdings and Texas case law, women should be denied the      right to choose.       Justice Owen's views are so far from the mainstream that,      on those grounds alone, the Senate should be reluctant to      confirm her. But what is particularly disturbing about her      approach to judging is, as Mr. Gonzales has identified, her      willingness to ignore that text and intent of laws that stand      in her way. In an important age discrimination case, Justice      Owen dissented to argue that the plaintiff should have to      meet a higher standard than Texas law requires.       Justice Owen has also shown a disturbing lack of      sensitivity to judicial ethics. She has raised large amounts      of campaign contributions from corporations and law firms,      and     then declined to recuse herself when those contributors have      had cases before her. And as a judicial candidate, she      publicly endorsed a pro-business political action committee      that was raising money to influence the rulings of the Texas      Supreme Court.       After the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Judge Charles      Pickering, another far-right choice, for a seat on the Fifth      Circuit earlier this year, the Bush administration declared      that it would not be intimidated into choosing more centrist      nominees. Sadly, the administration has lived up to its      threat. In this dispute the Senate is right: the      administration should stop trying to use the judiciary to      advance a political agenda that is out of step with the views      of most Americans.       Justice Owen is a choice that makes sense for Justice      Department ideologues who want to turn the courts into a      champion of big business, insurance companies and the      religious right. But the American people deserve better.      Justice Owen's nomination should be rejected.                                  ____              [From the Los Angeles Times, July 23, 2002]                        Ideologues All in a Row       Last year President Bush eliminated the American Bar Assn.      from the process of vetting potential judicial nominees, a      role it performed ably and in a nonpartisan way for the nine      presidents before him. Now he relies on the ideological tests      of the very conservative Federalist Society.       Not surprisingly, the men and women who pass this rigid      test look remarkably alike on the bench. They often side with      business in disputes involving employee rights, consumers and      the environment. They strongly oppose abortion, and their      opinions reveal a strong streak of judicial activism dressed      up as traditional principle.       Priscilla Owen is among them. A protege of Bush confident      Karl Rove, who engineered her 1994 election to the Texas      Supreme Court, Owen is a nominee to a seat on the U.S. 5th      Circuit Court of Appeals. She comes before the Senate      Judiciary Committee today to defend a record of indifference      to the problems of most Americans.       Senators should ask her why, for example, she voted to      reverse a jury verdict in favor of a woman who had sued her      health insurance company for refusing necessary surgery to      remove her spleen and gallbladder. Her colleague on the Texas      high court, Alberto Gonzales, now Bush's top legal advisor,      dissented, writing that Owen's decision turned the legal      standard in that case ``on its head.''       Gonzales, a solid conservative himself, also took issue      with Owen in an abortion case that should draw tough      questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chairwoman      of today's hearing. Texas law allows pregnant teenagers in      some instances to seek permission from a judge to have an      abortion without their parents' consent. Owen has staunchly      opposed such ``judicial bypasses.'' In one case, Gonzales,      wrote, Owen's opinion would have ``create[d] hurdles that      simply are not found in the . . . statute'' and would be ``an      unconscionable act of judicial activism.'' in other cases,      her colleagues have accused her of ``inflammatory rhetoric.''       For all this, Owen's nomination puts Feinstein in a tough      spot. She was chairwoman last March when the Judiciary      Committee rejected Charles Pickering, another Bush pick for      the 5th Circuit. She is anxious to avoid being labeled      obstructionist. But given her repeated calls for mainstream      nominees, not to mention her long support for abortion      rights, Feinstein should vote no, and so should her      colleagues.       Although it is now one of the most conservative appellate      federal courts, the 5th Circuit has a long and honorable      history--defending civil rights during the 1960s and the      rights of asbestos workers, systematically deceived and      injured by their employers, in the 1970s. Owen would add      nothing positive to that legacy.       Americans want independent, common-sensical and capable      judges, not those whose political ideology--from either      direction--wins them a nomination. As long as Bush continues      to exclude the American Bar Assn. from the nomination      process, he should not be surprised that his choices draw      fire.                                  ____           [From the San Antonio Express-News, July 21, 2002]                  Bush Court Choice Should Be Rejected       Once competency is established, the most important      qualification for a judge is commitment to following the law      as it is written--regardless of personal philosophy.       Justice Priscilla Owen is clearly competent, but her record      demonstrates a results-oriented streak that belies      supporters' claims that she strictly follows the law.       Because of Owen's record as a member of the Texas Supreme      Court, the Senate Judiciary Committee should reject her      nomination to sit on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.       Her most infamous opinions involve cases in which minors      were seeking a legal bypass allowing them to get an abortion      without parental consent.       In those cases, she consistently landed in a small court      minority that opposes such bypasses, while a majority of her      fellow judges on an all-Republican court upheld the law as      legislators wrote it.       Former Justice Al Gonzales clearly pointed that out. In an      opinion that countered a dissent she supported, he wrote:      ``To construe the Parental Notification Act so narrowly as to      eliminate bypasses, or to create hurdles that simply are not      to be found in the words of the statute, would be an      unconscionable act of judicial activism.''       Now serving as President Bush's White House counsel,      Gonzales is defending his former state court colleague.      However, opinions she wrote in the parental consent cases      show a clear line between strict constructionist judges and      activists.       Owen, who remains on the state's high court, is an      activist.       In recent years, judicial nomination struggles on Capitol      Hill have become a game, played by both parties, or petty      obstructionism.       The Senate should not block a judicial nominee simply      because he or she is more conservative or more liberal than      the Senate's majority party.       It also should not engage in petty personal attacks. But      concerns about Owen go to the heart of what makes a good      judge.       When a nominee has demonstrated a propensity to spin the      law to fit philosophical beliefs, it is the Senate's right--     and duty--to reject that nominee.       A hearing on Owen's nomination is set for this week.       Although Owen should be rejected for a lifetime      appointment, the Democrat-controlled Senate should have given      her a hearing long ago. Bush nominated Owen on May 9, 2001.       Owen and the president were owed better treatment. Even      nominees who are destined for rejection deserve timely      consideration, and the Democrats should pick up the pace in      considering Bush's judicial picks.       During his years as Texas governor, Bush did a masterful      job of selecting quality, moderate judges. But his decision      to nominate Owen is a disappointment.       We urge Bush to take more care in future nominations and      return to his previous policy of nominating judges who      believe in the law more than any ideological agenda.                                  ____           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, July 23, 2002]                      Feinstein's Decisive Moment       Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., faces a momentous      decision. Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold      hearings on Priscilla Owen, the president's candidate for a      lifetime appointment to the United States Court of Appeals      for the Fifth Circuit. With the committee divided along party      lines, Feinstein could cast the decisive vote.       When George W. Bush became president, he excoriated      judicial activism and vowed to nominate justices who      interpret the law, instead of trying to rewrite it.       Priscilla Owen simply does not satisfy the president's own      criteria for this position. According to a report issued by      People For the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, Owen      has demonstrated a disturbing pattern of overruling the law      when it clashes with her conservative ideology.       In one case, for example, Owen's dissenting decision would      have effectively rewritten a key Texas civil rights law by      making it more difficult for employees to prove      discrimination. Her colleagues on the bench--mostly Bush      appointees--wrote that her ruling ``defies the Legislature's      clear and express limits on our jurisdiction.''       With respect to reproductive rights, Owen advocated a far      more restrictive interpretation of the Texas law that allows      a minor to obtain an abortion without parental notification.      Her dissent prompted then-Justice Alberto Gonzales, now the      White House counsel, to write that her opinion constituted      ``an unconscionable act of judicial activism.'' Gonzales,      naturally, now expresses the White House party line, hailing      Owen's integrity and ability. ``I'm confident she will follow      the law as defined by the Supreme Court,'' Gonzales was      quoted as saying in the San Antonio Express-News.       But close observers of her Texas record are less confident      of her objectivity. Danielle Tierney, a Planned Parenthood      spokeswoman from Texas, said Owen has ``a record of active      opposition to reproductive and women's rights.''       Owen has also tried to finesse laws that protect public      information rights, the environment, and jury findings.       The point is, Owen has created a strong record of      ``rewriting'' the law when it does not match her conservative      convictions.       This is why it is vital that Feinstein reject this      nomination.                                  ____             [From the Dallas Morning News, July 16, 2002]            Justice Owen: Perpetrator or Victim of Politics?         her activism has been extreme, even by texas standards                          (By Craig McDonald)       Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, who faces a      Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday on her nomination      to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, flunks the stated      judicial criteria of both President Bush and the Democratic      chairman of the Judiciary Committee.       Although the president nominated Justice Owen, she flunks      his own pledge to appoint ``strict constructionists'' who      narrowly interpret laws rather than write opinions promoting      a political agenda. ``I want people on the bench who don't      try to use their position to legislate from the bench,'' Mr.      Bush has said. Yet Justice Owen's record on the Texas Supreme      Court is one of a judicial activist who seeks to make laws      from the bench.       Justice Owen also flunks the criteria of Senate Judiciary      Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, who has pledged to stop any      ``ideological court packing.'' Justice Owen's record has      established her as an ideological extremist out of the      mainstream--even on the all-conservative Texas Supreme Court.       Justice Owen's extreme opinions have mobilized a large      coalition of Texas organizations working to stop her      appointment. The groups fighting her nomination range from      the Texas chapter of the American Association of University      Women to the Women's Health and Family Planning Association.      They include the AFL-CIO, the National Association for the      Advancement of Colored People, Planned Parenthood, the Texas      Civil Rights Project, the Texas Abortion Rights Action League      and others.       While each of those organizations has its own reasons for      opposing Justice Owen, my group--Texas for Public Justice--is      particularly troubled by the fact that she has amassed a body      of rulings that advance the agendas of the special interests      that bankrolled her judicial campaigns. Thirty-seven percent      of the $1.4 million that Justice Owen raised for her Supreme      Court campaigns came from donors with a direct stake in case      in her court.       Letting special interests bankroll judicial campaigns has      shattered public confidence in Texas courts. A 1999 Texas      Supreme Court poll found that 83 percent of Texans, 79      percent of Texas lawyers and 48 percent of Texas judges say      campaign contributions significantly influence judicial      decisions. Commenting on the poll, U.S. Supreme Court Justice      Anthony Kennedy said, ``The law commands allegiance only if      it commands respect. It commands respect only if the public      thinks judges are neutral.''       Since Justice Owen joined the high court in 1995, she has      written and joined a slew of opinions that favor businesses      over consumers, defendants over plaintiffs and judges over      lawmakers and juries. A 1999 study by Austin-based Court      Watch found that individuals won just 36 present of their      cases during Justice Owen's tenure, compared to a win rate of      66 percent for businesses, 70 percent for insurers and 86      percent for medical interests.       While all nine Texas Supreme Court justices are pro-     business conservatives, Justice Owen and Nathan Hecht became      an isolated bloc of extremist dissent about 1998.      Masquerading as ``strict constructionists,'' Justices Owen      and Hecht have promoted the interests of big business and the      far right with much less restraint than their fellow Texas      justices. That ultraconservative activism is all the more      disturbing, given that it mirrors the agenda of the top      donors to their judicial war chests.       In making lifetime appointments to federal appeals courts,      the president and the Senate can--and should--do better.      Justice Owen lacks criminal trial experience, has taken more      than $500,000 in judicial contributions from interests with      cases in her court and has produced a body of activist      opinions that are extremist--even by Texas standards.                                  ____           [From the San Antonio Express-News, July 21, 2002]     Judge Owens Flunks Bush's Own ``Strict Constructionists'' Test                        (By Jan Jarboe Russell)       In a perfect world, there wouldn't be ``liberal'' judges or      ``conservative'' judges, there would just be good judges.      After all, if you ask ordinary people what they want in a      federal judge, what they want are judges who are fair,      learned and impartial, judges who have the ability to lay      aside their own political views and do their public duty.       Why then is it so darn hard to find these kind of plain-     and-simple judges? The answer, of course, is the dreaded P      word; politics. The ongoing battle in the Senate Judiciary      Committee over the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the 5th      U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is a perfect example of how      politics is making a certifiable mess of America's judicial      system.       In seven years on the Texas Supreme Court, the only way      moderate-thinking people in Texas survived Owen's relentless      ultra-conservative dissents was to toughen our stomachs and      take her many efforts to rewrite our state laws one day at a      time. This is a woman who has consistently ruled against      consumers, has routinely overturned decisions of juries, has      curtailed access to public records, and by anyone's measure      is an avid anti-abortion ideologue.       Mind you: the Texas Supreme Court is no bastion of      liberalism. The nine members of the court are 100 percent      pedigree Republican, but Owen was such a right-wing activist      she managed to earn the nickname ``Justice Enron'' for      accepting $8,600 in Enron campaign funds in one year--$1,000      of it from Kenneth Lay himself--and turning around the next      and writing an opinion that saved Enron $225,000 in school      taxes.       As one of only nine states in the nation with the sorry      system of electing our judges with expensive campaigns paid      for by the very lawyers and businesses that come before these      judges for justice, Texas gets exactly the kind of justice we      deserve. In the case just mentioned, for example, Enron paid      for the privilege of robbing the public school children of      Spring, a Houston suburb, of their rightful share of taxes.       I don't expect President Bush to nominate judges to the      federal bench with whom I agree politically. But I do expect      Bush to nominate people to lifetime positions on the federal      bench who meet Bush's own standards of ``strict      constructionists,'' judges who will interpret rather than      write the law. Owen fails the Bush test.       In no less than a dozen cases in which the Texas Supreme      Court was asked to allow a pregnant teenager to bypass the      state's parental notification requirement and have an      abortion, Owen voted every time to deny the bypass and      created hurdles that were not written in the state's law. In      one case, when lawyers for a high school senior requested      that the court act quickly on the girl's request for      permission to bypass the notification requirement, Owen wrote      a dissent that asked: ``Why then the rush to judgment?'' The      girl was in the 15th week of pregnancy at the time.       Owen's rulings in these abortion notification cases were so      strident that Alberto Gonzales, now Bush's White House      counsel but then a member of the Texas Supreme Court, wrote      in a majority opinion that Owen and two other dissenting      justices were thwarting the clear intent of the law. To      accept their reasoning, he wrote, ``would be an      unconscionable act of judicial activism.''       Gonzales finds himself in the role of reluctant cheerleader      for Owen. In a telephone interview from his office in the      West Wing the other day, Gonzales claimed that he never      accused Owen of judicial activism and believes she would be      an excellent judge. His opinion has written in black-and-     white only two years ago--he clearly called her dissent an      ``unconscionable act of judicial activism''--but maybe in his      struggle to find the gray, Gonzales meant that he thought all      of three of the judges were unconscionable. Who knows?      Politics makes people parse words very carefully.       Owen's political credentials are indeed impressive. She is      a protege of Karl Rove, the president's political adviser,      and it is Rove who is pushing her judicial nomination. But      politics should not be the primary measure of a judge's      ability to administer justice.       As much as it pains me to say it, Justice Enron should stay      put in Texas.                                  ____              [From the Houston Chronicle, July 31, 2002]                  DiFi, Owen Would Be Very Odd Couple                            (By Cragg Hines)       Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a wonderfully calm, cool      Californian, loves to be the swing vote. It increases the      sense that she is unbought and unbossed, and it makes her      political currency slightly more valuable than that of      colleagues who fall predictably one way or another on an      issue.       Part of this is political tromp l'oeil, an illusion so      strong that it's difficult to tell it's not genuine. For,      when the roll is called, only rarely is Feinstein not      reliably found where she sought to be--in her regular center-     left Democratic pew.       Which brings us to the nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen      of the Texas Supreme Court to be a judge on the 5th U.S.      Circuit Court of Appeals, a place where the conservative      judicial activist, corporate suck-up and made member (blood      oath?) of the Federalist Society has no earthly place being.       Feinstein ran last week's hearing by the Senate Judiciary      Committee on Owen's nomination and said she was ``keeping an      open mind'' regarding President Bush's determination to give      Owen lifetime employment. (For the forgetful: Bush and Owen      both got their start in statewide politics as clients of the      White House political high priest, Karl Rove.)       Feinstein's self-advertised ``open mind'' is about the only      hope for supporters of Owen. The Judiciary Committee's nine      Republicans need one of the panel's 10 Democrats to vote with      them to get the nomination to the floor.       If the nomination is not cleared by the committee, it's      dead. None of this sending it to the floor without a      recommendation in a Senate with a one-vote Democratic margin      and run by Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.       (Owen opponents would still like to hear something      definitive from two other Demoracts--Sen. Joseph R. Biden,      Jr. of Delaware, who did not show up for last week's hearing,      and the enigmatic gentleman from Wisconsin, Sen. Russell D.      Feingold--but the focus is on Feinstein.)       Owen's opponents believe that Feinstein will eventually      vote against the Texas jurist, but they cannot be absolutely      certain. Feinstein is not about to help them divine the      oracle at the moment.       ``I've been giving it a great deal of thought,'' Feinstein      said this week as the Senate headed toward summer recess.      ``I'm not going to let my decision be known, but at an      appropriate time, I will.       ``What I've said, and I've taken this position, I think,      rather scrupulously, is that I don't make up my mind until      after the hearing.''       There was little in the hearing that should lead Feinstein,      or any senator, to believe that Owen is anything but the very      bright, very ideological, very driven hard-right jurist      revealed in her work over the last seven years on Texas'      highest civil court.       Finally, Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill, asked Owen directly      about her position on abortion.       ``My position is that Roe v. Wade has been the law of the      land for many, many years . . . ,'' Owen said, noting that      decision had been modified (and made more restrictive by      subsequent rulings). ``None of my personal beliefs would get      in the way of me applying that law or any other law.''       But Owen's record, in a series of recent abortion-related      cases, suggests otherwise. In all but one of the cases, Owen      sought to tweak and torture the Texas law to something not      intended by the Legislature.       Feinstein was listening to all of this and, one assumes,      took it on board. In case she didn't, an editorial in The Los      Angeles Times the morning of the hearing should have helped:      The work of Owen and similarly situated conservative jurists      ``reveal(s) a strong streak of judicial activism dressed up      as traditional principle.''       The home state newspaper parsed Feinstein's situation: She      also chaired the hearings earlier this year in which the      Judiciary Committee rejected Bush's nomination of Charles      Pickering of Mississippi for a seat on the 5th Circuit Court.       ``She is anxious to avoid being labeled obstructionist,''      The Times said of Feinstein. ``But given the repeated calls      for mainstream nominees, not to mention her long support of      abortion rights, Feinstein should vote no, and so should her      colleagues.'' Feinstein said she weighs such opinion but that      it is not dispositive.       One piece of baggage Feinstein would like to discard in the      Owen matter is that her vote will have anything to do with a      business relationship that the senator's husband, Richard C.      Blum, has with Dr. James Leininger of San Antonio, a generous      supporter of Owen's judicial campaign.       ``I've never met (Leininger), talked with him, seen him,      heard from him--and that's that,'' Feinstein said. Nor, she      said, ``have I ever talked to my husband about this, nor has      he ever talked to me about it.''       So Feinstein should be able to vote against Owen with a      clear conscience.
