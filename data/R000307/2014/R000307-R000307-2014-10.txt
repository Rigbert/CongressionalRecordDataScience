President, I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding. I thank Senator Hoeven for his leadership on this issue and for bringing this issue to the attention of all Members, more especially those of us in our conference, but this should be a bipartisan effort.  I rise today to join my colleagues in discussing yet another--yet another--job-stifling and unjustified regulation proposed by this administration.
