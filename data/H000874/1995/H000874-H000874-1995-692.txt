Speaker, as a member of the Fire Services caucus, I am proud to introduce the Fire Safety Education Act.  Every 113 minutes, this Nation incurs a civilian fire death. Every 17 minutes, this Nation incurs a civilian fire death. Every 17 minutes, this Nation incurs a civilian fire injury. On average each year, we lose about 6,000 lives, experience 29,000 civilian injuries and incur several billion dollars in property losses. These are bone-chilling statistics which should concern all of us. I believe, in many instances, these fire-related losses probably could have been avoided had the individuals affected received proper fire safety education. All too often, we all read stories in the paper about innocent children burning to death in a home without a smoke alarm or about the senseless death of fires started by children playing with matches or adults not adequately putting out cigarettes. I have introduced the Fire Safety Education Act to help avoid these types of occurrences in the future.  This legislation will create a grant program through the U.S. Fire Administration for State and local fire prevention efforts. Half of the grant money in the bill is designated for established fire prevention programs which have demonstrated success. The bill will encourage communities to continue their fire prevention programs by offering Federal assistance if they do so.  In addition to encouraging fire prevention grants, the Fire Safety Education Act also seeks to improve our country's collection and analysis of fire data. The bill also sets recording requirements so that we can be sure Federal and local resources are being used efficiently.  It is extremely important that we provide resources to help combat our Nation's fire problem. This bill serves as a preventive measure which will move us a step closer to achieving our goal of preventing senseless loss of life and property.                          ____________________
