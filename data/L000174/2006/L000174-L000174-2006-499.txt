President, I have spoken several times in the course of this debate about my belief that immigrants should learn the English language. In my experience, most new Americans want to learn our language and make efforts to do so as quickly as possible. The bill that we are debating calls for immigrants to learn English as one of the several steps they must take before they can earn citizenship.  We can all agree that English should be the common language of the United States, but by making English the ``national'' language, the Inhofe amendment goes too far. The amendment was modified to remove a ban on publishing official documents in any language but English. That was a good correction. In many local communities and States it may well be useful and helpful for the government to reach out to language minorities. Greater participation and information are good and appropriate steps communities should be striving for. We should not be mandating artificial and shortsighted restrictions on State and local government.  I regret, however, that the amendment continues to include language that strongly discourages the use of other languages to inform residents and continues to treat those who speak another language as second-class citizens. We would do better to recognize our diversity and provide greater opportunities to those for whom English is a second language to become more fluent.  My mother spoke Italian as a child and learned English when she went to school. My wife grew up in a family that spoke French. She began speaking English when she started going to school. Both were helped throughout their lives by being completely and totally bilingual as a result.
