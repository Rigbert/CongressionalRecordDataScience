I look forward to working with him on this to accommodate those Members on the west coast in particular.  There is a change in the announced schedule with regard to first votes, as we have discussed, and I appreciate your responding to that.  With respect to the Labor-Health bill, it was our expectation that the Labor-Health-Education appropriations bill, which was reported out of committee this week, would be on the floor this coming week. As you know, that included within it a bipartisan-approved increase in the minimum wage, by $2.10, to $7.25 over the next 30 months. I notice that that bill is not on the schedule for next week. Can you tell me the status of the Health and Human Services appropriations bill?  I yield to my friend.
