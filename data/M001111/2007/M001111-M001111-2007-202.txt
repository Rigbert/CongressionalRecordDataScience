 President, I ask if we could set up a time agreement on this amendment so Members know when the vote is going to occur tonight. I ask unanimous consent for 60 minutes of debate prior to the vote; that no second-degree amendment be in order to the amendment prior to the vote; that the time be equally divided and controlled in the usual form; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to this amendment.
