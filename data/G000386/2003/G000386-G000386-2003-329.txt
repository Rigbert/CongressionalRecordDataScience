m., Tuesday, June 24. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time of the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume consideration of S. 1, the prescription drugs benefit bill.  I further ask consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party lunches.
