 President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that motion on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.                           amendment no. 3507  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past two years, the Subcommittee has held hearings which have focused on corruption, fraud and financial management problems at the international financial institutions. The interest was stimulated in part by flagrant abuses which compromised the World Bank's program in Indonesia. The Bank's Country Director ignored internal reports detailing program kickbacks, skimming and fraud because he was unwilling to upset the Suharto family and their cronies whom he believed were responsible for Indonesia's economic boom. A change of government and country directors presented an opportunity to set a new course for management and lending policies.  Because of these problems, I asked GAO to conduct a review of the Bank's management with an emphasis on anti-corruption policies and programs in several of the largest borrowing countries, including Indonesia, Russia, and Brazil. While the Bank limited GAO's access to documents, and set up a special committee to supervise their work, they still did an excellent job.  In brief, the GAO concluded the Bank has launched an ambitious effort to identify problems, but significant challenges lie ahead. We are a long way from real solutions.  Let me tick off some of the conclusions which concerned me the most--  First, although the World Bank has established an Investigations Unit which answers to a new Fraud and Oversight Committee, many local problems in borrowing countries never reach the investigators. In one country where the Bank itself identified corruption as a serious problem, 30 allegations of abuse reported to their local officials had not been referred on to the Investigations Unit or Committee.  Second, both the Investigations Unit and the Committee answer to one of the Bank's Managing Directors. GAO concluded that the independence of investigations could be compromised by the fact that a Managing Director controls the unit's budgets and makes final decisions on whether an investigation is pursued, including those that may involve employees who answer to the Director.  Third, new initiatives introduced in 1998 to improve financial and procurement procedures only apply to 14% of the Banks 1,500 projects. In recent audits, 17 of 25 borrowers showed a lack of understanding or noncompliance with procurement rules. GAO's review of 12 randomly selected projects identified 5 projects where the borrowing countries implementing agencies had little or no experience managing projects.  Fourth, when making project recommendations for Board approval, the staff's risk analysis fails to adequately address corruption or undue political influence as key factors. Eight of Twelve projects reviewed did not identify corruption or political manipulation as a critical risk even though other Bank reports indicated both were serious issues in the countries included in the project sampling.  Finally, GAO determined that solving problems is made more difficult because audits are often late and of poor quality, and the Bank does not evaluate the quality of audits.  To remedy these problems, GAO recommends the Bank integrate the investigative function and establish its organizational independence, include more complete corruption data in risk assessments and country strategies, develop a system for allocating anti-corruption assistance, improve borrowing countries' capabilities to monitor, implement and supervise fraud free projects, and improve auditing and project supervision.  These problems are not unique to the World Bank. We have all read the stories about the IMF being caught by surprise in both Russia and Ukraine regarding manipulation of loans and loan data. I am sure there are similar problems in the regional institutions as well.  To accelerate a solution to these pressing issues, Senator Leahy and I felt it was prudent for the Secretary of the Treasury to encourage these institutions to implement GAO's recommendations. The amendment before the Senate requires the Secretary to withhold 10% of our contribution to each institution until audits are in place, independent investigation units are established, and the problem of corruption is being addressed in risk assessments. We also expect the institutions to strengthen local government capacity so that lending and projects are better supervised to prevent corruption.  This amendment addresses one of the most fundamental issues which has compromised support for the multilateral banks. Bringing more transparency to lending and improving procurement and management procedures will help restore confidence and support to the banks.                           amendment no. 3511
