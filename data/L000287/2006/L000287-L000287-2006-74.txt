Mr. Speaker, I rise in vehement opposition to the proposed elimination of National Youth Sports Program (NYSP) funding, contained in the President's Budget Request, for the second year in a row. I am concerned that some of my colleagues may not understand the severity of the situation that NYSP is facing. If Congress does not provide full FY07 funding for NYSP, the program will be forced to close its doors. This will result in 75,000 of our nation's most vulnerable youth, being left behind next summer.  NYSP uses sports instruction and competition, as a vehicle to enhance self-esteem and respect, among boys and girls from low-income households. Established in 1969, with a $3 million funding commitment from the White House, NYSP has provided over 2 million participants with instruction in career and educational opportunities, and exposure to the college environment for nearly four decades.  Because I have witnessed, firsthand, the difference that the NYSP program has made in the lives of under served youth in my Congressional District I cannot, in good conscience, sit idly by as this essential program is dismantled. In my Congressional District, Morehouse College has done an outstanding job of running the NYSP program for nearly four decades, serving over 10,000 children throughout Atlanta. The Morehouse College NYSP program is unique, because it has taken great pains to maintain a balance between athletics and academics. Similar to NYSP programs throughout the nation, Morehouse College offers instruction focusing on sports. However, it also includes additional instruction in areas such as: nutrition, drug awareness and prevention, creative writing, and leadership development.  The NYSP program has a tremendous impact on the youth that it serves in my Congressional District. By placing NYSP participants in academic settings, where they receive hundreds of hours of exposure to the benefits of higher education, the participants begin to believe that they, too, can succeed in college and beyond. Furthermore, the mentoring relationships established between the teaching/coaching staff, college student volunteers, and NYSP participants, have resulted in hundreds of former NYSP participants returning to work in the program at Morehouse College as student volunteers.  Mr. Speaker, NYSP is not asking for a handout from Congress. In fact, in 2005 NYSP secured two-thirds of its operating expenses from other public and private sources, such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the 202 selected institutions of higher education with which it partners. The Administration knows that NYSP works. Congress knows that NYSP works. Institutions of higher learning in 47 states and the District of Columbia know that NYSP works. Most important, over 2 million NYSP participants, and their families, know that it works.  I strongly encourage all of my colleagues, especially those serving on the budget and appropriations committees, to reject the President's proposed elimination of the NYSP program, and provide full funding for FY07.                          ____________________
