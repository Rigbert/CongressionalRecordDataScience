 Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio].  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  One listening to this debate would think that there is not one penny that can be cut from the Pentagon budget without hurting our preparedness, or ignoring the needs of our enlisted families or the working people of America. This cut would total $13.4 billion. That is a lot of money.  However, the Pentagon has $14.6 billion in unneeded inventory that exceeds the war needs of the United States for more than 100 years, and they still have a computer over there placing more orders. Not a penny. This 1 year's cut could be absorbed by their unneeded inventory.  We heard we would have a gap between our strategy and the military program. Well, the strategy is absurd. We are going to fight two wars at once with no allies. Two World War II's at once with no allies. Our budget is two times the total of all our enemies combined. And they are saying we cannot depend on our allies, so we have to be able to fight two wars at once. If we cannot depend on our allies, why are we spending billions of dollars to expand NATO to former Soviet bloc countries.  At one time in my life, we had a great warrior in the White House, and this warrior said it better than anybody else will say it here today. Dwight David Eisenhower. ``This world in arms, it is not spending money alone, it is spending the sweat of our labors, the genius of our scientists, the hopes of our children.''  That is what this debate is all about. Every gun made, every warship launched, every rocket fired is, in a final sense, a theft from those who hunger, those who are not fed, and those who are cold and not clothed. That was a great warrior, Dwight David Eisenhower, a general who led us to victory in World War II. If he were here today, he would urge Members to support these justified cuts in the bloated Pentagon budget.
