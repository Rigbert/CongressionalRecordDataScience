. General Accounting Office. We asked for an audit of the Office of Support Aircraft of the Department of Defense, and what we received in this audit is shocking. The Department of Defense, which is required to keep administrative aircraft adequate to meet the wartime needs of the United States of America, made use of 48 such aircraft during the Persian Gulf war, maintains over 500 aircraft, 10 times what they used at the height of the Persian Gulf war and, last year they spent $378 million on these support aircraft.  There are some notable problems with their use of these aircraft. There is no centralized control. Each and every service determines who and when people will be eligible to use these aircraft. Frequently, one-star generals and lower-ranking civilian officials from the Department of Defense, instead of using their chauffeurs and their automobiles, their limousines and their drivers, to go to Andrews Air Force Base to catch a jet, opt to take a helicopter at the cost of $1,400 to $1,600 an hour. According to the GAO, they save between 5 and 15 minutes instead of spending $30 on a cab. They spend $400 to $1,600 to operate a helicopter. I think it is more for their ego than it is for any support purposes, and that is what the General Accounting Office has found.  We also have the fact that we are providing now for the commander in Korea, C-U-S-F-K, as he is called, a four-star general, we are going to provide him with a luxury pallet. That is something which can be inserted into a jet aircraft as this general is required, often, to come back to Washington, DC, to receive orders, and the current $350,000 luxury pallets--I think that most Americans would like to live in a $350,000 house, but this general does not think that a $350,000 luxury pallet is adequate to put in an airplane so he can fly back in comfort to Washington, DC. No, he needs a $750,000 pallet so that this general can fly back and forth to Washington, DC, in extraordinary luxury at probably seven times the average median price of houses for most Members of Congress, $750,000 for a luxury pallet for one general.                              {time}  1645  It is time that the generals in the Pentagon and the civilians in the Pentagon entered into the real world, the world of limitations, the world where you do not go first class-plus when you are not on an urgent mission. And the GAO identifies that most of these missions were not urgent missions.  In fact, they also find that not only are these aircraft used to transport generals, as I said, every one-star general in the Pentagon can take a helicopter and then get a private jet any time they want. They do not have to justify it or compare it to commercial rates. They do not even have to compare it to first class rates with a chauffeur-driven limousine. They can just do it, because it is there. And there are no controls.  We not only use it indiscriminately for Pentagon brass and for officials at the Pentagon, we are carting around the cadets at our academies to football games and swim meets. We had one football game in Hawaii. The Air Force played the University of Hawaii. The taxpayers of the United States of America spent $270,000 to transport Air Force cadets to the University of Hawaii football game. Now, is that not wonderful?  My hometown university, the University of Oregon, went to the Rose Bowl this year, something that only happened once in the last quarter of a century. It is our second time. Nobody asked the State of Oregon to support the students of the University of Oregon or the alumni of the university of Oregon and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to transport them. People made their own way.  But no, not when it comes to the Air Force Academy. Was it a particularly important game in Hawaii? Why did we spend $300,000 on transporting? It had something to do the with the fact the game was in Hawaii. They spent a total of $2 million transporting cadets to and from sporting events last year, many times at the cost of $2,000 per student. Those same students could have flown first class and each student could have had a chauffeur-driven limousine and had their meals and hotels paid for, for less than it cost to transport them, and this does not include the cost of the crew on the ground and other incidental costs, wear and tear on the airplane. These are only the actual operating costs of the plane.  So it is time the Pentagon came to reality here. I have introduced with Senator Grassley legislation that would reduce the support aircraft to that which is needed, truly needed by the military, 50 percent, save $200 million next year and every year thereafter.                          ____________________
