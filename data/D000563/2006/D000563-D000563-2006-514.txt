President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable and compassionate woman. Anna May Hawekotte Smith fought tirelessly for underdogs of every sort throughout a professional career hat lasted more than 50 years. She passed away on July 5 at the rich age of 90.  In 1950, at the age of 35, while pregnant with her fourth child, Anna May suffered a crippling stroke. She was left paralyzed, forced to relearn such basic functions as walking and talking. Through perseverance, Anna May recovered. While a limp and leg brace remained the only physical suggestions of her former impairment, the experience left a lasting impression on Anna May. For the next 55 years, she used her extraordinary empathy, skills, and determination to help others and to advance many worthy causes.  Over the course of her lifetime, Anna May Hawekotte Smith served many roles--educator, administrator, advocate of social justice, champion of women's rights, wife, and mother. She attended Barat College in Lake Forest, IL. After graduating in 1938, Anna May obtained a master's degree in speech education from Columbia University in New York. She continued her graduate work in speech at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, and interned with doctors at the University of Illinois Neuropsychiatric Clinic. Anna May Hawekotte Smith began her professional career as a professor at Barat College. She was soon promoted to chairman of the college's speech and drama department. During her tenure at Barat, she broadcast the first live women's radio talk show to spotlight issues related social justice and the advancement of women.  In 1966, she helped develop a program at Barat to help high school girls from low-income families in Chicago and Lake County to prepare for college. The Upward Bound Program, as it was called, ran for 8 years and assisted hundreds of young women.  It was also during her time at Barat that Anna May met her future husband, Charles Caroll Smith. Charles was executive director of the Catholic Youth Organization of Chicago and the administrative assistant to the late Archbishop Bernard J. Sheil. The pair wed in 1941 and raised three children together.  Anna May Hawekotte Smith was a woman of active faith. That was evident in her work on behalf of the Catholic Church, as well as in her calm acceptance of the hand of God in her own life. Anna May Hawekotte Smith did not fear change; she embraced it as an adventure and God's will for her. Her daughter, Sheila Smith, said her mother was never afraid of seeing one door close because she trusted God would open a new door. Sheila remembers a couple of years ago, when Anna May learned that Barat College would be closing its doors. She didn't express anger or frustration. Instead, she told her daughter that it was time to focus on a new venture: the Barat Education Foundation. The foundation, created in 2000, would carry on the legacy of the school where she had spent so many years.  In 1969, Anna May's husband Charles passed away. Sheila remembers an evening shortly after her father died. She was sitting in the kitchen with her mother when Frank Sinatra's classic song, ``My Way'' came on the radio. Anna May told her daughter that, though she had been comfortable in her life, she had often done what was expected of her and what other people wanted. Widowed now, at the age of 54, she was free to make her own decisions, to live her life her way.  Anna May accepted a teaching position at Sangamon State University, now the University of Illinois Springfield, in 1973 and remained a member of the university faculty until her retirement in 1985. Today, a scholarship in her name recognizes Anna May's commitment to the advancement of women.  Following her retirement, Anna May moved back to Chicago, where she became assistant director for job development programs at the Northern Illinois National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Throughout her life, she also supported social justice causes ranging from civil rights to women's rights.  Mr. President, this Friday, July 21, on what would have been Anna May's 91st birthday, her friends and family will gather at a memorial service at Barat College Chapel to remember and honor this remarkable woman. In the words of her family, Anna May Hawekotte Smith was more than a lifelong learner, she was a lifelong doer. All of us who knew her recall her not only with fondness but with great admiration.  Our thoughts and prayers are with all of those whom she loved and who loved her, especially her children, Charles Smith, Sheila Smith, and Catherine Smith Wilson; her two brothers; and her six grandchildren.                          ____________________
