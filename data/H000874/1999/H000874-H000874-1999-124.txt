Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss with some of the real experts on defense and budget some of the issues that confront this Congress and the American public as it relates to budget, defense and veterans' issues. I want to thank the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moore) for his comments just now on the impact of the budget on veterans.  We plan to use the next hour, Mr. Speaker, to discuss the issue of defense spending and to dispel the misguided rhetoric and unjustified claims from the other side of the aisle that the President is hollowing out this Nation's military forces. We will show that not only is the President providing a strong defense, but because of his fiscal discipline, joined by the Congress and in many respects led by the Congress, a surplus exists, a surplus that if the Republicans have their way, would not be used to fund critical military readiness needs or other discretionary programs, but instead provide a fiscally unsound tax cut.  Let me first address the over $800 billion Republican tax proposal which perhaps will be debated tomorrow. How do they pay for this? They pay for it by using the projected on-budget surplus, not paying down the debt, not saving Social Security or Medicare, not investing in readiness, research, development, T and E, but a tax cut.  We are here today talking about the largest surplus ever recorded in dollar terms and the largest since 1951. Let me repeat that. We are here today talking about the largest surplus ever recorded in dollar terms under this administration and the largest since 1951 when Harry Truman was President of the United States, the largest since 1951 as a percentage of the gross domestic product, because the President's economic plan passed in 1993, and the Democratic Congress, without a Republican vote, it focused on reducing deficits, paying down debt held by the public, investing in our people and opening markets.  Our publicly held debt today is $1.7 trillion below what it was forecast to be by President Bush's director of the Office of Management and Budget. Let me mention that again. In 1992, in December, President's Bush's director of OMB, Dick Darmen, submitted an analysis to the Congress in which he said today's deficit was going to be $1.7 trillion more than it actually is. It is less than projected because of that economic program.  This fiscal prudence has resulted in many achievements. Our Nation is seeing record economic growth for 5 years in a row. We have an unemployment rate which is the lowest peacetime rate in over 4 decades.  I would say, as the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) said, that is a result of a program that was universally, unanimously opposed by our Republican colleagues. Real family income is up, real hourly wages are up, private sector growth is booming at the fastest rate since Lyndon Johnson was President. Business investment is at a higher rate than at any time since President Kennedy was in office, and Federal Government spending has been reduced to the lowest level in a quarter of a century.  The tax cut plan by the Republican majority would bring us back unfortunately and fearfully to deficits realized during the Reagan-Bush years where we went from $985 billion in debt in 1981 to $3.2 trillion just 12 years later. We tripled, almost quadrupled, the national debt in 12 years.  Let me remind everyone here that debt held by the public in 1981 was, as I said, 985 billion. Now 3.247 trillion; not now, in 1993. The tax plan that is being proposed will cost more than 864billion over 10 years. Actually, that will be $1.02 trillion when we consider the extra interest that will be paid because we do not, as the President has proposed and as we propose, pay down the national debt and save literally the American taxpayer billions and billions and billions of dollars in interest that they would otherwise pay if we did not reduce, as we propose to do, the debt. It will add an additional 1 trillion in public debt over the next 10 years and balloon to 3 trillion over the following 10 years.  Now I have three children and two grandchildren. I do not want them to have to pay off that added debt. I think it is immoral for us to follow that course. I think it is incumbent upon us as a generation that is doing very well to pay our debts and to leave the next generation, the young people of America, in a position where they can invest their money in the priorities of their time, not of our time.  Who would end up paying for this increase in interest rates if we do not pay down the debt? Consumers, home purchasers, farmers and small businesses in the form of higher interest rates. So while on the one hand they would have thought they got a tax reduction, in fact they will get an increase because of the interest rates.  By proposing a tax cut, the Republicans also in my opinion ignore something that every American depends upon every day, a strong and creditable defense. If this tax cut is realized, defense spending would be $200 billion almost, less than the President's plan over 10 years. This, Mr. Speaker, is in my opinion unacceptable and unsafe in this unstable and dangerous international community.  I have shortened my discussion just a little bit because I have so many of my distinguished colleagues that have joined me.  The balanced budget agreement cut defense spending to a level dictated by an arbitrary formula. That was what we adopted in 1997. I voted for it because in that time we had large debt, not surpluses, confronting us. That formula, which was as a result, has removed the careful considered judgment of the President, civilian and military leaders and this body in deciding appropriate spending levels.  My colleagues saw the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) a little earlier say the assumption of the Republican tax cut is that everything will stay on hold, all domestic and defense discretionary spending, essentially on hold. There is no question that defense spending has diminished below the point many of us would like to see, but the cause of this cannot and should not be the subject of partisan finger pointing at one party or the other. We have heard too often recently the Republican side of the aisle, quick to blame the President for what they allege to be a hollowing out of our military.  The President's record on defense spending has not created, in my opinion, and I think the record reflects, a hollow force. On the contrary, today's Armed Forces are well prepared, well trained and dedicated as ever. But we must continue to invest. We must continue to ensure that our military is ready, prepared for whatever eventualities may occur. Our equipment remains effective and superior to our adversaries, as we have just seen. The performance of our men and women in uniform has been and continues to this day to be outstanding. Our military needs to be supported in a responsible manner.  Now frankly my Republican colleagues say that that is what they want to do, but then they propose a tax cut which will inevitably lead, as it did from 1986 to just a couple of years ago, 1986 to essentially, and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) will perhaps tell us, but 1995 and 1996, to a continuing decrease in effective net defense spending. That was not prudent. We ought not to follow that course, but the tax cut will inevitably lead us to that end.  The Armed Services must compete with the robust economy which has provided a market rich for the technical, mature, educated product that our Armed Forces has produced.                              {time}  2000  The President has kept the Nation's armed forces strong and our military is the envy of the world. Mr. Speaker, just as we agreed in 1997 to work together to solve our economic crisis of dangerous deficit spending, we must now work together to ensure a continued, strong national defense and a continued, strong economy, and a continued reduction of the debt so that the American public and our children will be out of debt and keep interest rates low. That is the best thing we can do for our public.  Tomorrow, we will debate perhaps, we do not know yet, they are talking about it, the tax scheme which, among many things, will jeopardize our fiscal commitment to our Nation's defense. We in Congress must vow never, never, never to sacrifice our Nation's defense for the sake of partisan politics, and we must pledge to work together to ensure a ready superior force, prepared always to defend our Nation and its interests throughout the world.
