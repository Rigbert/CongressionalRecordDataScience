It has 17 Republican amendments on it. An hour apiece with a vote would probably take us around the clock or close to it. I wish to review this list with the Senator from Utah and others interested. I said earlier I was going to make a unanimous consent request. I will not make it at this very moment, but I will be making a unanimous consent request within minutes, which will include at least two of the amendments that are on his list, and it will be a starting point. I will object to the request at this moment.
