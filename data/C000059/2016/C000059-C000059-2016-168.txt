Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to bring to the floor H.R. 5538, the fiscal year 2017 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.  As we begin, I want to personally thank Chairman Rogers for his leadership and support. I also want to thank my good friend and our ranking member, Ms. McCollum, for her partnership and work on this bill and to say a very happy birthday. Finally, I want to thank each of our subcommittee members for their assistance and hard work on the legislation before us.  The fiscal year 2017 Interior and Environment bill is funded at $32.095 billion, which is $64 million below the FY 2016 enacted level and $1 billion below the budget request.  The committee has provided robust wildland fire funding in this bill. Fire suppression accounts are again fully funded at the 10-year average level, which rose by $133 million from last year. The committee also addressed concerns about forest health and active forest management, and provided a $30 million increase for hazardous fuels.  This bill also makes critical investments in Indian Country. Overall, funding for the Bureaus of Indian Affairs and Education is increased by $72 million, or 3 percent, while funding for the Indian Health Service is increased by $271 million, or 6 percent, from fiscal year 2016 levels. This is the largest increase in this bill.  The bill provides for $2.9 billion for the National Park Service, including more than $65 million in new funding to address the maintenance backlog and other priorities related to the Park Service centennial.  The bill provides $480 million to fully fund payments in lieu of taxes, PILT, in year 2017.  We have also addressed a number of concerns within the Fish and Wildlife Service. The bill continues funding for popular cost-shared grant programs. It also provides additional funds to combat international wildlife trafficking, protects fish hatcheries from cuts and closures, continues fighting to fight invasive species, and reduces the backlog of species that are covered but not yet delisted.  The bill provides $322 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund programs that enjoy broad, bipartisan support.  Funding for EPA is reduced by $164 million from fiscal year 2016 enacted levels. Again this year, there is a great deal of concern over the number of regulatory actions being pursued by EPA in the absence of legislation and without clear congressional direction. For this reason, the bill includes a number of provisions to stop unnecessary and damaging regulatory overreach by the Agency.  Before closing, I would like to make an additional point about the challenges facing Flint, Michigan, and other communities across the country addressing lead in drinking water. This is an issue of great concern to the committee members. It is not a partisan issue.  What occurred in Flint has called greater attention to aging infrastructure and the need for prudent management and oversight of water systems. This bill provides targeted investments and prioritizes resources that will help the EPA and Michigan respond to Flint and help other States and communities address the needs of their water systems.  The bill provides an increase of $207 million above the fiscal year 2016 enacted level for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. It also includes $50 million for the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation, otherwise known as WIFIA, program, which may be leveraged through direct Federal loans or loan guarantees to fund up to $3 billion to $5 billion worth of water infrastructure projects nationwide.  In addition, the bill provides increases for State grants for improved State oversight and operations of drinking water systems and for communities to work on integrated plans for pipe replacement. The bill also directs the GAO to assess the number of lead service lines by State.  Lastly, the committee is taking an additional step to provide relief for communities like Flint by including bill language that allows States to use State revolving fund dollars to forgive a portion of a community's outstanding loans. This and other steps taken in this bill will have a real impact.  In closing, I want to thank the staff on both sides for their hard work on this bill. On the minority side, I would like to thank Rita Culp, Jocelyn Hunn, Joe Carlile, and Rebecca Taylor. Their work is very much appreciated.  On the majority side, I would like to thank our subcommittee staff: Kristin Richmond, Jackie Kilroy, Betsy Bina, Jason Gray, Darren Benjamin, and, of course, our chief clerk Dave LesStrang. I would also like to thank Ian Foley, Rebecca Keightley, Molly Lowe, and Tricia Evans on my personal staff, and my chief of staff, David Ramey.  Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill and it deserves Members' support.  I reserve the balance of my time.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.001[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.002[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.003[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.004[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.005[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.006[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.007[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.008[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.009[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.010[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.011[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.012[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.013[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.014[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.015[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.016[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.017[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.018[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.019[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.020[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH12JY16.021    Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to thank Chairman Calvert for the warm birthday wishes. But I would also like to thank the chairman and his staff for their open and collaborative approach, and the wonderful staff on the Democratic side who will be helping me this evening.  This subcommittee has had a challenging portfolio of issues, and I commend the chairman's effort to find solutions in another yet difficult budget year.  This year's subcommittee held 14 budget hearings, 4 which involved Native American Indians and Alaska Natives.                              {time}  1645  The testimony provided by the 209 witnesses clearly articulated the serious need for programs and services under this subcommittee's jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the FY 2017 subcommittee allocation is $64 million less than last year's enacted level. This means the needs of many important programs that are vital to protecting our Nation's natural and cultural resources will not be met as they far outpace a stagnant allocation. Within this constrained top line number, difficult choices had to be made, and, sadly, the majority cut important programs that protect the American public and conserve our natural resources.  The most significant programmatic cut is to the Environmental Protection Agency, which is slashed by $164 million. This cut will impact the Agency's ability to protect human health and the health of our environment and to ensure clean air and clean water for our families and future generations.  This year, the critical need for the EPA was unmistakable as our Nation watched a tragedy unfold in Flint, Michigan, by which children were poisoned by lead in their drinking water. So I find it difficult to reconcile the cuts recommended in this bill with the public health challenges that are faced by this country. Flint is a culmination of years of weakening the EPA through budget cuts and an overreliance on State agencies to manage Federal environmental laws. All of our communities deserve and expect their government to provide clean water and basic public health protections.  Especially in light of Flint, I must strongly object to the majority's decision to reduce funding for clean water by $394 million, which is 28 percent below the 2016 enacted level. Clean water and safe drinking water go hand in hand. You cannot have one without the other.  The residents of Flint were betrayed by their State government, and, to this day, they still do not have safe drinking water available from their taps. The levels provided in this bill for the State Revolving Funds are inadequate to deal with the decaying infrastructure in our Nation, no less the emergency in Flint, Michigan.  In addition to the irresponsible cuts to the EPA, I am also troubled by the 30 percent reduction for the Endangered Species Listing. Reducing funding for this program opens the door for litigation, and it delays protecting and recovering vulnerable species.  The bill also shortchanges the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which, since its inception, has protected conservation and recreation land in every State and has supported tens of thousands of State and local projects. Yet, despite its merits, this bill slashes the Land and Water Conservation Fund program by a third.  Despite this bill's shortcomings in the environmental protection and resource conservation areas, I do, however, want to express how very proud I am of this subcommittee's nonpartisan approach in addressing the issues that are facing our Native American brothers and sisters. I am pleased that this bill recommends an increase of $343 million for programs that are critical to Indian Country.  However, I would be remiss if I did not point out, even with this increase, the funding for Native American programs is still $172 million less than the administration's request. Native American and Alaska Native populations face substantial hardships, and when compared to the total population, they have poorer health, lower earnings, and higher rates of poverty.  So we must continue to work together in our efforts to support these communities. That is why I applaud this bill for maintaining our commitment to provide Native American students with safe schools that are conducive to learning and for fully funding contract support costs so that tribes are not penalized for exercising their self-determination rights.  Another bright spot in this bill is the continued support for the National Parks Centennial Initiative. The bill recommends $80 million for the Centennial, which will strengthen the foundation for visitor services and make essential infrastructure investments.  I am also pleased that an additional $3 million is provided for the Civil Rights Initiative grant program and that funding is included for grants-in-aid to Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  I especially would like to thank the chairman for working with me to resurrect the Save America's Treasures program. This program funds and preserves nationally significant sites, structures, and artifacts. I am very proud that, in working together, we were able to restart this program, and I will work diligently with the chairman to make sure it is included in the final bill. Unfortunately, this bill neglects to act on many other opportunities to wisely invest taxpayers' dollars.  I am frustrated that the majority has, effectively, left $1.2 billion on the table by not adopting the commonsense reforms that are championed in Chairman Simpson's wildfire disaster funding bill. Every member of the Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies is a cosponsor of that bill--Democrat and Republican alike. Yet, once again, the majority has balked and cites committee jurisdiction. However, those jurisdictional issues did not hinder the majority's including dozens of harmful legislative riders. I must express my concern and disappointment with the 38 partisan riders in this bill. The number is outrageous, and, to me, the nature of the riders that are included panders to special interests at the expense of the public good.  For example, the bill contains a provision that would reverse the safety improvements that were developed following the Deepwater Horizon tragedy. Eleven lives were lost in that explosion. I must express my clear dismay that this bill puts the profits of big oil companies ahead of worker safety. The veto-bait provisions that seek to turn back protections for endangered species, to restrict control of greenhouse gas emissions, and to undermine clean water and clean air protections do not belong in this bill.  I acknowledge and I appreciate the efforts that have been made to accommodate Democratic priorities in this bill. However, I still cannot support this bill as it is drafted. Despite my current opposition, it is my clear intention to continue working with Chairman Calvert through this year's appropriations process to produce a responsible bill that both parties can support. The gentleman has my word on that.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
