President, earlier today I made a statement, I put an additional statement in the Record, of my opposition to the amendment, so I will not expand on that, other than to say I wish all Senators, no matter how they vote, will either listen to or read what was said by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.  I have served with him here for 20 years. Throughout that time, we have had times of agreeing and times of disagreeing. One thing I always agreed on is his sense of history, his allegiance to the Constitution. I know of no Member of this body now serving or previous serving who stood stronger for the Constitution or stood stronger for history as Senator Byrd.  Mr. President, we should ask ourselves, in a Nation as powerful as ours, in a Nation, really the most powerful democracy known to mankind, the most powerful economy, the most powerful military worldwide reach, but a democracy and the most powerful democracy, one based on three separate branches of Government, the ability for them to be separate, the ability for them to have the respect of the people, we should ask ourselves as we continue to try to destroy any one of those branches of Government, what do we do to our democracy?  If we give up the power of the purse to the executive, that is chipping away. We find Members who want to denigrate the very bodies in which they serve--both this and the other body--and that chips away at our democracy. We find those who want to destroy the Presidency no matter who holds it. That chips away at our democracy.  Mr. President, each one of us should take a little bit of time out, read some history, consider what maintains this great and powerful democracy and ask ourselves: Are we supporting it or are we whittling away at it?  I yield the floor and thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.
