  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, you have heard the term ``reinvent the wheel.'' We have some people around here who want to un-invent the wheel. The Tea Party--``small government at any cost''--radicals have what they think is a brilliant new idea. It is called ``devolution.''  We will devolve the duty, the obligation, and the funding of the national transportation system to the 50 States. Oh, what a great idea. Well, no. Actually, we tried it in the last century. It failed pretty miserably. Here it is: 1956. This is the brand spanking new Kansas Turnpike. Oklahoma said they would build--oh, they ran out of money, so Oklahoma didn't build their section. Kansas did. For 3 years, cars crashed through the barrier at the end of this and landed in Emil Schweitzer's farm field. That is devolution. They want to go back to that.  Dwight David Eisenhower said, no, that is not acceptable. He passed a bill for a national transportation system, funded by a user fee, and the highway got completed.  Now we want to go back to that era? We want to compete with the world by spending less on transportation, by having less Federal coordination, and by passing a pathetic Band-Aid bill today with pretend money that will limp us through the next 9 months?  No. We need a substantial investment in our national transportation system--putting millions of people back to work, making us first class again, and competing with the rest of the world. No devolution.                          ____________________
