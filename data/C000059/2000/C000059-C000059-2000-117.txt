Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2372, the Private Property Rights Implementation Act. As a Member representing California, as well as a member of the Western Caucus, I am acutely aware of the need for legislation to protect private property owners.  H.R. 2372 addresses unequal and unfair treatment of property right claims. It simply allows property owners, injured by Government action and excessive regulation, equitable and simplified access to the federal courts. Currently, 83 percent of Federal property claims are thrown out of the court before their merits can be debated. With a statistic like that, no one can argue that the current process is fair.  It also levels the playing field for small and middle class property owners. Unfairly, private citizens find their pocket books disportionately strained by the cost of defending their fifth amendment property rights.  No matter what reason the Government has for restricting private property use, and there are some legitimate reasons, there is no excuse for denying landowners their day in court.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose all amendments which threaten to gut H.R. 2372, especially Mr. Boehlert's amendment. This amendment would eliminate the bill's provision which allows landowners to take their appeals to federal court.  This is not an issue about taking power away from the States and localities, it is about the rights of property owners to have their claims considered fairly and in a timely manner.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2372. To support the Fifth Amendment right of all American citizens.
