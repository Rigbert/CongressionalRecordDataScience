Mr. Speaker, owing to the unprecedented participation in today's debate, we have had over 120 Republican Members who have participated and I am sure the number is similar on the side of the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos); and owing to the fact that the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), said every Member who wants to participate would be entitled to do so, I understand, if my information is correct, on the Democratic side there are approximately 12 more Members waiting to speak. We have four more as of now.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during consideration of H.J. Res. 61, pursuant to the order of House of earlier today, debate on the joint resolution be extended an additional 30 minutes, equally divided and controlled by the chairman of the Committee on International Relations or his designee and the ranking minority member.
