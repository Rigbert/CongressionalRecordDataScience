 President, I rise to introduce the bill entitled the Breast Cancer Research Stamps Reauthorization Act of 2000. I am pleased that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has joined me as the lead cosponsor.  The Breast Cancer Research stamp is the first stamp in our nation's historydedicated to raising funds for a special cause. Since the stamp's issuance in the summer of 1998, the U.S. Postal Service has sold 164 million Breast Cancer Research stamps--raising over $12 million for breast cancer research. In addition, the stamp has focused public awareness on the devastating disease and has stood out as a beacon of hope and strength around which breast-cancer survivors can rally.  Unfortunately, without congressional action, the Breast Cancer Research stamp will expire on July 28, 2000. The Breast Cancer Research Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2000 would permit the sale of the Breast Cancer Research stamp for 2 additional years. The stamp would continue to cost 40 cents and sell as a first class stamp. The extra money collected will be directed to breast cancer research at the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense.  A Breast Cancer Research stamp remains just as necessary today as 2 years ago. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in every major ethnic group in the United States. More than 2 million women are living with breast cancer in America, 1 million of whom have yet to be diagnosed.  Breast cancer continues to be the number one cancer killer of women between the ages of 15 and 54. This year alone, 182,800 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,800 women will die from the disease. The disease claims another woman's life every 15 minutes in the United States.  Thanks to breakthroughs in cancer research, more and more people are becoming cancer survivors rather than cancer victims. According to the American Association for Cancer Research, 8 million people are alive today as a result of cancer research. The bottom line is that every dollar we continue to raise will save lives.  I am pleased to report that this reauthorization bill has over 39 original cosponsors and broad support within the health community.  Let me just repeat a couple of the glowing comments from the many groups in support of this bill. It shows the truly astounding impact of this stamp.  The Susan G. Komen Foundation writes:       The Breast Cancer Research stamp has not only raised      millions of dollars by providing a convenient and innovative      mechanism for public participation in the [battle against      breast cancer], but it has also focused public awareness on      this devastating disease.  Betsy Mullen of Women's Information Network--Against Breast Cancer adds:       This bill, if passed will provide an innovative, simple and      now proven way for individuals to make a substantial      contribution to fund federal cancer research and to continue      to be a part of what has become an effective public-private      partnership.  The American Association of Health Plan attests:       We've heard from our physicians about women who have      scheduled examinations or mammograms after purchasing the      stamp or receiving a card or letter posted with it.  Oliver Goldsmith, chairman of the Southern California Permanente Medical Group, writes:       The Breast Cancer Research stamp captures the essence of      innovation, volunteerism and partnership that are such an      integral aspect of our country's history and spirit. This      vital legislation will give all of us the opportunity to      continue to work together to eradicate breast cancer. The      American people can realistically continue to raise millions      of dollars a year to fund cutting edge research to end this      rampant disease that claims the lives of all too many breast      cancer victims in this country and around the world.  Other supporters of the Breast Cancer Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2000 include the American Cancer Society, the American Medical Association, the Y-Me National Breast Cancer Organization, Leadership America, the National Association of Women's Health, the American Cancer League, the American College of Surgeons, Friends of Cancer Research, the California Nurses Association, the Association of Reproductive Health Care Professionals, and many others.  I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
