President, I have lost track of how long it has been since the President nominated Ambassador Richard Holbrooke to be the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations.  What I do know is that in the intervening months we have fought a war in Kosovo that I supported, but which harmed our relations with Russia and China.  We have watched as tens of thousands of students demonstrated in the streets of Tehran; seen further signs that North Korea is preparing to test a long-range missile that could reach our shores; entered a new and hopeful period in the Middle East peace process; watched the Northern Ireland peace process reach a dead end once again; and seen India and Pakistan, armed with nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them, clash over Kashmir. All of this has occurred while Ambassador Holbrooke has been waiting to be confirmed.  So, Mr. President, it is possible for the United States to carry on without a UN ambassador. We have managed to do that. The world has not come to an end, although not a day has passed without a crisis that we have an interest in. But does anyone here think it is a sensible way for the world's only superpower to conduct itself?  Every day, we face threats to our security interests, our economic interest, that affect the health and welfare of the American people, and which require the intensive attention and intervention of skilled diplomats. Aside from the Secretary of State, there is no diplomatic position more important than our UN Ambassador.  Yet month after month after month, we have seen this nomination delayed by the Majority party. First it was due to allegations of financial irregularities, which Ambassador Holbrooke resolved months ago. Months had already been lost waiting for a hearing.  Then, shortly after the Majority Leader said the Senate would vote on his nomination, a hold was placed on it and more weeks have passed without a vote being scheduled--a vote that is certain to confirm Ambassador Holbrooke overwhelmingly. In fact, he would have been confirmed easily months ago, if the Senate had been permitted to vote.  This is the last week before the August recess. There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for delaying this further. There are no political points to be made here. On the contrary, we hurt ourselves each day that we are without a UN Ambassador. It is, frankly, ridiculous to be acting as if this position can remain vacant for month after month, without weakening our influence around the world.  So let us hope this is the week that Ambassador Holbrooke will be confirmed, and that he can get started on the difficult job that we, the American people and the President, need him to do.                          ____________________
