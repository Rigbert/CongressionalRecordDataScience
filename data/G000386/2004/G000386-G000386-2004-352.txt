 President--and I will object--I want to take advantage of this opportunity to say that there are a lot of very important pieces of legislation that we have before this body that are bipartisan that need to be passed.  Two weeks ago, we had a bill dealing with outsourcing and the efforts to create manufacturing jobs in America by giving a tax advantage to manufacturers that manufacture here. It is a bipartisan bill, voted out of the Senate Finance Committee with only two dissenting votes, and those were Republican votes. So, overwhelmingly, people on the other side of the aisle know that bill has to pass.  But time after time we deal with nongermane amendments that distract from the efforts of this Senate to do things that create jobs in America and, in this particular instance, move people from welfare to work.  So I do not think it is wrong for some of us to take exception to the efforts to stall important pieces of legislation getting through this body, and that is why I object.
