Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  This cut is not required by any treaty. There is no strategic analysis, as the gentlelady said. There is no estimate of how this would affect the balance between the United States and other nuclear powers.  Events over the last several years, as well as through analysis, such as that done under the Nuclear Posture Review, have confirmed that we need to maintain and revitalize our nuclear deterrent.  I rise in strong opposition to this reckless amendment.                              {time}  2145
