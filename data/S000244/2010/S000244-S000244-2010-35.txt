Iwao Matsuda. He is a patriot who has dedicated his life to his country and to the people of Japan. I have worked with Mr. Matsuda for many years and am saddened by his retirement from the United States-Japan Legislative Exchange Program (LEP).  Mr. Iwao Matsuda served Japan for many years in a variety of roles. One such role was as a civil servant in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Having served in the Ministry for more than twenty years, he learned the importance of the United States-Japan friendship. Later in his career, as Member of the Japanese Diet, Mr. Matsuda constantly forged new pathways to improve United States-Japan relations and he recognized that at the core of improved relations was a deeper cultural understanding of our two countries. As a Member of the Diet, he was in a unique position to forge a pathway to closer ties. Thus, Mr. Matsuda helped launch the LEP which is now one of the most successful exchange programs in Congress.  As a founding father of the LEP, Mr. Matsuda has been a leader in building a long-lasting friendship between the United States and Japan. His in-depth knowledge of the United States has been a key to building the LEP into the successful program that it is today. Members of Congress, including myself, welcomed the knowledge and wisdom that Matsuda shared at LEP meetings. Under his leadership, Members of Congress and the Diet have been able to break down barriers and build lasting friendships that we all cherish.  My wife Cheryl and I wish our good friend Mr. Iwao Matsuda all the best. As he makes a change to the private sector, we both know that Matsuda will continue make Japan proud. I look forward to finding new ways to work with my friend and I wish him well with future endeavors.                          ____________________
