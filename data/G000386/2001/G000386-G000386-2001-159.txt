 President, I want to discuss my vote on the Hutchinson-Bond amendment. I commend Senators Hutchinson and Bond for raising the issue of accelerating full deductibility for the self-employed. I support, and have always supported, this important effort and wish to see it realized. I am confident that with the leadership of Senators Hutchinson and Bond it will become reality.  However, as the recent experience with the $1.35 trillion tax relief bill has shown, it is critical that tax legislation be first considered by the Finance Committee as part of a tax bill.  I have sought and have received agreement from the chairman of the Finance Committee that this measure and similar health tax related matters will be subject to a markup in the Finance Committee in the near future. I look forward to pursuing this issue at that time.
