President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator Isakson in introducing the Tanning Transparency and Notification Act, or the TAN Act.  This legislation is a continuation of an initiative that we worked on together five years ago during the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, FDAAA, of 2007. That initiative required the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, to issue a report to Congress on whether the labeling requirements for indoor tanning devices provide sufficient information to consumers regarding the risks that the use of such devices pose for the development of irreversible damage to the eyes and skin, including skin cancer.  We called for this report in 2007 because the FDA had not updated its warnings on tanning beds since 1979. The FDA still has not acted and we believe that users of indoor tanning beds deserve to be fully informed. While the American Academy of Dermatology, the FDA, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization, WHO, continue to discourage the use of indoor tanning beds, this message and up-to-date information about the risks of indoor tanning are still not being adequately provided to consumers.  Not surprisingly, the FDA found in its report to Congress that updating current labeling requirements for tanning beds would better protect consumers from irreversible skin damage. This is an excerpt from the FDA's own report:       Based on its analysis of the results of the consumer study      required by section 230 of FDAAA, FDA has determined that      there are warnings that are capable of adequately      communicating the risks of indoor tanning,     and that a modified warning statement label may more      effectively convey these risks than the current labeling      requirements. FDA has also determined that changes to the      positioning requirements for the warning statement label may      communicate such risks more effectively.  Unfortunately, the FDA has not heeded its own advice. Tanning bed labels remain unchanged and skin cancer rates continue to rise. This year, approximately 131,810 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the United States, and nearly 9,180 people will die from melanoma. Some of these cases result from the use of tanning beds.  Two million Americans, approximately 70 percent of whom are girls and women, visit a tanning salon each day. The WHO reports that the risk of cutaneous melanoma increases by 75 percent when use of tanning devices starts before 30 years of age.  Better informing these individuals about the incidence of melanoma, and increasing transparency and improving notification about the risks of indoor tanning are all ways to reduce skin cancer rates. The Tanning Transparency and Notification Act would require the FDA to carry out the recommendations in its report and update the labeling requirements for tanning beds.  Initiatives like this can make a difference in the health of Americans. Indeed, just last year, the FDA finalized critical regulations--at my and others' urging--that were 30 years in the making regarding sunscreen labeling. Providing consumers with critical information about the risks of indoor and outdoor tanning can help better protect them against skin cancer. I look forward to working with my colleagues on improving the labeling of indoor tanning beds and continuing efforts to combat skin cancer.                                 ______                                       By
