It reminds me that if we remember in our history, when de Tocqueville came here, he came over to study our business system. He was so impressed with the great wealth this Nation had accumulated that he wrote a book. The last paragraph says that once the people of this country find out they can vote themselves money out of the public trust, this system will fail.  We are so close to that point, and yet, this great discovery that was reflected in the election of November shows me that people are saying that we are almost there and we cannot afford to let it continue.  The one thing that the three of us have in common is we are all freshmen, we are new here. I think maybe that is why we are a little bit more exercised on this. We remember the mandate very well. That is all I heard during not just the election, but I have had 77 town meetings since the election. The first thing coming out of the chute is the budget. ``I do not care what you do, do something to stop the deficit.'' That is what we are committed to doing.
