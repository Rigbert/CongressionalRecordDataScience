Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, the ranking member, for yielding me this precious minute.  I want to augment my remarks of earlier this afternoon and thank Jaime Shimek of our own staff who worked so very, very hard on the Energy and Water Subcommittee, allowing this bill to move to the floor.  And then I feel compelled to rise to thank our chairman of the full committee, Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen, with whom I have had the opportunity to work now for many decades and to say to him he is an exemplary model of public service to the people of our country, a true patriot, and someone who devoted so many hours to moving a bill to the floor that could achieve bipartisan consensus in a very loaded political environment.  I shall never forget, at the beginning of the Iraq war, our trip to the Middle East, to many of the countries involved, the manner in which he comported himself, the great counsel he gave to so many of us as a military man himself, and the great leadership that he has provided as chair of our Defense Subcommittee at one point and now of the full committee. The people of New Jersey can truly celebrate his service to our Nation as we move this bill to a final vote later today.
