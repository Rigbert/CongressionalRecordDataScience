 Today we will vote on her confirmation as a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Ms. Bade's nomination comes with the bipartisan support of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and a ``well qualified'' rating from the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  Given that 77 Senators voted yesterday to advance this nomination, it is obviously clear to the vast majority of us that the President has made yet another excellent choice to the Federal bench. I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting for Ms. Bade later today.                           The Green New Deal  Madam President, on another matter entirely, this afternoon the Senate is going to vote on the far-left wish list that many of our Democratic colleagues have rushed to embrace--the so-called Green New Deal.  For a relatively sparse resolution, this proposal has already traveled quite a fascinating path in Congress. It originated with the most radical, farthest left Members of the new House Democratic majority. The Speaker of the House quickly praised its ``enthusiasm.''  Its principal sponsor rolled out the first version of the plan alongside an extensive background document that laid out the policy's true goals in candid detail but which Democrats then rushed to hastily scrub off the internet.  It is not exactly an auspicious start, but, nevertheless, a number of our Democratic colleagues here in the Senate rushed to embrace it as well. Every Democratic Senator who is currently running for President has embraced the Green New Deal.  The energy, the momentum, and the defining new voices in today's Democratic Party seem to be all in for the Green New Deal. ``It is ambitious. It captures your imagination,'' said one current Presidential candidate.  ``I'm in all the way,'' said one of our Senate colleagues, who is also running.  When asked if the proposal might go too far, another of our Senate colleagues running for President replied on this issue: ``You cannot go far enough.''  So just how far does the proposal go? What exactly is in this thing? What is it?  For starters, the proposal addresses the small matter of eliminating--listen to this--the use of all fossil fuels nationwide over 10 years--get rid of it all. This might sound like a neat idea in places like San Francisco or New York--the places that the Democratic Party seems totally focused on these days--but, frankly, the communities everywhere else would be absolutely crushed by this.  It is killing off entire domestic industries, winding down millions of jobs, and, basically, outlawing the only sources of energy that working-class and middle-class families can actually afford. By one rough estimate, these steps could lead to a spike in household electricity bills of $300 a month--that much increase in your utility bill. Keep in mind that this is just a warmup act.  While they are at it, our friends on the far left also propose a federally mandated overhaul of every building in America--every building in America. No family home or small businesswould be safe until it meets Washington bureaucrats' standards of greenness. But if you can believe it, other aspects of this proposal make these things sound downright practical, by comparison.  The resolution also includes a far broader socialist wish list that gestures toward a new government-run healthcare insurance system, a new system for government-guaranteed housing, and a new government system to guarantee everyone--everyone--``economic security.''  The last point is a little vague, but, helpfully, before it was scrubbed off the internet, the original sponsor's background document made the long-term goal perfectly clear--listen to this: ``economic security to all those who are unable or unwilling to work.''  That is the background document they rushed to delete. The Democrats' long-term vision is taking hard-working people's taxpayer dollars to pay those who choose not get off their couch day after day simply because they are unwilling to work.  So my Democratic colleagues' brilliant new idea--their rallying cry--is snatching away the energy sources that middle-class families use, shuttering the industries that provide many of those families with their livelihoods, and changing the homes they live in, the cars they drive, and the healthcare plans they rely on.  Remember what our colleague said: ``You cannot go too far.'' Our colleagues are certainly putting that to the test.  I haven't even gotten to what American families would have to pay--to pay--for the privilege of being lab rats for all of this far-left social engineering--for being lab rats for all of this social engineering. My Democratic colleagues have been fairly quiet on that subject. I guess it is a lot more fun ordering off the menu than taking a look at the check.  Families would almost certainly be faced with much higher utility bills. Then, there is the cost to replace appliances. Presumably, electric cars would have to be purchased. Then, there is the Federal tax burden.  Just how much of other people's money are Democrats proposing to burn in this effort to turn the country into a far-left fiction novel?  One initial rough estimate found that all of the pieces of the Green New Deal might add up to as much as $93 trillion.  That is just over the first decade. That is quite a tab. It exceeds the annual GDP of the entire world--the annual GDP of the entire world as of 2017. It would mean historic tax increases, historic new debt, and even that would only begin to scratch the surface. Bear in mind, the sticker price doesn't even begin to capture the full national cost of the economic wound this plan would inflict on our country while all our competitors would be roaring on by.  My colleagues want to pull the emergency brake on the U.S. economy because it isn't ``green'' enough, but global carbon emissions are a global problem. We only produce about 15 percent of the global total. China has already soared past us. They are the world's largest emitter. In recent years, while U.S. emissions have actually been declining, China's share has been growing fast.  We will certainly get to test their new economic security payments for those unable or unwilling to work after the Green New Deal drives all of our domestic manufacturing jobs over to China, India, and our other competitors, who will gladly gobble up our jobs and continue to emit with reckless ambition.  My Democratic colleagues have settled on quite an interesting strategy--maximum pain for American families, with no meaningful change in global carbon emissions.  Since I announced last month that Senators will actually have the opportunity to go on record and vote on this socialist wish list, a funny thing has happened. I am not sure I have ever seen the self-professed supporters of a piece of legislation more angry or irritated that they will actually have to vote on it. They are angry and irritated that they will actually have to vote on it.  Merely bringing their own plan up for a vote--a plan they had characterized as ``an amazing step forward''--is now declared to be a ``diversion'' and a ``sham.'' By one colleague's assessment, by getting their proposal a floor vote, I was creating ``a ploy to try to undermine the Green New Deal by calling a vote.''  I have to say, it is remarkable enough to see a major political party coalesce around a proposal to forcibly remake the entire country according to what is fashionable in Brooklyn and San Francisco, but it is even more stunning to see my colleagues so angry and upset at the opportunity to back up their new philosophy with their votes. What an outrage, to actually vote on something we say we are for.  Well, later today, we will see--the American people will see which of their Senators can do the commonsense thing and vote no on this destructive, socialist daydream, and they will see which Senators are so fully committed to radical, leftwing ideology that they can't even vote no on self-inflicted economic ruin that would take a sledgehammer to America's middle class.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
