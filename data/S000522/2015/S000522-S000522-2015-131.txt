Mr. Speaker, I recently hosted a briefing entitled Catholic Engagement on Nuclear Disarmament: What are the moral questions? and one of the speakers, His Excellency Archbishop Bernardito Auza, Permanent Representative of the Holy See to the United Nations, presented the following statement:       The Holy See has always been morally against nuclear      weapons and has always called for their abolition. It has      worked and continues to work for a world without nuclear      weapons.       In February 1943, two years and a half before the Trinity      test, Pope Pius XII had already voiced deep concern regarding      the violent use of atomic energy. In an address to a meeting      of Western military scientists in 1953, Pope Pius XII said      that the possession of ``ABC'' (Atomic-Biological-Chemical)      weapons made legitimate self-defense against an aggressor a      less likely prospect, because ``if the damage resulting from      war is not comparable with that of the `injustice tolerated,'      one may be obliged `to submit to the injustice.' '' Devoting      his entire 1954 Easter Message to the question of nuclear      weapons, he spoke of the effects of a nuclear war by evoking      ``the vision of vast territories rendered uninhabitable and      useless to mankind . . . transmissible diseases . . . and      monstrous deformities.'' Given such totally uncontrollable      and indiscriminate consequences, the Pope demanded ``the      effective proscription and banishment of atomic warfare,''      calling the arms race a ``costly relationship of mutual      terror.'' This was the first clear papal condemnation of the      nuclear arms race, sixteen years before the Treaty on the      Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).       Already well within the Cold War era and right after the      Cuban missile crisis, Pope Saint John XXIII, in his 1963      Encyclical Pacem in Terris, called for the abolition of      nuclear weapons and for the establishment of an adequate      disarmament program to achieve that end. He spoke very      clearly about the theory or doctrine of deterrence as the      principal cause of the arms race and of arms proliferation      and about the tremendous economic burdens the arms race      provoked. He argued quite extensively that ``justice, right      reason, and the recognition of man's dignity cry out      insistently for a cessation to the arms race. The stockpiles      of armaments that have been built up in various countries      must be reduced reciprocally and simultaneously by the      parties concerned. Nuclear weapons must be banned. A general      agreement must be reached on a suitable disarmament program,      with an effective system of mutual control. Unless this      process of disarmament be thoroughgoing and complete, and      reaches men's very souls, it is impossible to stop the arms      race, or to reduce armaments, or--and this is the main      thing--ultimately to abolish them entirely. Everyone must      sincerely co-operate in the effort to banish fear and the      anxious expectation of war from men's minds. But this      requires that the fundamental principles upon which peace is      based in today's world be replaced by an altogether different      one, namely, the realization that true and lasting peace      among nations cannot consist in the possession of an equal      supply of armaments but only in mutual trust. And we are      confident that this can be achieved, for it is a thing that      not only is dictated by common sense, but is in itself most      desirable and most fruitful of good.''       In his address to the UN General Assembly on 4 October      1965, Pope Paul VI characterized nuclear weapons as      ``nightmares'' and ``dark designs.'' He also stressed that      the weapons themselves ``lead astray the mentality of      peoples.'' His plea of ``jamais plus la guerre,'' of ``war      never again,'' reverberated in the General Assembly Hall. But      his appeal to let weapons fall from our hands, ``especially      the terrible weapons that modern science has given us,'' in      clear reference to nuclear arms, still remains unheeded. Pope      Paul's call to end the nuclear arms race reached its      culmination in his 1977 World Day of Peace message, in which      he demonstrated that nuclear arms offered a false sense of      security. He reiterated this in his message to the U.N.      General Assembly on Disarmament in 1978, calling the peace of      nuclear deterrence ``a tragic illusion.'' He also reiterated      an assertion made earlier in his papacy, that the nuclear      arms race retarded the development of peoples, citing the      ``crying disproportion between the resources in money and      intelligence devoted to the service of death and the      resources devoted to the service of life.''       In 1982, Pope Saint John Paul II addressed a message to the      United Nations General Assembly on its second conference      devoted to Disarmament. The Pope said that in the ``current      conditions of the Cold War, `deterrence,' considered not as      an end in itself but as a step toward a progressive      disarmament, may still be judged morally acceptable.      Nonetheless, in order to ensure peace, it is indispensable      not to be satisfied with this minimum, which is always      susceptible to the real danger of explosion.'' The Holy      Father, therefore, did not countenance deterrence as a      permanent measure.       As time progressed and the central promise of the NPT      remained unfulfilled, the Holy See stepped up its efforts to      argue for the abolition of nuclear weapons. In his 2006 World      Day of Peace Message, Pope Benedict XVI criticized the      argument of nuclear arms for security as ``completely      fallacious'' and affirmed that ``peace requires that all      strive for progressive and concerted nuclear disarmament.''       Since the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT,      there has been an increased attention to the humanitarian      dimension of and the risks associated with nuclear weapons.      This heightened interest was manifested by cross-regional      humanitarian statements in the UN and other regional and      international fora and, in particular, by the organization of      three Conferences on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear      Weapons in Oslo (March 2013), Nayarit (February 2014), and      Vienna (December 2014). These Conferences have seen increased      participation of States, of non-governmental organizations      and of the greater civil society.       During the Vienna Conference, the Holy See presented three      documents: first, the official Statement delivered by the      Delegation of the Holy See; second, the message that Pope      Francis sent to His Excellency Mr. Sebastian Kurz, President      of the Vienna Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of      Nuclear Weapons in December 2014; and, third, a paper      entitled ``Nuclear Disarmament: Time for Abolition.''       On April 9, 2015, the Permanent Observer Mission of the      Holy See to the United Nations in New York organized a      conference entitled ``Nuclear Weapons and the Moral      Compass.'' The Speakers were neither nuclear scientists nor      political authorities, but rather religious leaders: an      Anglican Bishop, a Rabbi, an Evangelical Minister, an Imam,      and a Catholic Bishop in the person of Bishop Oscar Cantuu,      Bishop of Las Cruces and Chairman of the USCCB Committee on      International Justice and Peace.       The objective of the Conference was to insist on and      strengthen the moral argument against not only the use but      also the possession of nuclear weapons. Arguing against the      policy of deterrence, the Conference served to echo and      further disseminate the Paper that the Holy See presented in      Vienna and Pope Francis's strong stand for the abolition of      nuclear weapons The timing of the Conference was in      anticipation of the then imminent Ninth Review Conference on      the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which      opened yesterday at the UN in New York and will continue      until May 22.       The NPT is one of the best known and most adhered to      Treaties, with Palestine being the 191st Party to it. The      Holy See has been a Party to the NPT since the very      beginning, not because it has nuclear weapons or has to be      constrained from developing nuclear weapons capabilities, but      to encourage nuclear possessing States to abolish their      nuclear weapons, to dissuade non-nuclear possessing States      from acquiring or developing nuclear capabilities, and to      encourage international cooperation on the peaceful uses of      nuclear energy.       The documents that the Holy See presented in Vienna      advanced anew the moral argument against both the possession      and the use of nuclear weapons, and aimed to sustain and      advance the discussion along this line.       The Holy See considers it a moral and humanitarian      imperative to advance the efforts towards the final objective      of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. It argues that      disarmament treaties are not just legal obligations; they are      also moral commitments based on trust between States, rooted      in the trust that citizens place in their governments. If      commitments to nuclear disarmament are not made in good faith      and consequently result in breaches of trust, the      proliferation of such weapons would be the logical corollary.       Despite some progress and much effort on the part of many,      nuclear disarmament is currently in crisis. The institutions      that are     supposed to move this process forward have been blocked for      years. The central promise of the NPT has remained a dream.      In fact, while the pre-NPT nuclear power countries not only      have not disarmed but are also modernizing their nuclear      arsenals, some pre-NPT non-nuclear countries have acquired or      are in the process of acquiring nuclear arms capabilities.      What is even more terrifying is the possibility that non-     state actors, like terrorist and extremist organizations,      could acquire nuclear weapons.       The possession of nuclear weapons and the reliance on      nuclear deterrence have had a very negative impact on      relations between and among States. National security often      comes up in discussions on nuclear weapons. All States have      the right to national security, but this principle must not      be applied in a partial and discriminatory manner, for      example, when one State affirms that it needs nuclear weapons      for its national security, while at the same time affirming      that another State cannot have them. It is urgent to revisit      in a transparent and honest manner the definition made by      States, especially the nuclear weapons states, of their      national security.       Nuclear weapons cannot create for us a stable and secure      world. Peace and international stability cannot be founded on      mutually-assured destruction or on the threat of total      destruction. The Holy See believes that peace cannot be      reduced solely to maintaining a balance of power between      enemies. On the contrary, as Pope Francis affirms in his      letter to the President of the Vienna Conference, ``Peace      must be built on justice, socio-economic development,      freedom, respect for human rights, the participation of all      in public affairs and the building of trust between      peoples.''       In its argument against the possession and use of nuclear      weapons, the Holy See also focuses attention on (1) the costs      of the nuclear stalemate to the global common good; (2) the      ``illusions of security'' inherent in the possession of      nuclear arms; (3) the inequality at the root of the non-     proliferation regime according to the NPT; and (4) the      enormous toll that current nuclear policies take on the poor      and on the world's priorities.       The United Nations will soon adopt the Post-2015      Sustainable Development Agenda. The Sustainable Development      Goals contained therein are daunting and require enormous      means to implement. It would be naiive and myopic if we seek      to assure world peace and security through nuclear weapons      rather than through the eradication of extreme poverty,      making healthcare and education accessible to all, and      promoting peaceful institutions and societies through      dialogue and solidarity.       For our own good and that of future generations, we have no      reasonable and moral option other than the abolition of      nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a global problem and      they impact all countries and all peoples, including future      generations. Moreover, ever-growing interdependence and      globalization demand that whatever response we may have      against the threat of nuclear weapons must be collective and      concerted, based on reciprocal trust.       Arguing for nuclear abolition from the moral perspective,      the Holy See appeals to human consciences. As Paul VI      affirmed in his 1965 Address to the United Nations General      Assembly, ``Today, as never before, in an era marked by such      human progress, there is need for an appeal to the moral      conscience of man. For the danger comes, not from progress,      nor from science. The real danger comes from man himself, who      has at his disposal ever more powerful instruments, which can      be used for destruction as for the loftiest conquests.''       No one could ever say that a world without nuclear weapons      is easily achievable. It is not; it is extremely arduous; it      is even a utopia for some. But there is no alternative than      to work unceasingly towards its achievement. As President      John F. Kennedy said in his Commencement Address at the      American University on 10 June 1963, ``The pursuit of peace      is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war--and frequently the      words of the pursuers fall on deaf ears. But we have no more      urgent task.''       Let me conclude by reaffirming the conviction that Pope      Francis expressed in his December 2014 message to the      President of the Vienna Conference on the Humanitarian Impact      of Nuclear Weapons: ``I am convinced that the desire for      peace and fraternity planted deep in the human heart will      bear fruit in concrete ways to ensure that nuclear weapons      are banned once and for all, to the benefit of our common      home.''                          ____________________
