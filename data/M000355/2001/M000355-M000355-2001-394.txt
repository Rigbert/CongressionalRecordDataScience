 President, the next amendment will be on the Democratic side, offered by Senator Landrieu. We are in the process of looking at it now. We think it may well be accepted. Shortly, Senator Landrieu will send that amendment to the desk and make her statement about it.  Let me say that after that, Senator Specter will be recognized to offer an amendment, and Senator Dodd and I are talking about the possibility of Senator Specter being followed by Senator Helms. I believe the majority leader would like for us to vote a couple more times tonight. Senators may expect additional votes.
