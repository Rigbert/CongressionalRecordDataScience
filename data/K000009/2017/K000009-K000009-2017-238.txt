Speaker, on October 15, the world celebrated International Day of Rural Women and the invaluable contribution of women farmers.  To do our part in expressing solidarity, I rise to introduce this Resolution to commemorate this every important day.  According to the U.N., rural women makeup over one-quarter of the total population and represent 43 percent of the agricultural workforce. They play a critical role in agricultural production, food security and economic stability.  Women serve as the bedrock of society. They feed the world's families. They feed our neighbors, and our countrymen. They are important role models for younger generations. Unfortunately, despite this, they still face many societal and economic limitations both here and abroad.  This Resolution shines a light on women farmers and empowers them to succeed as entrepreneurs. It calls on the people of the U.S. and the world to recognize their critical contribution and to recommit to reducing these barriers and limitations.  I urge my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________
