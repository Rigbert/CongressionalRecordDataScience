 He will be remembered as a skilled businessman, a devoted public servant, and a man who deeply cared about the city of Tuscaloosa.  A native of Mobile, Hilliard graduated from the University of Alabama in 1957. He went on to serve our country as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps and served for 14 years in the Reserves, retiring with the rank of major.  Hilliard was the president of Duckworth-Morris Insurance Company and also served with distinction four terms as finance and waterworks commissioner on the Tuscaloosa City Commission. During those 16 years, he played an instrumental role in the creation of the mayor-council model of municipal government that we know today. He was also influential in the efforts that led to Congress passing the Lake Tuscaloosa Protection Act, which prevented the Federal Government from installing a hydroelectric powerplant on Lake Tuscaloosa's dam in 1970.  In addition to his many years of service to the city of Tuscaloosa, Hilliard was a true leader in his community--serving on numerous boards and working with various charitable and business organizations. He served on the board of directors of First Alabama Bank, was the president of the United Way of West Alabama, and was president and director of the Exchange Club of Tuscaloosa. He also served as a board member and officer of the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama, was a member of the board of directors and membership chairman of the YMCA of Tuscaloosa, and was the Chairman of the Heart Fund Drive. Hilliard was on the DCH Foundation Board, was director of the Alabama League of Municipalities, and was a deacon of First Presbyterian Church of Tuscaloosa.  Hilliard's many accomplishments, as well as his contributions to the city of Tuscaloosa and West Alabama, will not be soon forgotten. Tuscaloosa named the city's wastewater treatment plant after him in 1998. The Community Foundation of West Alabama named him a ``Pillar of West Alabama'' in 2010 for his dedicated efforts and service to the area.  The city of Tuscaloosa and the State of Alabama were fortunate to have a leader and a great man like Hilliard Fletcher, and he will be sorely missed. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Betty; his daughter, Beth Lubin; and his sons, Douglas and Curtis, as they celebrate his many life accomplishments and mourn this great loss.                          ____________________
