Mr. Chairman, I have been in my office listening to the debate on the gentleman's amendment, and I have never heard so much energy wasted on an amendment that very frankly does damage to this Nation and not to the monuments. When I hear people talk about the Statute of Liberty and the Grand Canyon, they are full of it. That is really, in fact, not what this is all about.  Mr. Chairman, if my colleagues want to know what it is about, read this report called ``A Monumental Abuse: The Clinton Administration's Campaign of Misinformation in the Establishment of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument.'' I have it right here. This was passed by the Committee on Resources. Read it. It is the greatest blatant political piece of trash that administration did. There was no danger to that area of the Escalante, but because the environmentalists wanted it and Kathleen McGinty wanted it, they set this vast area of land, without consulting with the governor and without consulting with the local representative, and by the way he lost, because there was a huge coal deposit there and they did not want that coal deposit developed. Read your record. Do not vote for this amendment. It is nothing but a bunch of hot air.
