 President, I rise today in strong opposition to the nomination of Lawrence VanDyke to a Nevada seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of letters and other documents relevant to Mr. VanDyke's nomination following my remarks.  Mr. VanDyke's temperament and integrity have been called into question by his colleagues and the American Bar Association, which rated him ``Not Qualified'' for the Federal bench. Mr. VanDyke's record, including his opposition to rights of LGBT individuals and commonsense gun control, is far outside the mainstream.  First, I want to discuss concerns raised by Mr. VanDyke's colleagues regarding his temperament, competence, and work ethic.
