 President, the Senator is absolutely right. Let me emphasize it this way. I was on a radio program in Iowa yesterday, where a lady called me, and I had been saying, as the Senator has just said, that you have to wait until 2014 for this program to go into effect. She said: You are telling me you are going to pass this bill right now, but we have to wait until 2014 until we get any benefit from it? She didn't talk about the taxes, as theSenator is, but the taxes go into effect. Another smokescreen is, you have 10 years of tax increases, fee increases, and the program is 6 years long, but the taxes are 10 years long. So it is nice for the CBO to say: Yes, this is balanced and maybe even has a surplus in it. But over the long term, this program does not cost just $848 billion. I hope I answered your question.
