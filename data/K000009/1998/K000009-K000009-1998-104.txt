Speaker, I rise today to honor a true patriot and outstanding American, Gen. Walter A. Churchill. On September 21, 1998, Gen. Churchill lost his battle to a series of debilitating strokes and passed away at the age of 94. He was a friend to us all. Yes, he was a demanding General but even more he was a compassionate human being.  Enlisting in the Marine Corps at the young age of nineteen, Gen. Churchill remains one of only a few to rise to the rank of Marine Corps General. He retired on December 1, 1963, following 41 years and eight days of service to our country. In addition to his active membership in the Marine Corps League, Gen. Churchill established himself as a local political leader and a successful businessman in our district.  Gen. Churchill knew how to build community and a better future. He followed in the footsteps of his father and uncle in 1917, and managed a successful grocery business in northwest Ohio. He became the national leader in one stop shopping in 1971, when he opened the Monroe Street store. Always an innovator in the business world, Mr. Churchill has provided countless numbers of young people with the opportunity to earn money while attending college, and many retirees have found employment in his stores to supplement their retirement income. He was always helping others.  Mr. Churchill served as a loyal member of the Toledo Rotary Club where he maintained 37 years of perfect attendance. He served on the Board of Directors of the Toledo Better Business Bureau, the Toledo Small Business Association, and he served as president of the National Association of Retail Grocers. He was not just a member of these organizations but he was an activist. On many occasions, he traveled to Washington, DC to bring his views on national issues to those serving in elected life. He always came with a twinkle in his eye and a remarkable zest for life.  Gen. Churchill's commitment to his employees and our community, and his love for our country will be missed by all who had the pleasure to know him. A mighty oak fell when he passed from this life.  On behalf of our entire community, we extend deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Gen. Walter A. Churchill. He was ``always faithful.''                          ____________________
