President, I don't think anyone is going to say we haven't done everything we could to go through the committee process to get a hearing. I just flat gave up. That is why we have this rule.  I will be looking forward to taking the next steps. I know there are a lot of people out there who want to have this type of justice afforded the pilots of the United States of America, the same as every other citizen enjoys.  With that, I appreciate the patience of my colleagues, because I know we have other business, and I yield the floor.
