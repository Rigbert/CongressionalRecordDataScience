President, I understood we were in a position to move forward on the IP bill, plus a number of judges who are on the calendar. As Members know, in a rather extraordinary fashion, I expedited the consideration of 10 judges, notwithstandingthe Thurmond rule and the late date and had gotten support from my side for not holding them over the normal time. I had understood we had an agreement to move forward on the IP bill, plus four or five of these judges this morning. That seems to be somewhat in doubt. According to the House, the IP bill has to go over now. All these matters, I suppose, we could bring them up next year, but I would rather get them done this year.
