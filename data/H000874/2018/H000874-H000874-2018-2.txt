Speaker, the majority leader agreed to have a colloquy on the schedule. He has given us the schedule.  Obviously, there are still a lot of questions, but I understand, and I appreciate the majority leader bringing us as much up to date as he can.  Will the flood vote later this afternoon or this evening be the last vote that the gentleman would perceive?  Mr. McCARTHY. For today, yes. I don't foresee more votes until the Senate acts, if that helps clarify for everyone.
