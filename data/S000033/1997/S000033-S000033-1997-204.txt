 Speaker, at a time when some American corporations commonly use large-scale layoffs in order to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in profits on the stock market, demand give-backs in order to pit American workers in competition with cheap, unprotected foreign workers, and invest overseas to escape health, safety, and environmental standards here at home, we do not believe that the United States Government should be rewarding such shortsighted companies with billions of dollars in federal contracts vis-a-vis companies that are good corporate citizens here at home and overseas. Instead, we should be using the purchasing power of the Federal Government to reward socially responsible and environmentally responsible companies.  Every year the U.S. Government buys more than $200 billion in goods and services, ranging from weapons systems to cleaning supplies, making it the largest customer in the American marketplace. This purchasing power needs to be harnessed--through targeted procurement preferences--and used as an engine of progress and as a powerful source of marketplace leverage to reward exemplary corporate behavior in the bottom line.  The economist Adam Smith recognized that free markets, left to their own devices, do not deal with matters of economic justice and social equity, let alone environmental sustainability. In that vein, our Federal Government should also be doing more than just trying to save a buck. Uncle Sam should be an enlightened consumer and encourage more of the business community to practice good corporate citizenship. Just as with the individual citizen, the good corporate citizen should be expected to act ethically and should be rewarded accordingly in the marketplace. That means not only acting responsibly as a company in producing goods and services, but also responding to the needs and interests of host communities as well as employees and customers. This approach is far from revolutionary because companies of all sizes and sectors have realized that good conduct can result in long-term profitability. That is why more than 100 U.S. companies have already adopted codes of conduct to govern their internal operations and external affairs.  My colleagues, Congressmen Evans, Filner, Lipinski, and Lewis join me today in introducing legislation to give a substantial preference, when bidding on Federal contracts, to companies that adopt and enforce a corporate code of conduct and open their operations to outside monitoring of compliance. In other words, priority will go to companies which provide a safe and healthy workplace, avoid racial or gender discrimination, comply with laws that ensure fair competition, and uphold a responsible environmental record at home and in their overseas operations.  Specifically, our bill--the Good Corporate Citizenship and Federal Procurement Incentives Act--does the following:  Requires the director of each Federal agency to establish procedures to give a preference to contracting with companies that have adopted and are enforcing codes of conduct;  Requires that corporate codes of conduct build upon the workplace code of conduct recently agreed upon by the Apparel Industry Partnership as well as the model business principles developed and announced in 1995 after lengthy White House consultations with business leaders, public interest groups, and concerned individuals;  Ensures that all employees are well informed about the specific provisions of the corporate code of conduct adopted by their employing company;  Establishes an annual Federal interagency review, a public petition process, and public hearings to be spearheaded by the U.S. Department of Commerce to investigate and determine whether companies that have been awarded preferences are, in fact, complying with and enforcing their corporate codes of conduct;  Allows any person or organization--including independent monitors--with pertinent factual information to file a petition and request a public hearing on evidence that a company that has received or is receiving a procurement preference is not in compliance with its own corporate code of conduct; and  Authorizes Federal agencies to take into account when extending trade mission support, OPIC/EX-IM Bank assistance and other taxpayer-financed benefits and to withdraw, suspend, or limit procurement preferences awarded on a contract or company basis or both as a result of investigations and public hearing(s) in which it is determined that a company is not enforcing its corporate code of conduct. The decisions of Federal agencies in this regard would also be subject to judicial review.  Mr. Speaker, this is very timely and ground-breaking legislation to give a significant preference in the awarding of more than $200 billion in Federal contracts to U.S. companies that practice good corporate citizenship day in and day out.                          ____________________
