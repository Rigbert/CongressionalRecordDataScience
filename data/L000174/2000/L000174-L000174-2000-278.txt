President, I want to also thank the distinguished majority leader for his work in bringing this up. This can sometimes be a contentious bill, as he knows. His efforts in working also with the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, paid off. And the distinguished majority leader had the patience to allow Senator McConnell and me to work through an awful lot of amendments on both sides of the aisle.  I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid. We heard periodically the crunch in the Cloakroom as he broke a few arms, but we moved it through and got an overwhelming vote.  Senator McConnell showed close cooperation with me and with Senators on both sides of the aisle throughout the process. I enjoy working with him. I know he agrees we need more resources for some of these issues, and we will work together to get them.  We have many interests around the world. We know U.S. leadership costs money. I think Senator McConnell and I have tried to show a bipartisan cohesion on that.  I thank the staff. They spent many long days and late nights, many long weekends in getting this far. I appreciate that. Robin Cleveland, Senator McConnell's chief of staff on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, as always, has been a pleasure to work with. She shows enormous competence and knowledge. I appreciate that. Her assistant, Jennifer Chartrand, was indispensable to this. Jay Kimmitt on the committee staff and Billy Piper on Senator McConnell's personal staff have all been of great help.  On the Democratic side, I mention several. First, I want to mention Cara Thanassi of my staff who was there from start to finish. Ms. Thanassi, on the floor now with me, is a Vermonter. She will be heading back to graduate school, only after she spends a month in East Timor. I am proud of her and what she has done for the Senate. She has shown the best attributes of a true Vermonter.  J.P. Dowd, my legislative director, helped on the Senate floor during the many busy times of the last few days. Of course, Tim Rieser, the Democratic clerk on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, has worked on these issues in the Senate for nearly 15 years. He probably has as great an institutional memory on the foreign policy issues as anybody in the Senate staff or Senate and was truly indispensable.  Again, I thank the leader for his help in getting the Senate this far.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
