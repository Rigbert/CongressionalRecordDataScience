Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding and I would first want to thank the chair of the committee for the expeditious, speed-of-light consideration of this legislation that literally was introduced a month and a half ago as well as thanking my colleague from Illinois for ensuring that it was heard before Congress adjourned. I also would be remiss if I did not thank the members of the Indiana delegation who joined me in this effort.  Mr. Speaker, I do rise to urge my colleagues to support this legislation to rename a post office in East Chicago, Indiana in honor of Lance Corporal Harold Gomez. Corporal Gomez was the first resident of East Chicago to die during the Vietnam War and his community would like to honor him in this special way.  Corporal Gomez was born in East Chicago in 1946. After working briefly at Inland Steel Company, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and was sent to Vietnam in 1966. Corporal Gomez quickly became a fire team leader in a rifle company of the Third Marine Corps in Vietnam. He was awarded the Silver Star Medal posthumously for valiant leadership and bravery during his service, earning particular praise for his actions during the February 21, 1967 battle in which he died. Corporal Gomez's military awards also include the Purple Heart Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Rifle Sharpshooters Badge.  In Harold Gomez's short life, he touched many lives and was admired by both friends and colleagues. I am deeply honored to offer this legislation to honor a true hero of northwest Indiana and our country. Corporal Gomez distinguished himself in combat and is a source of inspiration to many citizens of East Chicago and the rest of the northwest Indiana community. He is worthy of this honor.  On behalf of northwest Indiana's many veterans, I am proud to support this legislation to name an East Chicago post office in honor of Corporal Harold Gomez.
