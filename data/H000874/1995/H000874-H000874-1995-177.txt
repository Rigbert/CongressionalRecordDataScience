Speaker, I ask unanimous consent, and this is the point I wanted to make, that this debate which is an important debate for us to have, but it is an important debate to have with notice to Members in time to reflect and frankly time to hear from the public, that we delay this debate and set aside 2 hours for debate on this resolution, that it be open for at least one amendment, 1 week from tomorrow.
