Is it not part of an interesting pattern that when we talk about the economy, jobs, and growth, we talk about tax breaks primarily for wealthy people, but when we talk about struggling working families, we cannot seem to find an increase in the minimum wage, we cannot find a child tax credit for people in lower income categories? Why is it that this administration, this Government, turns a blind eye to the people who are struggling with the lower income jobs, the middle-income jobs, really the backbone of America's economy, people who need the help the most? Does not this minimum wage issue tell us the same story?  There is absolutely no recognition or sensitivity by this administration and the White House to these people. Here we stand, 2\1/2\ years into this administration, and I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, has President Bush suggested at any point in those 2\1/2\ years any increase in the minimum wage to help people who are struggling to survive in this tough economy?
