You had to go to court and have a decision made by the judge in discovery as to whether they would be required to produce the document. You naturally believed, if they were holding back a document, then certainly it might be a document that would compromise their position or jeopardize their position.  I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont, is it not a fact now that because of this long delay and because of this intransigence by the White House to release these documents, there is more and more curiosity as to what is contained in them? Here we have a nominee who, despite an excellent academic resume, really has little to show in terms of legal writings or things that give us an insight into why he should be selected for a lifetime appointment to the DC Circuit Court.  I ask the Senator from Vermont, isn't it fairly obvious at this point that, if the White House will release these documents and start the orderly process, then we can have a final disposition of Mr. Estrada, just as soon as they respond?
