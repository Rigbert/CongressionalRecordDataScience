Speaker, I wish to congratulate the heroes and heroines of compassion in our community for their exceptional devotion to serving the needs of others. In so doing, the ethic they set creates a better way of life for people across our region and enriches the human condition. The Charter for Compassion was created by Karen Armstrong, author of many interfaith books in 2008. Her wish was that the faith leaders of the world would acknowledge their core common value of compassion in a simple document and the response to her idea for Heroes of Compassion was phenomenal. Greater Toledo has many individuals and organizations that qualify as Heroes of Compassion. But many of these individuals and institutions are unsung heroes and heroines. Their stories of compassion are untold, while news of violence and conflict make headlines. The First Heroes of Compassion of Toledo were honored at the 11th Annual MultiFaith Banquet on March 11, 2012 at the Franciscan Center at Lourdes University, and later at a community gathering at the Unitarian Universalist Church on Glendale Ave. The First Heroes of Compassion included:  Sr. Mary Angelita Abair: Decades of work in central Toledo with the poor, marginalized, imprisoned, and disabled;  Cherry Street Mission: Emergency shelter, food and other assistance;  Dr. Lawrence V.

Doneghy: Inner city youth mentor and support for prostate cancer awareness;  Fr.
