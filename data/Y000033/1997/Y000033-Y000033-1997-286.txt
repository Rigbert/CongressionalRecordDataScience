Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce legislation today to extend the African Elephant Conservation Act of 1988, an historic conservation measure that continues to be successful in its ongoing efforts to save the flagship species of the African Continent.  By way of background, my colleagues may recall that by the late 1980's, the population of African elephants had declined by almost half. In 1979, the total elephant population in Africa was approximately 1.3 million animals. In 1987, fewer than 700,000 African elephants were alive.  While drought, disease, and human population growth contributed to this dramatic decline, the illegal killing or poaching of elephants for their ivory tusks was the single most important reason why thousands of these magnificent animals were slaughtered. During its peak, as much as 800 tons of ivory were exported from Africa each year, equivalent to the deaths of up to 80,000 elephants annually.  In response to this serious problem, Congress enacted the African Elephant Conservation Act--Public Law 100-478. A primary objective of this law was to assist impoverished African nations in their efforts to stop poaching and to develop more effective elephant conservation programs. To accomplish that goal, the legislation created the African Elephant Conservation Fund.  Since its creation, Congress has appropriated over $6 million to fund some 48 conservation projects in 17 range States throughout Africa. In addition, over $7 million has been generated through private matching money to augment the Federal support made available through the grant program.  With these funds, resources have been allocated for conservation projects to purchase antipoaching equipment for wildlife rangers, create a comprehensive reference library on the African elephant, undertake elephant population census, develop and implement elephant conservation plans, and move elephants from drought regions in Zimbabwe. In fact, the Zimbabwe project was the first time in history that such a large number of elephants were successfully translocated to new habitats.  Without these conservation projects, I am convinced that the African elephant would have continued to decline and would have disappeared from much of its historic range. Instead, what has happened is that the population has stabilized and, in fact, is increasing in southern Africa, the international price of ivory remains depressed, and wildlife rangers are now much better equipped to stop unscrupulous individuals who are intent on illegally killing elephants.  The African Elephant Conservation Fund has provided desperately needed capital for projects in various African countries and a diverse group of internationally recognized conservation groups, including the African Safari Club of Washington, DC, the African Wildlife Foundation, Safari Club International, and the World Wildlife Fund, has participated in these efforts. In fact, the African Elephant Conservation Fund has been the only continuous source of new money for African elephant conservation efforts for the past 8 years.  In June of last year, the House Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans conducted an oversight hearing on the effectiveness of the African Elephant Conservation Fund. At that time, a representative of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service testified that the Fund ``provided a critical incentive for governments of the world, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to work together for a common conservation goal. This is not a hand out, but a helping hand.''  While the African Elephant Conservation Fund has facilitated the development of a number of successful conservation projects, the battle to ensure the long-term survival of the African elephant has not yet been won. In fact, it is essential that this critical investment be continued in the future. Therefore, the fundamental purpose of my legislation is to extend the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to expend money from the African Elephant Conservation Fund beyond its statutory expiration date of September 30, 1998. I am proposing that the authorization of appropriations for the fund be extended until September 30, 2002.  With this extension, I am confident that additional worthwhile conservation projects will be funded and that the African elephant will survive in its natural habitat for many future generations.  I urge my colleagues to join with me in this effort by supporting the African Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act of 1997.                          ____________________
