Thank you to the distinguished ranking member, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership, for her leadership on human rights. She has been a stalwart for years, and I want to thank her for her tremendous leadership.  I want to thank Mr. McGovern for sponsoring this, and for his commitment as well.  And I especially want to thank Congressman Frank Wolf with whom I've been in Congress now for 28 years. And there is no one that I know or have ever met who cares more deeply, more passionately, more fervently, nor works more effectively to promote human rights around the globe. I have traveled with Frank. I would be more than happy to carry his bags. He is just such a tremendous individual.  I'll never forget when the International Religious Freedom Act was being considered. It was his legislation. He was the prime sponsor. I held a number of hearings on it as chairman of the Global Human Rights Subcommittee on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and there was significant opposition to that legislation. The Clinton administration was against it, on the record, said so in hearings.  Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Labor and Human Rights, John Shattuck, couldn't have made it more clear. They made a bogus argument that the legislation would set up a hierarchy of human rights, vis-a-vis, all other human rights.  Our argument was religious freedom was integral, and a necessary part of a fabric of protecting everyone who was weak and disenfranchised. That includes religious believers, regardless of what their belief system might be. And we wanted to speak out in a very powerful way.  Mr. Wolf pushed that bill to a successful completion. It ended up being signed into law and the International Committee for Religious Freedom, its designation of countries of particular concern, those egregious violators of religious liberties now get put on a list. They're subject to sanctions. We have an ambassador at large who combs the Earth promoting religious liberty and freedom, and then issues reports that holds countries to account and speaks truth to power. That's all a direct result of Congressman Frank Wolf, the prime sponsor of legislation that was as dead as a door nail when he introduced it because of opposition in very high places and indifference.  So it is very fitting that Mr. Wolf will be serving as cochair of this extraordinarily important Human Rights Commission, named very aptly and very importantly after another great man, Congressman Tom Lantos. No one has done more on such issues as anti-Semitism than Congressman Lantos, Chairman Lantos, who is not, sadly, with us, but I'm sure is looking down from heaven with a great smile on his face because he cared passionately about human rights as well.  Madam Speaker so it ought to be clear, I believe it is time to turn the Caucus into a Commission. When the Human Rights Caucus was founded back in 1983, human rights was, at best, a foreign policy sideshow, an obligatory mention, often uttered after the more ``weighty matters'' of statecraft took place, like trade and other issues. It was always at the end if at all. An afterthought. It always had some asterisk next to it on the talking point memo. In case after case, high level diplomats would essentially say, oh yeah, by the way, I have to bring up human rights, because when I go back home I have to mention it. And many of our Secretaries of State, with some exceptions, often would take it to that point. It was never a central core issue in our foreign policy. There was little predictability or consistency.  The Caucus certainly has helped move human rights concerns forward. The Commission, I believe, will take it to the next level.  I hope that more Members will realize that genuine respect for humanrights is the key to good governance. It's also the key, if you want intellectual property rights respected. If you want contract law observed and honored in places like China where human rights are violated with impunity, respect fundamental human rights for the individual. Stop torturing. Protect women from the violence of coercive population control and forced abortion. Help the Falun Gong and the Christians and the Uighurs and the Buddhists and all the others, the Catholic bishops who are languishing in prison. Get it right on fundamental human rights and you also help on the trade side as well, because if they respect one, if they respect their own people, they'll adhere to contract law and intellectual property rights.  I do believe that we must care for and protect all, no exceptions, everywhere, every place, every time from violence; and from my point of view, that includes unborn children, newly born children, the handicapped, disabled; it includes those who are of a religious denomination that some government official thinks ought not to have their rights or liberties. It is about everyone being included. Nobody being excluded. The politics of inclusion. And again, for me that means the unborn child and everyone else who is weak and at risk.  I do believe that we have to, Madam Speaker, realize that human rights can be respected. It is a matter of political will. It is a matter of understanding and empathizing. Get in the minds and hearts of victims and get motivated. Go into the prison, empathize with someone who has been victimized by torture. And we all come out with a different, enlightened, compassionate perspective. Empowered and knowledgable, we then must--we have a duty--to act!  We'll never know the full extent of the Caucus's success over these 25 years, the impact that it has had, but I believe it has had a tremendously positive impact, as a result of broad bipartisan action, Democrats and Republicans, staff, doing yeoman's work. Hans was mentioned a moment ago. He's a fighter. There are so many who have done so much, often without any kind of accolade whatsoever, but they stand up and they do the hard work of human rights, and they do it each and every day because they care, because they love and because they have compassion.                              {time}  1700  Again, this is a resolution that takes the Human Rights Caucus to the next level, and I think it's about time we did it. This Congress, I think, will be much improved; we will have more insights. Good staffing does make a difference. We've had great staffing, but I think now as we build out that staff, I think more victimized people everywhere will be represented.
