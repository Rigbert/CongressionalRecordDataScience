President, last month Senate Republicans filibustered the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to fill a vacancy on the D.C. Circuit that arose when Chief Justice Roberts left the D.C. Circuit to join the Supreme Court 8 years ago. Caitlin Halligan is a woman who is extraordinarily well-qualified and amongst the most qualified judicial nominees I have seen from any administration. It is a shame that narrow special interests hold such influence that Senate Republicans blocked an up-or-down vote on her confirmation with multiple filibusters of her nomination and procedural objections that required her to be nominated five times over the last 3 years.  Had she received an up-or-down vote, I am certain she would have been confirmed and been an outstanding judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Instead, all Senate Republicans but one supported the filibuster and refused to vote up or down on this highly-qualified woman to fill a needed judgeship on the D.C. Circuit. Senate Republicans attacked her for legal advocacy on behalf of her client, the State of New York. It is wrong to attribute the legal positions a lawyer takes when advocating for a client with what that person would do as an impartial judge. That is not the American tradition. That is not what Republicans insisted was the standard for nominees of Republican Presidents but that is what they did to derail the nomination of Caitlin Halligan.  Also disconcerting were the comments by Republicans after their filibuster in which they gloated about payback. That, too, is wrong. It does our Nation and our Federal judiciary no good when they place their desire to engage in partisan tit-for-tat over the needs of the American people. I rejected that approach while moving to confirm 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees in just 17 months in 2001 and 2002.  The filibuster of the nomination of Miguel Estrada was different. It was to obtain access to information about his work and whether he acted ideologically as his supervisor at the Office of Solicitor General had alleged. Had we gotten access to those materials, there would have been a vote on the Estrada nomination. Republican Senators now demand access to all sorts of materials while filibustering for the first time in our history the Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, as well as the nominee to head the CIA and judicial nominees. They cannot do that and still complain about the Estrada nomination.  Now that Senate Republicans have during the last 4 years filibustered more of President Obama's moderate judicial nominees than were filibustered during President Bush's entire 8 years--67 percent more, in fact--I urge them to abandon their misjudged efforts that sacrifice outstanding judges for purposes of partisan payback.  Today the Senate will finally consider another circuit court nomination that has been delayed for no good reason. The nomination of Judge Patty Shwartz of New Jersey to the Third Circuit has been needlessly stalled for 13 months since being favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. This is another of the many judicial nominees who could have been confirmed last year. She is another qualified nominee who is supported by her home state Senators and by the Republican Governor of New Jersey. After this prolonged and unnecessary delay, I am pleased that she will finally be allowed to join the Third Circuit to serve the people of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the Virgin Islands.  In 10 years as a United States Magistrate Judge in the District of New Jersey, Judge Shwartz has handled more than 4,000 civil and criminal cases and presided over 14 cases that have gone to verdict or final judgment, including 11 jury trials. Before becoming a judge, Judge Shwartz spent 14 years as an assistant U.S. attorney in the District of New Jersey, where she ultimately rose to become chief of the Criminal Division. During her time as an assistant U.S. attorney, Judge Shwartz tried more than 15 jury cases to verdict, all as sole or chief counsel. It was while serving in the U.S. attorneys Office that Chris Cristie, then U.S. attorney and current Governor of New Jersey, became acquainted with her and her work.  Governor Christie has written to the committee in support of Judge Shwartz's nomination. He said that she ``was an impressive Criminal Chief; hard working, bright, articulate, great with people and conversant with the law.'' He added: ``As a Magistrate Judge, she also performed admirably and garnered the respect of the entire legal community. Again, her hard work, amiable personality, patience, intelligence, and knowledge of the law were lauded by all who appeared before her.'' I ask unanimous consent that his full letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated Judge Shwartz unanimously well qualified, the highest possible rating from its nonpartisan peer review. She has the support of Senator Lautenberg and Senator Menendez.  By any objective measure, Judge Shwartz is a nominee with solid legal credentials and qualifications. Rather than evaluating her on her record, some have tried to claim there is an issue because Senator Menendez met with her before supporting her. They infer, despite denials by the nominee and Senator Menendez, that she must have made him some untoward commitment on how she would rule on some matter. There is no basis for that claim.  It is past time for the Senate to consider her nomination on the merits of her record and to confirm her. Her nomination has been stalled on the Senate floor for 13 months. This is just one example of the unnecessary delays that prompted a New York Times editorial about the delays in filling judicial vacancies. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that editorial be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  Judged on her qualifications and her record, Judge Patty Shwartz should be confirmed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. She should not have been delayed for more than a year. Sadly, this is not an isolated case but one in a steady pattern of obstruction. This is especially harmful at a time when judicial vacancies remain above 80. Filibusters and delays based on fictions do not help Americans seeking justice in ourFederal courts. Instead, they cause delays, overcrowded dockets, overburdened courts and have gone on too long.  When confirmed, Judge Shwartz will be one of just three women serving as active judges on the Third Circuit. It is time to move forward in a bipartisan fashion to vote to confirm this qualified nominee so that she may better serve the American people as a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              State of New Jersey,                                       Office of the Governor,                                   Trenton, NJ, February 11, 2013.     Senator Chuck Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Russell Senate Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators:  I write in support of Magistrate Judge      Patty Shwartz' nomination to be a Judge on the Third Circuit      Court of Appeals. When I became the United States Attorney in      the District of New Jersey in 2001, Judge Shwartz was the      Chief of the Criminal Division, a very important and taxing      job in a large prosecuting office. Judge Shwartz was an      impressive Criminal Chief; hard working, bright, articulate,      great with people and conversant with the law. She remained      my Criminal Chief until she became a Magistrate Judge.       As a Magistrate Judge, she also performed admirably and      garnered the respect of the entire legal community. Again,      her hard work, amiable personality, patience, intelligence      and knowledge of the law were lauded by all who appeared      before her. I am sure that if she were elevated to sit on the      Third Circuit Court of Appeals she would prove an excellent      judge for all of the same reasons she was an excellent      prosecutor and Magistrate Judge. She has my full support for      the position for which I believe she is well suited.       If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.           Very truly yours,                                                   Chris Christie,     Governor.                                  ____                       [From the New York Times]                         Courts Without Judges                        (By the Editorial Board)       The number of vacancies on the nation's federal courts has      reached an astonishingly high level, creating a serious      shortage of judges and undermining the ability of the      nation's court system to bestow justice.       Of 856 federal district and circuit court seats, 85 are      unfilled--a 10 percent vacancy rate and nearly double the      rate at this point in the presidency of George W. Bush. More      than a third of the vacancies have been declared ``judicial      emergencies'' based on court workloads and the length of time      the seats have been empty. By far the most important cause of      this unfortunate state of affairs is the determination of      Senate Republicans, for reasons of politics, ideology and      spite, to confirm as few of President Obama's judicial      choices as possible.       Numbers compiled by the Senate Judiciary Committee tell the      story. Mr. Obama's nominees for seats on federal courts of      appeal, the system's top tier below the Supreme Court, have      waited an average of 148 days for their confirmation vote      following the committee's approval, more than four times      longer than Mr. Bush's nominees. For Mr. Obama's nominees to      federal district courts, the average wait time has been 102      days, compared with 35 days for Mr. Bush's district court      choices.       The prestigious and important United States Court of      Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit offers a      particularly striking example of Republican obstructionism.      The 11-seat court rules on most appeals from federal      regulatory agencies and has exclusive jurisdiction over      national security matters. It has four vacancies; the last      time the Senate confirmed someone to the court was 2006.       Mr. Bush appointed four judges to the court, a feeder to      the Supreme Court, but whether the Senate will allow Mr.      Obama to appoint any remains to be seen. Mr. Obama's first      nominee for the court, Caitlin Halligan, withdrew from      consideration last month after Senate Republicans      filibustered for a second time. Those critics echoed the      National Rifle Association's ridiculous portrayal of her as a      legal activist outside the mainstream because she had filed a      brief in opposition to the gun industry when she was New York      State's solicitor general.       The real reason, as everyone knows, was to prevent Mr.      Obama from adding balance to a generally conservative court.      He may fare better with his latest nominee, Sri Srinivasan, a      lawyer whose background working in the United States      solicitor general's office under both President Bush and      President Obama should help his chances.       Nominees for other important government posts have also      been held up for partisan reasons. Some Republicans say this      is simply payback for the Democrats' filibustering of Bush      nominees. But while neither party should be in the business      of obstructing judicial nominees, unless they are unqualified      or unacceptably extreme, a retaliatory response based on      politics hurts all who rely on courts to protect their rights      and uphold the law.       It is also worth noting that Mr. Obama has not been putting      forth candidates with strong ideological profiles. His      nominees are decidedly moderate, which was not always true of      the Bush judicial choices that the Democrats felt compelled      to filibuster.       Mr. Obama could help reduce the problem by speeding up his      nominations. The White House appears to have sharpened its      focus since the election, but currently, 62 district and      circuit court vacancies have no nominees.       The Halligan filibuster got some Democratic senators      talking about a bolder strategy, including revisiting      filibuster reform and making it harder for senators to      torpedo or delay nominations to judicial vacancies in their      home states. Another proposal is to have Mr. Obama make      simultaneous nominations to fill the four vacancies on the      District of Columbia Circuit, which would force Republicans      to come up with plausible reasons to oppose each of them. In      the face of political paralysis, these ideas are worth      embracing.
