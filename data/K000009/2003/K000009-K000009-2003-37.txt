Speaker, the White House has been backtracking on how it was that fraudulent intelligence information was included by the President in his January State of the Union address delivered in this Chamber. Specifically, the statement by President Bush was that Iraq had sought to buy processed uranium for weapons of mass destruction from Niger, Africa. That information was wrong. Indeed, the documents involved appear to contain forged signatures of leaders from those nations who are no longer in office. How could this kind of information be placed in a State of the Union address?  The current Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. George Tenet, over the weekend has claimed publicly that he will take responsibility for this serious statement that misled Congress, misled the American people and indeed the people of the world about Iraq's intentions and capabilities relative to nuclear weaponry. The real question about this revelation is who exactly knew what and when did they know it? And who is responsible for these words being included in the President's State of the Union address, an address of such major proportion that preceded the invasion?  At the same time as I ponder these questions as I know the American people are, I am in receipt of a letter from an intelligence officer. I have read it and reread it and reread it again. In the letter and in my dealings with intelligence officers, I have been told that they are trained to triple-check, to verify significant intelligence information, triple-check. So when a statement is made in the State of the Union address of such consequence, I ask myself, was it triple-checked? Who really knew what and when did they know it? Surely someone, more than one person in that White House and other places checked and rechecked and thenchecked again every word and every sentence in the speech.  I know the President practiced the speech before coming here. All Presidents do. So who knew what and when did they know it?  A retired intelligence officer from the Marine Corps wrote me this letter just a few months ago, but his words have been coming back to me, and I reread this after these revelations this weekend, and I want to share some of it with my colleagues. He says he is a retired United States Marine Corps officer with over 30 years of active and reserve service. Upon his retirement from the Marine Corps, he has worked in domestic intelligence and law enforcement in our country at a senior level.  He basically informs me, in starting his letter, that his intelligence background is operationally based. But he says in the letter, first of all, there is no such thing as an intelligence failure, Congresswoman. Intelligence is a command function, just as operations is a command function, just as logistics is a command function. If a commander decides to do something that is not supported by intelligence, then that is a command failure, not an intelligence failure.  He wrote to me that in his opinion the evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction had not been vetted through the intelligence community, and he adamantly believes that that process is absolutely critical to an adequate analysis of the question. I thought about those words a great deal.  He says in his letter, look at the decision to go to war in Iraq. Our Commander in Chief decided to go to war, he planned for an operation, and nobody was about to give him any information to the contrary.  I ask myself, even if they had that information? Who had the information? Who knew what and when did they know it? We have a responsibility to the Constitution, to this country and to the people of the world. We ought to get to the bottom of who knew what and when did they know it.                          ____________________
