 President, I believe my Senate colleagues are well aware of how seriously we take our college basketball in my home State of Kentucky. The Kentucky High School Athletic Association, KHSAA, State Basketball Championship has been played every year since 1918 and is truly a special event.  Kentucky is one of three States that does not divide its schools into classes based on size--that means one State, one tournament, and only one champion. Teams that advance out of their district tournaments play in one of sixteen regional tournaments--the winners of which advance to play in the KHSAA Sweet Sixteen in Lexington's legendary Rupp Arena.  This year, over 14,000 fans packed the stands for the championship game and watched Covington Catholic High School defeat Scott County in an overtime thriller. I rise today to pay tribute to the players, coaches and fans of the 2014 champions--the Covington Catholic Colonels.  For the Colonels, led by head coach Scott Ruthsatz, the road to the school's first-ever title was not easy--it seldom is in this grueling, statewide tournament. Covington Catholic found themselves down in the second half in three out of their four Sweet Sixteen games--including the championship. The players never gave up hope, though. On his team's 27 to 18 halftime deficit in the championship game, tournament MVP Nick Ruthsatz--Scott's son--said coolly, ``We've been in this position before and we knew we could pull through.''  As it turned out, Nick's confidence was not misplaced. The Colonels stormed back, tying the game at 47 with only 50 seconds to go, and sending the game into overtime. In the extra period, it was the Colonels staunch defense and clutch free throws that propelled them to a 59 to 51 victory.  The 97th KHSAA Basketball Championship, like so many before it, was an excellent display of athletic ability as well as sportsmanship. This tournament would not be what it is without the efforts of the players, coaches, fans, and teachers of all the participating schools. They are all worthy of our praise.  However, in Kentucky, there can only be one champion. Thus, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating the Covington Catholic Colonels on winning the 2014 KHSAA State Basketball Championship.  An article was recently published in the Cincinnati Enquirer chronicling Covington Catholic High School's championship win. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objections, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From the Cincinnati Enquirer,                              Mar. 24, 2014]        Covington Catholic Rejoices in Historic Basketball Title                            (By James Weber)       Lexington.--Ben Heppler stood at center court on the Rupp      Arena floor and kept looking around at the all the chaos and      celebration around him.       Chaos, celebration and cheer, same first letters as      Covington Catholic Colonels, who were celebrating their first      state basketball championship March 23.       ``I'm trying to soak it all in,'' Heppler said. ``I'll      remember this for the rest of my life.''       Cov Cath outlasted Scott County in overtime, 59-51 Sunday      afternoon, March 23, at the University of Kentucky's historic      basketball arena. It was the third title in Northern Kentucky      history, and the second in the past six tournaments by a      Ninth Region team (Holmes, 2009). It was also the first in      Cov Cath history in its ninth trip to the Sweet 16.       ``It's incredible,'' said senior forward Mark Schult. ``You      dream of it, as a little kid, going out and winning your last      game, and it's hard to believe we actually did it.''       The Colonels finished with a 33-2 record. After losing to      Holmes in the 35th District final, the Colonels won seven      straight games. They trailed in the second half in three of      the four state tourney games.       With a veteran team and most of the student body in      attendance as the Colonel Crazies, it was a great day for      Covington Catholic.       ``It's so special,'' said head coach Scott Ruthsatz. ``You      have to look at the administration on down, what they're      doing at Covington Catholic. You have to give so much credit      to the Crazies. Our Colonel Nation really supported us, and      not just this game, all season long. Being the first winner      of it, it feels fantastic.''       Said Heppler: ``It's really special to be the first ones      and hang that first banner up there. We've always had that      empty spot and since Coach Ruthsatz's first day we said we      would be the ones to put it up there. The 6 a.m. workouts in      the summer, playing in the gym all those times, it paid      off.''       Cov Cath's fitness and toughness in adversity paid off      against the experienced Cardinals, who were seeking their      third state title (35-4). After an early 9-3 lead, Cov Cath      was on the wrong end of a 22-4 run and trailed 27-18 at      halftime. Scott had three 3-pointers in a 70-second span by      junior Hines Jones, who averaged four points a game for the      year. Forward Tony Martini had Scott's first five points and      posted 17 points and 16 rebounds for the game. Cov Cath shot      just 6-of-22 in the first half, several of those misses      coming from around the rim.       ``We've been in this situation before and we knew we could      pull through,'' Nick Ruthsatz said. ``We knew eventually we      would start hitting some, and the fourth quarter we just      buckled down. All the conditioning through the summer pulled      us through.''       Cov Cath trailed by four points, 47-43, with 1:33 to go.      Ruthsatz tied the game with a pair of foul shots with 51      seconds to play.       Ruthsatz gave Cov Cath its first lead since 9-8 early in      OT, then tied the game at 51 with 2:16 to play. A tip-in by      junior Bo Schuh gave the Colonels the lead for good with 1:46      to play.       After three missed shots by the Cardinals on their next      possession, Ruthsatz grabbed the rebound and made two foul      shots with 57 seconds to play to make it 55-51. Following      another missed shot, CCH senior Parker Keller made two free      throws, then Heppler scored the final points of the season on      a fast-break layup.       ``We just played better defense, tried to lock them down,''      Heppler said. ``That's the experience of this team with three      senior starters and Parker hitting those huge free throws at      the end. It's a team game. Everybody can score. Most teams      around the state don't have five guys who can guard      everybody, so that works to our advantage.''       Ruthsatz had 25 points and five assists. Schult had 12      points and six rebounds. Heppler scored eight with a pair of      treys. Freshman guard Cole VonHandorf had nine points, and      Schuh posted 12 rebounds.       One of VonHandorf's chief tasks was guarding Scott County      star guard Trent Gilbert, who came in averaging 26 points per      game. The Mr. Basketball finalist, who is getting interest      from several Division I schools, only scored 10 points on 4-     of-25 shooting. Cov Cath rotated several defenders on him and      often double-teamed him in the backcourt.       ``We just tried to pressure him as much as possible,      because we knew he's a great shooter,'' Scott Ruthsatz said.      ``You can never leave him open. We had a hint of the way he      likes to go and shoot, and we tried to keep fresh guys on      him.''       The fatigue may have hand in two crucial foul-shot misses      by Gilbert. A 91-percent shooter for the year, Gilbert made      28 in a row in the Sweet 16. However, he missed the front      ends of two one-and-one situations late in regulation.       ``I love stepping up and being able to shut him down,''      VonHandorf said. ``They told me if I shut him down, we win. I      tried my best. He's a great player; I'll give him so many      props. I can't wait to see where he goes next year.      (Assistant coach) Joe Fredrick told me all of his moves, I      had them all down, I felt I could play him fairly well.''                          ____________________
