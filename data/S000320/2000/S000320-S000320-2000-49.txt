 The committee intended with this report language to ensure that NCAP would be expanded to include small size dummies until those dummies are certified for use in crash tests conducted to verify compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards. I am very supportive of the expanding the number of crash test dummies to more accurately simulate the diverse height and weight of vehicle occupants. The intent was not to prevent the agency from using small dummies nor to prevent NHTSA from acquiring test data essential. To the contrary, the committee provides additional funding in the relevant Research and Analysis contract program.  I want to underscore how important it is for members of the committee and the entire body to have accurate and consistent information from NHTSA in order to proceed with expanded NCAP tests. Indeed, the committee has received conflicting information from NHTSA regarding the readiness of small size dummies for use in crash tests.
