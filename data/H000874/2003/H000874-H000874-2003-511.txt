 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman was absolutely right. It was an open process in the committee, and I may stand corrected, but I believe there were Democrat amendments approved by the committee as well as Republican amendments approved by the committee in developing what at least the committee thought was a bipartisan bill. So, unfortunately, these things happen in the legislative process, and fortunately, we can correct those problems hopefully.
