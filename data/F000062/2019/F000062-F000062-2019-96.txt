 President, I rise to introduce a resolution in observance of ``National Trafficking and Modern Slavery Prevention Month.'' This resolution is meant to bring awareness to the worldwide scourge of human trafficking.  All of us, as Americans, must raise our awareness of this pernicious crime that often goes unnoticed and undetected in our communities. Human trafficking claims over 40 million victims globally. It has also created an estimated $150 billion global industry, an industry that affects every State in America.  Traffickers prey on vulnerable populations, like those in the juvenile justice system, and use physical and psychological techniques to control their victims behind closed doors: isolating them from the public, exploiting language and cultural barriers, and threatening victims with violence. These techniques often prevent victims from coming forward. All of us can do better in recognizing warning signs.  I have been heartened that recently, various private entities, such as hotels, the travel industry, and those in the convenience-store industry, have all come together to commit to training their employees to better detect human trafficking. In addition to raising awareness, January is also a month to renew our commitment to enforce, and enact, laws to help eradicate trafficking.  For example, in 2000, Congress enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which marked a strong commitment to prosecute human traffickers and better aid victims.  Last Congress, then-Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley and I authored the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which was complemented by Senators Cornyn's and Klobuchar's Abolish Human Trafficking Act. Both of those bills update our trafficking laws to better aid victims.  Bipartisan members of Congress worked together to address this critical issue, and I am proud that both bills were signed into law last month.  Finally, in introducing today's resolution, I would like to thank Senators Grassley, Leahy, Cornyn, Klobuchar, Isakson, Markey, Shaheen, Blumenthal, Brown, Toomey, and Rubio for cosponsoring the resolution.  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the Floor.                          ____________________
