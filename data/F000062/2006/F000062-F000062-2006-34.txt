 President, I would like to take a moment to thank Senator Kohl for his stewardship of the Agriculture appropriations bill. His work on this bill will provide funding to support our Nation's farmers and consumers, and I support those efforts wholeheartedly.  Mr. President, my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, and I would like to take a moment to engage our colleague from Wisconsin in a colloquy.
