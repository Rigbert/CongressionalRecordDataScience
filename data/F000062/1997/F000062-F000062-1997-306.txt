 President, this morning, on my way to work, on Connecticut Avenue, I ran into the fact that another bomb had been placed at a Planned Parenthood center. This is just January, and the number of these bombings and attempted bombings are already over six.  I rise today really to deplore these acts, and I rise today to say to the right-to-life movement: Please, make clear that terrorism is not part of your agenda. If you fail to do so and fail to do so now, I believe we are in for a terrible siege this year, if the month of January is any indication.  I am also hopeful that the Attorney General will join in the investigation and the subsequent prosecution as our legislation of the last session provides.  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.
