 President, today we are resuming debate on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 1, the Marriage Protection Amendment. It will be necessary to file cloture on the motion to proceed. Therefore, that cloture vote will occur Wednesday morning.  In the meantime, we have a number of Senators who wish to come to the Senate to speak to the marriage amendment. We are also working on an agreement for debate time during Tuesday's session. Under a previous agreement, at 10:15 tomorrow morning, we will vote on the nomination of Renee Bumb to be U.S. District Judge for New Jersey. That will be the first vote of the week.  I also remind all of our colleagues, on Wednesday of this week, we will have a joint meeting with the House to hear an address by the President of the Republic of Latvia. That address will occur at 11 a.m. Therefore, Senators should be prepared to depart the Chamber around 10:40 a.m. on Wednesday morning.  I also remind all of our colleagues this week the Senate will address the death tax repeal, the Native Hawaiians issue, and the supplemental appropriations conference report when it becomes available.                          ____________________[Page S5401]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
