  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today Congress will vote to borrow $51.8 billion as a down payment on the relief, rescue and recovery effort, a sum which could reach $200 billion.  It is the responsibility of this Congress to oversee the administration's disbursement of these funds and to make certain it goes to the victims and appropriate expenditures and not disaster profiteering. Likewise, Congress must safeguard against opportunists, some even in our own ranks, who would use the disaster for their own petty political ends.  In fact, in light of the huge costs, the big run-up in the deficit that we are about to see, some on the other side of the aisle are suggesting this makes the case for tax cuts for the wealthiest investors in America, those who earn more than $300,000, have estates worth more than $6 million. They say that those tax cuts will provide economic stimulus that will trickle down on the people of New Orleans and Mississippi.  They have been trickled on more than they can stand. We need an appropriate, compassionate, and cost-effective recovery effort, not more tax breaks for the most privileged among us who were not affected.                          ____________________
