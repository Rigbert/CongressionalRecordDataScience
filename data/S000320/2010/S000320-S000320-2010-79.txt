 President, the first point the Wall Street Journal editorial highlights dealing with Chairman Bernanke's overt political activities states:       Whether or not Mr. Bernanke is confirmed, the lesson we      draw--  This is the Journal editorial staff--     is that overly political Central bankers will eventually be      undone by politics.  They always are.  The Wall Street Journal goes on to conclude:       Our own view is that Mr. Bernanke is already far too      susceptible to political pressure. As a Fed governor, he was      Alan Greenspan's intellectual copilot last decade when their      easy money policies created the housing mania.  On Mr. Bernanke's loose money record, the Journal noted in these editorials:       Mr. Bernanke was the intellectual architect of the decision      to keep monetary policy exceptionally easy for far too long .      . . He imagined a deflation that never occurred, ignored the      asset bubbles in commodities and housing, dismissed concerns      about dollar weakness and in the process, stoked the credit      mania that led us to where we are today in the financial      panic.  Finally, the Wall Street Journal points out in regard to Chairman Bernanke:       The Fed Chairman has shown he knows how to ease money . . .      But, that is the easy part of his job. The hard part, the      time when Central bankers earn their fame, is when they have      to take the money away. We see little at this point in the      Chairman's policy history or guideposts to suggest he will be      willing to endure the criticism that will come with      tightening money amid a lackluster recovery, if that is what      is required to protect the dollar or prevent an inflation      outbreak.  For these and other reasons, the Wall Street Journal, one of the most widely recognized business publications in the world, opposes the nomination, as I do, of Chairman Bernanke.  I yield the floor.
