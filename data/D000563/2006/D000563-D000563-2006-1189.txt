 Another amendment that has been filed authorizes the Department of Defense to assist NATO in peacekeeping efforts in Darfur. The third sets aside funds for a special envoy to be named to play the role that former Senator John Danforth of Missouri played so effectively. Let me say parenthetically, he is a great man. I am honored to call him a friend. He accepted this assignment when he could have returned to the peace and solitude of his retired life in St. Louis, but leaving the United Nations he went on to Darfur. That speaks volumes about this man's commitment to the suffering of the world that he did it.  Now we have an amendment before the Senate asking that another envoy be sent by the United States, a person of the caliber of John Danforth, who can do his best to try to bring some peace to that region.  The situation in Darfur represents a massive humanitarian catastrophe, one that is ongoing, one that is happening on our watch. As we stand to make these speeches in the comfort and security of the Senate, people are literally dying, being raped, and starving to death in Darfur.  Over the past 3 months alone, resurging violence in Darfur has forced 200,000 people from their homes. One-third of them are cut off from any humanitarian aid. In addition, Human Rights Watch has reported the Sudanese Government launched a new offensive in southern Darfur last week. The government troops reportedly used helicopter gun ships against a defenseless village in south Darfur where thousands of displaced Darfurians sought refuge. Can you imagine the horror of that scene as helicopter gun ships sprayed these poor helpless people?  The African Union mission in Darfur has 7,000 peacekeepers; 7,000 men in uniform to guard an area the size of Texas. But a Texas without roads, a Texas without bridges, a Texas without communication. They cannot end this genocide by themselves.  Unfortunately, while violence in Darfur escalates, the news on the prospects of peace, talks between the Government of Sudan and the rebel groups, is very discouraging. The talks have dragged on for 2 bloody years. They were set to conclude on Sunday, but in the absence of an agreement, they have been extended another 48 hours. The prospects for an accord seem dim. Khartoum so far has also refused to allow a U.N. assessment team into Darfur to prepare for a mission there.  The Sudanese Government launched a war on its own people for 3 straight years. They cannot be allowed to dictate terms to the United Nations. Hundreds of thousands of lives hang in the balance in Darfur. We should appoint that special envoy, someone of the stature, the dedication, and wisdom of John Danforth, to try to advance the peace process. The United States must engage the other members of the United Nations Security Council to put real pressure on the Government of Sudan.  One of the troubling aspects is that many believe that the major countries of the world are pulling their punches and not holding Sudan accountable because Sudan has oil deposits. Once again, our foreign policy is being affected, if not dictated, by energy reserves in Africa, as it is in so many other parts of the world.  What a grim reminder of how important it is for the United States to move to energy independence so we can stand up for the values we need without sacrificing all-important energy for our own economy and that other countries can step forward and make the right decision in terms of the morality and values of the world rather than gauging the impact it will have on their oil imports.  We have to work with our European allies to persuade China and Russia to set aside their objections to U.N. action.  We should pass the amendments before us this week on the supplemental appropriations bill, and the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act should be signed into law. We should continue to support the African Union mission in Darfur, while leading efforts to ensure that NATO and the United Nations take up the peacekeeping mission in Darfur.  Three years of genocide--3 years after our declaration that a genocide was occurring right here on our watch--3 years is too long.  I echo the thousands of people who gathered across America on Sunday--the students from Georgetown University, the students from other universities across this country, and many other caring people who came forward. I urge the Senate to join them to save Darfur.                          ____________________
