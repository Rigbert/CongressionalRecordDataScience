President, I thank my colleague and friend from Nevada, Senator Reid, for that statement because here on the closing day of this week's session, as we wrap up the second week of 4 weeks, it really is a time to reflect on what little time is left in this session, and when Senator Reid refers repeatedly to a do-nothing Congress, it is understandable. Two weeks down and 2 weeks to go before the election and no budget.  This so-called fiscally conservative leadership in the Senate cannot produce a budget on how we are going to spend our money this year. They cannot produce a budget and, if I am not mistaken, I say to the Democratic leader, I don't believe a single appropriations bill has been signed into law at this point.
