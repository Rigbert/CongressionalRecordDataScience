 Mr. DeLAY. I would just remind the gentleman, again, that formal conferences are held. When the formal work of the House, through its conference committees are to be done, at that particular time, Members that oppose the bill will have all of their rights protected, and they can go to those meetings and participate in the conference process.  But in order to get a bill, particularly a bill as complicated as an energy bill or the Medicare bill, it has never been, even when the gentleman's party was in the majority, it has never been the practice of having big, huge conference meetings and debates on a daily basis or a regular basis. These things are worked out with those who want a bill and then presented to the full conference in the light of day so that people can express themselves, and it is brought to this floor for further debate.
