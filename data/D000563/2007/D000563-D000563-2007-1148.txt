President, this article is from the Atlantic Magazine,April 2007 issue. I came across it and was attracted to the title of this article by Steven Faris titled ``The Real Roots of Darfur.''  When we have this debate about global warming and talk about climate change, we talk about the impact it might have on a great State such as Florida over many years and other places around the world. Mr. Faris writes an article that talks about the climate change in this area, the Darfur region, which has taken place over the last several years. What they once billed as an occasional drought or bad agricultural practices now has become a recurring trend.  Here is what Mr. Faris wrote in the Atlantic Magazine:       By the time of the Darfur conflict 4 years ago, scientists      had identified another cause. Climate scientists fed      historical sea-surface temperatures into a variety of      computer models about atmospheric change. Given the      particular pattern of ocean temperature changes worldwide,      the model strongly predicted a disruption in African      monsoons.  Of course, the rainy seasons.  Columbia University's Alessandra Giannini led one of the analyses and said:       This was not caused by people cutting trees or overgrazing.      The roots of the drying of Darfur, she and her colleagues      have found, lay in changes to the global climate.  There is a competition here for land between farmers and those who have livestock, and that is part of the tension in this area.  The article goes on to conclude:       With countries across the region and around the world      suffering similar pressures, some see Darfur as a canary in      the coal mine, a foretaste of climate-driven political chaos.  Environmental degradation creates very dry tinder, so if someone wants to light a match to it, they can light it up.  I wish to put this into the Congressional Record for those who follow this debate because I have spoken about a lot of reasons for the violence here, and it is the first time I have seen a suggestion of environmental causation.                               Exhibit 1                        The Real Roots of Darfur                           (By Stephan Faris)       To truly understand the crisis in Darfur--and it has been      profoundly misunderstood--you need to look back to the mid-     1980s, before the violence between African and Arab began to      simmer. Alex de Waal, now a program director at the Social      Science Research Council, was there at that time, as a      doctoral candidate doing anthropological fieldwork. Earlier      this year, he told me a story that, he says, keeps coming      back to him. De Waal was traveling through the dry scrub of      Darfur, studying indigenous reactions to the drought that      gripped the region. In a herders' camp near the desert's      border, he met with a bedridden and nearly blind Arab sheikh      named Hilal Abdalla, who said he was noticing things he had      never seen before: Sand blew into fertile land, and the rare      rain washed away alluvial soil. Farmers who had once hosted      his tribe and his camels were now blocking their migration;      the land could no longer support both herder and farmer. Many      tribesmen had lost their stock and scratched at millet      farming on marginal plots.       The God-given order was broken, the sheikh said, and he      feared the future. ``The way the world was set up since time      immemorial was being disturbed,'' recalled de Waal. And it      was bewildering, depressing. And the consequences were      terrible.''       In 2003, another scourge, now infamous, swept across      Darfur. Janjaweed fighters in military uniforms, mounted on      camels and horses, laid waste to the region. In a campaign of      ethnic cleansing targeting Darfur's blacks, the armed      militiamen raped women, burned houses, and tortured and      killed men offighting age. Through whole swaths of the      region, they left only smoke curling into the sky.       At their head was a 6-foot-4 Arab with an athletic build      and a commanding presence. In a conflict the United States      would later call genocide, he topped the State Department's      list of suspected war criminals. De Waal recognized him: His      name was Musa Hilal, and he was the sheikh's son.       The fighting in Darfur is usually described as racially      motivated, pitting mounted Arabs against black rebels and      civilians. But the fault lines have their origins in another      distinction, between settled farmers and nomadic herders      fighting over failing lands. The aggression of the warlord      Musa Hilal can be traced to the fears of his father, and to      how climate change shattered a way of life.       Until the rains began to fail, the sheikh's people lived      amicably with the settled farmers. The nomads were welcome      passers-through, grazing their camels on the rocky hillsides      that separated the fertile plots. The farmers would share      their wells, and the herders would feed their stock on the      leavings from the harvest. But with the drought, the farmers      began to fence off their land-even fallow land--for fear it      would be ruined by passing herds. A few tribes drifted      elsewhere or took up farming, but the Arab herders stuck to      their fraying livelihoods--nomadic herding was central to      their cultural identity. (The distinction between ``Arab''      and ``African'' in Darfur is defined more by lifestyle than      any physical difference: Arabs are generally herders,      Africans typically farmers. The two groups are not racially      distinct.)       The name Darfur means ``Land of the Fur'' (the largest      single tribe of farmers in Darfur), but the vast region holds      the tribal lands--the dars--of many tribes. In the late      1980s, landless and increasingly desperate Arabs began      banding together to wrest their own dar from the black      farmers. In 1987, they published a manifesto of racial      superiority, and clashes broke out between Arabs and Fur.      About 3,000 people, mostly Fur, were killed, and hundreds of      villages and nomadic camps were burned before a peace      agreement was signed in 1989. More fighting in the 1990s      entrenched the divisions between Arabs and non-Arabs, pitting      the Arab pastoralists against the Fur, Zaghawa, and Massaleit      farmers. In these disputes, Sudan's central government,      seated in Khartoum, often supported the Arabs politically and      sometimes provided arms.       In 2003, a rebellion began in Darfur--a reaction against      Khartoum's neglect and political marginalization of the      region. And while the rebels initially sought a pan-ethnic      front, the schism between those who opposed the government      and those who supported it broke largely on ethnic lines.      Even so, the conflict was rooted more in land envy than in      ethnic hatred. ``Interestingly, most of the Arab tribes who      have their own land rights did not join the government's      fight,'' says David Mozersky, the International Crisis      Group's project director for the Horn of Africa.       Why did Darfur's lands fail? For much of the 1980s and      '90s, environmental degradation in Darfur and other parts of      the Sahel (the semi-arid region just south of the Sahara) was      blamed on the inhabitants. Dramatic declines in rainfall were      attributed to mistreatment of the region's vegetation.      Imprudent land use, it was argued, exposed more rock and      sand, which absorb less sunlight than plants, instead      reflecting it back toward space. This cooled the air near the      surface, drawing clouds downward and reducing the chance of      rain. `Africans were said to be doing it to themselves;' says      Isaac Held, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and      Atmospheric Administration.       But by the time of the Darfur conflict four years ago,      scientists had identified another cause. Climate scientists      fed historical sea-surface temperatures into a variety of      computer models of atmospheric change. Given the particular      pattern of ocean-temperature changes worldwide, the models      strongly predicted a disruption in African monsoons. ``This      was not caused by people cutting trees, or overgrazing; says      Columbia University's Alessandra Giannini, who led one of the      analyses. The roots of the drying of Darfur, she and her      colleagues had found, lay in changes to the global climate.       The extent to which those changes can be blamed on human      activities remains an open question. Most scientists agree      that greenhouse gases have warmed the tropical and southern      oceans. But just how much artificial warming--as opposed to      natural drifts in oceanic temperatures--contributed to the      drought that struck Darfur is as debatable as the      relationship between global warming and the destruction of      New Orleans. ``Nobody can say that Hurricane Katrina was      definitely caused by climate change,'' says Peter Schwartz,      the co-author of a 2003 Pentagon report on climate change and      national security. ``But we can say that climate change means      more Katrinas. For any single storm, as with any single      drought, it's difficult to say. But we can say we'll get more      big storms and more severe droughts.''       With countries across the region and around the world      suffering similar pressures, some see Darfur as a canary in      the coal mine, a foretaste of climate-driven political chaos.      Environmental degradation ``creates very dry tinder,'' says      de Waal. ``So if anyone wants to put a match to it, they can      light it up.'' Combustion might be particularly likely in      areas where the political or social geography is already      fragile. ``Climate change is likely to cause tension all over      the world,'' says Idean Salehyan, a political scientist at      the University of North Texas. Whether or not it sparks      conflict, he says, depends on the strength, goodwill, and      competence of local and national governments. (For more on      the economic, political, and military tensions that global      warming might create, see ``Global Warming: What's in It for      You?'' by Gregg Easterbrook, on page 52.)       In Darfur itself, recognizing climate change as a player in      the conflict means seeking a solution beyond a political      treaty between the rebels and the government. ``One can see a      way of de-escalating the war,'' says de Waal. ``But unless      you get at the underlying roots, it'll just spring back.''      One goal of the internationally sponsored peace process is      the eventual return of locals to their land. But what if      there's no longer enough decent land to go around?       To create a new status quo, one with the moral authority of      the God-given order mourned by Musa Hilal's father, local      leaders would have to put aside old agreements and carve out      new ones. Lifestyles and agricultural practices would likely      need to     change to accommodate many tribes on more fragile land.      Widespread investment and education would be necessary.       But with Khartoum uncooperative, creating the conditions      conducive to these sorts of solutions would probably require      not only forceful foreign intervention but also a long-term      stay. Environmental degradation means the local authorities      have little or no surplus to use for tribal buy-offs, land      deals, or coalition building. And fighting makes it nearly      impossible to rethink land ownership or management. ``The      first thing you've got to do is stop the carnage and allow      moderates to come to the fore,'' says Thomas Homer-Dixon, a      political scientist at the University of Toronto. Yet even      once that happens, he admits, ``these processes can take      decades.''       Among the implications arising from the ecological origin      of the Darfur crisis, the most significant may be moral. If      the region's collapse was in some part caused by the      emissions from our factories, power plants, and automobiles,      we bear some responsibility for the dying. ``This changes us      from the position of Good Samaritans--disinterested,      uninvolved people who may feel a moral obligation--to a      position where we, unconsciously and without malice, created      the conditions that led to this crisis,'' says Michael Byers,      a political scientist at the University of British Columbia.      ``We cannot stand by and look at it as a situation of      discretionary involvement. We are already involved.''
