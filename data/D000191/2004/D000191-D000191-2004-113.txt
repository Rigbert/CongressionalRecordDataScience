  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, by attacking John Kerry's war record this morning, the Republicans would revive the controversy of the war in Vietnam, yet they are unwilling to meet the commitment to the veterans of that war who are still waiting for the benefits they were promised. They will attack veterans of the war, and they will not help the veterans of the war in the way we promised when they went to war.  They have not yet repealed the disabled veterans tax. They are supporting $1 billion less than we need to provide health care. The President is proposing to double the prescription drug cost for our veterans. And yet they have the temerity to attack a distinguished veteran of that war, one who has also voted to meet the commitments to the veterans of that war and the veterans who are coming home today. But they are not willing to pay that bill, they are just willing to attack.                          ____________________
