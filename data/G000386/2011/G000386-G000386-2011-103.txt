 President, I urge my colleagues to support cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 1249, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This bipartisan legislation will make our patent system more effective and more efficient. It will enhance transparency and patent quality and improve certainty in the patent process. It will also enhance the ability of the Patent and Trademark Office to cut its backlog and process patent applications in a more expeditious manner. Ultimately, this bill will help promote innovation and technological advancements and will provide a stimulus for American businesses and, obviously, will help generate new jobs.  My colleagues will recall the Senate passed the bill we entitled the America Invents Act earlier this year by a margin of 95 to 5. The House bill is very similar to our Senate bill, so Senators should not have a problem supporting it. In addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act enjoys the widespread support of a large number of industries and other stakeholders from within the United States patent community.  I am pleased to support the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed so we can get this bill done as soon as possible.                      Natural Disaster in Vermont  Mr. President, I am happy to yield the floor, but before I do, I wish to say to Senator Leahy we are all sorry for the natural disasters that have happened in his State, wish him well and his State well, and, obviously, there will be some congressional action to help not only that natural disaster but the rest of the natural disaster that occurred as a result of Irene.
