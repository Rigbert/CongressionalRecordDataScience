President, I thank my friend and colleague from Vermont. I thank him for his strong support on the issue of Ngawang Choephel. He and I have heard from so many Vermonters who met Ngawang Choephel at his time in Middlebury and feel as we do.  I also thank Senator Moynihan for his support of this former Middlebury College student and this Fulbright scholar, and also for his support of other prisoners of conscience in Tibet. Senator Moynihan has been a stalwart supporter of Tibet and its people for as long as I can remember. The fact he has sponsored this resolution gives added weight to it.  Like so many in Vermont, I was outraged when I heard of Mr. Choephel's 18-year prison sentence in December. This followed a secret trial and followed a year of incommunicado detention. The Chinese Government has not released a shred of evidence that Mr. Choephel committed any crime. In fact, I understand the entire 16 hours of videotape that he sent out of Tibet prior to his arrest contained only footage of traditional Tibetan music and dance. That is what he studied at Middlebury College and that is the reason he returned to Tibet.  The frustrating aspect of this is that China has done so much to destroy a lot of the tradition of Tibet, the history, the writings, the music, the dance. Mr. Choephel was simply preserving for future generations what is so important in this ancient, ancient culture. When the Chinese authorities finally acknowledged that Mr. Choephel had been arrested, and they did not do that until a year after he disappeared despite numerous inquiries on his behalf, the State Department called for his immediate release. Even after he was convicted, the Chinese Government refused to release any information to support the charge against him.  Many of us suspect that his arrest and sentence were intended to intimidate the Dalai Lama's supporters in the United States. The Dalai Lama's supporters have voiced their support for Mr. Choephel, but I am not aware of any relationship between Mr. Choephel and the Dalai Lama. If the Chinese authorities' purpose was to scare off these supporters, they are going to be disappointed. It is only going to embolden those like myself who support Tibet and its people.  I have written several letters to Chinese and United States officials, as has Senator Jeffords and Representative Sanders and others. I was in Beijing in November, and I asked President Jiang Zemin personally about the case of Ngawang Choephel, and I raised the case of Ngawang Choephel with the other Chinese authorities with whom I met. Just last week I sent letters to President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Gore. The Vice President is due to travel to China in the near future. Those letters were signed by the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and by Senators Feinstein, Glenn, Kempthorne, and Dorgan, all of whom were on the November delegation to China.  Of course there have been all kinds of articles and editorials on Mr. Choephel's behalf in this country.  I said to the Chinese that here, at a time when we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Fulbright Scholarship Program, a Fulbright scholar from Vermont is arrested unjustly. It shows a lack of any sense of history on the part of the Chinese in this because, of course, the first Fulbright scholarships 50 years ago were used in China. Now, on the 50th anniversary of the Fulbright scholarship, the Chinese arrest a person who was simply recording an ancient culture.  So, our resolution calls for the release of Ngawang Choephel. It urges United States officials to raise his case in their meetings with China's officials, to support a resolution on human rights in Tibet and China at the U. N. Commission on Human Rights, to urge the Chinese Government to allow international human rights groups to monitor human rights in Tibet, and to support an exchange program for Tibetan students. It says, instead of bringing the curtain down on Tibet, open the doors to Tibet, open them to this wonderful, wonderful culture.  The resolution makes clear to the Chinese Government that the United States Senate considers improvements and respect for human rights in China and Tibet a priority. There would be no better way for the Chinese Government to demonstrate sincerity on human rights than to release Mr. Choephel.  This resolution and the support for Mr. Choephel that we all share are not intended to embarrass or unfairly single out China. We want relations between our two great countries to improve. But our purpose is to call attention to a terrible mistake that has been made in the hope that China's Government will review the case and set Mr. Choephel free. I intend to keep writing and speaking about Ngawang Choephel until that day comes. So I thank Senator Moynihan for his leadership as well as the other dozens of Members of Congress, the hundreds of Vermonters, and Americans around the country who have signed letters in support of Ngawang Choephel.  The Chinese should look at the names on these resolutions. This is not a Democrat or Republican issue, not conservative or liberal issue. It goes across the political spectrum in this body. What it says is that we are as interested in human rights as anybody else. It also says, when you have an ancient culture like the Tibetans', an ancient religion, ancient music, ancient writings and speakings, they cannot be stamped out by anybody and they should not be stamped out by anybody. The Chinese should respect the culture of the Tibetans.  The Tibetans pose no threat to the People's Republic of China. But actions in trying to suppress, to eliminate, to destroy their religion, their culture, their music and their writings, that poses a threat to all, including those of us in the United States, the greatest democracy on Earth.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter about Mr. Choephel to Vice President Gore signed by all Members of the Daschle delegation to China be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 11, 1997.     Hon. Albert Gore,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Vice President: We learned recently that you plan      to visit China this spring. We were in Beijing in November,      where we met with President Jiang Zemin. Among the issues      Senator Leahy raised with the President was the case of a      Tibetan named Ngawang Choephel, a former Fulbright scholar at      Middlebury College in Vermont where he studied and taught      enthnomusicology. When he returned to Tibet in 1995 to make a      video about transitional music and dance, he was detained on      charges of spying and held incommunicado for 15 months. Last      month, after a secret trial, he was sentenced to 18 years in      prison.       Mr. Choephel sent many hours of video footage to India      before he was detained, which we understand deals only with      traditional music and dance. Other than referring to an      alleged ``confession,'' the Chinese have never produced any      evidence to support the charge that Mr. Choephel engaged in      epsionage on behalf of the United States or anyone else. The      State Department has urged the Chinese to release him.       We believe the Chinese government has made a tragic      mistake. Over forty Members of Congress have signed letters      to President Jiang and the Chinese Ambassador calling for Mr.      Choepel's release. We urge you to stress the administration's      view that Mr. Choephel should be released, and to ask      President Jiang to personally look into this case.           Sincerely yours,     Patrick Leahy,     Thomas a. Daschle,     Dianne Feinstein,     John Glenn,     Byron L. Dorgan,     Dirk Kempthorne.                                                                    ____
