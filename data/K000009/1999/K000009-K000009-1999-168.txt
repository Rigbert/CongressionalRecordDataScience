Chairman, I want to say to the chairman of our subcommittee, and to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that we so much support the efforts that he is making for this Niles Center, also on behalf of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Roemer). We have that special situation where Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio all meet. And the services provided through the Center serve the entire country certainly, especially the Midwest. And I want to compliment the gentleman for drawing our attention to it and placing it in the debate today.
