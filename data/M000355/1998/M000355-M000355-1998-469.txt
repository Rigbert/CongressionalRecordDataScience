 President, I was graciously letting my time run during that quorum call. I think we may have inadvertently taken away the 10 minutes prior to the military construction bill. I would like to reconstruct that time. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee is here.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee be recognized for 5 minutes prior to the military construction vote and that Senator Byrd, or his designee, be entitled to 5 minutes prior to the military construction vote as well.
