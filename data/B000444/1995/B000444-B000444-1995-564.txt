 President, earlier this week an article in the Science Times section of the New York Times explored what it called ``the mystery of music.'' Scientists are attempting to find how and where the sense and art of music arise in the brain. It is a search in which much remains to be discovered, but it has already produced fascinating results, including the possibility that, even as it provides the child with a constructive source of pleasure and reward, early musical training may also enhance the ability to think and reason in terms of time and space. That possibility suggests, in turn, the significant role that music and musical education play in achieving the fundamental goals of our educational system.  That suggestion lends a special emphasis to an innovative musical program inaugurated this spring at three Los Angeles-area high schools. This program, I believe, serves as an excellent model for improving education through the cooperation of the private and public sectors.  ``Musicalympics,'' an artistic competition for high schools, was conceived by David Griffin, a Warner Brothers Records representative. Griffin enlisted the interest of Warner Brothers Records chairman, Danny Goldberg, who signed the record company on as the Musicalympics' founding benefactor, the first, Griffin hopes, of other corporate sponsors to follow. Similarly, he hopes to see this year's inaugural competition among the three high schools extended to other schools in the future. The thoughtful design of the competition and the solid professional backing it is receiving make its prospects good, I believe, on both counts.  Each school participating in Musicalympics has created a team of student songwriters, musicians, choreographers, dancers, costume designers, set designers and production personnel such as television camera operators, lighting designers and recording engineers to pursue the creation of a musical performance from the writing of an original song to the final television production. Each school has been given a small cash stipend to underwrite expenses, and production professionals have guided the students in mastering technical production details.  Professional Musicalympics television crews have visited each school periodically to videotape students preparing their productions. David Griffin is producing and directing a television documentary special which showcases the competition, which will end in a complete television performance of each school's production. The competition is being judged by Griffin, a Warner Records artist and other television professionals. The documentary will premiere early next month and the winning school will be announced before each school's participating students and invited guests, sponsors, contributors and other key supporters. Each participating student will receive a videotape of the finished television program, and all three participating schools will receive cash prizes, or musical instruments and recording equipment.  Mr. President, the Musicalympics directly addresses a number of educational dimensions which concern the Nation today. In the first place, it offers an opportunity for interested students to participate directly in the creation of an original artistic performance; it provides those students with an intimate, personal perspective on the origin and nature of a production in one of the performing arts which are a chief feature of our culture. It helps these students develop the practical, hands-on skills that make such performances possible. It combines the resources of the private and public sectors to achieve a worthwhile goal few schools could manage on their own. It provides for both the participating students and their schools the challenge and the reward of disciplined teamwork focused on a constructive conclusion. And, finally, it takes broad theoretical and practical advantage of the fundamental, universal, and characteristically human creation and appreciation of music.  Mr. President, I commend the founders and supporters of Musicalympics. This is a program that deserves scrutiny, encouragement and support.                          ____________________
