Speaker, I thank the gentlelady.  The energy trade deficit for our Nation has been on a downward path from 4.7 billion barrels in 2008 to 3.6 billion barrels in 2013. That is real progress, and you can even see it in falling gasoline prices across this country.  Our bill will support thousands of jobs through the Army Corps of Engineers in developing infrastructure, and the bill provides $922 million above the request to meet an unmet enormous backlog.  This bill as a whole is far from perfect, yet our Congress must work toward keeping our economy and jobs growing through giving certainty to the public that Congress can operate our ship of state.
