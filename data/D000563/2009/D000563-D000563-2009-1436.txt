 Yesterday, I was in a neighborhood of Chicago named Albany Park. It is one of the most diverse neighborhoods on the north side of our city. I went into this neighborhood on Kedzie Avenue to meet in front of a house that had been boarded up going through mortgage foreclosure. A lot of families gathered around, families who live in the neighborhood. And they looked like America--Black, White, and Brown--all standing there with their neat little homes all around this one foreclosed building.
