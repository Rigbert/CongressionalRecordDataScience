 I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 Black Leadership Forum, Inc.,                               Washington, DC, September 16, 2002.     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,     Member of the Senate, Senate Russell Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hollings: We are writing to share with you a      letter which the Black Leadership Forum, Inc. (BLF), whose      members are listed on the left side of this page, delivered      several weeks ago to members of the Senate Judiciary      Committee. The attached letter strongly opposes the      nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd to a seat on the Fourth      Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, for the reasons stated in      substantial detail.       It has come to our attention that you are actively      supporting Mr. Shedd's nomination and are aggressively      pressing the Judiciary Committee for speedy approval of a      hearing on his nomination by the full Senate. Therefore, we      feel that it is urgent for you to be directly informed by BLF      of the bases for our objections to this nomination. We      reflect in this letter the deep concern in the African      American community about this nomination because Mr. Shedd's      judicial record undercuts our closely guarded values of equal      justice and threatens the maintenance of our civil rights      advances and constitutional protections.       Conversations with numerous African Americans who also are      resident-constituents of your District, indicate that they,      too, believe that this nomination should not go forward. We      sincerely hope, therefore, that we can meet with you      regarding our objections to Mr. Shedd's nomination and that      until we have had this discussion, you will forego any      further actions supporting his nomination. We have called      your office requesting such a meeting prior to a vote by the      Judiciary Committee on this issue.           Love Embraces Justice,     Dr. Joseph E. Lowery,     Dr. C. DeLores Tucker,     Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich, Ph.D.                                  ____                                        Rainbow Push Coalition                                     Chicago, IL, August 24, 2002.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Member, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Let me lend my voice of opposition to      the chorus of discontent surrounding the nomination of Judge      Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge      you to oppose the Shedd nomination, based on the merits, and      the merits alone. A seat on the Fourth Circuit is too      important to the nation's judiciary not to be heavily      scrutinized.       As a native of South Carolina, I am deeply disturbed by the      direction taken by the Fourth Circuit in recent years. As a      Judicial Circuit with considerable influence on the Supreme      Court, those elevated to the Court should reflect the highest      American ideals of inclusion and equal protection under the      law. Moreover, the states included in the Fourth Circuit are      comprised of the highest percentage of African Americans,      than any other Circuit, thus judges on the Court must be      sensitive and respectful for the civil rights laws for which      we fought so hard.       Currently, the Fourth Circuit is the most extremist court      in the nation on civil rights issues, criminal justice      issues, and those involving the power of the federal      government, to enact legislation, which holds States      accountable for civil rights violations. The nomination of      Dennis Shedd threatens to take the Court in a further      extremist direction. For example, Judge Shedd's opinion in      the Condon v. Reno case suggests that he favors disempowering      Congress. American judges, and their rulings should protect      rights, rather than restrict the balance of power.       To preserve this nation's ideals of inclusion, and to      ensure equal protection under the law for all Americans, I      urge you, and other members of the members of the Senate      Judiciary Committee to vote ``No'' on the nomination of      Dennis Shedd.           Sincerely,     Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr.                                  ____                                     National Bar Association,                                Washington, DC, September 4, 2002.     Re Nomination of Judge Shedd, United States Court of Appeals          for the Fourth Circuit.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Bar Association hereby      submit this letter in strong opposition to the confirmation      of Dennis Shedd to the United States Court of Appeals for the      Fourth Circuit. We strongly urge you to vote to defeat his      appointment to this critical Court.       The National Bar Association, established in 1925 is the      oldest and largest organization of minority attorneys,      judges, legal scholars and law students in the United States      and in the world. During our 77 year history we strive to      obtain equal justice for all persons within the jurisdiction      of these United States of America. Real diversity can only be      achieved as a result of equal justice for all which directly      results in equal opportunity. Real diversity, equal justice,      and equal opportunity does not currently exist in our federal      judiciary.       The National Bar Association maintains a watchful eye on      federal judicial nominations, as part of its' historical      mission. We     have a duty and obligation to support or oppose any      nomination which directly affects our struggle for equal      justice and equal opportunity for all. During these difficult      times, the United States of America must set an example to      the world by assuring equal justice and equal opportunity to      a truly diverse nation.       The National Bar Association feels, confirmation of Dennis      Shedd to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth      Circuit will severely undermine and inhibit its' goals of      equal justice for all, equal opportunity for all, and real      diversity. In our opinion the one thing which insulates the      United States of America from anarchy, civil strife, etc. is      our Construction (as currently amended), which provides an      open judiciary, where any citizen regardless of race, creed,      color, gender, economic status, social status, etc. can seek      redress. Absent an open federal judiciary, citizens will seek      other less civil means to voice their concerns and seek      redress. An open judiciary is the balance for the scales of      justice.       The essential element of an open judiciary is our      constitutional right to trial by jury. This right provides      some assurance of fair and equitable treatment in resolution      of disputes, without political influence of the government.      Therefore, we must oppose federal judicial nominees, when      their actions or beliefs, in any way reduce complete access      to the courts, right to trial by jury, or in any way      discourage access and right to trial by jury.       A review of Dennis Shedd's record appears to indicate a      judicial philosophy to reduce and discourage access to the      courts and exercise of each citizens right to trial by jury.      For these reasons, the National Bar Association strongly      opposes nomination of Dennis Shedd to the United States Court      of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.           Sincerely,                                              Malcolm S. Robinson,     President.                                  ____                                         The National Black Caucus                                         of State Legislators,                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2002.     Re Fourth Circuit Nomination of Judge Shedd.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Black Caucus of State      Legislators (NBCSL) is the body that represents some 600      African American state legislators in 44 states, the District      of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Last year, we      celebrated our 25th year of involvement and dedication to      many of the most pressing social issues and policies that      impact our legislators' districts and the nation at large.      Our commitment is to our constituents as well as the national      agenda. Our dedicated work is to maintain the highest values      of civil and human rights insuring that African Americans are      a fair and representative part of the political and social      equations of this great nation.       In their letter to you, dated September 4, 2002, members of      the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus have spoken      clearly and definitively in opposing the nomination of Judge      Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit. In reviewing the      information presented therein and having also researched the      history and record of Judge Shedd, we find it woefully      deficient regarding the issues of fairness, equality and      justice. Moreover, as has been pointed out by our colleagues      in South Carolina ``African Americans constitute a full one-     third of South Carolina's population yet there is only one      active African American federal judge in the state.'' In that      there are unquestionably ``many, well-qualified African      American .  .  . jurists'' in South Carolina, this is rightly      seen an unfair and unequal treatment in the sight of fair      representation. Further, considering the existent      disproportionate representation of jurist of Color, certainly      an effort must be made to insure that any South Carolina      nominee be a strong advocate of civil and human rights.      Rather, Judge Shedd's performance on the U.S. District Court      for the District of South Carolina demonstrates what could be      construed as hostile to civil and constitutional rights.       We have learned that Judge Shedd's insensitivity to      fairness has been demonstrated in his review of employment      discrimination cases brought by African Americans and in      fact, women, even in such cases when the Equal Opportunity      Commission has found ``reasonable cause.'' But, we have also      found that in furtherance of this questionable action, when      white men bring cases of ``reverse'' discrimination, those      cases proceed. We also note that there have been concerns      raised about the number of unpublished opinion issued by the      Judge and further that such concerns regarding the decisions      were reversed or vacated by the Fourth Circuit Court of      Appeals.       The Fourth Circuit must have a judge who is mindful of the      rightful place that African Americans have in this nation,      and be a strong advocate of civil rights, human rights and      constitutional rights. Any nominee should have demonstrated      his dedication to such virtues and ideals. No other      individuals should be considered for this important position.       For these reasons among others raised by our South Carolina      Legislative Black Caucus, we cannot support the nomination of      Judge Dennis Shedd for the Fourth Circuit and would ask that      the opinion of our body be strongly considered in this      matter. Should you have any questions, or require additional      comment, please contact me.           Very truly yours,                                                  James L. Thomas,     President.                                  ____                                        Congressional Black Caucus                                of the United States Congress,                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2002.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the Congressional Black      Caucus, we write to express our strong opposition to the      confirmation of Dennis Shedd to the United States Court of      Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. We urge you to vote to defeat      his appointment to this critical court.       The Fourth Circuit has the highest percentage of African-     American residents of any federal circuit in the nation. As      you know, President Clinton tried in vain for many years to      integrate the Fourth Circuit by nominating no fewer than four      moderate African-Americans to the court, only to see their      nominations languish. James Beaty and James Wynn from North      Carolina, Andre Davis from Maryland and Roger Gregory from      Virginia were never given hearings before the Judiciary      Committee at any time during the Clinton presidency. It was      not until President Clinton took the extraordinary step of      giving Roger Gregory a recess appointment in the final days      of his Presidency that the last all-White circuit court in      the nation was finally desegregated.       The Fourth Circuit is also the most conservative of the      federal circuits. Its rulings on the rights of those accused      of crimes, employees who face discrimination, and individuals      with disabilities are far outside the judicial mainstream.      Given the importance of the Fourth Circuit to the African-     American community and the current ideological imbalance on      the Court, it is imperative that any nominee to this Court be      a jurist of moderate views who will protect the civil and      constitutional rights of all Americans. Dennis Shedd is not      that nominee.       Above all, we are concerned that any nominee to the Fourth      Circuit be committed to the rigorous enforcement of federal      civil rights laws. We are particularly troubled by Dennis      Shedd's record in this area. Throughout his eleven years on      the federal district court, Judge Shedd has demonstrated a      propensity to rule against plaintiffs in civil rights cases.      Based on our review of Judge Shedd's record, we doubt      seriously whether he can fairly and impartially adjudicate      the claims of persons protected by the federal civil rights      laws.       Despite the fact that employment discrimination cases      comprise a large portion of Judge Shedd's civil rights      docket, Judge Shedd has allowed only few discrimination      plaintiffs to have their day in court. In almost every case,      Judge Shedd has dismissed some or all of the claims of civil      rights plaintiffs before they have a chance to be heard by      the jury. By all evidences, Judge Shedd utilizes an extremely      high threshold of evidence necessary to allow a      discrimination claim to get to the jury. For example, in the      one race discrimination case in which Judge Shedd did not      dismiss at least some of the plaintiff's claims, a White      manager terminated an African-American female employee after      directing racial epithets at her in the presence of a co-     worker. Even with this evidence, Judge Shedd said it was an      ``extremely close question'' whether the case should be      dismissed. Given Judge Shedd's characterization of the      evidence in this case, we question his commitment to      following decades of case law recognizing that discrimination      often occurs in much more subtle but no less pernicious forms      and therefore may proven circumstantially. In contrast to      Judge Shedd's systematic dismissal of claims by African-     American plaintiffs, Judge Shedd has allowed ``reverse      discrimination'' claims by White men to proceed to trial in      four of the five cases in which summary judgment was      requested.       Also, in a number of cases, Judge Shedd has overruled a      magistrate's recommendation to allow claims to be tried to a      jury. In one case, a magistrate concluded that a female      corrections officer could pursue her claim for ``outrageous      conduct'' where her supervisor subjected her to repeated      requests for sex, lewd language, and physical contact, and      told her co-workers that he was having an affair with her and      that she was pregnant with his child. The conduct occurred      not only in the workplace but by telephoning the plaintiff at      home and by visits to the plaintiff's house, which the      supervisor said he could visit ``anytime he wanted.'' Judge      Shedd dismissed the claim, stating that while the defendant's      actions were ``certainly disgusting and degrading,'' they did      not rise to the level of outrageous conduct.       Judge Shedd's narrow and restrictive view of civil rights      claims is also evidenced by his dismissal of several cases in      which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had found      ``reasonable cause'' to believe that discrimination occurred.      A finding of ``reasonable cause'' by the EEOC is extremely      rare (occurring in fewer than 10 percent of the cases filed).      Thus, the fact that Judge Shedd has refused to allow many of      these claims to get to the jury strongly suggests that Judge      Shedd utilizes an exceedingly high threshold for proving      unlawful discrimination. The endorsement of such a     restrictive standard that is far outside the mainstream of      federal jurisprudence has devastating implications for all      civil rights plaintiffs if Judge Shedd is confirmed to the      Fourth Circuit.       At his June 27 hearing, Judge Shedd admitted that, during      his eleven years on the bench, a plaintiff has never won an      employment discrimination jury trial in his court. He      defended this record by asserting that he could not recall a      plaintiff ever winning a jury trial in a discrimination case      in any court in South Carolina. However, we have subsequently      learned that during Shedd's tenure on the bench, there have      been at least twenty-one jury verdicts favorable to      discrimination plaintiffs in other federal courts in South      Carolina, yielding over $7 million in damages. Shedd's lack      of awareness of the outcome of these numerous cases evidences      a troubling indifference toward the type of civil rights      cases with which, by virtue of his docket, he should be the      most familiar.       Another area of grave concern to us is Judge Shedd's narrow      view of Congressional power to enact protective legislation.      We believe that Judge Shedd has the worst federalism record      of any nominee considered by the Judiciary Committee thus      far. At the same time, the Fourth Circuit has been the most      active federal circuit in curtailing federal power,      invalidating many portions of important federal legislation      in recent years. Judge Shedd's record in this area signals he      will join this Circuit's aggressive efforts to alter the      balance of federal and State power in a way that threatens      enforcement of our most cherished civil rights laws.       Judge Shedd authored the original district court opinion in      Condon v. Reno, striking down the Driver's Privacy Protection      Act based on his belief that the federal government did not      have the power to require States to ensure that State      driver's license records would remain private. Although the      Fourth Circuit affirmed Judge Shedd's decision, the Supreme      Court unanimously reversed the holding in a decision by Chief      Justice Rehnquist. In an unpublished opinion, which usually      signifies a routine decision, Judge Shedd struck down part of      the Family and Medical Leave Act, holding that the Eleventh      Amendment doctrine of state sovereign immunity prevents an      employee from suing a State agency for a violation of that      statute. This issue--because it calls into question      Congress's power to remedy sex discrimination in the      workplace--has profound implications for Congress's authority      under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment.       Judge Shedd has demonstrated a reluctance to sanction law      enforcement for crossing the line. In a recent criminal case,      a deputy sheriff and a State prosecutor videotaped a      constitutionally protected conversation between a lawyer      and a defendant charged with a capital crime. The      defendant was convicted in state court, but the South      Carolina Supreme Court overturned the conviction on the      basis of the videotape, calling it ``an affront to the      integrity of the judicial system,'' and stating that      ``[t]he right to counsel would be meaningless without the      protection of free and open communication between client      and counsel.'' Judge Shedd presided over the federal cases      arising from a grand jury's investigation of the matter.      When the deputy offered a guilty plea, Judge Shedd      reportedly questioned it because he did not believe a      civil rights violation occurred. Judge Shedd imposed only      a $250 fine on the deputy and remarked at his sentencing      hearing that ``[the deputy] is caught up in a situation in      which there's at least part of the criminal defense bar      trying to get prosecutors and law enforcement punished.      That's what's going on in the law.'' In contrast, when the      defense attorney was convicted of perjury for denying he      leaked the videotape to the press after learning of its      existence before trial, Judge Shedd sentenced the lawyer      to prison and a $20,000 fine, accompanied by a lecture      about the serious consequences of committing perjury.       Judge Shedd has also exhibited a high level of      insensitivity on issues of race. Judge Shedd made several      insensitive comments as he dismissed a lawsuit aimed at      removing the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina      statehouse dome. According to press accounts, Judge Shedd      suggested that South Carolinians--thirty percent of whom are      African-American--``don't care if that flag flies or not.''      (``Judge Dismisses Most Flag Defendants, The Greenville News,      June 11, 1994). He also analogized the Confederate battle      flag, to many a symbol of support for slavery and racist acts      of terror directed at African-Americans, to the Palmetto      tree, which is on the State flag: ``What about the Palmetto      tree?'' What if that reminds me that Palmetto trees were cut      down to make Fort Moultrie and that offends me?'' (``U.S.      Judge Dims Hope of Battle Flag's Foes,'' The State, June 11,      1994.) It is shocking that Judge Shedd, who was raised in      South Carolina during the 1950s and 1960s, could compare--     even hypothetically--being ``offended'' by the representation      of the Palmetto tree to the reaction of the African-American      community to the Confederate battle flag.       Dennis Shedd's opinions in his eleven years on the federal      bench reflect hostility toward plaintiffs in civil rights      cases, a desire to limit Congress's authority to enact      legislation that is applicable to the States, and a general      insensitivity on issues of race. The Fourth Circuit      desperately requires a voice of moderation and commitment to      core civil and human rights values. We believe that Judge      Shedd is not that voice and that the Committee should      therefore reject his nomination to this important court.
