Speaker, as a cosponsor of H.R. 3525, the Church Arson Prevention Act, I am pleased that the House is considering this important legislation.  The legislation before us is straightforward. It will help law enforcement officials capture those responsible for these heinous crimes.  Unfortunately, the motivation of those committing these acts is also straightforward--hate, ignorance and disrespect.  More than 30 fires have occurred at churches throughout the South, leaving in their wake a fear that the demons of the past have risen again. This time they are not content to spew their slogans of hatred. Instead, their hate is at such a fever pitch that these brutes attack one of the most powerful symbols of community and love--places of worship.  In the 1960's our Nation witnessed a dramatic struggle for racial equality. Efforts to give African-Americans equal opportunity were often met with violent protest, and America lost a number of brilliant young leaders to racial hatred and bigotry, including religious men like the Reverend Martin Luther King.  In the end, the American ideal of equality won, and hate lost.  Now, those who would tear our Nation apart have returned.  We must collectively respond to this hatred. We cannot tolerate these deplorable acts against African-Americans and our places of worship. Indeed, the combination of this racial and religious intolerance is immoral and must be countered at every turn.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the House will pass this legislation to fight these despicable acts, and the Senate should follow suit.  In addition, I would urge the President and Assistant Attorney General Patrick to continue their efforts to bring the perpetrators of these hateful acts to justice--America's citizens of all races and religions deserve no less.
