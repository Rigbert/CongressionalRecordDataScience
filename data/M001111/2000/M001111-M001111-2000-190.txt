 Unfortunately, despite efforts by my office and the City of Seattle, no other Senators signed the letter urging the Appropriations Committee to provide the WTO funding, as well as earmark funds for the City of Seattle.  I worked to make it a bipartisan letter. Perhaps if other Senators had signed the letter when I asked last year, we would have been able to provide earmark money for Seattle and avoid part of the problem now facing my state, as was discussed by my colleague from Washington earlier today.  The WTO was a difficult period for my constituents. We are continuing to deal with the many issues raised for our state during the ministerial. The city of Seattle and other local governments have been forced to bear $12 million in security costs. this is a far higher cost than anyone anticipated. It threatens to force other budget cuts to make up for the State Department's refusal to work with my constituents.  Congress--with strong assistance from the President and Vice President--did provide $5 million in WTO money. The issue before us now is between my constituents--who have been asked to absorb virtually all WTO security costs--and the State Department.  Obviously, this issue will not go away. And I have already begun to work with the administration to get further support in forcing the State Department to assume some responsibility for the $12 million in WTO security costs.  Now is not the time for the State Department to discredit or deny the legitimate issues raised by my constituents. And now is not the time to politicize an issue that remains difficult and volatile for my constituents. Seattle and Washington state want to heal the WTO wounds  This administration has been enormously helpful to Washington state interests. Across the board, the President and the Vice President, have both devoted time, energy and resources to Washington state's problems fighting for jobs for aerospace workers, supporting our high tech economy, devoting new resources to environmental problems, and addressing our difficult transportation problems are all examples of the close working relationship between this administration and Washington state.  And I expect the same degree of support in trying to resolve the current problem on WTO security related costs incurred by the city of Seattle and other local governments in Washington state.  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in working with the administration to address this very difficult problem. The best way to do this is through cooperation--by trying to convince the State Department that in hosting international events, we must be careful not to ask local governments to assume costs that are clearly federal responsibilities.  Mr. President, I will continue my efforts to ensure that the city of Seattle and other local governments are not left holding the bag, and once again, I welcome my colleagues to join me in this effort.                          ____________________
