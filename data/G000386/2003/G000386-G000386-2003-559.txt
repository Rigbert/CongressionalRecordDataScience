 President, we are in a position where there is a lot of anxiety about the economy. That anxiety probably started back in March of 2000, when we first saw a downturn in the manufacturing index, and the manufacturing index has been in a downturn for 33 months, at least as far as it relates to employment.  There is anxiety that the economy might go back to mid-2000 and later in 2000 when Nasdaq lost half its value. Then September 11 happened. There is anxiety about the war on terrorism, reinforced by the murder of Americans in Saudi Arabia yesterday. There is anxiety about the economy because of the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. As far as war and foreign relations are concerned, there is not a lot we in Congress can do about it because people expect us to fight a war against terrorists. They expect us to make sure that bases for terrorism training against American citizens are not maintained by protection of foreign countries, such as Afghanistan.  Americans expect us to not allow a nation such as Iraq, where there has been a great deal of evidence of the existence of weapons of mass destruction that could be used against American citizens, to continue to exist, or a nation such as Iraq that supports terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah or Hamas, to create greater turmoil in the Middle East, threatening the oil supply coming to the United States which will affect our economy. There is not much we can do about that, but the American people expect us to do what we can.  Also, there are some actions we can take domestically that deal with the anxiety about the economy, whether itis related to the downturn of the domestic economy or whether that downturn is related to our international relations, our international responsibilities, or the protection of American citizens.  What we are doing today is responding, as best we can, through the tax policy of our country, to the anxiety about the economy. We have had the good fortune of a President with vision, with ideas to stimulate the recovery and, in the process of this legislation, as economists will tell us, create more than 1 million new jobs through changes in tax policy.  We are responding to the issues that are on the minds of Americans, and those issues are the need to create jobs and bringing robust growth to the economy.  I have the good fortune of serving in the Senate at the same time we have a President who has a tax policy that tries to accomplish what I have been working for in the Senate as a member of the Finance Committee for a much longer period of time than President Bush has been President of the United States.  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, that good fortune gives me the opportunity to work for my goals simultaneously with the goals the President seeks. Many times being a member of the Senate Finance Committee--I was not chairman at that particular time--I found myself trying to fight what I thought were bad ideas put forth by Presidents of the United States on tax policy. Today I have the good fortune of trying to accomplish for President Bush good things for our economy along the lines that I have tried to accomplish over a long period of time. Not often do Senators have that opportunity.  On the other hand, we faced a challenge in meeting the President's goals. As many of my colleagues know, several weeks ago the Senate agreed upon the size of the reconciled tax relief cuts for jobs and for growth. I join many of my colleagues in wishing the reconciliation amount had been larger, and I believe we have put together a good proposal, given the limitation we face of the realities of compromising on the budget which we adopted 1 month ago.  I am pleased that the Finance Committee was able to report out legislation that received bipartisan support, although not as broadly bipartisan as I had hoped. While I wish the number of supporters from the other side of the aisle had been greater for final passage, I think the vote reflects broad bipartisan support for a significant majority of the provisions in this bill.  The vote also reflects a common goal: to see our economy strengthened by tax relief policies. At least three-fourths of this bill enjoys bipartisan support, for instance, with major parts of the income tax policy that is in this legislation, meaning personal income tax policy.  I believe the bill before us today is a balanced package of consumption and investment incentives that will provide short-term stimulus and provide the building blocks for meaningful future economic growth.  There is wide support for the provisions that accelerate the child tax credit, the marriage penalty relief, expansion of the 10-percent bracket, almost all of the marginal rates expanding small business expensing, and providing much needed alternative minimum tax relief.  These six provisions make up approximately $300 billion of the total package of economic growth proposals before the Senate and represent the three-fourths of the bill that I described that had broad bipartisan support. Unfortunately, from the statements by a few of my colleagues, one would never know about these items having broad bipartisan support.  I believe the American people sent us here to get the people's business done. Sadly, despite a bill that provides so much benefit to working families and will create over 1 million new jobs, there are many who put partisanship first and turn the other song on its head: accentuate the negative and eliminate the positive.  Let me try to counter the efforts to eliminate the positive by briefly taking Members through key provisions of the bill. I will emphasize first those that I can say categorically would have overwhelming support, meaning overwhelming bipartisan support, if they were voted upon separately.  With regard to the child tax credit, we immediately bring the child tax credit to $1,000 per year instead of waiting for that to be phased in over the rest of this decade. In addition, we also accelerate the refundable portion of the child credit.  In other words, we are going to speed up the giving of money to people who have not even paid income tax so that they benefit from our emphasis upon helping families with children.  Finally, we simplify the definition of a child for several different tax programs. I know it is not imaginable to the average taxpayer that somehow we would complicate the Tax Code by having half a dozen different definitions of the world ``child,'' but we do have. We simplified this by expanding who is eligible and making more families eligible for certain tax benefits. This is what that means: Over $75 billion that hard-working families will get to keep in their pockets. Thus, by far and away the biggest part of this bill is direct benefits that help middle and lower income families.  There is one more thing. Not only are hard-working families getting the biggest benefits, they are first in line to get the benefits of this bill because we include the President's proposal that would send checks--rebate checks, if you want to call them that--to those who receive the child credit in their 2002 tax year. The Treasury Department states that these checks will be sent out within 6 weeks of Congress approving this bill. So in just a few weeks, eligible families will receive a check from the Treasury of up to $400 per child.  Why $400 per child? Because presently the child credit is $600 and it would not reach $1,000 until later in this decade, gradually phased in. We make that $1,000 credit effective right now for the year 2004.  Now, there is another very popular change in this bill that a vast majority of this body believes should have been done a long time ago and was done in the year 2001 tax bill but phased in over this decade. What we do is provide marriage penalty relief of $51 billion in this package to de-emphasize the penalty for people being married, meaning they pay a higher tax bill than people who would have the same incomes not being married. So these people will not be penalized for being married and having both husband and wife working.  It also enhances tax relief for those families where one spouse decides to stay home and spend their time, rather than outside the family and the workforce, doing that work in the family, raising kids. As my wife reminds me, raising the family is one of the hardest and most important jobs, and that has been emphasized very effectively by the President of the United States.  So the marriage penalty would have been phased in over this decade, and now, retroactive to January 1, 2004, we are going to have the marriage penalty fully brought in under the 2001 tax bill policy.  There is another problem particularly for middle-income taxpayers, and that is how the alternative minimum tax is hitting an increasing number of American taxpayers. The bill before us actually ensures that fewer Americans will be subject to the alternative minimum tax through the year 2005, and we devote $49 billion in this bill to addressing the alternative minimum tax.  I want to be candid with the taxpayers of America and tell them that we are not doing in this bill, because of costs now, what we did in 1999 when, during the Clinton administration, the Senate and House sent to the President a bill abolishing the alternative minimum tax. That was vetoed by President Clinton. I am sure I am going to have Members on the other side of the aisle saying we are not doing enough for the alternative minimum tax. I hope they remember that when it was not as far down the road as it is now on covering more Americans being hit by the alternative minimum tax, this Congress had the foresight to do away with the alternative minimum tax and President Clinton vetoed it.  In this regard of how we handle the alternative minimum tax, we eliminate more people from being hit by the alternative minimum tax than we would have under the 2001 tax law.  In another area where we want to increase investment to create jobs, the bill provides for increasing expensing of depreciable investment by smallbusiness. We increase that from a $25,000 a year write-off to a $75,000 a year write-off, to encourage expansion and investment by small business today and the new jobs that will result from that small business investment.  The acceleration of the expansion of the tax brackets at the 10 percent bracket benefits all taxpayers and will mean thousands of taxpayers no longer even owe Federal income tax. That 10 percent bracket relief reports $44 billion of revenue loss in this bill, meaning that people hit by the 10 percent bracket will pay $44 billion less in taxes. This is another one of the provisions in the 2001 tax bill that would have been phased in over the next decade that we are bringing back effective January 1, 2004, fully implemented.  The reduction of tax rates at all other levels--and this does reduce marginal tax rates back to January 1, 2004, rates that would have otherwise been reduced gradually over the rest of this decade, making those marginal tax rates fully effective this year. The reduction of the top rate amounts to less than 7 percent of the total cost of this package, although I fear that many speakers will have us think it is 93 percent from all the words spent on this matter.  The reduction of all tax rates will help the husband and wife who, after years of hard work, have finally achieved good paying jobs and now face the triple threat. That triple threat is the cost of paying for their children going to college, saving for their own retirement and, oddly enough, probably helping their own parents in retirement.  The reductions of rates as well as expensing will help small business owners, as in my own city of Dubuque, IA, and small business owners across the country. These small business folks are key to job creation. If they hire more workers, if they expand their businesses, we are all better off.  That brings me to the point of who most benefits from the reductions of rates as well as small business expensing: The people who are hired by the small business owner. What this bill is all about is the creation of jobs. Of all the people benefiting, it is going to be those who want to work and will have an opportunity to work because of the 1 million-plus jobs that will be created by this legislation. These new jobs and the people who will be in them do not show up on any of the charts that we will see. They do not show up on the benefit table. But it is those people and their families who benefit greatly from this bill.  This is jobs creation legislation. This is based on the presumption that if money is in the taxpayers' pockets and 110 million taxpayers in America decide how that money is going to be spent or invested, it will do more economic good, turn over the economy many more times, than if it comes through the Federal Treasury and 535 Members of Congress decide how it will be divided.  Do not buy into the argument: How can we afford a tax cut when the budget deficit is what it is. A lot of the same Members who are going to be bringing that issue forward are some of the same Members who offered amendments on the Budget Act or offered amendments on the appropriations bill in January to spend more money. A lot of the votes on the budget took money away from tax relief in the budget and spent it somewhere else. Anyone who is concerned about the budget deficit ought to have reduced taxes and put it against the bottom line, not spend it someplace else.  The conclusion can be drawn that a lot of Members expressing concern over the budget deficit are not really concerned about the budget deficit but want more tax money coming through the Federal budget, through the Federal Treasury, so 535 Members of Congress can spend the money rather than 110 million American taxpayers having it in their pockets.  I happen to believe how 535 Members of Congress spend the money is not going to respond to the dynamics of our free market system, compared to 110 million taxpayers making the decision of how that money is spent.  Much of the discussion I have spoken about, worry of the budget deficit, is going to be related to discussion regarding the top rate and whether or not we should reduce the top rate from 38.6 to 35. Remember, that was already legislated in 2001 but not going to be fully effective until the year 2006. We made a judgment that putting money into the pockets of people who will invest it and create jobs, particularly small business owners, is better to do now, starting January 1, 2004, rather than waiting until 2006.  For those listening, do not look exclusively at the number of taxpayers impacted by those rates. Such an analysis fails to tell a complete story about the efficacy and efficiency of lowering top rates and seems to focus instead on who gets what in a distributional sense, not the economic good that comes from the policy decisions.  In my opinion, the better way to think about it is to focus on: One, what most efficiently changes behavior of taxpayers; two, what provides incentives for the creation of jobs; and, three, what has the largest multiplier effect on the economy. And by ``multiplier effect,'' I mean what is going to be done with the money by the 110 million taxpayers who create jobs. That has to be one of two ways. Either they spend it and it enhances two-thirds of the economy related to consumer spending or it will be invested and, with investment, the creation of jobs.  We will hear a lot about distributional analysis of how this tax bill might affect certain classes of taxpayers. It also ignores the fact that successful businesses--in other words, profitable businesses that pay proportionately higher taxes and the highest marginal tax rates--are the ones who will disproportionately add the most labor and capital. This is an important point to keep in mind.  Everyone knows most of my livelihood outside of Congress or even while I have been in Congress has been from farming. But throughout my lifetime I have had jobs with small business people in the Waterloo-Cedar Falls area of Iowa. I have had those jobs because I started out as a small farmer. If you are farming 80 acres, you cannot make a living so you moonlight someplace else to provide income to support your family. I had an opportunity to work at a little business called Universal Hoist. We made grain-moving equipment for farmers and grain elevators to buy. That business is still operating in Cedar Falls. I worked 10 years, from 1961 to 1971, as an assembly line worker at a company called Waterloo Register Company. We made furnace registers. I had the beautiful job of putting screw holes in those registers. Do that for 10 years and you have a lot of time to think about public policy, too, I guess. Regardless, that is what I did. That factory closed down in 1971. It no longer exists.  The point I make about higher income people, they provide jobs for people in my State. They probably provide a lot more jobs than the John Deeres and Maytags. These are outstanding businesses in my State and I do not denigrate their contribution to the economy. I had jobs because of small entrepreneurs investing and creating a job for me that I could not create for myself on an 80-acre farm. I created a part-time job on an 80-acre farm. Someone else invested money. These were middle-income taxpayers, as I knew them at that time. It takes people with money to create jobs.  Also, people who have money have not always been rich. And they are not always going to be rich. We have economic mobility studies that show that. One might get the opinion from debate on this bill--and I hope I am accurately anticipating because I have heard these debates before. One gets the idea from the debates on class warfare that somehow people who are poor in America are poor throughout their lifetime, and people who are rich are rich throughout their lifetime. People at the top levels have problems and they come down, and there is great mobility upwards in our society. I want people who discuss we are not doing enough for the poor or we are doing too much for the rich in America, I want these Members to understand the studies show as we divide our working people into quintiles of income, these studies show the people in the lowest quintile after 10 years have moved to the second, third, and fourth quintile, maybe some even up to the fifth quintile. But there is only 10 percent of the original 20 percent in the lower quintile after 10 years. That is 2 percent of our workforce.  There is great upward mobility. Those studies also show a lot of peoplein the top quintile after 10 years are not in the top quintile. There is mobility downward.  What we are talking about in this legislation to create jobs, to give tax relief to American workers, is to give small business, and even large business, an incentive to create jobs in one of two ways: Either take the money and invest it and create jobs rather than spending it for you or for consumers to take their extra money and buy things and create consumer demand, in turn creating jobs.  It also has something to do with enhancing the capital-to-labor ratio. That is because when capital is more available, when there is a surplus of capital, that is when labor in America does its best because labor is going to be much more in demand when there is a surplus of capital. That is where labor is going to make its progress, with higher wages and more jobs being created. This bill will enhance the capital-to-labor ratio.  To further be definitive on what I have said as a philosophical statement with statements that are backed up by studies that have been made, we have, as far as cutting the marginal tax rate is concerned, studies suggesting that a 5 percentage point reduction in the top marginal tax rate would increase small business investment by as much as 10 percent. The Treasury has indicated that 80 percent of the benefits from the top rate acceleration go to small business.  I will digress for a minute to talk about something that troubles me about the debate on bringing down the top rate to 35 percent. Some folks, especially those who have acquired their wealth through professions, big business, or inheritance, are the ones most violently opposed to reducing the top rate. It makes you wonder why these people so oppose bringing down the tax burden on businesses that they probably do not even know about--small business.  I gave this some thought while I was out in the field helping to plant corn the other day. I asked myself, Could it be that they are envious? No, that doesn't make sense because these folks generally have more money than successful small business people.  I asked myself another question: Could it be they do not want others, maybe those looking to make the transition from modest success to very successful status, to make that transition that is possible given the economic mobility of our society? Could it be that they see high taxes as a way to bar others from moving up? Could it be that they believe high taxes are the necessary tool to block successful small business people? Could it be that these elitists want to block a class of people who move up because of hard work rather than by pedigree? Could it be that high taxes on small businesses is a way to sustain the status quo?  I hope that is not true, but it makes you wonder. I know in the heartland of America people do not resent or try to block success of those who acquire it through developing small businesses. In my State of Iowa, the opinion of a successful small business person is very important, if not more important, than that of a corporate CEO.  I was amused to read some press reports about how K Street lobbyists and the Fortune 500 have reservations about this Finance Committee bill before us. There were too many revenue raisers, too many loophole closers, too much to ask from big business.  I would like to ask a different question. Are we doing enough for small business and the people who want to hire them? I want to focus on that question. Small businesses, as I have indicated, are engines of growth for our economy. In the recent past, they have been the source of most newly created jobs. I also continue to believe it is important to ensure that small businesses do not operate at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis large corporations because they are forced to pay higher marginal income tax rates. Currently, successful small businesses incur a 10-percent rate penalty when compared to their big business counterparts. In other words, if you are not incorporated, you pay the higher marginal tax rate of 38 percent. There is a bias in favor of corporations away from small business, individual entrepreneurs, because of the 38-percent bracket on personal income versus the 35-percent bracket for the corporate tax rate.  Even common sense would tell you that does not make good economic sense. Why should you have a bias in the Tax Code against people who do not want to incorporate?  I want to leave that issue now and turn to the last major part of the bill, and that is the part of the bill that provides for a partial exclusion of dividend income from taxes. As my colleagues know, the President called for a complete end to this double taxation of dividends. He would even go further, as I would, and say that double taxation of anything is wrong, dividends or otherwise. I have to admit that our bill is not a bill that is an absolute victory against double taxation because the proposal as reported covers only 86 percent of dividend-receiving taxpayers and is a good step in the effort to eliminate economic distortion resulting from that tax policy framework. When in full effect, this policy would ensure that dividends would be subject to the top rate of 28 percent. All other ordinary income would be subject to a top rate of 35 percent. This means that dividend income would enjoy a significant preference over other forms of periodic investment income such as interest.  Let me note to my colleagues that we provide State fiscal relief in this bill. A lot of Senators, over a 2-year period of time, have talked to me about the necessity of doing this, both members of the Senate Finance Committee as well as people even in my own Republican caucus, and people who are not on the Senate committee. They have been indicating to me that they view State fiscal relief as a key component to an overall agreement on taxes and on growth.  To be perfectly candid, we have Members of this body, right or wrong, who are telling us if we don't have something in here for fiscal relief, this bill is not going to get 51 votes to pass. Like it or not, they have a great deal of leverage. So we are dealing with that and hopefully dealing with it in a responsible way, through programs where there has been a Federal/State partnership, such as Medicaid. There are some areas where there has not necessarily been a State/Federal partnership. These funds, under our agreement--and there will be an amendment that fleshes this out to a greater extent--could be used for education, health care, law enforcement, and essential Government services. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on this important issue as we start filling in the details of that that will be part of an amendment offered later on.  I conclude by commenting briefly about the offsets that are in this bill.  Let me first note that there has been some surprise in the media about the fact that these are offsets. I respond by saying that if the media is somehow shocked that we would have offsets, they haven't been paying attention to a lot of tax bills which have been going through here. The fact is you are not going to get a tax bill through this body under what you call regular order unless there is unanimous consent to do it without a point of order. If there is a point of order, you have to have 60 votes, or you have to avoid a point of order, which is hard to do, by having offsets, meaning it would be revenue neutral.  As the President's own spokesperson stated, the President in his budget provided several billions of dollars in offsets--not necessarily the same ones we are using in this bill. In addition, my counterpart in the House has stated that he will look to offsets to pay for improvements in the international tax arena. Offsets are not new.  I will not discuss all the offsets at this point. But my colleagues should know that many of these offsets deal with the scandals we have seen recently at Enron and many other bad actors in corporate America.  That is not denigrating corporate America because the bad actors are a few compared to tens of thousands of legitimate, ethical, honest corporations in America.  It is my view that while we are trying to help shareholders with reductions in dividends, we should also be closing down the loopholes, the games and the gimmicks that executives have been playing. The shareholders and the workers--and many of the workers who also own shares--have been greatlyharmed by the actions of corrupt executives. This bill takes great strides in ending these loopholes.  Thus, shareholders benefit greatly from the dividend deductions as well as our efforts to end the fast and loose games being played in some corporate suites.  I haven't thanked Senator Baucus yet for his continued efforts to work with me despite our inability to find common ground on all the elements of this economic recovery package. Senator Baucus, ranking Democrat and former chairman of the committee, has worked very hard to help me move this bill along even though he could not vote for it in committee. That is particularly in the tradition of our committee. Rarely does a bill come to this floor where he and I are not on the same side of the fence. Yet there are going to be a lot more bills coming to the floor this year, as before, on which we are on the same side of the fence.  I look forward to continuing to work through our differences to produce legislation that will be helpful and getting things moving again as quickly and effectively as possible.                           Amendment No. 555
