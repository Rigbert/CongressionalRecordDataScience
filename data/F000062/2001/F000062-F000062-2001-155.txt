 Boxer) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:                            S. Con. Res. 39       Whereas during the last 8 years, the Federal Government has      operated robust offshore and onshore oil, gas, and coal      leasing programs that matched or exceeded production levels      during the administrations of former President Reagan and      former President Bush;       Whereas offshore, the United States has leased and      currently manages more than 44,000,000 acres of outer      Continental Shelf land;       Whereas proposals to provide more access to currently      protected Federal land for development by the oil, gas, and      coal industries ignore the quantity of land that is already      available for that purpose;       Whereas it is not necessary to drill in sensitive areas to      meet the energy needs of the United States;       Whereas since 1982, there has been in effect a statutory      moratorium on new leasing, pre-leasing, and related      activities on submerged land of the outer Continental Shelf;       Whereas in 1990, former President Bush used his authority      to declare areas of the outer Continental Shelf along the      coastlines of Washington, Oregon, California, Bristol Bay,      Alaska, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and more than 100      miles off the Florida coast, off limits to new drilling      through calendar year 2000;       Whereas in 1998, former President Clinton extended the Bush      limitation through June 2012;       Whereas citizens of California, Florida, and other States      affected by the outer Continental Shelf drilling moratorium      are overwhelmingly opposed to new oil drilling off their      coastlines and are concerned about plans to open the Florida      Gulf Coast to new leasing;       Whereas a majority of people of the United States are      growing increasingly concerned about the environment and      believe that protecting the environment should take      precedence over economic development;       Whereas the people of the United States have made a      decision to protect the coastlines of the United States from      oil development, because the people know that far better      alternatives exist; and       Whereas there are many other worthy options before Congress      that could increase energy independence and reduce reliance      on foreign oil, such as reauthorization of the Strategic      Petroleum Reserve, incentives to improve energy efficiency,      research into renewable energy and alternative fuels, and      full funding of energy conservation and efficiency programs      (including programs for solar and renewable energy,      weatherization, and other initiatives): Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the      moratorium in effect as of the date of adoption of this      Resolution on new oil and natural gas leasing, pre-leasing,      and related activities on submerged land of the outer      Continental Shelf should be maintained.
