President, at one time I had the floor. I yield at this point and again hope the Senate will support the bipartisan initiative that has involved many months of work and is critically needed in the economic challenges we face today.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Montana.
