President, Vermont boasts many talented artists, creators, composers and authors. Not least among them is Chris Bohjalian of Lincoln, an accomplished writer whose recent novel, The Sandcastle Girls, is drawing the praise and accolades of critics and readers alike. Marcelle and I were inspired by the story Chris has committed to the printed page; it is a novel that I believe will secure his place among the most accomplished writers of the 21st Century.  I read with interest an interview with Chris published in Vermont's Burlington Free Press on July 15. Like many artists and authors, Chris drew from his own heritage in his case, Armenian--to pen a moving story of compaslion and perseverance amid horror and tragedy. Perhaps this is why he has called The Sandcastle Girls the ``most important book'' he will ever write.  Chris is a longtime friend, and I have always enjoyed reading his works. The Sandcastle Girls is an achievement that stands apart and will deeply affect its readers.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article, ``TheMost Important Book I Will Ever Write.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 15, 2012] ``The most important book I will ever write''--Bohjalian talks about                          `The Sandcastle Girls'                           (By Sally Pollak)       Chris Bohjalian is a novelist who lives in Lincoln.      Bohjalian, 51, writes a Sunday column for the Burlington Free      Press. ``The Sandcastle Girls,'' his 14th novel, comes out      Tuesday. In a recent conversation with Free Press reporter      Sally Pollak, Bohjalian said ``The Sandcastle Girls'' is the      most important novel he will ever write. He said, as well, he      thinks it's the best book he's ever written.       ``The Sandcastle Girls'' is set in Aleppo, Syria, during      the Armenian genocide, nearly a century in the past. The      story centers around a young American woman, Elizabeth      Endicott, who travels to the Middle East to assist Armenian      refugees. She befriends (and aids) a group of interesting      people, and falls in love with an Armenian engineer who has      suffered devastating losses.       The book is narrated by a contemporary American novelist of      Armenian heritage, Laura Petrosian. Bohjalian says Petrosian      is a female version of himself.        BFP: What compelled you to write this book?       CB: This is the second time I've tried to write about the      Armenian genocide. I tried to write about it when I finished      ``Water Witches,'' prior to writing ``Midwives.'' I wrote an      entire novel called ``Sugar Daddy.'' Terrible book, never      published.       Not only was it a terrible, terrible book, but about this      time Carol Edgarian wrote ``Rise the Euphrates'' about the      Armenian genocide.       And I remember thinking to myself, Why does the world need      my book when it has ``Rise the Euphrates?''       Rather than try to save the novel I went onto my next      project, a novel about a midwife who dies in childbirth, and      wrote that book instead.       I was about 100 pages into the manuscript about the      Sandcastle girls when Mark Mustian published his interesting      and marvelous novel about the genocide, ``The Gendarme.''      Once again I thought the world doesn't need my novel.       But I was so emotionally invested in these characters, I      cared so much about the story, that I soldiered on and      finished it. I'm really glad I did. I love this novel.      Elizabeth Endicott, Nevart and Hatoun are my three favorite      female characters, along with Sibyl Danfroth in ``Midwives,''      that I've ever written.       BFP: ``The Sandcastle Girls'' is a mystery, a love story      and a narrative of war. How do you approach writing a novel      that weaves together these themes?       CB: Those elements are woven together through the      characters. I know when I read a novel, I'm interested in      characters I care about. And so when I began this book I      began with the people, I began with the characters. And I do      care so deeply about the characters in this book, especially      those women.       BFP: How did you come up with ``the compound'' in your      novel, the setting for much of the action and the place where      many of your characters live?       CB: Partly, I was simply after historical authenticity:      Where would Elizabeth Endicott, an American, be living? Then,      however, I saw the importance of the juxtaposition of where      Elizabeth lays her head at night compared to where the      refugees who are coming from the desert are sleeping. The      square of the citadel is an innermost ring of Dante's      inferno, compared to the compound.       BFP: Did you know when you started writing the book how you      were going to resolve it?       CB: I never know where my books are going when I begin      them. I depend upon my characters to take me by the hand and      lead me through the dark of the story. I didn't know this      novel was even going to have a component that was mysterious      when I began it. All I knew was that I wanted to examine what      my narrator calls the ``Slaughter You Know Next to Nothing      About.''       BFP: Can you describe the sense of responsibility or      obligation you might have felt writing a novel that would      tell people something about this mass killing, now a century      in the past?       CB: I know in my heart this is the most important book I'm      ever going to write. I'm telling a story that is not known      but was precedent-setting for some of the most horrific      tragedies and crimes of the last century. There's a direct      line between the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, the      killing fields of Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda. It's a long list.       In 1915, there were roughly two million Armenians living in      the Ottoman empire. By the end of the First World War, 1.5      million would be dead, three out of every four of them. In      1915, I had four Armenian great-grandparents. By the end of      that year, at least one would be dead. Both of my Armenian      grandparents are genocide survivors.       My family history is a part of that horrific global      narrative. So when I started this book, I began with the      personal. My narrator, Laura Petrosian, is a female version      of me. That's my grandparents' house in the novel.       Elizabeth Endicott and Armen Petrosian (central characters      in the book) are not my grandparents. They are completely      fictional.       BFP: When did your grandparents, Leo and Haigoohi      Bohjalian, come to this country?       CB: There were two points of arrival. I believe my      grandfather, Leo, first arrived here in 1920 but he didn't      stay. He went back to get my grandmother and they lived in      Paris until late 1927, or very early 1928.       BFP: What do you know about your own Armenian ancestors?      And how does your family's history figure into this work?       CB: I know almost nothing about my Armenian ancestry; I      know even less about my (maternal) Swedish ancestry.       I don't know what demons dogged my mother and father, but      they never talked to me about their childhoods. That's why      perhaps ``The Sandcastle Girls'' is a novel and not a memoir.      I couldn't tell you enough about my Armenian and Swedish      ancestors to write a memoir. I have wondered if I am going to      learn a lot about my (Armenian) ancestors when this book      comes out, which would be great.       My aunt believes that Haigoohi's father (Bohjalian's great-     grandfather) was murdered by Turkish soldiers because he      supplied horses to the army. They killed the Armenian and      took the horses.       The history of ``The Sandcastle Girls'' is accurate. I did      my research and I did my homework. I believe that Aleppo of      1915 (where the novel is set) is the real thing.       I knew so little about the Armenian genocide as a child,      and what my grandparents must have endured, that I saw no      irony in the fact that my first serious girlfriend when I was      13 and 14 years old was Turkish. I understood as a child that      my grandparents were from Armenia and were magnificently      exotic, by the standards of both grandparents. My mother      really did call their house the Ottoman Annex of the      Metropolitan Museum of Art. Their English, up to as late as      1970, was heavily accented.       BFP: Your father, Aram Bohjalian, died last summer, about a      year before the publication of ``The Sandcastle Girls.'' Did      you get a chance to talk to him about the book? What were his      feelings about the novel?       CB: My father's eyesight had been diminished by macular      degeneration for so long, he was not able to read even large-     print books. That photograph (of Bohjalian's father and      grandparents) is one of many photographs that my dad and I      pored over the last two years of his life. Because he was so      ill, I was visiting him a lot. The way I would try to take      his mind off the pain he was in was to get out family photo      albums and ask him to tell me stories, ask him to tell me      about the different people in the photographs. A lot of it he      didn't know.       My father, as a first generation son of immigrants, in many      ways distanced himself as much as he could from his Armenian      ancestry. He grew up in a house in Westchester County in      which everyone spoke Armenian or Turkish. When he started      kindergarten, he spoke not a single word of English. He      didn't even know how to ask where the bathroom was. In terms      of distancing himself from his Armenain ancestry, he became      as American as possible.       He was not as handsome as Don Draper in ``Mad Men'' but he      was a Mad Man. He was an advertising executive at large New      York City ad agencies.       I think my father knew more than he wanted to share with      me. He had mixed emotions about it. On the one hand, he was      always really proud of me; even when his eyesight was gone,      he loved listening to my books on audio, even the bad ones.       But I think he also felt that this story was too painful      for a novel. I remember once reminding him when we talked      about this that I had written novels about a woman dying in      childbirth, a couple who had their twin daughters washed away      in a flood, the Holocaust, and a domestic abuse murder-     suicide. And I also told him that as an Armenian-American, I      felt an incredible desire to write this story because it      feels so much a part of me.       BFP: Can you tell us something about your recent trip to      Armenia and Lebanon?       CB: The principal driving force that led me to Armenia was      the death of my father, and not simply his death but his      illness. The more time I spent looking at old family      photographs, the more time I spent seeing images of Leo and      Haigoohi, the more I felt this profound desire to see Mount      Ararat.       I have never in my life been outside Vermont and felt less      like a stranger in a strange land, than when I was in      Yerevan, Armenia. I was so happy there in ways I hadn't      expected.       BFP: ``The Sandcastle Girls'' will be released Tuesday. Are      you nervous as publication approaches?       CB: I've never been as emotionally invested in how people      respond to a book as I am with this one. Because this is the      most important book I will ever write. And I think it's the      best book I've ever written. And the reason why it's the most      important book is pure and simple: because it's about the      ``Slaughter You Know Next to Nothing About.''                          ____________________
