What is happening in my community is horrendous, and yet I see these Wall Street banks get more money. Wells Fargo--I will say their names. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, U.S. Bank, these are the ones that are causing huge problems in my region. And when they get acquisition of the property, they don't manage it because they don't care about our community.  We are a dot on the map for them. You know what? I was sitting here, I was thinking, what is going on here? I figured out, you know what they are going to do? They are going to take the loss on those properties, their original worth, and then the $4,500 they got, they are going to take the loss and book it on their tax returns for 2008 and make a huge windfall in the Tax Code, which isn't fair to the American people, because the American people are footing the bill here.  So we have a lot of work that we have to do to heal this system and to heal this market. The one gentleman was talking about, you know, when the government takes over it's socialism. I don't know exactly what to call it when the Treasury Department really has rescued all these banks. The fascist system used to do that. They are combines, they are industrial combines, and their banking combines were one and the same with the government. But it's an ``ism'' of some kind.  I thank very much the gentleman. We share the same deep concern.
