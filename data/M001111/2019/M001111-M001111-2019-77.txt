  It reaffirms that every worker in America has the right to receive equal pay for equal work. It protects women from retaliation for talking about salary information with coworkers. It allows women to join together in class action lawsuits, and, importantly, it prohibits employers from seeking salary history so the cycle of pay discrimination cannot continue.  This bill has the support of Republicans and Democrats and millions ofworkers in this country, and I really hope this Senate can reconsider and bring this important piece of legislation up that has passed the House.  I thank my colleagues who are out here today supporting this effort.
