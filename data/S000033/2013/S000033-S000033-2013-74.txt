 Kathryn A. Condon, who has retired after over 30 years of public service. Specifically, I would like to thank Ms. Condon for her steadfast leadership as the Executive Director of Arlington National Cemetery.  Arlington National Cemetery embodies one of our commitments to those who defend our Nation--to provide them with a final resting place that honors their service. With approximately 27 to 30 funeral services a day, Arlington is one of many active cemeteries for our fallen heroes. It is also considered a national treasure for its rich history, dating back to the Civil War, and historic memorials, such as: the Tomb of the Unknowns; the Women in Military Service Memorial, which honors the brave women who have honorably worn our Nation's uniform; and Chaplains Hill, the eternal resting place of Chaplains from four different wars.  Although Arlington is now a shining example of how we honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, it has not always been so. In 2010, the Army's inspector general discovered grievous errors, dysfunction, and mismanagement at Arlington. These highly publicized problems were linked to antiquated procedures and failure by the cemetery's senior leadership.  Ms. Condon's steadfast commitment and dedication as Arlington's top executive has reinstated Arlington as a national shrine for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Her leadership has led to the correction of all of the issues highlighted by the Army inspector general's 2010 report and the creation of processes that will ensure the longevity of this national shrine and make certain that previous mistakes are not repeated.  Particularly, I would like to highlight Arlington's new burial record system, ANC Explorer. In 2010, Arlington relied on a paper-based record system that caused confusion and led to the misplacement of burials. Thanks to Ms. Condon, Arlington now operates a new geospatial tracking system, which permits the families of our fallen heroes and cemetery staff to, among other things: receive turn-by-turn direction to any burial site or monument; view events, in real-time, occurring through the cemetery; and easily track and maintain burial space.  On behalf of our Nation's veterans and their families, I would like to thank Ms. Condon for her devotion to reaffirming Arlington National Cemetery's status as a national treasure and commend her on an illustrious career in public service.                          ____________________
