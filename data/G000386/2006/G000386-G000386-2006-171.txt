 President, I rise today to honor one of our Nation's most courageous men, who fell while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. CPL Jeremy S. Jones gave his life on June 27, 2006 when an improvised explosive detonated while he was on patrol. Corporal Jones was a member of D company, 1st battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Hood, TX. He was 25 years old.  My thoughts and prayers are with the Jones family, his father, Scott; his mother, Diane; his wife, Jennifer; and his two young children, Mackenzie and Anthony. Also, my deepest sympathies go out to Jeremy's friends, to the men and women of the 4th infantry, and to all who knew him.  Jeremy was a soldier, a patriot, and a father. Jeremy did not die in vain but gave his life defending freedom and protecting all of us back home. He is truly an American hero. Corporal Jones' sacrifice and the sacrifice of so many others will be remembered by all freedom-loving Americans.                          ____________________[Pages S7280-S7281]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES                   sergeant first class terry wallace
