 I am grateful for Ms. Nakashima's excellent reporting, and am pleased to draw attention to this important issue. I will ask that Ms. Nakashima's article, entitled ``Burma's Child Soldiers Tell of Army Atrocities,'' be printed in the Record following my remarks.  Reports of widespread use of child soldiers, forced labor, and human rights abuse come as no surprise to anyone with even casual knowledge of recent Burmese history. Tragically, these recent reports are not ``news,'' but rather business as usual in one of the world's most repressive countries.  While the corrupt military junta has recently been conducting a propagandistic offensive to convince naive Western diplomats that Burma can be a responsible member of the international community, the continual flow of evidence regarding Burma's gross abuses of human rights illustrates how hollow recent Burmese ``reform'' has been. Anyone duped into believing that the junta's decision to loosen the shackles that bind Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically elected leader of Burma who has spent nearly a decade under house arrest, represents a liberalization of the junta should think again. Proof that the Burmese junta continues its repression of democracy came yesterday when the Defense Ministry announced that it had detained seven members of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Party, NLDP, members. Their treasonous crime appears to be distributing anti-government leaflets.  The Burmese junta maintains power through its gratuitous use of military force against ethnic minorities and political dissidents. Now, the evidence is overwhelming that the junta exploits children as young as 11 years old in pursuit of greater coercive military power. Human Rights Watch reports that Burma's army of 350,000 includes nearly 70,000 boys under the age of 18.  If these children are fortunate enough to survive the physical and emotional abuse heaped on them by their military superiors during their ``training,'' they are then forced into combat, often against domestic Karenni and Shan minorities. As part of the ethnic cleansing and intimidation campaigns the Burmese junta has conducted against these ethnic minorities for decades, these children soldiers are often encouraged to torture, rape, and kill innocent villagers. In one instance, Burmese military commanders ordered some of these child soldiers to force Karenni villagers to clear a minefield by walking through it. The children were subsequently ordered to shoot villagers who refused to walk through the minefield.  Recently, the Burmese junta has sought to improve its standing in the international community by touting its supposedly more intense efforts to curb the production and trafficking of heroin. Mr. President, this claim is laughable. American State Department officials should not be deluded into believing that Burma has become a partner in the war against drugs. Burmese child defectors from the army who now live in refugee camps in Thailand have corroborated reports that the Burmese military has fueled its soldiers by making them take amphetamines, washed down with whiskey, before going into combat. Countries that force drugged children into deadly combat should not be considered allies by the United States in any war.  In response to Human Rights Watch's report, a Burmese military spokesman denied that Burma ``recruits'' underage soldiers and incredulously asserted that Burma's military is an all-volunteer army. Such brazen lies should convince no one that the Burmese government has changed its repressive ways.  If Than Swe, as head of the Burmese government, is committed to upholding international standards of human rights, it can begin by enacting meaningful and verifiable economic, political, and judicial reforms. It should release the seven NLDP members it has unjustly arrested and all other political prisoners, and it should allow Aung San Suu Kyi to meet and communicate freely with Burmese citizens throughout the country, as well as with international representatives. Until the Burmese junta agrees to hold free and fair elections to allow the Burmese people the opportunity to choose their own leaders, it must be aware that American sanctions will continue.  I ask that the article to which I referred be printed in the Record.  The article follows:               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 10, 2003]             Burma's Child Soldiers Tell of Army Atrocities                          (By Ellen Nakashima)       He was taught how to hold an assault rifle and aim it at an      enemy. He was taught how to pull a trigger, aim at the next      enemy and pull the trigger again. He learned all this, he      says, by the time he was 12, when he was officially declared      a soldier of Burma and sent to the front lines of a long-     running civil war.       Now 14, the taciturn boy Kyaw Zay Ya lives in a rebel-held      village in Burma near the Thai border, one of the few places      in the country willing to protect him from service in what      human rights monitors call the largest child army in the      world.       According to New York-based Human Rights Watch, Burman's      army of 350,000 includes as many as 70,000 youths under 18. A      study the group issued last October found that rebel groups      fighting the army also use child soldiers, though in far      smaller numbers.       The numbers would make the military-ruled Burma, also known      as Myanmar, the worst violator of international laws against      using children in armed conflicts, Human Rights Watch      contends.       The Burmese government has denied that its army takes in      recruits under 18, and says that its force is all volunteer.      But people interviewed in safe houses and camps along the      border disputed those contentions.       In a two-hour talk here, Kyaw said he was press-ganged into      the army at age 11, took part in combat repeatedly and felt      ``afraid and very far from home.''       Another young man, Naing Win, said he was 16 when he was      ordered into a nasty firefight. To fuel the soldiers, he      said, the commander made them take amphetamines, washed down      with whiskey. The troops, Naing recalled, ``got very happy.''       In the encounter, each soldier was ordered to lob five      grenades at the enemy. Naing, whose forehead bears a shrapnel      scar, said he was sufficiently high on the drugs that at one      point he was throwing stones. With one grenade, he forgot to      remove the pin that allows it to explode. then he was ordered      to run forward exposed to enemy fire, retrieve the grenade,      take out the pin and throw it again. The battle killed his      best friend, 15.       Another time, after his unit had won a battle against      ethnic Karenni rebels, his commander wanted the area cleared      of mines. But 40 Karenni villagers were made to walk through      the mined zone, he said. In the ensuing explosions, some died      and some lost their legs. Those who survived were lined up.      Naing said he and several other soldiers were ordered to      shoot them. They did.       ``I'm very sorry,'' he said.       For much of Burma's history since it gained independence in      1948, the national army has been fighting guerrilla armies      fielded by ethnic groups that want control of their own      affairs and regions. Currently, army operations consist      largely of low-intensity conflicts against a handful of      opposition groups, notably the Shan State Army, the Karen      National Liberation Army and the Karenni Army.       The army has a major advantage in numbers over these      groups, none of which has more than 15,000 troops, according      to Karen and Karenni officials and Human Rights Watch, but      they say the army still employs underage soldiers.       ``Children are picked up off the street when they are 11      years old,'' said Jo Becker, child advocacy director for      Human Rights Watch. ``Many have no chance to contact their      families and see their parents again. Everyone we had talked      to had been beaten during the training. Most were desperately      unhappy.''       The Burmese government denies the charges. ``I am totally      flabbergasted at the assertions in the Human Rights Watch      report,'' said Col. Hla Min, deputy head of the Defense      Ministry's International Affairs Department in the capital,      Rangoon. ``The Myanmar Defense Forces does not recruit      underage and, in fact, MDF is a voluntary army. Today, after      98 percent of all the insurgents have made peace with the      government, there is not much need for recruitment as accused      by certain quarters.''       In a faxed reply to a query, he stated that the Burmese      troops are now engaged in work similar to that of the U.S.      Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.       U Kyaw Tint Swe, Burma's ambassador to the United Nations,      said in a statement to the U.N. Security Council on Jan. 14      that ``there is no credible evidence of the use and      recruitment of children by the Myanmar armed forces.''       U.S. policy is that people can enlist in the military at      age 17, but must be at least 18 to serve on front lines.       In an interview, a 19-year-old named Aung, who asked that      his full name not be used, said he was taken into the army in      1998 at age 14 after seven years in an army-run prep camp,      named Ye Nyunt. There he and others learned to march in      straight rows, clean guns and recognize land mines. Aung was      9 when he first picked up a gun, a standard army-issue G-3.      The gun was taller than he was, he recalled.       Aung though that after he finished his studies, he would      become an army captain. But one June day in 1998, when he was      14, a general showed up at the school. All boys older than 13      who had not finished the 10th grade were pulled aside. He and      his schoolmates thought they were just being sent to another      class. Instead, they were trucked to a holding center in      Mandalay. ``I got to the army by force,'' he said, ``not      voluntarily.''       Aung said he first saw battle at the age of 15, and he was      sick for three days afterward. But he grew used to it: In the      following two years, he took part in seven major firefights      and countless minor skirmishes, he said.       The worse battle lasted from early morning into the      evening, in the village of Loi Lin Lay in 1999. The fighting      began at the back of the village and by afternoon had moved      to the front, where he and his friend, another 15-year-old,      were deployed. By nightfall, most of his Burmese counterparts      were dead.       ``During the fighting, you don't have time to think,'' he      says. ``Only shoot.''       He said he felt powerless to resist. In the army, ``if a      bad person gives an order, you have to follow it. If he says      burn the village, you have to burn it. If he says kill a      person, you have to do it.''       Naing Win, the boy soldier who recounted use of      amphetamines, said in an interview that he was picked up at a      train station near Mandalay when he was 15. Authorities found      he had no identification card and gave him a choice: Join the      army or go to prison. He was forced into a truck with 40      other people, 16 of whom were boys. They were taken to an      army base, then to a holding camp for recruits.       If a boy refused to east his food, was late or missed a      task, the other soldiers would often be forced to beat the      victim with bamboo strips or a whip, Naing said. There were      other forms of punishment, the former soldiers said, such as      jumping in the sand like frogs for 10 minutes, or lying flat      on the ground and staring at the sun.       One boy was stripped naked, his hands and legs tied, Naing      recalled. After 20 or 30 blows, his skin was bloody. An      officer rubbed salt into the wounds on his back. The boy      screamed in pain. Hours later, he was dead.       But not all officers were harsh, said Kyaw, who recounted      being plucked for military service from a bus stop near      Rangoon at age 11. One officer let the boys watch videos,      including James Bond movies. Others would arrange      surreptitious meetings between a youngster and his parents.       In the field, they had duties that included rounding up      villagers in rebel areas to serve as porters, the former      soldiers said. Those who balked or could not keep up were      beaten or killed. Naing said he also witnessed Karenni      villagers being raped. A general told the soldiers that      raping women serves ``to give the soldiers energy.''       ``Some of my friends said, `It's okay. They're not Burmese.      They're Karenni.'' Once, he said, he saw a teenage girl being      raped repeatedly in an open field in the evening. First came      the battalion leader, then a bodyguard, then ordinary      soldiers. She was screaming and crying. She was left to die,      he said.       All three of the former soldiers said they eventually      deserted.       Naing fled in 1995, after six years in the army. He married      a Karenni woman and joined the Burma Patriotic Army, a group      of 30 fellow deserters whose aim is to oppose the central      government in Rangoon. He said he has pretty much abandoned      hope of seeing his family in Mandalay province again, unless      there is a change in government. He still dreams about his      friend who was killed.       Aung escaped in May 2001. Today, he lives in a Thai town      near the border and works odd jobs. He is waiting for the      political situation to change, so that he can return home to      Rangoon province. The only way he expects that to be possible      is if ``people in the outside world put a lot of pressure on      the government.''       And last September, after three years in uniform, Kyaw was      bathing alone in a stream near a waterfall. No one was      watching. He bolted. After walking for four hours, he reached      a Karen village, where soldiers tied his hands an punched      him, thinking he might be a spy. After he convinced a Karen      officer that he was a true deserter, he was given refuge in a      border village.       He does not dare to go home. ``They will put me in      prison,'' he said. He has no desire to resume studying. His      only desire is to be a kickboxer one day, like his favorite      Burmese boxers Shwe da Win and Wan Chai. He says he does not      think much about the army. He has no nightmares. ``I don't      dream,'' he said.                          ____________________
