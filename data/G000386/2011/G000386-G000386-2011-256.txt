 It provides that a strategy that relies on the tax law to reduce, to avoid, or to defer tax liability cannot be novel or nonobvious.  So a strategy for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability will be deemed insufficient to differentiate a claimed invention from the prior art for purposes of evaluating an invention under section 102 or section 103 of the bill that is before us. This ensures that taxpayers and their advisers will then be guaranteed equal access to the tax laws, and that is obviously the fair way to do it. It is the commonsense way to do it.  So I wish to be clear that tax preparation software is not a tax strategy. Senior policy and examination staff from the Patent and Trademark Office agree that such software is not a tax strategy.  I also have letters from H&R Block, KPMG LLP, and Grant Thornton that state that the underlying language does not impact their software patents. Again, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    H&R Block,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2011.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Ranking Member Grassley, Our company has reviewed the      language in Section 14 of the Patent Reform Act of 2011, now      pending in Congress. Although H&R Block holds and is seeking      numerous patents pertaining to methods of delivering tax      advice and tax return preparation, H&R Block's inventions do      not, by their nature, reduce, avoid, or defer tax liability.      Therefore, at this time, we do not have any major concerns      regarding the language in the Act that statutorily deems that      all strategies for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax      liability are `in the prior art' and not patentable.      Nonetheless, we should mention that H&R Block is concerned      about the precedent that this bill will set. Our fear is that      Congress is going down the path where, in the future, it will      simply declare ``not patentable'' any subject matter it deems      to be unpopular or politically unfavorable.           Sincerely,                                                    Brian Donohue,     AVP, Government Relations.                                  ____                                                     KPMG LLP,                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2011.     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Chairman,     Hon. Charles Grassley, Ranking Member,     U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary 224 Dirksen Senate          Office Building Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We would      like to commend you on the inclusion of section 14--a ban on      the patenting of tax strategies--in S. 23, the Patent Reform      Act of 2011, recently approved and reported by the Committee.       We agree with the sentiments expressed by Sen. Grassley on      February 3rd that ``[i]f firms or individuals were able to      hold patents for these strategies, some taxpayers could face      fees simply for complying with the tax code.'' Taxpayers      should not be forced to choose between paying more tax than      they are legally obligated to pay or paying royalties to a      third party with a patent on a legal method of complying with      tax law. Tax strategy patents create higher costs and produce      confusion for taxpayers and their advisors.       As noted by the AICPA in its letter to you, tax strategy      patents undermine Congressional authority, intent, and      control of tax policy, and would create inequalities among      taxpayers. No person should hold exclusive rights over how to      comply with the Tax Code.       We are a firm with extensive experience in the provision of      tax advice to clients, and we are a firm that develops its      own proprietary tax tools, including computer software. We      therefore appreciate the proper balance between the      protection of intellectual property rights and the public      policy concerns implicated by extending that protection to      patents on tax planning. This bill gives proper deference to      the rights of the taxpayer and the already complex      requirements of a tax advisor. We therefore urge inclusion of      section 14 by the Senate in the final version of S. 23.           Respectfully yours,     KPMG LLP.                                  ____                                               Grant Thornton,                                Washington, DC, February 24, 2011.     Re: Tax strategy patent legislation.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Gentlemen: I am writing to offer Grant Thornton's      strong support for the tax strategy patent provision included      in the patent reform legislation (S. 23) recently approved by      the Senate Judiciary Committee and now poised for full Senate      consideration. I would like to commend you for your      commitment to addressing the problems created     by tax strategy patents and for including the tax strategy      patent provision in S. 23.       Patents on tax strategy methods threaten the integrity,      fairness, and administration of the tax system, and Grant      Thornton believes resolving this problem must be an essential      component of any patent reform legislation. Grant Thornton      wants to encourage you to aggressively oppose efforts to      remove or weaken the tax strategy patent provision in S. 23.       Tax strategy patents grant private legal parties virtual      20-year monopolies over particular methods of compliance with      U.S. tax laws. Taxpayers cannot satisfy their legal      obligations using a patented interpretation of the tax code,      allowing patent holders to privatize tax provisions that      Congress intended for everyone. This makes a uniform      application of the U.S. Tax Code impossible, potentially      forcing taxpayers to pay more tax than Congress intended and      more tax than similarly situated taxpayers. Tax strategy      patents threaten to undermine public confidence in the      nation's tax laws, hinder compliance, and mislead taxpayers      into believing that a patented strategy has been approved by      the IRS solely because a patent was granted. In addition, tax      strategy patents increase the costs and burdens of      compliance. Preparers and taxpayers must not only determine      the proper tax treatment of an item, but also whether that      treatment is covered by a patent, whether the patent might be      infringed by properly reporting the item, and whether the      patent is valid.       Grant Thornton believes that no one should have a patent on      the application of the law to the facts and that the granting      of tax strategy patents should be prohibited by legislation.      Grant Thornton supports the provision in Section 14 of S. 23,      which is based on the freestanding legislation S. 139. The      new provision builds on previous legislative efforts that      enjoyed wide bipartisan support in both chambers. In the      110th Congress, the House passed a patent reform bill that      would have barred tax strategy patents.       The new language in S. 23 would designate any claim on a      patent application for a ``strategy for reducing, avoiding,      or deferring tax liability'' as indistinguishable from prior      art, and thus preclude applicants from using a tax strategy      as the point of novelty. Grant Thornton believes this      provision needs to be enacted quickly. Over 130 tax strategy      patents have already ben approved and more than 150 are      currently pending.       Grant Thornton agrees that patents should continue to be      available for tax preparation software, so long as the patent      does not extend to tax strategies embedded in the software.      Grant Thornton believes the bill sufficiently addresses the      serious concerns raised by tax strategy patents without      infringing on the rights of others to copyright, trademark or      patent software that assists in the implementation of tax      planning.
