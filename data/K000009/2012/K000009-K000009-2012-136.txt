Speaker, entrepreneur Tim Kiedrowski grew up in Lorain, Ohio and is a proud 1973 graduate of Admiral King High School, named for Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King, a Lorain native and Chief of Naval Operations during WWII. Tim was a drummer in the Admiral King (HS) Admirals band, as well as in numerous local rock-n-roll bands.  Shortly after his high school graduation, in search of employment, Tim was hired by Leonard DeLuca, the owner of DeLuca's Bakery in Downtown Lorain. Len soon entrusted Tim with the responsibility of opening the bakery every morning to start the preparation of baked goods for the day. Tim continued to work at DeLuca's Bakery until 1975 and continued playing drums in area bands.  Tim married his sweetheart, Terri Girz in 1977, and wanting more job security, he became a welder for P.C. Campana, Inc. in 1975 until 1981. A downturn in the local economy caused many layoffs, and Tim was one of the casualties. Terri continued her work as an OB-GYN Registered Nurse at St. Joseph Hospital in Lorain, and Tim became `Mr. Mom' for their family for the next 2 years.  On Christmas Eve, 1983, Tim was hired as a baker at the Simply Delicious Bakery in Downtown Amherst, Ohio. Tim enjoyed his return to the ``dough business'', but 1 month into the job, the owner of the bakery declared bankruptcy and asked Tim if he wanted to become chief cook and bottlewasher. Never afraid of a challenge, Tim and Terri took out a small business loan to buy the bakery. Proud of their Polish heritage, the name was officially changed to Kiedrowski's Simply Delicious Bakery as of November, 1984. They remained in Downtown Amherst for 11 years.  Accidents can be disastrous in a bakery, but the ``snoogle accident'' was a welcome one for the Kiedrowski's. Late one evening in the bakery, Tim was preparing Ladylocks and Terri was working on a batch of cheese Danish. With leftover ingredients, these two happy bakers set out to create something new. A little of this, a little of that, and voila!, the Snoogle was born. These airy, cheese-filled concoctions have become Kiedrowski's biggest seller, and in April, 2011, they were awarded a patent for the Snoogle . It is not unusual for the bakery to sell 100 dozen over the course of a weekend.  In 1994, Tim and his crew packed up the mixers, ovens and all of the baking ingredients and moved into their current location at 2267 Cooper Foster Park Road in Amherst.  In 1997, again on Christmas Eve, Tim and Terri started brainstorming about ways to get customers into the bakery during the January ``slow season.'' After much discussion with family and friends, Tim proposed to host an old-fashioned Polish wedding (aka The Paczki Ball) just before Lent. Naysayers told Tim he could never organize this type of feast in 6-weeks time, but he set out to prove them wrong. With a few ads on local radio stations WEOL and WOBL as well as word-of-mouth, Tim and Terri hoped to sell 100 tickets to the first Paczki Ball in 1998, held at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Lorain. Party-goers quickly lined up at the door, and after 150 tickets were sold, the remaining guests had to be turned away. Karol Kiedrowski Peltz was crowned the first Paczki Ball Queen. Joseph Girz, Terri's father and well-known as ``Doughboy Joe'' (and the inspiration for the Kiedrowski logo) was crowned the first Paczki Ball King.  The Paczki Ball was moved to Lorain Catholic High School in 1999, a larger venue, and 375 tickets were sold. In 2002, the event moved to DeLuca's Place in the Park, a large party center owned by Tim's former boss, Leonard DeLuca. In 2003, the production of paczki as well as the Paczki Ball were videotaped by Army Armstrong for a film that would debut the following year. In this same year, new entertainment was added at the ball, the ``Presentation of the Paczkis'', was the hit of the party, and continues to this day. In 2011, Kiedrowski's Bakery sold over 50,000 paczkis during the Lenten season.  Life is never easy as a bakery owner. Tim and Terri had four boys: Matthew, Mark, Michael and Timmy, and there were nights that the boys did their homework and slept at the bakery while their parents did ``prep work'' for the next day's business. Terri became a self-taught cake decorator, working on birthday, graduation and wedding cakes at night after her shift was done at the hospital. Proud of their Catholic upbringing, Tim and Terri sent their boys to St. Anthony's elementary school followed by Lorain Catholic High School. Tim never had the opportunity to go to college, but encouraged his sons to further their education. Each of the boys went on to college to earn their respective degrees.  At the beginning of the Lenten season in 2011, Tim was notified that he was a finalist for the first-ever ``Best Bakery in America'' online contest, sponsored by Baking Buyer Magazine and Dawn Foods. With creative brainstorming over the course of 6 weeks, Kiedrowski's Simply Delicious Bakery was declared the winner, with more than 50 percent of the votes cast. Tim remarked that all of his years of hard work provided him with his honorary ``Degree of Baking'', but the Best Bakery in America Award provided him with the validation.  Kiedrowski's has celebrated its Polish heritage for 28 years through baking, and plans to share their delicious pastries for many years to come as they sweeten America's palate as America's Best Bakery.                          ____________________
