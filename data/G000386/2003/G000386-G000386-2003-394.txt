 President, in addition to what the Senator expressed, it is a desire on our part that we would have some votes yet today and that we would like to move along very quickly. I think the spirit he has set is one that is shared on our side, even to the point of being specific statements from our leadership, the extent to which they would hope to have some votes today.  I yield the floor.
