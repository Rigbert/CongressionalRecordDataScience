 President, I rise today to report on some of the progress we have made in our effort to secure our Nation's ports and our cargo container system.  This morning, I testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs about the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act which I introduced last year with Senators Collins, Coleman, and Lieberman. That critical and effective bill is on the fast track both in the House and in the Senate.  While that hearing was starting, we received another urgent reminder of why we need to improve our cargo security in this Nation. This morning, this very morning at the Port of Seattle, 21 Chinese nationals were discovered.
