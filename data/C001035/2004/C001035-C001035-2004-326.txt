President, I direct the attention of the Senator from Alaska to line 16 on page 115, which clearly says that:       The President shall disclose to the public for each fiscal      year after fiscal year 2005 the aggregate amount of      appropriations requested . . . for the National Intelligence      Program.  It does not say that we are requiring disclosure of the appropriations for the elements that make up the national intelligence program.
