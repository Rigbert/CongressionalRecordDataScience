They did a limited extension, not permanent extensions, and they dealt with all of the extenders, and they had a 2-year extension, as you know.  Whether or not we are looking at doing something temporarily while we prepare for what I think both sides think are necessary, and that is a major tax reform bill at some point in time in the spring or the summer, can the gentleman tell me whether there is that component of the consideration of the tax extenders legislation?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman again. As the gentleman stated, yes, coming out of the House we made it permanent because that gives much greater stability to the country, and that is still part of the negotiation.  The Senate has a different idea than inside the House. None of that has been finalized yet. When the negotiation gets finalized, that will give us the answer.
