I am concerned about the oil that is consumed in America and the gasoline consumed in America. I don't care if Toyota makes a car that is sold in Australia and what the mileage might be. That is their concern.  For us to take the attitude or approach that we are not even going to hold the manufacturer to any higher standards with fuel efficiency in my mind is a concession that we will be dependent on foreign oil for as long as we can imagine.  The Senator from Missouri says I am engaged in a ``Soviet survival'' approach to the economy. I will just tell him that I don't believe it was a Soviet-style approach which enacted CAFE in the first instance and resulted in such a dramatic decline in our dependence on foreign oil.  As to the argument that this kills jobs, the idea this kills jobs, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of endorsement from the Transport Workers Union of America. Here is one union that supports it.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Transport Workers Union                                                   of America,                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 2005.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 130,000 members of the      Transport Workers Union and transit and rail workers      everywhere, we urge you to vote for the Durbin CAFE amendment      to the pending energy bill to raise fuel economy standards.       The amendment requires all car companies in America--both      domestic and foreign--to increase average fuel efficiency.      This is achievable with current technology and so clearly in      the national interest that it is difficult to understand how      anyone could oppose it:       (1) National Security--in an era when the United States is      under attack from foreign fanatics, it is of critical      importance to reduce our dependence on foreign oil imports,      most especially when those imports support and subsidize      those very nations which are the source of these attacks.       (2) Air Pollution--Opponents of environmental measures are      fond of citing the need for established, proven science.      There is no dispute that auto emissions are one of the major      sources of air pollution in the modern era.       (3) Reducing Health Costs--Auto emissions are a major cause      of asthma and other respiratory diseases and a major      contributor to the rising health care costs in America. These      costs are, in turn, a major factor in the difficulty American      manufacturers have in competing with foreign manufacturers.       It would be disingenuous to pretend that the members of the      Transport Workers Union do not have a major stake in reducing      the costs to the U.S. economy--accidents, death, healthcare,      pollution cleanup, and enforcement--of automobile use.      Certainly anything that would stop the extreme subsidizing of      auto use in America and allow the marketplace to drive      consumers to the most efficient use of transportation      resources would increase jobs for the rail and transit      workers we represent.       But that is an important point. Tightening auto fuel      efficiency standards would not, as some argue, reduce      American jobs. It would simply transfer them from one      industry to another--to an industry which is not only highly      unionized and highly compensated, but which promotes the      national interest of security, a clean environment and lower      health care costs.       We urge you to vote for the Durbin fuel economy amendment      to the energy bill.           Sincerely,                                                  Roger Tauss,                                             Legislative Director,                                          Transport Workers Union.
