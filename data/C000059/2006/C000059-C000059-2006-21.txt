Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  I certainly want to support the gentlewoman's amendment also. Representative Millender-McDonald's amendment is certainly one on which we should all agree. This is something that needs to be clearly defined and stated, that airlift and sealift requirements to ensure our Nation's future mobility force structure capabilities are able to meet future needs.  In this war, 70 percent of the cargo missions have been flown by C-17s. That is a 60 percent increase over the military's own prewar anticipated usage of the plane. In addition to military uses, C-17s have been used in humanitarian efforts to bring food and supplies to victims of Hurricane Katrina and to the Far East disasters there last year.  Senior leaders at the DOD can't seem to find clearly the exact number of C-17s required. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force states 187 TRANSCOM and Air Mobility Commander stated 200 C-17s are required. The former TRANSCOM commander, General Handy, whom I respect immensely, stated that 225 C-17s are required.  In addition to senior leaders of DOD, the Defense Science Board, in a report dated September 2005, raised concerns about the adequacy of the Pentagon's organic and strategic sealift and aerial tankers.  Therefore, I support this amendment so we can get on to fulfill our congressional oversight responsibility and ensure that our mobility system adequately supports current and future force structure requirements.
