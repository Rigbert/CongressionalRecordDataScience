Chairman, in closing, I would like to say that BSEE has done an enormous amount of study and assessment. They continue to do so as they look at the operations of oil and gas industry in California, certainly off the coast of California.  Many people don't realize how large a producer the State of California is in the oil and gas industry. It has a long history in the State of California, one of the largest oil companies in the country, Chevron, still one of the few that operates out of the State of California, and we are certainly very proud of that.  It has not been a perfect history, but the science has improved. The production practices have improved, and it is certainly an important part of our economy, and we want to make sure that they continue to operate safely. We are going to make sure that these agencies do the necessary regulatory work that they need to do.  So I am opposed to this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
