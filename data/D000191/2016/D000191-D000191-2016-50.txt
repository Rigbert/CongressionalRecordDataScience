Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, there are 1,100 harbors that this would apply to across the United States. We have already discussed at great length the fact that the Corps has a $2.4 billion backlog of O&M under existing authority and, after today, a $74 billion backlog of authorized but unconstructed projects.  I understand the gentleman's concerns, and he is being a great advocate for his home port; but I would direct a question to the gentleman if, perhaps, he can answer it: With 1,100 ports in America, how many other ports are ina similar situation? And what would the cost be to the Corps, which already has a $2.5 billion backlog in O&M?  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).
