Mr. President, today, the Senate considers the nomination of Jerome A. Holmes for a lifetime appointment to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Just last week we confirmed another nominee to the Tenth Circuit, the fifth to be appointed by this President. This progress comes in stark contrast to the seven years in which a Republican-led Senate failed to confirm a single new judge for that court. Indeed, when I moved forward with the nominations of Harris Hartz of New Mexico, Terrence O'Brien of Wyoming, and Michael McConnell of Utah, it broke a longstanding partisan barricade that had been maintained by Republicans. Among the victims of the Republican obstruction were outstanding lawyers President Clinton nominated such as James Lyons and Christine Arguello, who were never even granted hearings by the Republican majority. Judge Lyons was among the many Clinton nominees voted unanimously ``Well Qualified'' by the American Bar Association who were never granted hearings, and Ms. Arguello is a talented Hispanic attorney whose nomination had significant, widespread and bipartisan support from her community and State.
