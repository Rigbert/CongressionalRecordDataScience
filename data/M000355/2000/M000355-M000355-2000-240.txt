 I am told the appropriate way to do that is to burn it. I wonder if the Senator from Utah shares my view with regard to if that is, in fact, the appropriate way to dispose of a flag that actually has reached the end of its useful life, how would we determine which flag burning was a desecration and which was actually an honor?
