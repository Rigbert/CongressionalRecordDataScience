Speaker, I thank my friend from Ohio, [Mr. Traficant] for yielding, and I thank the gentleman from California, [Mr. Kim], as well.  Obviously, Mr. Speaker, I am in very strong support of the pending resolution on the Special Olympics. It is an extraordinarily worthwhile endeavor, giving hope and opportunity to so many folks, and it is worthwhile that the Capitol Grounds be allocated for that particular purpose.  In addition, Mr. Speaker, I was a little late getting here and it passed with such efficiency and effectiveness that I failed to timely reach the floor. But I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio yielding and his suggestions as well and rise in strong support of H.Con.Res. 49, which authorizes the use of the grounds of the U.S. Capitol for a truly wonderful and family-oriented event, the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby.  Mr. Speaker, I have sponsored this resolution for the past 6 years, and I want to thank the committee and its staff for assuring the timely passage of this resolution in each one of those years. This Soap Box Derby is an American tradition. The Hill, Capitol Hill, is an excellent hill from which to do that, and it is certainly appropriate that on July 12, just a week after the birthday of our Nation, that this very American of traditions is carried out in the site of the U.S. Capitol.  It is a tradition which teaches to young people self-reliance, the worth of competition, and the worth of adding their hands and their talent to constructing something of worth.  So I again express my strong support not only of the resolution already passed on the Soap Box Derby, but on this one as well.
