 President, I am offering today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to Joseph Gabra and his wife, Sharon Kamel, Egyptian nationals currently living with their children in Camarillo, California.  Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel entered the United States legally on November 1, 1998, on tourist visas.
