Speaker, first of all, I am extraordinarily pleased that I found the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay).  Mr. Leader, I would appreciate and I know all Members would: We were here late last night. We have been working hard. I know the conference committee has been working very hard.  If the gentleman would bring us up to date for what he sees as the balance of the day and the balance of the week.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
