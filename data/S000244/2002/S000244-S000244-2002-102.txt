Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, a national insurance crisis is ruining the Nation's essential health care system. Medical professional liability insurance rates have soared, causing many insurers to either drop coverage or raise premiums to unaffordable levels. Doctors and other health care providers are being forced to abandon patients and practices, particularly in high-risk specialties such as emergency medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. This trend has had a particularly negative impact upon women, low-income neighborhoods and rural areas, and in medical schools large and small.  When California faced a similar crisis over 25 years ago, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, following the recommendation of the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), then chairman of the California Assembly's Select Committee on Medical Malpractice, enacted the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act, known as MICRA.  MICRA's reforms include a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, limits on the contingency fees lawyers can charge, and provisions that prevent double recoveries. According to the Los Angeles Times, ``Because of the 1975 tort reform, doctors in California are largely unaffected by increasing insurance rates. But the situation is dire in other States.'' Exhaustive research by two Stanford University economists has confirmed that direct medical care litigation reforms, including caps on noneconomic damage awards, generally reduce malpractice claims rates, insurance premiums and other stresses upon doctors that may impair the quality of medical care.  The HEALTH Act includes MICRA's reforms, while also creating a fair share rule by which defendants are only liable for the percentage of damages for which they are at fault. Additionally, H.R. 4600 sets reasonable guidelines, but not caps, on punitive damage awards. Under this legislation, a punitive damage award cannot exceed the greater of $250,000, or two times the amount of economic damages that are awarded.  The HEALTH Act will accomplish reform without limiting compensation for 100 percent, or all of plaintiffs' economic losses, meaning any loss which can be quantified and to which a receipt can be attached. These include their medical costs, lost wages, future lost wages, rehabilitation costs, and any other economic out-of-pocket loss suffered as a result of a health care injury.  Additionally, although this legislation places a cap on noneconomic damages, it also allows deserving victims to keep more of their jury awards by limiting the percentage that lawyers can take. This is accomplished according to a sliding scale that caps legal fees down to 15 percent of awards exceeding $600,000. Without such reforms, lawyers can take their standard one-third to 40 percent cut from whatever victims recover. Enactment of this bill will allow victims to keep roughly 75 percent of awards under $600,000 and 85 percent of awards over that amount. Under the HEALTH Act, the larger the demonstrable, real-life economic damages are, the more the victims will get to keep.  A recent survey conducted for the bipartisan legal reform organization Common Good, whose board of advisers includes former Clinton administration Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and former Democratic Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, reveals the dire need for regulating the current medical tort system in America. According to the survey, which was conducted by the reputable Harris organization:  First, more than three-fourths of physicians feel that concern about malpractice litigation has hurt their ability to provide quality care in recent years; second, 79 percent of physicians report that fear of malpractice claims causes them to order more tests than they would based only on the professional judgment of what is medically needed.  As former Democrat Senator and Presidential candidate George McGovern and former Republican Senator Alan Simpson have written, ``Legal fear drives doctors to prescribe medications and order tests, even invasive procedures, that they feel are unnecessary. Reputable studies estimate that this defensive medicine squanders $50 billion a year. The Common Good survey also asked physicians the following question: Generally speak, how much do you think that fear of liability discourages medical professionals from openly discussing and thinking of ways to reduce medical errors?                              {time}  1330  An astonishing 59 percent of physicians replied ``a lot.''  Americans want to see their friends and loved ones receive the best and most accessible health care available, but, with greater and greater frequency, doctors are not there to deliver it because they have been priced out of the healing profession by unaffordable professional liability insurance rates.  Sound policy does not favor supporting one person's abstract ability to sue a doctor for unlimited and unquantifiable damages when doing so means that health care will become less accessible and less affordable to all Americans, particularly to women, to the poor and to those who live in rural areas.  The American Bar Association estimates that there are 1 million lawyers in the United States, but all of us, all 287 million Americans, are patients, and as patients and for patients, I urge my colleagues to support the HEALTH Act.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
