President, of the 105 judicial vacancies that have occurred so far this year, the Senate has acted to fill only 39. The last year of the Bush Administration, a presidential year in which we had the reverse situation with a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, the Senate confirmed 66 judges--70 percent more than the number confirmed this year. Over the 2-year span of this Congress, the Senate will have confirmed only 73 judges. By contrast, the Democratic Senate in the last two years of President Bush's Administration confirmed 124 judges--70 percent more judges than the number confirmed by this Congress. Indeed, in the last eleven weeks of Congress in 1992, a Democratic Senate held four judicial nominations hearings and confirmed 29 judges. In the last eleven weeks of this Congress, Republicans will have managed to hold no hearings and confirm no judges.  President Clinton has tried to make progress on bringing greater diversity to our federal courts. He has been successful to some extent. With our help, he could have done so much more. We will end this Congress without having acted on any of the African American nominees sent to us to fill vacancies on the Fourth Circuit and finally integrate the Circuit with the highest percentage of African American population in the country, but the one Circuit that has never had an African American judge. We could have acted on the nomination of Kathleen McCree Lewis and confirmed her to the Sixth Circuit to be the first African American woman to sit on that Court. Instead, we will end the year without having acted on any of the outstanding nominees to the Sixth Circuit pending before us.  This Judiciary Committee reported only three nominees to the Courts of Appeals all year. We held hearings without even including a nominee to the Courts of Appeals and denied a Committee vote to two outstanding nominees who succeeded in getting hearings. I certainly understand the frustration of those Senators who know that Roger Gregory, Judge James Wynn, Kathleen McCree Lewis, as well as Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell and others should have been considered by this Committee and voted on by the Senate this year.  There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits. With 24 current vacancies, our appellate courts have nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the federal court system. I note that the vacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more than 12 percent nationwide. If we were to take into account the additional appellate judgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, S. 3071, a bill that was requested by the Judicial Conference to handle current workloads, the vacancy rate on our federal courts of appeals would be more than 17 percent.  The Chairman declares that ``there is and has been no judicial vacancy crisis'' and that he calculates vacancies at ``less than zero.'' The extraordinary service that has been provided by our corps of senior judges does not mean there are no vacancies. In the federal courts around the country there remain 66 current vacancies and 12 more on the horizon. With the judgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, there would be over 135 vacancies across the country. That is the truer measure of vacancies, many of which have been long-standing judicial emergency vacancies in our southwest border states. The Chief Judges of both the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have had to declare their entire courts in emergencies since there are too many vacancies and too few Circuit judges to handle their workload.  After creating 85 additional judgeships in 1990, Congress reduced the vacancies from 131 in 1991, to 103 in 1992, to 112 in 1993, to 63 in 1994. Vacancies were going down and we were acting with Republican and Democratic Presidents to fill the 85 judgeships createdby a Democratic Congress under a Republican President in 1990. We will end this session with more vacancies than at the end of the session in 1994, without having added the judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference. Since Republicans assumed control of the Senate in the 1994 election, the Senate has not closed the vacancy gap at all and the workloads in many of our courts have gotten significantly worse. More vacancies are continuing longer, and it has taken longer to confirm nominees to existing vacancies. We have lost ground and squandered opportunities for progress in the past six years.  As I have pointed out, the vacancies are most acute among our Courts of Appeals and in our southwest border States. We have not acted to add the judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference to meet increased workloads over the last decade. According to the Chief Justice's 1999 year-end report, the filings of cases in our Federal courts have reached record heights. In fact, the filings of criminal cases and defendants reached their highest levels since the Prohibition Amendment was repealed in 1933. Also in 1999, there were 54,693 filings in the 12 regional Courts of Appeals. Overall growth in appellate court caseload last year was due to a 349 percent upsurge in original proceedings. This sudden expansion resulted from newly implemented reporting procedures, which more accurately measure the increased judicial workload generated by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, both passed in 1996.  I regret to report again today that the last confirmation hearing for federal judges held by the Judiciary Committee was in July, as was the last time the Judiciary Committee reported any nominees to the full Senate. Throughout August, September, October, and now into November, there were no additional hearings held or even noticed, and no executive business meetings included any judicial nominees on the agenda. By contrast, in 1992, the last year of the Bush Administration, a Democratic majority in the Senate held three confirmation hearings in August and September and continued to work to confirm judges up to and including the last day of the session. During that presidential election year the Senate confirmed 66 judges; this year the Senate will not reach 40.  I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities. That highly-qualified nominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate should have joined with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around the country.  I regret that the Judiciary Committee did not hold additional hearings after July, that the Senate only acted on 39 nominees all year, and that we took so long on so many of them. I deeply regret the lack of a hearing and a vote on so many qualified nominees, including Roger Gregory, Judge James Wynn, Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell, Enrique Moreno and Allen Snyder. The Senate squandered a number of important opportunities to help our courts and should have accorded these qualified and outstanding nominees fair up or down votes.                          ____________________
