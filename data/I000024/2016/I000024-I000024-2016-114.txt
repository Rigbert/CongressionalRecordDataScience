 I don't recall at any time someone from the private sector like the Lautenbergs coming in and participating the way that she has. I really do appreciate it. I know she is around here somewhere.  But let me say this to the Senator: You came in when we lost Frank and where we all were at that time. I have to say publicly that you are the guy who jumped in there and filled the vacuum that was created by his loss. We could not have done it.  When I stop and think about all the people who are supporting this, in the years I have been here--I am talking about 22 years here in the Senate--I have never seen this happen before, where we have so much unanimity, not even on the highway bills or things we have done together. I want to make sure everyone knows that you are very much the reason where we are today. I hope we can finish this up today and make everyone happy.  I was talking to a group yesterday. In talking about this, we haven't really used the issue of jobs as we should have. They were talking about how many--I will not name the companies--that are right now employing in places such as China, India, and other places because of the uncertainty of the definitions that we have in this country. This completely solves that. I don't think anyone has ever put pencil to how many jobs can be immediately recreated in this country, along with other things, that will be coming in the future. This could end up being the greatest jobs bill, not of the year, but of the decade.  Does the Senator agree with that?
