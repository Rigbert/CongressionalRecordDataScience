Speaker, I rise today to share with you remarks made at the 6th Annual Charles County Economic Development Summit by William Burke on the occasion of presenting the ``John Bloom Citizen of the Year Award'' to Mayor William Eckman. Mayor Eckman is a true American patriot whose compassion, caring and concern for the residents of LaPlata shined forward during the difficult tornado disaster of April 2002. All of us in the Charles County community share Mr. Burke's enthusiasm in recognizing Mayor Eckman.  To follow are the remarks presented by William Burke, Board Member, Charles County Economic Development Commission, President, Southern Maryland Title on October 28, 2003.  ``I would like to start by stating that this award is not given out each year. Only when a citizen exemplifies the highest degree of devotion to the well being of our community, do we bring out this award. However, this year it is certainly necessary to acknowledge the devotion of Bill Eckman, the mayor of La Plata, with this award.  Bill Eckman first came to Maryland when AT transferred him here from Pennsylvania. He had been the Fire Chief in his Pennsylvania town. He joined the La Plata Volunteer Fire Department, where he served for 12 years. He has been a consistent and steady supporter, participant, teacher, writer and speaker for fire and rescue issues. He has traveled to many cities addressing fire and rescue infrastructure. He has started 9 specialized fire fighting training programs. After he retired from AT, he wrote a book about fire protection and water supply.  Bill and his wife Delores lead a bible study program focused on community. The program teaches others to build relationships and care for one another. Bill practices this philosophy in his activities with the Charlotte Hall Veterans Home where he regularly brings services and music with other lay preachers to the residents. This also gives him the opportunity to display another talent. Bill plays his trumpet with an informal group at the Veterans home.  Bill has been married for 52 years, has three children and three grandchildren.  Bill Eckman was a La Plata Town councilman for at least 10 years and has been mayor for 20 years.  In that time, La Plata has changed. The population has grown from under 2,000 to nearly 8,000. The Town Hall has had 4 homes and is getting ready to find a new location. The town staff has grown from 15 to 50.  He has devoted much of his adult life to municipal government. He has been the president of the Maryland Municipal League and is presently a well-respected member of the League's Legislative Committee. Often, he is asked to speak before the State Legislature.  It is safe to say that during this time Bill has made friends and earned the respect of elected officials on both sides of the aisle.  Bill has always wanted La Plata to be a happy place to live; a town that enjoys the fruits of good growth without losing the benefits of a small town. He has always wanted to plan, and whenever possible, to stay ahead of infrastructure needs. He has been known to get excited about the very unsexy jobs that come with being mayor--like putting in a new 15-inch sewer pipe.  Doug Miller, La Plata town manager, remembers when Bill first had the summer long concert ideas. Doug thought there might be a citizen turnout for 3-4 concerts, but thought Bill's vision was a bit ambitious. Well, for over 10 years, the La Plata Town Hall has hosted Friday night summer concerts to a packed lawn of families.  However, all the smart growth initiatives, concert series and sewer pipes were just sand in the bucket compared to the leadership Bill would exhibit after April 28, 2002. Every Mayor and Town Manager sweats weather conditions that have the potential of causing harm to their town and heaves a sigh of relief when storms pass on by, but this time they were not so fortunate. This time Bill had to go into high gear and get the job done. He had to stand strong for residents and businesses that faced ruin, despair and fear. He was dealing with a complete lack of services, the water tower was down, electricity was gone, telephone communication was hampered, helicopters were med-evac-ing the injured, and the press was descending. He will tell you that there were many people who made the miraculous recovery possible, but there always has to be a leader that makes everything seem possible.  Here is a quote from the newspaper. ``Every morning since the tornado hit early one Sunday evening, La Plata Mayor Bill Eckman has taken a walk around town to talk with demolition crews and neighbors.''  Regardless of how many people contributed there is a very interesting reason why recovery did not have to start from square one. Bill had already realized that La Plata was in transition and had previously put together a new town visioning process many months before the tornado.  The blue print for recovery was there because Bill is an optimist, a visionary and a leader.  It is for those qualities that we honor Bill Eckman as the 2003 Citizen of the Year.  Mr. Speaker, please join with me and the Charles County community in recognizing the numerous contributions Mayor Eckman has made to our County, our State and our Nation.                          ____________________
