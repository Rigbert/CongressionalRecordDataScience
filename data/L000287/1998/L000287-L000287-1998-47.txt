Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for those words and for taking the time to participate in this. She added so much.  I think what we all are saying tonight is that we must continue the dialogue, continue to talk to each other, continue to move to create the beloved community, an interracial democracy; continue to do what we can to lay down the burden of race.  It is ongoing. We do not necessarily have a blueprint, a road map. We are going down this road for the first time. I think if we can do it in the Congress, we can do it in the larger society. We are the leaders. We should go out and help get our districts and our States to talk about race, and do not be afraid to bring the dirt and the filth from under the American rug, out of the cracks and corners so we can see it, so we can deal with it.  I know the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Jay Dickey) was unable to go on the trip, but he had attended several of these meetings. I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Dickey).
