Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, I am a little bit disturbed that what the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) seemed to have said was that Congress should never question a court decision that is based on constitutional grounds. Had he and I been in Congress before the Civil War when the Supreme Court decided the Dred Scott case, I am sure both of us would be asking the House of Representatives to go on record opposing that decision as being misguided. We are doing something similar to that today.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).  Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, I rise in strong support of this resolution and against the court's decision. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling that the Pledge of Allegiance is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion is a complete misinterpretation of constitutional law. I would hope that this outrageous decision by this three-judge panel will be quickly overturned by the full Ninth Circuit Court or, if necessary, by the United States Supreme Court.  Incredibly, while Americans are pulling together following the horrific events of September 11, a panel of liberal Federal judges has chosen to challenge the time-honored Pledge of Allegiance. Like most Americans, I reject the court's unconscionable decision and stand resolutely with my colleagues today as we vote overwhelmingly to oppose this attack on an American symbol that we all hold dear.  Mr. Speaker, for all of the veterans who risked their lives for our country, for all the servicemen and servicewomen who serve today, and for all of our children who recite the Pledge every morning with respect and admiration, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and condemn the court's decision.
