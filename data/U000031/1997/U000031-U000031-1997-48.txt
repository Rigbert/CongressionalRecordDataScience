Speaker, I rise today to offer a tribute to a special friend who sadly is fiercely battling this awful disease called cancer.  Jonna Lynne Cullen, J.L. as we call her, served in this House as a staff member from 1967 until 1981. I got to know her very well when she was my boss at the Office of Management and Budget. She headed the Office of Legislative Affairs and to everyone's recollection she probably is the first woman that ever headed that office working for President Reagan from 1981 until 1984.  Mr. Speaker, she was a special friend. She was back here on the back rail. Many Members of Congress from those years, as they came into office, really learned the ropes in terms of what was going on, her ability to understand legislation, to work with all Members on both sides of the aisle. And it was sort of interesting, when she came in 1967, she worked for then the chairman, the Democratic chairman of the Committee on Rules, Bill Colmer. Trent Lott was his administrative assistant.  And Trent Lott came into office, of course, later on and is now the majority leader in the Senate. I know as I have spoken with both Trent Lott and other Members of the House that have moved to the other body, whether it be Olympia Snowe, Jim Jeffords, a whole host of Members that served here, they would very much like to speak this afternoon but of course as Members of the other body they are unable to do so.  As I look around the floor today and we have adjourned with legislative business, I have a number of my colleagues that are anxious to catch their planes and go back, but I wanted to recognize them in this hour that I have.  First, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the very distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston].
