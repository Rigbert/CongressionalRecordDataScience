Mr. Speaker, the American public has paid $500,000 for this report and deserves the right to know what is in it.  This weekend the Speaker himself said: ``I am totally in favor of releasing the report. The Speaker of the House is second in line to be President, is a very powerful position and the country deserves to know.''  Mr. Speaker, the country does deserve the right to know, and they deserve to know right now. Stop the stonewalling, stop the delay, stop the stalling. Release the outside counsel's report now and let the public draw their own conclusion. Anything less----                             point of order
