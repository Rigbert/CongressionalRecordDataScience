Would my colleague agree that we will work together in conference to develop a provision based on the following principle:  Swampbuster should operate in a manner that encourages voluntary restoration of wetlands. A farmer should not suffer a Swampbuster penalty if land he restores to a wetland later reverts to its prerestoration status. However, such a provision should be implemented in a fashion consistent with the wetland protection goals of Swampbuster.
