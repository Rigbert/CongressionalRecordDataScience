President, I have been here on the floor several times during the past few days over the New Year's weekend, as have the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic leader, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], and others who have been working the effort of trying to get this budget back together.  It is ironic that we are here and we hear statements coming from some, primarily in the other body from back in their home States and home districts, that show to me at least the disconnect with reality. I hope some of these Members when they return to Washington will have a fresh perspective on the human toll this foolish Government shutdown has taken. This foolish Government shutdown has taken a human toll. In fact, it is ironic that the House and Senate cannot seem to come together and get the work done necessary to get us out of this, but we are getting paid at the same time there are hundreds of thousands of Federal employees who want to work and they are not being paid.
