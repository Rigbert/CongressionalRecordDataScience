President, our Nation's antitrust laws exist to protect consumers. These laws promote competition, which ensures that consumers will pay lower prices, and receive more choices of higher quality products. The vast majority of the companies doing business in the U.S. are subject to the Federal antitrust laws.  A few industries have used their influence to obtain a special, statutory exemption from the antitrust laws, and the insurance industry is one of them. In the markets for health insurance and medical malpractice insurance, patients and doctors are paying the price, as costs continue to increase at an alarming rate. As the insurance industry prospers behind its exemption, patients and small businesses suffer. I am pleased to introduce today the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2009, which will repeal the antitrust exemption for health insurance and medical malpractice insurance providers.  The health care industry is the subject of a great deal of debate. There are many proposals to bring competition to health insurance providers. While we are debating these solutions, we should not lose sight of the fact that the health insurance industry currently does not have to play by the same, good-competition rules as other industries. That is wrong, and this legislation corrects it.  The lack of affordable health insurance plagues families throughout our country, and the rising prices that hospitals and doctors pay for medical malpractice insurance drains resources that could otherwise be used to improve patient care. Antitrust oversight in these industries will provide consumers with the confidence that insurance companies are operating in a competitive marketplace.  There is simply no justification for health insurance and medical malpractice insurance companies to be exempt from Federal laws prohibiting price fixing. Subjecting health and medical malpractice insurance providers to the antitrust laws will enable customers to feel confident that the price they are being quoted is the product of a fair marketplace. This bill will prohibit the most egregious anticompetitive conduct--price fixing, bid rigging and market allocations--conduct that harms consumers and drives up health care costs.  In the 110th Congress, I introduced a much broader repeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act with Senator Lott. While Congress did not reach consensus on that legislation, surely in this environment of rising health care costs, we can agree on this more narrowly tailored repeal. Insurers should not object to being subject to the same antitrust laws as everyone else. If they are operating in an appropriate way, they should have nothing to fear. American families, doctors and hospitals rely on insurance. It is important to ensure that the prices they pay for this insurance are established in a fair and competitive way.  I look forward to repealing the antitrust exemption in the health insurance and medical malpractice insurance industries.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1681       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Insurance Industry      Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.       It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that health      insurance issuers and medical malpractice insurance issuers      cannot engage in price fixing, bid rigging, or market      allocations to the detriment of competition and consumers.     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing in the      Act of March 9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1011 et seq., commonly known      as the ``McCarran-Ferguson Act'') shall be construed to      permit health insurance issuers (as defined in section 2791      of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-91) or      issuers of medical malpractice insurance to engage in any      form of price fixing, bid rigging, or market allocations in      connection with the conduct of the business of providing      health insurance coverage (as defined in such section) or      coverage for medical malpractice claims or actions.     SEC. 4. APPLICATION TO ACTIVITIES OF STATE COMMISSIONS OF                    INSURANCE AND OTHER STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY                    BODIES.       Nothing in this Act shall apply to the information      gathering and rate setting activities of any State commission      of insurance, or any other State regulatory entity with      authority to set insurance rates.                                 ______                                       By
