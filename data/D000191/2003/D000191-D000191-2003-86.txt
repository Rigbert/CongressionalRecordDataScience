Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello) for yielding me this time.  I would like to congratulate the chairman and the ranking member for their excellent work. This is a piece of legislation that is overdue, and we can only hope that the Senate will not be the usual dead weight on this issue and will actually move this needed bill through.  This bill would go a long way toward helping many communities across the United States meet Federal mandates. There is a lot of talk around here in Washington, D.C. about unfunded mandates. The law is replete with unfunded mandates.                      Announcement by the Chairman
