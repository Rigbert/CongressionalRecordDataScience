President, I mentioned yesterday on the Senate floor I spent a great deal of time in deep southern Illinois where some devastating and fatal tornadoes hit last week. As I said then and will repeat briefly now, the amazing outpouring of voluntarism and support from people far and wide was inspiring to me. It is great to know that, just as I had hoped, the people in my State rallied to help the victims.
