 President, I rise in support of amendment No. 1977, offered by my colleague, Senator McCain.  This amendment would bring much-needed clarity to the rules governing how Americans treat captured prisoners and detainees.  It will make clear that the Geneva Conventions apply to all people held in the custody of the Department of Defense.  It provides a workable definition of ``cruel and inhumane,'' based on the rules which govern how we treat criminals in the United States, and based firmly in the constitutional prohibitions of cruel and unusual punishment.  Most importantly, it sets rules that are clear, simple and in accord with basic American values.  First, let me make clear my view that in this modern world of asymmetric warfare, non-state actors, and unconventional threat, there is an absolute necessity to have a program to securely hold prisoners and effectively interrogate them to provide timely intelligence.  But in my judgment, the current system is not working.  Over the course of the past 4 years, there has been a great deal of confusion over the policies and practices of the United States towards individuals the Government has taken into custody.  This confusion has been evident at the highest levels of decisionmaking at the Pentagon, with memoranda authorizing this technique or that technique being issued and rescinded within weeks of one another.
