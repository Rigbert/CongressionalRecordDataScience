President, I do not want to turn this into a bouquet-tossing process, but I also want to commend our friend from Wyoming. I think he is going to do an excellent job in his new position. At the end of last year, we got a little bit more flexibility in terms of the interpretation of Leave No Child Behind Act because of the efforts with respect to hiring of rural teachers, and I thank him for his work on that, and certainly the bipartisan firm of Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Enzi, and Alexander is a force to contend with, and I am looking forward very much to working with them.
