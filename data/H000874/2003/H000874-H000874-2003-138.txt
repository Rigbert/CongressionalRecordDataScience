Speaker, last question, and I know it would disappoint my colleague if I did not pursue this issue, but Senator Grassley in the other body was quoted as saying he expects the Democrats to keep the heat on on this issue, so we do not want to disappoint him either.  I say that facetiously, but we really do care about the child tax credit. It appears that the conference is meeting. It appears that there is significant disagreement between the House and the Senate, but there appears that there is, in this limited area, that is, extending the child tax credit to those families who are making between $10- and $26,000, of which there are some 6\1/2\ million families, 12 million children affected by this and 200,000 military families, there appears to be agreement on this issue.  One of the disagreements is apparently that there are some of us who are willing to make it permanent, but want to at least see it active this year, but one of the problems apparently that the gentleman expressed last week was if we cannot make it permanent, we apparently cannot do it. I would hope, because I think we could do it very quickly on this floor and would not take much time of the body, that the gentleman would bring to the floor the Senate bill, which has the child tax credit, and that we might pass that or, alternatively, simply do a limited bill, send it to the Senate, and they could take it off the desk and pass it, but in either event, it would facilitate getting to those 6\1/2\ million families the same kind of assistance that we have already given to others who have received a refund of the child tax credit. I know the gentleman anticipated that question. I know he has an answer.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I have enjoyed my time in this institution working with the gentleman on institution matters, and I know the gentleman has strongly-held beliefs of protecting the prerogatives of this institution and the will of the House, and I just say to the gentleman under this issue, his words ``extending the child tax credit'' are critical. This House has spoken on that issue. This House has considered the Senate bill he mentions. This House has rejected that Senate bill as flawed, and this House has expressed itself because it wants to extend the child tax credit beyond the next election, and we expressed it in passing with a very good vote a bill and sent it to the other body.  I just would recommend that the gentleman direct his comments and his strategy toward the other body. All they have to do is pick up the House bill and the gentleman will get everything that he has asked for.
