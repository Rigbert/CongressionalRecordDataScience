Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3049, a bill providing for the continuity of the Board of Trustees of the Institute for American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development. Since 1988, I have been appointed by the Speaker's office to fulfill the Board of Trustee position for the two congressional seats of the U.S. House of Representatives and I thank the Speaker for this honor.  As you know, the Institute is a federally created institution for higher education, authorized under title 15 of the Higher Education Amendments of 1986. Its primary function is to provide instruction in Indian arts and culture and establish a program which completes with the award of degrees in the contemporary and traditional fields of Indian art and culture.  Unfortunately, the appointment/reappointment process of fulfilling the Board of Trusteesvacancies has proven to be extremely cumbersome and the appointments of voting members to the board has not been made in a timely manner. H.R. 3049 would prevent the situation where board members have felt obligated to serve additional terms in order to maintain a quorum for the purpose of conducting business. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this purely technical corrections bill and thank the Speaker for the opportunity to voice my concerns.
