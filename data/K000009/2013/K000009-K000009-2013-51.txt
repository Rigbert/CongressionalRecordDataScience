 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is stronger when we come together as we, the people, to solve the serious challenges facing our country, yet we find ourselves on the precipice of a GOP-driven government shutdown.  The standoff between the Tea Party and other Republicans is now leading to a GOP shutdown of our entire Federal Government. Extreme partisanship threatens our economic recovery and job creation across our country. Thousands of workers at Ohio's largest employer, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, are about to be furloughed. Most NASA employees, including the NASA Glenn Research Center at Brook Park, near Cleveland, will be sent home.  Here in Washington, World War II veterans on their way here with Honor Flights across this country to visit the World War II Memorial on The Mall will find the Visitor Center closed.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue to govern by staggering from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. The madness must stop. America needs leadership, not extreme partisanship. We need statesmanship, not brinksmanship. America has work to do putting our people back to work, educating the next generation, curbing crime, and improving health care.  So the Republicans want to shut down the government? This will deeply hurt our country. It will hurt Ohio. There's no reason for it beyond shameful, partisan politics. It's time for the Republicans in Congress to come to their senses.  Vote against the GOP shutdown.
