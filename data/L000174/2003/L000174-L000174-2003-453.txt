In closing, I would just add that there have been recent reports of a possible ``deal'' with Mr. Taylor under which he would go into exile in exchange for immunity from the Court. While I want to see an end to the fighting in West Africa, which has claimed many innocent lives, an immunity deal with Mr. Taylor would be a grave mistake. It will undermine peace and reconciliation efforts in the region. It will let a major war criminal escape justice. It would be unacceptable.                          ____________________
