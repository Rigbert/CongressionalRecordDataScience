Ron Dellums of California paid tribute to him at a memorial service here in Washington. Several of us who served with him in this House delivered eulogies praising Rep. Dellums for his decency, his strength of character, his leadership, his dedication to the men and women who serve in our military, and the respect he earned from his fellow legislators on both sides of the aisle.  I want to take this opportunity to include in the Record the remarks I offered along with the kind words spoken by Rep. Barbara Lee, Chairwoman Maxine Waters, and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton. Majority Whip James Clyburn also spoke, although unfortunately there is no transcript of his remarks. I can attest, however, to his moving words.  Below I share with the rest of our colleagues my remarks in praise of our friend, the late Rep. Dellums, joined by the statements of others made in tribute to him:       Mr. Hoyer: Rev. Lamar and Father Conroy, thank you for your      words of peace and reflection. Cynthia, Erik, Piper, Brandon,      and Pam, thank you for allowing us to join you in mourning      Ron and participating in this service today. To his      grandchildren and great-grandchildren, let me say ``thank      you'' for the love you gave him, because we all saw the joy      it brought him.       I had the great honor to serve in congress with Ron Dellums      for seventeen years. He was a friend, a teacher, an example,      a hero. He was always a gentleman. He was kind, gracious,      strong, and historic. Respected and admired by his colleagues      on both sides of the aisle.       As Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Ron Dellums      was a man who knew the purpose of arms. He understood that      instruments of war could be guarantors of peace. And he knew      that the greatest force was that of the moral being, the      spirit of good will and powerful words used to speak truth.       When he saw the injustice of apartheid in South Africa, Ron      fought with every fiber to arm Congress with truth and make      our country an instrument of moral clarity.       When he and other African-American Members saw an      opportunity to raise issues that were being ignored in      Washington and lift up voices that weren't being heard, Ron      helped create the Congressional Black Caucus that now serves      as the conscience of the Congress.       As city councilman, he drew on his own family's experiences      to see the clarity of his cause championing workers and their      families, the downtrodden, the forgotten, and the      dispossessed.       The people of Oakland elected Ron eleven times to congress      and then made him their mayor--because they saw in him the      kind of moral leader unafraid to stand up for principles and      determined to do right by those who entrusted him with high      office. They knew he would always speak up for them and speak      out for the causes he knew to be just.       Ron Dellums understood that the power of words speaking      truth--on the Floor of the House or in Committee or in the      City Council chamber or from the mayor's desk--could be      mightier than any armament. He was a man who chose his words      carefully and wielded them forcefully.       President John F. Kennedy said of Winston Churchill that he      ``marshalled the English language and sent it into battle.''      So too did Ron. And we will remember him always for speaking      truth, speaking justice, speaking goodness, and speaking for      those who needed a voice.       He was regal in bearing. He was real in his relationships--     warm and empathetic to all.       He was courageous in battle. Principled in his policies.      Moral in vision. Worthy of leading. Courteous in demeanor.      Clear in his goals. Loyal to his country, colleagues, and      conscience. Deserving of our love and respect. A Teddy-     Roosevelt ``doer of great deeds.'' And, most assuredly, a man      to be admired, emulated, followed, and--as we do today,      remembered.       Ron was our friend and our exemplar. We were honored and      blessed to be a part of his life.       Ron: you were always faithful, Marine. You were ``Semper      Fi.''       Ms. Lee of California: To our officiant, Rev. William H.      Lamar IV, Father Conroy, Reverend Skinner, and to all members      of the clergy.       First, let me offer my deepest condolences to Cynthia,      Brandy, Rachel, and Ron's entire family and extended family      and Ron's staff who have and continue to experience a deep      sense of grief, yet hope that through the celebration of      Ron's life, we all can join together and keep his legacy      alive through our work and love for each other.       I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge my      colleagues; members here; Majority Leader Steny Hoyer,      Majority Whip James Clyburn, Congresswoman Maxine Waters,      Congressman Hank Johnson, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes      Norton, Congressman Gregory Meeks, and Congresswoman Shelia      Jackson Lee. Members, please stand.       Our former congressional colleagues.       And Ron's friends and constituents, and all program      participants.       I thank you for being here today as we celebrate the life      of a man who was a statesman, a gentleman, and an authentic      representative of the people. Also, Ron was my mentor and my      friend.       I looked up to him, like we all did, as a warrior, and a      fighter.       Ron never gave up his principles and integrity, even though      he was brilliant, a deep thinker, a philosopher, and a man      who--as he would say--had a memory like an elephant. He was a      psychiatric social worker who understood human behavior in      its totality and a proud former marine who demonstrated that      peace is patriotic.       He was a comedian too.       He was so funny--some of you may remember his Richard Pryor      skit--Sandre, and I were with Ron when he played the role of      Richard Pryor at Lou Gossett's house.       What an evening--Ron became Richard Pryor, and Richard      Pryor became Ron.       Ron never let the weight of the world destroy his sense of      humor and fun-loving side with his friends and family.       I first met Ron as a college student in the early 1970s. I      was going to school, raising my two little boys while on      public assistance and developing my political consciousness.       I wanted to be an Intern in Ron's Washington office once I      was in graduate school at UC Berkeley. I went to Ron's      District Director, our beloved, the late Don Hopkins who Ron      relied on and loved deeply, with this request.       Don placed me in Ron's DC Office during the Watergate      hearings in the summer of 1974. I learned a lot that summer,      saw how Ron, as a progressive African American man from      Berkeley and Oakland, navigated his work as a legislator.      Even though--as he always reminded us--they painted him as a      commie pinko from Berkeley and he was on Spiro Agnew's hate      list--Ron wore this as a badge of honor. He knew he came to      Congress as an Anti-war, peace candidate, who knew the      priorities of our country were wrong and destroying people's      lives here at home & abroad.       In 1975, I came to Washington, D.C. to work on Ron's staff.      In those days, it was rare for a woman--let alone a black      woman--to run a congressional office. But Ron was proud to      call himself a ``feminist'' and lived his life by the same      progressive values he espoused on the House floor.       As an ardent anti-war activist, he also sought a seat on      the Armed Services Committee to advocate for alternatives to      military intervention.       Years later, Ron went on to make history as the first      African American to chair the Armed Services Committee--and      he used that position to advocate for more just and humane      military policies. I travelled with Ron, along with his staff      throughout the world. Heads of State wanted his advice and      knew he was a global leader.       I remember him telling his staff ``Let your conscience be      your guide. If you are right--just to stand on that street      corner alone because sooner or later everyone must walk right      to you.'' I'd like to ask Ron's staff--Congressional and      Mayoral--to stand. Ron loved his staff. They are all true      public servants who gave their all to our community, the      country, and the world.       Ron demonstrated this repeatedly--he introduced the South      African sanctions legislation 13 times.       It was the first override of a presidential policy veto in      the 20th century and finally put the United States on the      right side of history.       I will always remember Ron calling me after I was elected      to Congress to come to his beautiful home for dinner. Yes--he      also was a great cook.       Well, we sat at his kitchen table and asked me to think      about introducing an AIDS martial plan for Africa given the      devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa. His idea led to my      legislation establishing the global fund and PEPFAR which has      saved millions of lives. He worked so hard to help me get      these bills passed and the world owes him a debt of      gratitude.       Ron was my boss, mentor, and yet, like the brother I never      had. He gave me personal advice and support as a single Mom      raising two boys.       When my son Craig graduated from Brent Elementary School,      in the sixth grade here in Washington, DC., he asked Ron to      be the graduation speaker. Ron left Capitol Hill, spoke at      the graduation, took pictures and spent time with the kids      afterward. Mind you, they were young children. They didn't      have any political clout and couldn't vote.       Ron did this out of the goodness of his heart because he      loved children and cared about their future.       My sons Craig and Tony were childhood friends with Ron's      kids Brandy, Eric, & Piper, and to this day they remain close      friends.       Also, as a single woman in Washington, DC, Ron counseled me      on who--and who not to date.       He saved me from a lot of trouble and heartbreaks.       We can't forget that Ron was nominated for President in the      mid-70's, in Cincinnati, Ohio, but he declined the nomination      for the Office of the President at the National Black      Political Convention. Then there was an effort to draft him      to run for president, in New York,--I believe--in 1980.       Of course, he was conflicted--so was the staff. We just      knew he could win--but Ron decided he wanted to continue      serving his constituents because he wanted to help them      achieve their dreams and aspirations.       And, as the father of Coalition politics, which began in      the East Bay, his leadership was needed to continue to build      coalitions for peace and justice around the country.       When Ron called me and told me of his illness, I was      devastated. In his generous manner, he said he didn't want to      worry me and was gentle and cautious in the way he told me--     preparing me for that sad day. But he gave me time to be with      him each week during his last month. Thank you, Cynthia.       I spent my birthday last year--the evening of July 16 after      a legislative session--with Ron and his family. He was in      rare form, telling stories, being the comedian that he was,      toasting our friendship and singing Happy Birthday to me. He      was frail, in pain, but demonstrated a sense of hope and      courage--even as he knew he would meet his maker soon.       After my next visit, which would be the last, he talked      about family and friends--told me some of his secrets, and I      told him some of mine--encouraged me to keep fighting the      good fight and imparted more pearls of wisdom.       As I was about to leave, I was reluctant to hug him,      knowing he was in pain. He reared up in the bed and called me      to him in his playful way and gave me a big hug with tears in      his eyes.       As a brilliant, powerful, elected official, a fighter, and      a physical fitness champion, Ron was also kind, gentle, and a      humanitarian who lived his life with dignity and respect.       He left this earth demonstrating that same sense of dignity      and courage.       He did it his way.       Ron passed me a blue baton when we announced in 1998 that I      would run for his seat upon his retirement.       The baton, which I look at often, reminds me that all of us      must carry that baton that Ron gave us and run our mile in      this marathon for justice, for peace, and unity. So, when we      can pass our batons to the next generation, we know, as Ron      said frequently--we have secured their future. In honor of      the great legacy Ron has left, I'll be introducing the Ronald      V. Dellums Memorial Fellowship For Women Of Color In Science,      Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math, and National Security      Act. And we will get it passed.       Finally, let me say during moments like this, as a person,      of faith, I go to the scriptures often for inspiration and      hope.       2nd Timothy Chapter 4, verse 7 says: ``I have fought the      good fight, I have finished the race, and I have kept the      faith.''       Ron, rest in peace, rest in power, know that we got your      back.       Ms. Waters: By all standards, our brother, Ron Dellums, was      a truly exceptional human being who consistently gave of      himself to his loved ones, his community, his nation, and the      entire world.       Reverend King wrote ``The ultimate measure of a man is not      where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but      where he stands in times of challenge and controversy. In      dangerous valleys and hazardous pathways, he will lift some      bruised and beaten brother to a higher and more noble life.''       In both his public and personal capacities, Ron embodied      this standard of character, purpose, selflessness, and      service.       As an elected official, Ron was a bold pioneer, a true      leader, and a stalwart advocate for peace in the U.S. and      globally. Fueled by his extraordinary acumen and legendary      eloquence, he built a stellar track record of standing up for      principle, righting the wrongs of inequality, and empowering      the powerless.       Ron initiated his career in Congress as a crusader for      peace, taking on the establishment by opposing the Vietnam      War. He pressured Nixon to end the U.S. involvement, and      exposed war crimes in Vietnam, earning him a place on Nixon's      enemies list, of which he was proud to be a member.       Ron was a pioneer in the campaign to end apartheid in South      Africa, proposing sanctions as far back as 1972. He was      fiercely dedicated to opening hearts and minds in Congress to      the plight of the oppressed South African majority. Together      we fought apartheid, with my bill divesting California's      pension fund investments, and Ron's bill divesting U.S.      companies' assets and applying sanctions against the      repressive regime, becoming law just days apart, in Ron's      case by overriding the president's veto.       Ron called out racial discrimination in the military and      advanced diversity and inclusion through innovations that      opened doors of opportunity to people who had been excluded.      He championed the minority set-aside program for Defense      Department contracts, enabling businesses owned by African      Americans, Latinos, and other minorities to compete for a      share of the DoD's large procurement budget.       Ron consistently advocated for peace, opposing expensive,      excessive weapons such as the B-2 stealth bomber, and the MX      and Pershing II missiles. He called for funds for those      weapons to be shifted to cities, communities, education, and      housing. He opposed military intervention in Grenada, Zaire,      Burundi, Sudan, Angola, Liberia, and elsewhere, and was an      outspoken critic of the Persian Gulf War.       Ron's illustrious leadership was on display as chairman of      the Armed Services Committee. He maintained his commitment to      peaceful policy positions while allowing the committee to      work its will on the DoD's authorization and policies that he      opposed. Ron often voted against his committee's legislation.       Ron's principled passion was epitomized by his speech from      the well of the House supporting the Civil Rights Act of      1990. In that August 2, 1990 speech, which is still      emblazoned on the minds of many, Ron implored his colleagues      to support the bill, declaring ``this is throw-down time.      This is the bottom line. This is integrity. There is no      substitute to freedom and human dignity . . . there is no      substitute for justice.''       Ron's nature was just as resplendent outside the public      arena. To his friends and all who sought his counsel, he was      a trusted confidant, a source of strength, a bastion of      wisdom, and a compatriot in our shared goals and dreams. His      personal warmth, thoughtfulness, and empathy were as much a      part of his essence as passion for peace. When facing      conflict, he remained dignified. When confronting challenges,      he remained optimistic. When engaging opponents, he remained      congenial. Even his adversaries in Congress appreciated him      for being fair, responsive, thoughtful, and honorable.       I am grateful that I had the chance to thank Ron for what      he accomplished, represented, and taught us. Shortly after he      left Congress, we celebrated him at the Black Women's Forum      in LA, not just because of what he did for his district and      for the people of mine, but for all 435 districts. We      enveloped him in so much appreciation and praise that day--     every bit well-earned and well-deserved--that the eloquent      orator was rendered speechless, albeit only briefly.       To me, Ron was far more than a colleague, compatriot,      teammate, confidante, counselor, and political soul mate,      although he was all that. To me, Ron was a true friend, a      dear and trusted friend, a brother, and I loved him very      much.       Ron Dellums will always be remembered as the true article;      a man of conscience, dignity, and grace; a leader with the      rare blend of sincere humility and sublime intellect; the      peoples' patriot who waged peace at every opportunity; and a      man who is admired and loved by more people, in more comers      of the country and the world, than he could have imagined.       Ms. Norton: We celebrate our colleague and friend Ronald      Dellums at a time of historic polarization in Congress. It is      a good time to remember the peace advocate who chaired the      Armed Services Committee with such equanimity that he won the      respect, even the friendship, of those who opposed every      cause, of the many into which Ron poured his considerable      talent.       I first came to admire Ron even before being elected to      Congress from my work in the Free South Africa anti-apartheid      movement. For 14 years, Ron did not relent until he freed his      landmark bill for South Africa divestment, overcoming a      presidential veto.       By the time I was elected to Congress, Ron had already been      chair of the District of Columbia Committee for more than a      decade. That committee is long gone, and nothing would have      pleased Chairman Dellums more than its demise. But when      freedom-loving Ron Dellums first came to Congress, he knew      that if there had to be such a Committee, he wanted a seat on      it. Just as Ron sought peace by serving on the Armed Service      Committee, he sought to free D.C. from Congressional control      by serving on the D.C. Committee.       He joined the Committee during his very first term in      Congress. Upon becoming chair of the D.C. Committee, Ron      framed his service as ``an advocate, not an overseer of      District affairs.'' No sooner had Ron gotten to Congress in      1975, in his very 1st term, long before I even thought about      becoming a Member, he introduced the 1st D.C. statehood bill.       Ron would relish our progress today as we close in on      enough votes for the D.C. statehood bill to pass in the House      this term. We expect a vote soon in the Oversight and      Government Reform Committee to send the bill to the House      Floor. When that committee vote occurs, we will not be able      to claim we are breaking new or historic ground. In 1987,      more than 30 years ago Chairman Ron Dellums proclaimed      ``There should be no colonies in a democracy'' and led the      District Committee in a vote for statehood for the District      of Columbia that passed in his Committee.       The American citizens who live in the nation's capital will      forever remember Ron Dellums, prescient warrior for equality      and freedom--and well ahead of his time--a leader for      statehood for the District of Columbia.                          ____________________
