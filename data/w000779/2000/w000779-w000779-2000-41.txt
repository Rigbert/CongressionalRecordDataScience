I would also express my willingness to continue to work with him to assure the effective implementation of this legislation, particularly of titles II and III.  This is just one of countless issues that we have grappled with as we have strived to make this bill as fair and responsive as possible to the needs of our rural counties. We have made giant strides in improving this legislation, and I thank all the Members who have been willing to put aside their differences and work in a bipartisan effort to make this possible.
