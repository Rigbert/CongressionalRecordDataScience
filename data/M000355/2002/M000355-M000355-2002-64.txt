 ``Tim'' Jones as he assumes command of the 9th Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, 101st Airborne/Air Assault Division, at Fort Campbell, KY. This well deserved honor is the latest achievement in a long and distinguished Army career that started with Tim's graduation in 1984 from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY. After being commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, 2LT, in the brand new branch of Aviation, Tim returned to his home state of Alabama to complete rotary wing flight training at Fort Rucker. He then served in numerous positions including Company Commander with the 7th Infantry Division, Light, at Fort Ord, CA. His service at Ft. Ord was highlighted by his heroic actions in Panama during Operation Just Cause. He then served with the elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, also based at Ft. Campbell, KY. Only the ``best of the best'' in Army Aviation are invited to serve with the 160th, the ``Nightstalkers.'' Most recently, Tim completed an overseas assignment in Korea, and now returns to the United States to provide the leadership and experience desperately needed by combat units such as the 9th Battalion. Please join me in congratulating the Army's newest battalion commander, LTC Tim Jones, as well as his family, including wife Theresa, daughter Megan, and sons John and Daniel on this latest achievement in a long and distinguished career in Army Aviation.                          ____________________
