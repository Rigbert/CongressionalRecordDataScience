 President, with respect to amendment No. 2511, Senator Coburn and I have come to an agreement. Therefore, there is no need for me to offer a second degree.  I ask unanimous consent that the Coburn amendment No. 2511 be modified with the changes at the desk, and that the amendment, as modified, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
