 Mr. McCAIN. My understanding from talking to the floor staff, I say to the Senator from Oregon--and the distinguished chairman can probably helpout on this--is we have a number of amendments in order which are going to be voted on, I think by an agreement between the two leaders, which is the general procedure around here.  Nothing is more outrageous, as the Senator from Oregon pointed out, than these things that are stuffed into conference reports. But this isn't a conference report. This is an initial bite at an appropriations bill. I hope that perhaps we could work out something so we can continue with the amendment process and set a time for votes on all amendments, with the amendment of the Senator from Oregon in order following the others, as is the normal procedure. Maybe the Senator from Oregon could ask for that again, we could move forward. We all know that everybody's time is limited.  I thank the Senator for responding to my question.
