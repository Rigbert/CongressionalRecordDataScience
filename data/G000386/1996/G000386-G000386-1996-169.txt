 President, I want to take a few minutes to announce a temporary tax victory for small business taxpayers. The IRS has made a failed attempt to implement new rules for payroll tax deposits. These rules would require many employers to make their biweekly payroll tax deposits electronically.  On July 12, I authored a letter to Treasury Secretary Rubin and IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson. This letter discussed problems that employers and banks are having in understanding new payroll tax deposit rules and methods.  First, my letter asks Secretary Rubin to address specific questions posed by employers and their banks. Employers and their banks have a growing series of questions about the new procedures. Many of these center around the degree of access that IRS has to bank customers' accounts. Second, the letter reminds the Secretary that he has authority under the law to provide some regulatory relief for small businesses.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1996.     Secretary Robert E. Rubin,     Department of the Treasury,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Rubin: This letter is to express our great      concern of the impact upon small businesses and their banks      of new Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) rules. We hope that you      will act in accordance with Congressional intent to ensure      that the regulations do not create hardships for small      businesses. We also wish that you will answer specific      questions posed by our constituents working in the banking      industry.                        Small Business Concerns       Because the current EFT rules create new and significant      burdens for small businesses, and because the tax code      specifically allows for exceptions from the EFT rules for      small businesses, we request that you take immediate action      to clarify the necessary exceptions well in advance of the      January 1, 1997 effective date.       Small employers presently utilize the Federal tax deposit      (FTD) coupon system and their local bank to make periodic      payroll tax deposits with the Federal government. Internal      Revenue Code Section 6302(h) seeks to reduce paperwork by      replacing the FTD coupon system with an electronic fund      transfer system. However, Congress intended, as set out in      section 6302(h) and its legislative history, that the      regulations prescribe exemptions and alternatives to the      EFT rules for small businesses. To date, these exemptions      and alternatives have not been promulgated.       As a result, employers and their banks are confused. The      current regulations seem to require EFT compliance by all      employers that had made employment tax deposits exceeding      $50,000 in 1995. In anticipation of the approaching effective      date, the Internal Revenue Service has begun the process of      educating employers of their new EFT compliance requirements.      Nonetheless, small and rural employers know that the Congress      intended that they be exempt, and they are eager to see the      intended exemptions.       In part, the legislative history of the new law prescribes      the following.       ``The Committee [on Finance] intends that the regulations      do not create hardships for small businesses.''       ``The provision grants the Secretary considerable      flexibility in drafting the regulations and, the Committee      [on Finance] urges the Secretary to take into account the      needs of small employers, including possible exemptions for      the very smallest of businesses from the new electronic      transfer system.''       Small businesses will suffer unintended hardships if your      agency is unable to clarify the exemptions in advance of the      effective date. It seems that many small businesses will need      their banks to affect these new EFT transactions. Because      their banks may view this as a new and different service,      those banks may find it necessary to require small businesses      to pay added fees. Also, because EFT transactions can involve      a new variety of either debit or credit transactions, some      small business persons are adverse to allowing the IRS the      ability to deduct funds from their business accounts      without what some may deem as an adequate ``paper trail''.      Employers that do not need to comply should be spared the      anxiety of the rule change.       Again, since the tax code anticipates exemptions for small      and rural businesses, we request that you act promptly to      define those exemptions in order to spare these employers the      expense and anxiety of attempting to comply. Because employer      penalties are involved, and the compliance date is      approaching, we think that this requires your immediate      attention.                             Bank Concerns       Small businesses are not the only ones concerned about the      pending EFT rules. Although Iowa banks support efforts to      modernize our banking system and increase the use of EFT,      they have commented on potential problems arising from      implementation of these regulations. Since small businesses      are not governed by Internal Revenue Service Regulation E      (except sole proprietorships), banks question whether proper      notice and disclosure requirements will be in place. The      following are a list of unanswered questions raised by banks.       (1) What degree of access to bank customers' accounts is      provided to the Internal Revenue Service? Do the regulations      give the Internal Revenue Service open access to a bank      customer's account? What protections are in place to guard      against unfettered access and use of information in the      customer's account?       (2) A business may authorize a specific transfer to be made      for the purpose of paying depository taxes. However, if      penalties are assessed by the Internal Revenue Service, would      the bank then have the authority or requirement to withdraw      additional monies without the customer's approval from the      customer's bank account to pay these penalties?       (3) Who is responsible for notifying businesses of      transactions involving the bank account?       Iowa banks maintain that these are only several of many      unanswered questions about the practical applications of the      new regulations. Small businesses, banks, and the Internal      Revenue Service all have an interest in assuring the proper      and appropriate implementation of the regulations. Properly      promulgating efficient and effective regulations that do not      devastate either small businesses or banks requires      cooperation amongst all of the parties concerned. Two of the      three interested parties, small businesses and banks, have      expressed important and pressing concerns. We believe that      these questions and concerns should be addressed before      implementing regulations that pose unnecessary or burdensome      requirements on small business taxpayers or their banks.       Thank you in advance for your prompt and considerate      attention to these matters. Because taxpayers in our state      are eager to clarify these new rules, and because of the      coming effective date of January 1, 1997, we would appreciate      your efforts to make your response to us before August 23,      1996.           Sincerely,     Charles E. Grassley,                                            United States Senator.     Greg Ganske,                                               Member of Congress.
