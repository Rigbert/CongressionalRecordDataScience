I worked with him and I will continue. I would like to ask him this question.  Am I correct that yesterday the item of business before us was to exempt individuals who had been held liable for creating medical injuries from their full accountability and liability in medical malpractice, including pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies? That was the item on the agenda yesterday. Now, today, we are taking up the exemption from liability for gun manufacturers and dealers. Does the Senator from Rhode Island detect a pattern here, that each day of the week we are going to try to single out another special interest group and give them an exemption from accountability and liability in courts in America?  I think he is accurate in his description of what we have been doing in the last couple of days, which is trying to not provide for the public interest but to protect special interests, and not to provide individual citizens a right, regretfully, when they have been harmed, at least a right to make a determination of who should be held liable, but simply and categorically strip away these rights and to protect industries that have powerful influence in Washington.
