Mrs. Bachmann, thank you so much for your not only eloquent, but your passion for innocent life, and especially for the women who are so seriously injured by each and every abortion. Very often it doesn't manifest itself immediately. There's a post-traumatic stress element to this. And you certainly get it. And I think your passion and your voice is indispensable in this Congress. So I thank you for your leadership on behalf of all human life.  I yield to my good friend, Mr. Lamborn.
