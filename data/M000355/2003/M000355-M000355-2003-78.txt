 HATCH. That is exactly right. They treated Miguel Estrada differently from John Roberts.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me ask my friend from Utah, is there any conceivable basis for such disparate treatment for the same two people, nominated for the very same court on the very same day, going through the very same Judiciary Committee? Can the Senator from Utah think of any rational reason for this kind of disparate treatment?
