I am a strong supporter, as many of you know, of what we call our Make It In America agenda. Make It In America simply means we are going to provide jobs, we are going to provide opportunities, and we are going to build the manufacturing sector of our economy. In order to do that we also need to enhance the inventive, innovative, and development phases of our economy. This bill, I think, will facilitate this.  I congratulate the gentlelady from California for this amendment as well, which I think improves this bill. I rise in strong support and urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. I congratulate all of those who have worked on this legislation. It is obviously not perfect, but then again, no piece of legislation that we adopt is perfect. It is, however, a significant step forward to make sure that America remains the inventive, innovative development capital of the world. In order to do that we need to manufacture goods here in America--manufacture the goods that we invent, innovate, and develop here, because if we continue to take them to scale overseas, then the inventors, innovators, and developers will themselves move overseas.  So I thank Mr. Smith, Mr. Watt, Ms. Lofgren, and the others who have worked so hard on this legislation, who have dedicated themselves to trying to make sure that we have a context and environment in America which will facilitate the innovative sector of our economy.                          ____________________
