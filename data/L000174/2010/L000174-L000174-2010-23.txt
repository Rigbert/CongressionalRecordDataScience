President, today the Senate will finally consider two judicial nominations that have been stalled for months on the Executive Calendar after being reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.  The first nomination is Albert Diaz of North Carolina, who was nominated in November 2009 to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Fourth Circuit. His Republican home State senator, Senator Burr, asked nearly a year ago that the Judiciary Committee ``look for an expedited review and referral to the full Senate so that that deficiency on the fourth circuit can be filled.'' We did and the Judiciary Committee reported his nomination after unanimous rollcall vote--19 to 0--on January 28, nearly 11 months ago. There has been no explanation for the lengthy delays preventing final consideration of his nomination.  Judge Albert Diaz is a respected and experienced North Carolina jurist who served in the Armed Forces.  He has the support of both his home State Senators, Senator Hagan and Senator Burr. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated him unanimously ``well qualified'', and the North Carolina Bar Association has urged us to confirm him. When he is confirmed today, Judge Diaz will be the first Latino to sit on the Fourth Circuit. I congratulate Judge Diaz and his family on his confirmation.  In addition to Judge Diaz, there are six more superbly qualified consensus circuit court nominees ready for consideration by the Senate, four of them for judicial emergency vacancies. Five of these were reported unanimously, and another was reported with the support of 17 of the 19 Senators on the Judiciary Committee. I predict all six would be confirmed with strong bipartisan support, and I hope all six can get up-or-down votes before the Senate adjourns.  I yield the floor.
