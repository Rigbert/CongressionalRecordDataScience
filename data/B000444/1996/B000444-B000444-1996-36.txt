 President, in response to my friend's question, and in response to his counsel, I will seek no more time. I, frankly, was going to attempt a filibuster on this bill but I think--I am not being facetious when I say this--the wisdom of the chairman is correct. I probably would end up no better off, even if I succeed, in terms of what would come out of a continuing resolution.  But I will tell the chairman, although I am not going to pursue any strategy other than voting ``no'' on this legislation and on a continuing resolution, I am hoping to convince some of our colleagues, notwithstanding the fact we will have passed this legislation today, and I expect it will pass, that we get a supplemental to, in fact, give us an opportunity to work out things we are working out with the Senator from Oregon. But I do not seek recognition beyond voting ``yes'' or ``no'' when the time comes.
