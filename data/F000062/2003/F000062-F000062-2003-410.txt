 The judge can presume it. We both know the history and the history is 100 percent if you include the appeal of FISA judges in granting warrants. So there will not be a problem there.  I am concerned about the overreach. I am concerned about the misuse. And the only way we could figure to counter that was to keep the agent a foreign power, provide this presumption that a judge could use in that one case.  Senator, neither you nor Senator Feingold nor I would ever know if there was an overreach. That is what makes this far more dangerous, the fact that it is so secret.
