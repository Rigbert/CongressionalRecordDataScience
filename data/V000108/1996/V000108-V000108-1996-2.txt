Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I regret that I was not present 19 years ago when the Tom Bevill-John Myers story began; the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Bevill] at that time being chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Myers] being the ranking minority member. I am very pleased that I was present, however, as a member of the subcommittee on the very last markup held by the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Myers], and the ranking minority member, the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Bevill]. These two gentleman are gentleman in the truest sense of the word, and with the national public debate that has been overtaken by cynicism, they are the two who we can point to in the House of Representatives and hold out as examples of people who can hold strongly held views and yet work 24 hours a day to find that responsible bipartisan middle ground.  I say to the gentleman from Indiana and the gentleman from Alabama, I respect you, I have a deep affection for you. You have been friends of mine. You have been more than generous, much more generous than I deserved, with me, and you will be sorely missed. You have my every best wish for good health, joy, and happiness for every day of your life, and it was a tremendous privilege to be able to serve, however shortly, on the subcommittee with both of you in leadership positions.
