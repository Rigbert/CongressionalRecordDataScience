President, last year, a year and a month ago, we had this same vote. Sixty-two people in this Chamber voted in favor of it, and I will ask them to do the same again. This, very simply--we talked about this many times--makes English the official, the national language of the United States as opposed to giving an entitlement to anyone, to any other language, which is in, of course, the amendment we passed.  If this amendment passes, it will go to conference, and we will have an opportunity to do something in conference to decide whether it is a combination of these or one or the other should prevail. So I ask that you do what 90 percent of your constituents want you to do and that is vote yes on the Inhofe amendment to make English the national language of the United States of America.
