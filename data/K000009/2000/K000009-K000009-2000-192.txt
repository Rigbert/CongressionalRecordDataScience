Chairman, as I understand the point of order, if at the end of our brief period of discussion the point of order is called, then that means our amendment cannot be offered; is that correct, will not be voted on?  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. If the point of order has been reserved, the gentlewoman can proceed with her 5 minutes. If the gentleman insists on his point of order, at that time the Chair will make a ruling on whether the point of order is well taken.
