President, I rise today as a long-time supporter of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America to join Senators Hatch, DeWine, Kohl, and Biden in introducing this legislation, S. 2363, to revise and extend the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.  Senator Hatch has been one of the best friends and supporters Boys and Girls Clubs could ever have and I have been privileged to work with him on issues that matter to the Boys & Girls Clubs. Too often the public sees Republicans and Democrats disagreeing. From time to time, even Senator Hatch and I disagree on important issues. But when it comes to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America there is no doubt that we see eye-to-eye: Today weintroduce this bill to show the unified support of Republicans and Democrats for Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide.  Children are the future of our country, and we have a responsibility to make sure they are safe and secure. I know firthand how well Boys & Girls Clubs work and what topnotch organizations they are. When I was a prosecutor in Vermont, I was convinced of the great need for Boys & Girls Clubs because we rarely encountered children from these kinds of programs. In fact, after I became a U.S. Senator, a police chief was such a big fan that he asked me to help fund a Boys & Girls Club in his district rather than helping him get a couple more police officers.  In Vermont, Boys and Girls Clubs have succeeded in preventing crime and supporting our children. The first Club was established in Burlington 62 years ago. Now we have 22 club sites operating throughout the State: seven clubs in Brattleboro, one in Springfield, two clubs in Burlington, one in Winooski, two clubs in Montpelier, five clubs in Randolph, one club in Rutland, two clubs in Vergennes and one in Bristol. There are 10 additional project sites that will be on board and serving kids by the end of 2005: one in Bennington, two in Burlington, one in Duxbury, one in St. Johnsbury, one in Hardwick, three in Randolph and one in Ludlow. These clubs will serve well over 10,000 kids statewide.  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have pushed for more Federal funding for Boys and Girls Clubs. Since 1998, Congress has increased Federal support for Boys and Girls Clubs from $20 million to $80 million in this year. Due in large part to this increase in funding, there now exist 3,300 Boys & Girls Clubs in all 50 States serving more than 3.6 million young people. Because of these successes, I was both surprised and disappointed to see that the President requested a reduction of $20 million for fiscal year 2005. That request will leave thousands of children and their Clubs behind and we cannot allow such a thing to happen.  In the 107th Congress, Senator Hatch and I worked together to pass the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, which included a provision to reauthorize Justice Department grants to establish new Boys and Girls Clubs nationwide. By authorizing $80 million in Justice grants for each of the fiscal years through 2005, we sought to establish 1,200 additional Boys and Girls Clubs nationwide. This was to bring the number of Boys and Girls Clubs to 4,000, serving no less than 5 million young people. The bill we introduce today will build upon this: We authorize Justice Department grants at $80 million for fiscal year 2006, $85 million for fiscal year 2007, $90 million for fiscal year 2008, $95 million for fiscal year 2009, and $100 million for fiscal year 2010 to Boys and Girls Clubs to help establish 1,500 additional Boys and Girls Clubs across the nation with the goal of having 5,000 Boys and Girls Clubs in operation by December 31, 2010.  If we have a Boys & Girls Club in every community, prosecutors in our country would have a lot less work to do because of the values that are being instilled in children from the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Each time I visit a club in Vermont, I am approached by parents, educators, teachers, grandparents, and law enforcement officers who tell me ``Keep doing this! These clubs give our children the chance to grow up free of drugs, gangs, and crime.''  You cannot argue that these are just Democratic or Republican ideas, or Conservative or Liberal ideals--they are simply good sense ideas. We need safe havens where our youth--the future of our country--can learn and grow up free from the influence of drugs, gangs, and crime. That is why Boys & Girls Clubs are so important to our children.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to expand Federal support for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. We all know instinctively that our country's strength and ultimate success lies with our children. Our greatest responsibility is to help them inhabit this century the best way possible and we can help do that by supporting the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.                                 ______                                       By
