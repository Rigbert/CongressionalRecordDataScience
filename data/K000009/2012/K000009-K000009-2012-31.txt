 Mr. Speaker, I rise again to oppose the Republicans' destructive attempts to repeal the health care reform law, the 31st such attempt in this Congress.  In Ohio already, the law has been making a difference for hundreds of thousands of people--middle class families--for over 2 years. Nearly 100,000 young adults in Ohio have been able to remain on their parents' health insurance plan. In the first 5 months of this year, over 700 seniors just in my home town of Toledo, Ohio, have collectively saved over a half a million dollars on prescription drug costs. Last year, 1.2 million Medicare beneficiaries in Ohio received free preventive care from their doctor, like mammograms and colonoscopies.  Insurance companies are now paying out over $11 million in rebates to Ohio families because the insurance companies did not spend enough on paying for health care. And over 4 million Ohioans, including 1.5 million women and 1.1 million children, have seen their insurance companies drop the lifetime and annual limits on care they had previously imposed.  The Republicans here in the House of Representatives are voting to take away all these benefits, and what is the Republican plan to replace it? Nothing. The Republican plan to replace it is nothing.  Mr. Ranking Member, I thank you so much for yielding me time.
