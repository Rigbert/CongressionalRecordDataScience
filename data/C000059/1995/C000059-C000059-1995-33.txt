Speaker, one of the things that makes America great is the fact that in towns and cities across the face of our country there are citizens who are willing to step forward and dedicate their talents and energies to make life better for their friends and neighbors. Riverside County has been fortunate to have many such citizens. Men and women who have given freely of themselves so that our beautiful area in southern California will continue to be a desirable place to live for generations to come. Mrs. Eddie Dee Smith is one of these exceptional citizens.  A ceremony is scheduled on August 5 to rededicate the Rubidoux Senior Center as the Eddie Dee Smith Senior Center.  The North Rubidoux Women's Club, founded in Smith's home in 1954, was the driving force in getting the center established. Eddie Dee Smith was the club's founding vice president. She was also the senior center's director from 1977 to 1981.  Eddie Dee Smith has always been at the forefront of Rubidoux's advancement. She was a founder of the Mount Calvary Baptist Church, the Mount Vernon Baptist Church, the Rubidoux Senior Center, head of the Jurupa Area Girl Scouts, member of the Avalon Park Committee, regent of the Jensen-Alvarado Ranch, president of the Jurupa Democrat Club, and 1993 Jurupa Chamber of Commerce citizen of the year.  On behalf of the many people whose lives this remarkable woman has touched, I would like to add my personal congratulations, and the thanks of the people of the 43d Congressional District.                          ____________________
