Speaker, that is the way it has turned out to be, and I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) for his great leadership and vision and taking this CAFTA fight to the American people. It is a great privilege also to join with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Strickland), our esteemed colleague from south and southeastern Ohio, who I know will be adding remarks and great insight as the evening proceeds; the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky); the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Carnahan); and we had the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) from the Cleveland area here a little bit earlier.  It is really amazing to me when you have a trade agreement like NAFTA, that is so absolutely a failure, that now there is a new trade scheme, and they have got a name that rhymes with NAFTA. I just, I cannot believe it. I cannot believe they are over there. They have got a cookie-cutter system, and they are not paying attention to results.  If we look at the recent history of our country, going back to the mid-1970s, when the first so-called free trade agreement was signed, every single year the United States has begun to develop trade deficits. That means we ship out more jobs abroad than we create jobs here at home. And we end up taking our income and paying somebody else to do the work that we used to do, and we accumulate these growing trade deficits. And they get worse with every decade.  When NAFTA passed in the early 1990s, we actually had a trade surplus with Mexico, which immediately turned into a trade deficit; and with Canada we have doubled the deficit that we already had. When we signed the agreement with China, which those of us who were here voted against, we did not get any more jobs. We did not get any more income. All we got was more trade deficit. It is so deep America has never been in this kind of deep water before. In fact, this year the trade deficit will accumulate at over half a trillion dollars. America has never faced this kind of loss. So it is amazing to me that they name an agreement to rhyme with one of the biggest failures.  And here are some charts, I think, that tell a fuller story about what has happened with the NAFTA agreement. When NAFTA was signed in 1994, we had accumulated trade deficits with Canada; but then every succeeding year, they got deeper and deeper and deeper. So, with Canada, we have not really benefited.  And with Mexico, the surplus we had turned into a gigantic and growing deficit. And now what is happening with Mexico, of course, some of those jobs are being shifted to Latin America and to China. So NAFTA has been a negative.  And what has been going on in terms of the United States, just take the auto industry which is the primary category of deficit with Mexico. We were already getting imports from Mexico prior to NAFTA's signing. Now it is just an avalanche coming the other way. And what we predicted has come true. Mexico has turned into an export platform to the United States. And what we are doing is actually creating a world system where people work for poverty wages or starvation wages. We have high-productivity poverty rather than high-productivity prosperity.  And, finally, if one looks at the China agreement which has a relationship here because this is the same cookie-cutter approach that they are giving us with China, the deficits were growing, but then when permanent normal trade relations, if you can call an abnormal trade deficit normal, I have never understood the words they use. We are just hemorrhaging with China. And just one company alone, Wal-Mart, takes 10 percent of the exports that China sends around the world.  So my basic point here this evening is, why should we have more of the same? Why should we believe them when they say it is going to be all right?  And, indeed, I would like to place in the Record an article that was in the New York Times this week where the President of Costa Rica actually said he wants to postpone legislative review on this so-called CAFTA, which is an expansion of NAFTA, until an independent committee finds that it will not harm the poor. Well, it surely will harm the poor. And that is why, in nations like Mexico, we have historic demonstrations in Mexico City for example, of farmers, of peasants, of people just demonstrating and saying we cannot take it anymore; particularly in the countryside, the people are saying we cannot take it anymore.  So I want to thank my colleague for bringing this issue to light. I think we have to be careful of the administration and their efforts to try to come in here and try to buy votes and say, what kinds of transportation project do you like? Oh, how much do you want? Do you need a bridge? Which way do you want it to go, east west, up, down, you know, below the ocean floor? I mean, we will do it for you. What else do you need? Do you need a base? We are moving a few bases around. That is what happened during NAFTA at the very end. The American people would have won that debate, but it was bought. It was bought and sold. And now look at the negative yield that it has produced for the American people.  So I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) for highlighting this this evening. And it has been a pleasure to join my colleagues tonight.                [From the New York Times, May 10, 2005]               Free Trade Pact Faces Trouble in Congress                         (By Elizabeth Becker)       Washington.--Social Security is not the administration's      only economic initiative that is in trouble in Congress.       The current centerpiece of President Bush's trade agenda,      the Central American Free Trade Agreement, is facing      unusually united Democratic opposition as well as serious      problems in overcoming well-entrenched special interest      groups like sugar producers and much of the textile industry.       With record trade deficits, concerns about lost jobs and an      overarching fear that the United States is losing out in the      accelerated pace of global changes, the sentiment in Congress      is shifting away from approving new free trade agreements.       ``I don't like Cafta; I am not going to vote for it; and I      will do whatever I can to kill it,'' said Senator Harry Reid      of Nevada, the minority leader. ``We are approaching a      trillion-dollar trade deficit. We can't survive as a viable,      strong country doing that.''       Even more troubling to the administration, which says free      trade agreements are critical components of any effort to      enhance American global competitiveness, is the stance of      Republicans like Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, who      wants to hold off on new bilateral trade agreements.       In a speech on the Senate floor and in a later opinion-page      article in the newspaper The Hill, Senator Chambliss said      that even though his state is home to global companies like      Coca-Cola, United Parcel Service and Georgia Pacific, he      could no longer support bilateral trade agreements without      being assured that ``American industries and workers are      truly benefiting from these agreements.''       The trade deal, which was signed one year ago, involves a      handful of tiny countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador,      Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. But its prospects for      moving forward have been soured by larger questions about      China's enormous economic power and whether it is playing by      the rules     of trade in protecting intellectual property rights, valuing      its currency and calibrating the tide of its textile exports.      Also playing into the situation are unmet expectations from      the North American Free Trade Agreement.       The administration accuses the Democrats and other      opponents of putting too much on the back of this trade deal,      which would reduce tariffs for many American goods and, the      White House says, improve the chances for democracy and free      market economics in Latin America.       ``Cafta can't be held captive to China or any other trade      problem,'' said Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez, who      has been crisscrossing the country trying to sell the      agreement since he took office in January.       The administration admits that even in this off-election      year, when trade deals have the best chance of passage, it      does not have the votes to pass this one.       With little sign of progress, both sides notched up the      battle last week. President Bush announced that he would play      host this week at a high-profile White House meeting. Since      his first term, the Bush administration has promoted free      trade agreements with Central America and throughout the      Western Hemisphere as important components of its foreign      policy.       ``For too many decades,'' Secretary of State Condoleezza      Rice said in a speech before the Council of the Americas,      ``U.S. policy toward Central America and the Dominican      Republic has oscillated from engagement to disregard. With      Cafta, with the permanent engagement that free trade brings,      we can break this trend once and for all and we can      demonstrate that the United States is committed to the      success of all Latin American countries that embrace the      challenge of democracy.''       On the other side, centrist Democrats who normally vote for      every new trade deal said they opposed Cafta. They said the      administration had yet to outline a clear policy aimed at      narrowing the $617 billion trade deficit. And they challenged      the White House to write trade deals that reflected what they      saw as the pressing challenges of globalization in the 21st      century.       The administration characterizes most of these complaints      as protectionism and hopes that Rob Portman, the new United      States trade representative and a popular former member of      Congress, will be able to smooth the debate and win votes to      its side.       But Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the      ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Trade of the House      Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview that Cafta was      too small a treaty to warrant such attention.       ``Cafta will have a minor impact on our economy; we should      be spending time on the big issues like China, agricultural      subsidies,'' Mr. Cardin said. ``If I were the administration,      I would not like my trade agenda to be judged on Cafta.''       Despite its small weight, many interest groups are deeply      divided over Cafta. The Latino groups and politicians who      oppose Cafta say that Nafta, the decade-old agreement with      Mexico and Canada, failed to fulfill its promise.       Representative Hilda Solis, Democrat of California, who      describes herself as the only member of Congress of Central      American descent, said she opposed Cafta because of Nafta's      record, which she said included 750,000 jobs lost in the      United States and little progress in improving workers'      rights in Mexico.       By contrast, Mr. Gutierrez, the commerce secretary, said      Nafta was a strong selling point for Cafta.       ``I've been associated with Mexico for almost four decades      and Mexico is better than it has ever been,'' said Mr.      Gutierrez, who started his career in that country after      fleeing Cuba as a child. ``It now has its lowest inflation      rate, and its growth last year was 4.5 percent.''       But questions about labor rights and lost jobs are staying      at the forefront of the trade debate, not retreating.      American labor unions say the accord demands better      enforcement of existing labor laws in Central America without      imposing real sanctions. The administration defends the labor      provisions as groundbreaking.       Even the countries within Cafta have some noticeable      divisions. The ambassadors to the United States from Cafta      countries are traveling around the nation to try to persuade      members of Congress to vote for the accord.       But Beatrice de Carrillo, El Salvador's human rights      ombudswoman, said in an interview here that she opposed Cafta      because it was not strong enough to stop the destruction of      unions. And Costa Rica's president, Abel Pacheco, has said he      wants to postpone legislative review until an independent      committee finds that it will not harm the poor.
