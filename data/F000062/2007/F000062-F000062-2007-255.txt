 President, I rise today to introduce the Lytton Gaming Oversight Act of 2007, a bill seeking to ensure that Native American tribes follow the regular process under Federal law prior to establishing and operating gaming facilities.  I believe this approach provides a good step forward as it has the support of both the local community and the Lytton tribe.  I am pleased to have worked closely with representatives of the local community, such as California Assemblymember Loni Hancock, D-Berkeley, as well as my colleague Senator Specter in crafting this piece of legislation.  I introduced similar legislation in the 108th and 109th Congresses, but these bills would have effectively required closure of the casino operations, until a point when and if the Lytton successfully completed the two-part determination process.  This legislation, however, stalled. The legislation introduced today breaks that stalemate and seeks to prevent a massive expansion of gaming in the Bay Area.  The bill requires that the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians follow critical oversight guidelines laid out in Section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, before engaging in Class III gaming.  This legislation would amend language inserted into the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act of 2000.  That language mandated that the Secretary of Interior take a card club and adjacent parking lot in the San Francisco Bay Area into trust for the Lytton tribe as their reservation and backdate the acquisition to October 17, 1988, or pre-IGRA.  This backdating was done expressly with the goal of allowing the Lytton tribe to circumvent IGRA's ``two-part determination'' process, an important step that requires both Secretarial and Gubernatorial approval, in addition to consultation with nearby tribes and the local community and its representatives.  The legislation that I have introduced would simply return the Lytton tribe to the same status as all other tribes seeking to pursue Class III, or Nevada-style gaming, on lands acquired after the passage of IGRA in 1988.  It would allow the tribe to continue operating its Class II gaming facility provided it follows all IGRA regulations regarding gaming on newly acquired lands going forward.  Finally, it would also preclude any expansion of the facility used by the Lytton for Class II gaming.  I would like to emphasize what the bill would not do. It would not: Remove the tribe's recognition status; Alter the trust status of the new reservation; or take away the tribe's ability to conduct gaming through the normal IGRA process.  This legislation was solely crafted to restore IGRA's rightful oversight of the gaming process, just as Congress intended.  Section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides clear guidelines for addressing the issue of gaming on so-called ``newly-acquired'' lands, or lands that have been taken into trust since the enactment of IGRA in 1988.  Most importantly, in my opinion, IGRA's ``two-part determination'' process provides for both Federal and State approval, while protecting the rights of nearby tribes and local communities.  Circumventing this process creates a variety of serious and critical multi-jurisdictional issues, issues which can negatively affect the lives of ordinary citizens and deprive local and tribal governments of their ability to effectively represent their communities.  Without passage of this bill, the Lytton could take the former card club and the adjacent parking lot that is now their reservation and turn it into a large gambling complex outside the regulations set up by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. In fact, this is exactly what was proposed in the summer of 2004.  While the tribe announced that it was dropping its pursuit of a sizable casino, it could reverse these plans at any time and proceed with Class III gaming without first going through the regular process.  Allowing this to happen would set a dangerous precedent not only for California, but every State where tribal gaming is permitted.  I do not think it is asking too much to require that the Lytton be subject to the regulatory and approval processes applicable to all other tribes by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  This bill would do just that.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1347       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
