Mr. Kline, with long and distinguished service in providing U.S. Government information to the citizens of the 9th District of Ohio has retired after providing U.S. Government information to the citizens since he started as government documents librarian in 1971.  In 1981 he became coordinator for the library's federal depository collection, which is one of the more than 1200 Congressionally designated Federal Depository Libraries nationwide, and one of the four depository libraries serving our region. Mr. Kline has been an active and dedicated promoter of the use of government information, and has served with distinction on numerous committees and as president of the Government Documents Round Table of Ohio, which recently honored him with its ``Clyde'' award for achievement and service.  Daniel Webster said, ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.'' In his nearly forty year career in service to our nation's government as he carefully kept record of our documents and made them available to all, George Kline has upheld this ideal.  We wish Mr. Kline a retirement much deserved, traveling this new road of his life's journey with those for whom he cares and doing that which he enjoys.                          ____________________
