Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, for several years now I have pushed USAID and the Congress to establish a program to assist women who suffer from obstetric fistula. According to the USAID, an estimated 2 million women suffer needlessly from fistula and from 50,000 to 100,000 new cases are added every year, mostly in Africa.  Fistula occurs during obstetric labor, which sometime damages soft tissues. The destroyed tissues leave a hole or fistula in the pelvic floor area which causes incontinence. Tragically, the constant leaking of urine and feces leads to sickness, desertion by husbands and family, extreme social isolation, and poverty. Who are vulnerable, according to the USAID, very young mothers, women experiencing their first birth, women whose growth has been stunted due to malnutrition or illness, and poor women who lack access to the most basic of obstetric services.  My amendment and the underlying language in H.R. 2601, section 901, that I put into the bill, establishes 12 centers for the treatment and prevention of obstetric fistula. Funding is authorized at $5 million in 2006, and the amendment increases the authorization by $2.5 million to $7.5 million in fiscal year 2007.  Amazingly, for $150 to a couple hundred dollars, a woman victimized by fistula can obtain a surgical repair that gives her back her life. No woman should be denied this minimal, life-saving surgical repair. My amendment requires that the centers include increased access for women to emergency obstetrical care, including increased access to skilled birth attendants and care facilities.  My amendment states that the centers may include activities to expand abstinence education, postponement of marriage and child bearing until after the teenage years, and access to family-planning services.                              {time}  1545  During markup, an amendment was offered to exclude, and this would be the result of that language, certain faith-based health care providers who, while deeply committed to mitigating the pain of fistula, would be barred from receiving funds. I have been in contact with Dr. Kent Hill, the Acting Assistant Administrator for Global Health at USAID, and he concurs that my amendment is preferable and balanced because it permits inclusion of family planning programs, gives USAID the flexibility to get the job done, and is consistent with the conscience clause we secured through an amendment I inserted in Mr. Hyde's $15 billion HIV/AIDS law.  Section 901 is a modest $5 million in 2006, $7.5 million in 2007, and we need to begin in earnest to give women who suffer the tragedy of fistula the basic care that they need.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
