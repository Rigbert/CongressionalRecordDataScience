 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is both good news and bad news. The good news is that the Republicans have finally decided to stop holding three-quarters of a million American Federal workers as hostage. In Vermont we have close to 2,000 Federal workers who are working today but are not getting paid. These people have mortgages to pay. They have children to feed. They have financial obligations to meet. It is immoral. It is wrong to hold them and every other Federal Worker who is furloughed and not being paid as hostage.  It is also wrong to hold millions of Americans who need passports, who need environmental protection, who need Meals on Wheels, who need all of the services that this Government should be providing as hostage, who have paid for these services but are not getting them.  The bad news is that, while Federal workers will be paid, many of them will not be given the resources that they need to do their jobs properly. That is insane. Why do we give people the money to go to work but then not allow them the resources to properly fulfill their function?  Mr. Speaker, the truth of the matter is that this is not a debate about a 7-year balanced budget. If our Republican friends were serious about balancing the budget in 7 years, which I think can be done, they would not be spending $50 billion more on defense spending despite the end of the cold war. They would not be spending more money on the CIA despite the end of the cold war. They would not be giving huge tax breaks to the rich when the richest people in America today are richer than they have ever been before.
