 President, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare Rural Health Access Improvement Act of 2009.  The purpose of this legislation is to continue ongoing efforts to ensure that Americans in rural areas have access to health care services. Much has been done in the past to improve access to rural providers such as hospitals and doctors. Much more still needs to be done. And it is even more important in light of the economic challenges we face.  I hold town meetings in each of the 99 counties in the great state of Iowa every year. As many know, Iowa is largely a rural state, and a significant concern that I consistently hear during these meetings is the difficulty my constituents experience in accessing health care services. As the former Chairman and currently the Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, it has therefore been a priority for me to improve the availability of health care in rural areas.  In Iowa, as in many rural areas across the country, hospitals are often not only the sole provider of health care in rural areas, but also employers and purchasers in the community. Moreover, the presence of a hospital is essential for purposes of economic development because businesses check to see if a hospital is in the community in which they might set up shop. As you can see, it is vital that these institutions are able to keep their doors open.  In previous legislation, Congress has been able to improve the financial viability of rural hospitals. For instance, the creation and subsequent improvements to the Critical Access Hospital designation have greatly improved the financial health of certain small rural hospitals and ensured that community residents have access to health care.  However, there are still a group of rural hospitals that need help. I am referring to what are known as ``tweener'' hospitals, which are too large to be Critical Access Hospitals, but too small to be financially viable under the Medicare hospital prospective payment systems. These facilities are struggling to stay afloat despite their tireless efforts. Like in many communities in across the country, the staff of tweener hospitals and their community residents take great pride in the quality of care at these facilities. I have heard countless stories of the exemplary work tweener hospitals in Iowa perform not only as providers of essential health care, but also as responsible members of their communities. It is for this reason that many provisions in this bill are intended to improve the financial health of tweener hospitals and ensure that people have access to health care.  Most tweener hospitals are currently designated as Medicare Dependent Hospitals and Sole Community Hospitals under the Medicare program. There are provisions, both temporary and permanent, included in this bill that would improve Medicare payments for both types of hospitals. This includes improvements to the payment methodologies so that inpatient payments to Medicare Dependent Hospitals would better reflect the costs they incur in providing care. Improvements are also proposed in this bill to Medicare hospital outpatient payments for both Medicare Dependent Hospitals and Sole Community Hospitals so they would both share the benefit of hold harmless payments and add-on payments.  Also, a major driver of the financial difficulties that tweener hospitals face is the fact that many have relatively low volumes of inpatient admissions. This bill would improve the existing low-volume add-on payment for hospitals so that more rural facilities with low volumes would receive the assistance they desperately need.  Over the years, many have commented that it is simply unfair for many rural hospitals to receive only a limited amount of Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, or DSH, payments while many urban hospitals are not subject to such a cap. This bill would eliminate the cap for DSH payments for those rural hospitals for a two-year period.  There are also other provisions that would continue to help rural hospitals. The rural flexibility program would be extended for an additional year. This essential program provides valuable resources for rural hospitals.  This legislation also seeks to improve incentives for physicians located in rural areas and increase beneficiaries' access to rural health care providers. It includes provisions designed to reduce inequitable disparities in physician payment resulting from the Geographic Practice Cost Indices, or adjusters, known as GPCIs. Medicare payment for physician services varies from one area to another based on the geographic adjustments for a particular area. Geographic adjustments are intended to reflect cost differences in a given area compared to a national average of 1.0 so that an area with costs above the national average would have an index greater than 1.0, and an area below the national average would have an index less than 1.0. There are currently three geographic adjustments: for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense.  Unfortunately, the existing geographic adjusters result in significant disparities in physician reimbursement which penalize, rather than equalize, physician payment in Iowa and other rural States. These geographic disparities in payment lead to rural states experiencing significant difficulties in recruiting and retaining physicians and other health care professionals due to their significantly lower reimbursement rates.  These disparities have perverse effects when it comes to realigning Medicare payment to reward quality of care. Let me put that into context. Iowa is widely recognized as providing some of the highest quality health care in the country yet Iowa physicians receive some of the lowest Medicare reimbursement due to these inequitable geographic adjustments. Medicare reimbursement for some procedures is at least 30 percent lower in Iowa than payment for those very procedures in other parts of the country. That is a significant disincentive for Iowa physicians who are providing some of the best quality care in the country, and it is fundamentally unfair. Congress needs to reduce these disparities in payment and focus on rewarding physicians who provide high quality care.  The inequitable geographic payment formulas have also exacerbated the problems that rural areas face in terms of access to health care. Rural America today has far fewer physicians per capita than urban areas. The GPCI formulas are a dismal failure in promoting an adequate supply of physicians in states like Iowa, and more severe physician shortages in rural areas are predicted in the future.  The legislation I am introducing today makes changes in the GPCI formulas for work and practice expense to reverse this trend. It recognizes the equality of physician work in all geographic areas and establishes a national value of 1.0 for the physician work adjustment. It establishes a practice expense floor of 1.0 floor and revises the calculation of the practice expense formula to reduce payment differences and more accurately compensate physicians in rural areas fortheir true practice costs. These changes are needed to help rural states recruit and retain more physicians so that beneficiaries will continue to have access to needed health care.  Last year Congress enacted a number of other provisions to improve Medicare payment for health care professionals and providers in rural areas that will expire at the end of 2009. This bill extends the existing payment arrangements which allow independent laboratories to bill Medicare directly for certain physician pathology services through 2010. It extends and improves the rural ambulance payments enacted in the Medicare Improvements for Providers and Patients Act of 2008 by increasing payments from three to five percent and extending them an additional year, through 2010. The bill also includes several new provisions to improve beneficiary access to health care services. It permanently increases the payment limits for rural health clinics. It also allows physician assistants to order post-hospital extended care services and to serve hospice patients.  Finally, the bill would protect rural areas from being adversely affected by the new Medicare competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment. It would ensure that home medical equipment suppliers who provide equipment and services in rural areas and small metropolitan statistical areas, MSAs, with a population of 600,000 or less can continue to serve the Medicare program by exempting these areas from competitive bidding. We must ensure that rural areas continue to have medical equipment suppliers available to serve beneficiaries in these areas.  As you can see, we still have much to do when it comes to ensuring access to health care in rural America. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important matter.                                 ______                                       By
