Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I have served on the Appropriations Committee for a long time, and I am proud of the work that we have been able to accomplish in a bipartisan and bicameral manner, which is the history of the Appropriations Committee.  Unfortunately, the Senate bill before us today forces us to choose between abdicating our constitutional obligations and underfunding important programs in a way that is unacceptable to me and my constituents. I am afraid this is a bad precedent, and I hope that this does not happen in the future: we just accept whatever the Senate determines is the proper path forward.  I am disheartened by the Democrats' closed process that throws our bipartisan House priorities and will neithersecure our borders nor reopen the government. Rather than passing bills to score political points, I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to work with us to find a solution that reflects the will of the House, will pass in the Senate, and will be signed by the President.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two articles dealing with the administration's illegal use of taking fees to keep our parks and refuges open.                     [From the Hill, Jan. 6, 2019]House Panel To `Demand Answers' on Interior's Move To Use Visitor Fees                            To Keep Parks Open                  (By Miranda Green and Timothy Cama)       The House Natural Resources Committee intends to      investigate the Trump administration's decision to dip into      visitor fees to keep parks open, the panel's chairman warned      Sunday.       Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said that his committee--which      oversees Interior--has plans to look into the legality of the      decision, saying the shutdown has done ``terrible damage'' to      the U.S.       ``President Trump and his advisors apparently just woke up      to the fact that the shutdown they created several weeks ago      has done terrible damage to our country,'' Grijalva said in a      statement Sunday.       ``This is not how a rational president behaves, and the      Natural Resources Committee will demand answers about whether      these moves are legally justified.''       The National Park Service (NPS) announced to staff Sunday a      plan to dip into ``entrance, camping, parking and other fees      collected from park visitors'' to pay staff to assist in      urgent maintenance needs at a number of national parks      overburdened by visitors during the recent government      shutdown.       ``As the lapse in appropriations continues, it has become      clear that highly visited parks with limited staff have      urgent needs that cannot be addressed solely through the      generosity of our partners,'' Daniel Smith, NPS deputy      director, said in a statement obtained by The Hill.       Smith said he and acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt      developed the plan to ``address the maintenance and      sanitation issues that have arisen at a number of highly      visited parks.''       ``We are taking this extraordinary step to ensure that      parks are protected, and that visitors can continue to access      parks with limited basic services,'' the statement read.       Bernhardt signed a memorandum Saturday to use the fees      known as Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act money, The      Washington Post reported.       Jonathan Jarvis, who led the Park Service under President      Obama from 2009 to 2017, slammed the strategy as a      ``significant departure'' from how the agency has      historically used the money parks.       ``Since [the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act's]      original passage, it's always been interpreted by the Park      Service as not available for operations,'' said Jarvis, who      worked in the agency for more than three decades, including      as director of the Pacific West region.       ``This is a significant departure. It wasn't even a      consideration during the 16-day shutdown when I was      director,'' he said, referring to the 2013 shutdown. ``That's      eating your seed corn.''       Jarvis worried that using the fee money in this way would      take it away from park maintenance, which has a backlog      nearing $12 billion across the country.       Jarvis had officials close parks entirely during the 2013      shutdown, despite criticisms from Republicans and others.      He's been highly critical of the Trump administration's      strategy to keep them open with little to no staff.       ``It sends a particular message that they don't really care      about the resource, and probably increasingly, they don't      seem to care about the visitor either,'' he said. ``They only      seem to care about the bad press that they're getting.''       The gates to most U.S. national parks were left open under      the most recent shutdown, which has extended since Dec. 22.      While visitors have been able to access parks, many services      including bathrooms and trash pick-up was suspended as      government employees were kept home. That's created a number      of headaches across the country at highly visited parks where      trash is piling up, bathrooms are at capacity and visitors      aren't being watched by experts.       At least one park, Joshua Tree National Park in California,      was shuttered due to ``health and safety concerns.''       While in the past access to national parks has been      restricted during a shutdown due to safety concerns, former      Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke made keeping parks up a      priority during his tenure.       During the last shutdown last January, Zinke told reporters      the parks shouldn't be used as a bargaining chip in shutdown      negotiations.       ``Our public lands and our monuments really belong to the      people and not the government,'' he told CNN.       He said however, ``by law'' Interior wasn't allowed to      provide clean up services to parks.       ``Law enforcement is still there. But things like cleaning      the bathrooms . . . and telling the story of our parks, which      is important--that side of it, while the `Schumer shutdown'      is in, by law we're not able to provide those services,''      Zinke said, mentioning the GOP label for the shutdown at the      time.       In an interview earlier this week Zinke told The Associated      Press that the public should ``Pitch in, grab a trash bag and      take some trash out.''       Zinke's last day at Interior was Jan. 2. He resigned from      the agency in December amid multiple ethics investigations.       However, Interior's plan to dip from the fee pot was laid      out clearly in its 2019 shutdown contingency plan, which      read: ``Parks that collect fees under the Federal Lands      Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) will utilize available      retained recreation fees balances to provide basic visitor      services in a manner that maintains restrooms and sanitation,      trash collection, road maintenance, campground operations,      law enforcement and emergency operations, and staffing      entrance gates as necessary to provide critical safety      information.''       Spokesmen for Interior and NPS did not return requests for      comment.       Critics are questioning the legality of Interior's decision      to use the park fees, money that is assigned by Congress to      pay for other federal expenses, including the department's      multibillion-dollar maintenance backlog.       Theresa Pierno, president of the National Parks      Conservation Association, called NPS's action the equivalent      of stealing.       ``Instead of working to reopen the federal government, the      administration is robbing money collected from entrance fees      to operate our national parks during this shutdown,'' she      said in a statement.       ``It's incredibly concerning that the Acting Interior      Secretary is putting political pressure on Superintendents to      keep parks open at the expense of parks' long-term needs and      protection.''       Out of the 418 park units across the country, 165 collect      fees, and they took in $285.2 million in fiscal year 2017,      according to a report last year by the Congressional Research      Service. Usually, at least 80 percent of that revenue has to      stay with the park that took it in, and the rest can go to      other parks.       At least one group, the National Park Hospitality      Association, applauded the agency's fee strategy. The      organization represents companies that operate businesses in      parks, like gift shops, restaurants and lodging.       ``NPHA has actively supported visitor fee retention by      federal recreation providers and use of collected funds for      visitor-related purposes,'' Scott Socha, the group's chairman      and president for parks and resorts at Delware North Cos.,      said in a statement.                                  ____                     [PBS News Hour, Jan. 9, 2019] Government Restaffs Wildlife Refuges During Shutdown To Allow Hunters                                  Access                         (By Ellen Knickmeyer)       Washington.--The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is      directing dozens of wildlife refuges to return to work to      make sure hunters and others have access despite the      government shutdown, according to an email obtained Wednesday      by The Associated Press.       The partial restaffing of 38 wildlife refuges is angering      wildlife groups, who accuse the Trump administration of      trying to minimize the public impact of the more than two-     week-old shutdown to limit the political blowback for      President Donald Trump. Trump and Democrats in Congress are      locked in a dispute over Trump's demand for billions of      dollars for a wall on the southern U.S. border.       In an email sent Tuesday afternoon, Margaret Everson,      principal deputy director of the Fish and Wildlife Service,      cites ``opportunities, including hunting'' that are being      lost in the shutdown.       Everson advises in the email that 38 wildlife refuges      around the country will bring back some furloughed staff      using carryover funds.       ``While many of our refuges have remained accessible, but      not staffed, the extended lapse in federal appropriations is      impacting both our ability to serve the public and to protect      natural resources under our care in some places,'' Everson      wrote.       ``For the next 30 days, using previously appropriated      funds, we will bring back a limited number of employees to      resume work on high priority projects and activities that      support the Service's mission and meet the public's desire      for access to Refuge lands,'' Everson said in the email.       Everson did not immediately respond to an email from the AP      seeking comment.       The shutdown has forced federal agencies to stop paychecks      for hundreds of thousands of government employees, limiting      government services to only the most pressing, such as      Transportation Security Administration workers providing      security at airports without pay.       Unlike as in some past shutdowns, the Interior Department--     which oversees both wildlife refuges and national parks--     initially had directed national parks to stay open but with      little staffing, leading to pile-ups of uncollected garbage      and human waste in parks. The National Park Service over the      weekend said some parks could start using visitor fees to      staff during the shutdown.       On Wednesday, the National Wildlife Refuge Association, the      Coalition to Protect America's National Parks and the U.S.      Fish and Wildlife Service Retirees Association     urged the Trump administration to keep national parks,      wildlife refuges and other public lands closed to the public      during the shutdown.       ``It is simply impossible to steward these shared American      treasures properly, leaving thousands of lands and waters      accessible to the public with no staff on site, even for an      emergency,'' the groups wrote in a letter.       Desiree Sorenson-Groves of the National Wildlife Refuge      Association criticized the partial restaffing of some      wildlife refuges.       ``If it wasn't essential to have these refuges open for the      past three weeks, how is it essential now?'' she asked. The      bottom line was the Trump administration was trying to ``make      this less painful to the American public,'' she said.       According to the email, the wildlife refuges being      restaffed include Oklahoma's Wichita Mountains, scene of an      annual winter elk hunt. The other national refuges staffing      up again stretch from the Midway Atoll in Hawaii to Florida's      Merritt Island.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, responsibility of funding the government is one of Congress' most important duties. Republicans failed to meet this obligation, and they have allowed President Trump to peddle chaos.  The Trump shutdown is creating uncertainty for families, businesses, and communities. More than 800,000 employees are not getting paid today. For that, I am deeply heartsick. Vital services are being disrupted and small businesses are being forced to lay off employees.  Democrats are ready to end the Trump shutdown. The Interior bill has already received bipartisan support from the Senate. After this House bill passes, Senate Republicans will have a choice: pass their own bill and end the shutdown, or reject it and keep the government closed.  On Monday, the National Governors Association sent a letter asserting ``a Federal Government shutdown should not be a negotiating tactic.'' I agree with the Governors. I am sure that Federal employees whose paychecks are being withheld today feel the same way.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
