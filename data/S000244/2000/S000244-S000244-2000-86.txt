Speaker, I'm honored and excited to join Congressman Jim Rogan and my colleagues today in authorizing the President to present astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins--the crew of the historic Apollo 11 mission--with a congressional gold medal. As a cosponsor of this legislation and as Chairman of the House Science Committee, I have observed how these three leaders of America's space program continue to inspire generations of Americans to dream beyond Earth and entertain the infinite possibilities of space exploration.  I doubt any American alive on that memorable day in late July of 1969--the 20th to be exact--will ever forget the image of Neil Armstrong first stepping foot onto the Lunar surface. Commander Armstrong presciently declared, ``That's one small step for man; one giant leap for mankind,'' and America and the rest of the world watched in awe of the greatest feat in space history.  These men provided courage and service to the U.S. beyond this memorable and daring mission. Mr. Collins co-piloted the Gemini 10 mission and later served as assistant secretary of state for public affairs. Mr. Aldrin flew over 60 combat missions in Korea and survived a 5\1/2\ hour space walk on the Gemini 12 mission. Mr. Armstrong left NASA in 1971 but continued his service through the National Commission on Space and helping lead the presidential commission investigating the Challenger explosion.  Mr. Speaker, these outstanding leaders embody the values, principles, and dedication that make our country the greatest in the world. I'm proud to join my colleagues in working to recognize Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins with a congressional gold medal on behalf of the Congress and the people of the United States.
