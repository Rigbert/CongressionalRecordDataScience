 I would like to make a couple of comments. That is not what I am here to talk about today. But this President has a commitment to do something about our tax system. I know there is a lot of class warfare that goes on and people are always talking about taxes and that the poor people are paying all the taxes. It is kind of interesting that this President wants to make a dramatic change in the tax structure. When I go back to my State of Oklahoma, no matter where I go the people are all united in saying they really want to have something different.  The interesting thing is, I was riding yesterday with a CPA from Oklahoma and said: If we are successful in dramatically simplifying the Tax Code, why would you support that because you might be out of work?  He said: I would gladly do it. I can always find something else. It is unfair and it is a system that needs to be cleaned up.  I would only caution people who are watching what is going on in this Chamber, when we get into a discussion of changing the Tax Code, every time there is someone who suggests that you lower the marginal rates of taxation, they assume that this is an unjust burden on the lower income people.  In fact, when this President did it he was lowering the tax rate on people who paid taxes. Obviously, if you don't pay taxes, you can't lower the rate. That is what he was faced with.  Also, we learned a lesson following World War I when they raised taxes. It brought a lot of revenue into the system to fight World War I. When it was over, they decided they would go ahead and reduce the taxes because they did not need the revenue anymore. They were shocked to find out when they reduced the taxes that the revenue increased.  Then again, a very smart President, one I admired very much, was the President of the United States by the name of Kennedy. When President Kennedy was in office we were expanding a lot of the things in the social programs in this country. He said we have to have more money, and we have to raise more revenue to take care of these programs. John Kennedy was a Democrat, not a Republican. He said the best way to raise revenue was to reduce marginal rates. So he reduced marginal rates, and sure enough, that opened it up and revenue increased.  Another person came in the White House, Ronald Reagan, in 1980. He said the same thing. He actually reduced the top bracket rate from some 95 percent down to about 25 percent; and all other brackets, too. Everybody got in on that good deal. The largest tax reduction in the history of America successfully reduced taxes and increased revenue.  The evidence of that, if you look at the total revenue that came from marginal rates in the 1980s, was $244 billion. In 1990, it was $466 billion. It almost doubled in that decade, that 10-year period. It was the largest reduction of taxes in this Nation's history.  I hope those who will be engaging in class warfare and are going to be talking about how this is unfair and how the rich need to be paying more taxes keep in mind that the people who are paying the taxes are middle-income Americans. These are the people who need the relief. They need to have more opportunities to do more with the money. That is how you increase revenues.  I hear a lot of people complaining about this President and the fact we have the deficit. Obviously, we have the deficit for three reasons.  No. 1, we had a recession. This President inherited a recession. That started in March of 2000. With the economic activity low, you have to use the formula that for each 1-percent increase in economic activity it produces $46 billion in new revenue. So it was way down.  No. 2, he had succeeded President Clinton where he had cut the defense spending down to the bone with the myth floating around that somehow the cold war was over; we didn't need a military anymore. We were down to about half the Army divisions, down in tactical airwings, and half in ships, down 300 from 600. Then we realized we were in a more hostile world. By the time President George W. Bush had to start rebuilding the military, our modernization programs had stopped.  Then 9/11 came along. Here we are in a war.  I can tell you that the three factors which caused the deficit are factors that we are overcoming as we are speaking. But you might as well hold your breath for a while because the war is going to last a while.                          ____________________
