Section 337 of S. 3611 creates several reporting requirements with regard to the executive and congressional oversight of cybersecurity programs. These include Presidential notifications to Congress, reports to Congress and the President from the head of a department or agency with responsibility for cybersecurity programs, in conjunction with the inspector general of that department or agency, and a joint report to Congress and the President from the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security and the inspector general of the intelligence community on the status of the sharing of cyber threat information within 1 year. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Feinstein in the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate to ensure strong oversight and legislation with regard to cyber matters.  I am pleased the Senate today will pass the amended Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. The progress that Senator Feinstein and I have made to improve this bill demonstrates the success we can have when we work together constructively.                               Exhibit 1                                                      U.S. Senate,                             Select Committee on Intelligence,                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2009.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: As you know, our staffs have been in      discussions since the beginning of recess over various      provisions of S. 1494, the Intelligence Authorization Act for      Fiscal Year 2010, ordered reported from the Committee on July      22, 2009. Among the provisions at issue is Section 340,      Cybersecurity Oversight.       Section 340 is intended to provide a preliminary framework      for executive and congressional oversight of cybersecurity      programs, as defined in the section, to ensure that these      programs are consistent with legal authorities, preserve      reasonable expectations of privacy, and are subject to      independent audit and review.       Section 340 contains several reporting requirements. One      requires the President to provide certain notifications to      Congress. In addition, the head of a department or agency      with responsibility for cybersecurity programs, in      conjunction with the inspector general of that department or      agency, is to submit to Congress and the President periodic      reports on the program. Finally, the Inspector General of the      Department of Homeland Security and the Inspector General of      the Intelligence Community are jointly to submit a report to      Congress and the President on the status of the sharing of      cyber threat information within one year.       Under the provision as reported, notifications and reports      under the section are to be submitted ``to the Congress.''      Vice Chairman Bond and I have consulted with the Senate      parliamentarian to convey our recommendations for how      referrals of notifications and reports under the section      should be made.       As we have discussed before, cybersecurity is a matter of      interest to many of the committees of the Senate. Of note is      the longstanding interest in, and jurisdiction over, cyber      matters by the Judiciary Committee. This includes but is not      necessarily limited to the cybersecurity of the Justice      Department and other departments and agencies under the      Committee's jurisdiction, privacy interests of the American      people, and legal dimensions of the government's cyber      activities. Given the Judiciary Committee's role in these      matters and the expectation that reports under Section 340      will touch on one or more of the Committee's areas of      jurisdiction, it is my strong belief that documents provided      to the Congress should be provided to the Judiciary      Committee.       In addition, should the Intelligence Committee receive      reports under this section that are within the jurisdiction      of the Judiciary Committee but that are not provided to the      Judiciary Committee, I will ensure that access to those      reports is provided to Judiciary Committee members and staff      as appropriate.       Thank you for your cooperation over this issue, and other      provisions of the intelligence legislation.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                             Select Committee on Intelligence,                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2010.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: We exchanged letters last September      about section 340 of S. 1494, the Intelligence Authorization      Act for Fiscal Year 2010. As described in the report of the      Select Committee on Intelligence, the purpose of section 340      is to establish a preliminary framework for executive and      legislative oversight to ensure that the federal government's      national cyber security mission is consistent with legal      authorities and preserves reasonable expectations of privacy.       On September 16, 2009, you placed in the Congressional      Record, at 155 Cong. Rec. S9451, my letter to you of      September 15. Because section 340 provides for various      reports or notifications to be submitted ``to the Congress,''      I wrote to convey to you my recognition of the Judiciary      Committee's long-standing interest in, and jurisdiction over,      cyber matters, and my belief that documents provided to      Congress under section 340 should be provided to the      Judiciary Committee. I also stated my commitment that should      the Intelligence Committee receive reports under section 340      that are within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee      but are not provided to it, then I will ensure your      committee's member and staff access to those documents as      appropriate.       The Intelligence Committee has now reported a second FY      2010 Intelligence Authorization, S. 3611, which is based on      the work of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and      the Administration to reconcile S. 1494 and H.R. 2701, the      House intelligence bill. Section 337 of S. 3611 is the direct      descendant of section 340 of S. 1494. The legislative history      of section 340 of S. 1494, including my letter to you of      September 15, 2009, is part of the legislative history of      section 337 of S. 3611.       The recognition I expressed of the role of the Judiciary      Committee in cyber matters, my belief in the right of the      Judiciary Committee to receive reports under section 337, and      my commitment to provide to your committee access to such      reports in the event they are provided to my committee but      not to yours, apply as much to section 337 of S. 3611 as they      applied to section 340 of S. 1494.       I look forward to working with your committee, and other      interested committees of the Senate, in establishing a strong      basis for cyber security oversight.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                               Washington, DC, September 16, 2009.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Hart          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Feinstein: Thank you for your letter today      regarding S. 1494, the Intelligence Authorization Act for      Fiscal Year 2010. I was happy to work with you to reach      agreement on the amendment you are offering to the bill to      include the Judiciary Committee as a recipient of relevant      reporting provisions and to strike a proposed FOIA exemption      and modify another FOIA provision. I appreciate your support      for those improvements.       I had my first opportunity to review this legislation when      it was hotlined on August 5. As you noted, our staffs have      been in discussions over various provisions of S. 1494 that      involve the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee and      issues on which it shares an interest with the Senate Select      Committee on Intelligence.       Our understanding also includes the commitment in your      letter to me today to ensure that the Judiciary Committee      receives reports required by Section 340, Cybersecurity      Oversight. As you know as a member and former chair of the      Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland      Security, the Judiciary Committee has long engaged in      oversight and legislative activity regarding cyber threats      and cybersecurity. You and I have long worked together in the      Judiciary Committee on these issues and I appreciate your      recognition of the shared jurisdiction and responsibilities      of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees with regard to      oversight of cyber matters and cybersecurity. I appreciate      your commitment to ensure that the Judiciary Committee will      receive reports received under the Cybersecurity Oversight      provision.       As you have described it, Section 340 is intended to      provide a preliminary framework for executive and      congressional oversight of     cybersecurity programs, as defined in the section, to ensure      that these programs are consistent with legal authorities,      preserve reasonable expectations of privacy, and are subject      to independent audit and review. Section 340 creates several      reporting requirement with regard to the executive and      congressional oversight of cybersecurity programs. These      include Presidential notifications to Congress, reports to      Congress and the President from the head of a department or      agency with responsibility for cybersecurity programs, in      conjunction with the inspector general of that department or      agency, and a joint report to Congress and the President from      the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security      and the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community on      the status of the sharing of cyber threat information within      one year.       According to the legislative language, reports under the      section are to be submitted ``to the Congress.'' As you noted      in your letter, the Judiciary Committee has a ``longstanding      interest in, and jurisdiction over'' cyber matters and cyber      security. This includes criminal activities, cybersecurity      matters handled by the Justice Department and other      departments and agencies under the Judiciary Committee's      jurisdiction, the privacy interests of the American people,      and constitutional and legal dimensions of the Government's      cyber activities, including all legal guidance. Thank you for      your willingness to work together on this issue, and the      other provisions of the intelligence legislation.       I look forward to continuing to work together with you in      the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate to ensure strong      oversight and legislation with regard to cyber matters.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,                                                         Chairman.
