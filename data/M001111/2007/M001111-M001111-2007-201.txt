 President, for the information of all Senators, we are hoping to shortly get an agreement on an amendment that will be considered, we believe, with an hour time agreement, equally divided, and a vote in about an hour from now. It is the amendment that will be offered by Senator Dorgan. I believe the minority is looking at the amendment right now. We hope to get an agreement in just a minute.  I will suggest the absence of a quorum, but Members should know that we hope to get an agreement and move to that vote in about an hour. We should know in the next several minutes.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
