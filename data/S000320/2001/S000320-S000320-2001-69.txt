 President, I rise today to introduce the ``Freedom from Behavioral Profiling Act of 2001.'' This legislation would require financial institutions to provide proper notice and obtain permission from a consumer before they could buy, sell or otherwise share an individual's behavioral profile.  Everyone recognizes the importance of insuring the accuracy and security of credit and debit card transactions. Without basic safety features, consumers would avoid non-cash transactions and our economy would greatly suffer as a result. However, financial institutions have taken their data gathering efforts far beyond what is necessary to protect consumers from fraud, inaccurate billing and theft. Companies are using transactional records generated by debit and credit card use and are developing detailed consumer profiles. From these files they know the food you eat, the drugs you must take, the places you go, and the books you read, as well as every other thing about you that can be gleaned from your buying habits.  Troubling as it is that financial institutions are assembling such profiles, I find it even more worrisome that these companies are selling and trading these intimate details without consumer knowledge or consent. In as much, ``your'' sensitive personal information has become a commodity bought and sold like some latter day widget. I believe the American people have the right to be informed of these activities and should have the option to decide for themselves whether or not their personal information is shared or sold.  I find it quite ironic that the very institutions that work so hard to secure sensitive corporate information are the same companies that work so hard to exploit the personal information of consumers. Unfortunately, it would seem that corporate America has decided that the ``Golden Rule'' is not applicable in the Information Age.  The American people are only now becoming aware of the behavioral profiling practices of the industry. The more they find out, the more they do not like it. That is why I am offering this legislation, to give the consumer the ability to control his or her most personal behavioral profile. Where they go, who they see, what they buy and when they do it, all of these are personal decisions that the majority of Americans do not want monitored and recorded under the watchful eye of corporate America.  Colleagues in the Senate, I hope you will join me in an effort to give the people what they want, the ability to control the indiscriminate sharing of their own personal, and private, consumption habits.                          ____________________
