He has been a true leader for Indian Country during his tenure on the Appropriations Committee. I think we can both be proud of the progress we have made, working together in a nonpartisan way with our friends on the other side of the aisle.  On the matter of land into trust and the Carcieri decision, I am grateful for the opportunity to work with you, as well as Chairman Bishop and Chairman Young of the Natural Resources Committee, to try to come to an agreement that would affirm land taken into trust before the Carcieri decision and would improve our understanding of how the Department of the Interior arrived at decisions to take land into trust after the Carcieri decision.  It has been over 7 years since the Carcieri decision, and tribal, municipal, and State governments continue to struggle in the aftermath. We need to bring clarity and certainty to the matter of land taken into trust on behalf of our American Indian brothers and sisters.  Mr. Cole, you have my commitment to continue to work with you and the rest of our colleagues on a solution.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Cicilline  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 114-683.
