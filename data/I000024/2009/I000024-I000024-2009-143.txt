President, I am a little confused as to where we are. I have an amendment I do want filed. It is amendment No. 1132 at the desk right now. I say to the senior Senator from Hawaii that it is essentially the same thing as the wording of an amendment he will be bringing up.  My request of the Senator--and I cleared this with the Senator from Mississippi--is that I be the first cosponsor on his amendment so that it would be the Inouye-Inhofe amendment.
