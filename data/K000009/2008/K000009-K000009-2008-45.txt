Speaker and colleagues, it is with a profound sense of sadness, as well as a deep sense of privilege that I rise this evening to commemorate and to celebrate the life of our friend, colleague, and sister, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio's 11th District. This evening, we do this with the deepest gratitude for her life, and on behalf of our entire Ohio delegation, the people of our State, her home city of Cleveland, and citizens far and wide, who were blessed to know and walk, work, worship and smile along with Stephanie.  On the day of her funeral, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, or actually it was the day after, the Sunday Plain Dealer, had a very large photo of the memorial service held in Cleveland, Ohio. And the headline read, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, 1949 to 2008: Tears flow, laughter rolls during memorial service. And the paper goes on to recount so many beautiful, beautiful remarks and remembrances that people across this country attributed to her life. We will be placing this in the Congressional Record, as well as I would like to read from my home paper, the Toledo Blade, way on the other side of the State from where Stephanie represented. It stated, a leader passes, the loss of her fighting spirit will be keenly felt, deeply mourned and difficult to replace.  I think particularly this evening of her son, Mervyn. We wish him comfort, and we wish him her strength as he mourns her passing.  We all know that when one met Stephanie, you knew you had met strength. You knew you had met someone who endured struggle. She had a keen intelligence, a high-minded idealism, and wow, her charisma just overflowed.  The other day I was in my district and I met a man from Cleveland who had gone to school with Stephanie. And I said, tell me, was Stephanie always that enthusiastic? He said, ``Marcy, I went to law school with her. She never changed.''  And from the time she was in her late teens and early 20s to her service here, she had the same boundless energy, drive and positive spirit.  She was a devoted wife, a beloved mother, a sister to us all, and an elected leader, in that order. And she relished all of her life's roles. Her drive and energy were genuine, and they were infectious. And she carved a nobler path for America with her election as the first African American woman from Ohio to serve in the U.S. Congress. We Ohioans were very proud of her.  I know that I, like my colleagues, have so many vivid lasting memories of Stephanie. Upon her first swearing in, I still recall a little table in a reception hall here where I was able to present her with a single red rose as she was sitting next to her predecessor, Congressman Louis Stokes, and how she poignantly responded. She knew the steepness of the climb.  I recall my efforts to comfort her on the loss of her husband, and she immediately reciprocated as she shared with me, over my Blackberry, a favorite poem from which she drew succor.  Imagine how many memories each of us has, how many thousands of lives she touched, representing a district and State that tested her talents, her spirit, and her conscience daily. She served people well beyond her district, logging thousands of miles in freedom's cause.  I don't think I saw Stephanie too many times without that little valise in the back room here. She was always going somewhere. She held a hard job, and she put her entire being into it. She literally gave herself to us. And in her memory, we should dedicate ourselves to her unfinished work.  One can imagine how few women have ever served in the Congress from our State. To those afforded the privilege, there is a priceless bond that links our spirits and provides support.  Stephanie was such a valued sister. Though her years with us were far too short, her impact endures well beyond the years. She made history. She spoke her conscience, and she reveled in every step of the journey.  Thanks be to God, she did not suffer in the end. The Lord spared her that, perhaps as, through her life, she had endured too much personal sadness and loss that would have broken lesser spirits.  In loss, Stephanie's strength strengthens us. Her enduring personal legacy of character and endurance, beyond her milestone achievements, remain the portrait of her life. Our delegation is especially honored to fittingly commemorate her life and achievements here this evening.             [From the Sunday Plain Dealer, Aug. 31, 2008]  Stephanie Tubbs Jones, 1949-2008: Tears Flow, Laughter Rolls During                             Memorial Service                            (By Tony Brown)       It was a moment that surely would have earned one of the      wide, knowing smiles remembered so well by all the friends of      Stephanie Tubbs Jones.       Rep. Tim Ryan of Niles, the man Tubbs Jones used to call      her ``white son,'' and fellow Congressman Kendrick Meek of      Florida, whom she nicknamed her ``black son,'' had just      finished moving tributes to their congressional ``mom.''       That's when Mervyn Jones II, her real son, slipped out of      his front-row seat to join his ``brothers'' in an intimate,      tearful embrace in front of thousands gathered to bid      farewell to the first black woman elected to Congress from      Ohio.       The three remained locked in each other's arms well into      remarks made by former Rep. Louis Stokes, the man whose seat      Tubbs Jones inherited in 1989.       After the men returned to their places, Sen. Barack Obama--     the son of a black father and a white mother who grew up to      become the first black presidential nominee of a major U.S.      political party--turned in his chair to console a still-     sobbing Meek.       In that moment, amid the grieving and the laughter and the      consolation and the stories and the campaign rhetoric of the      celebration of a life well-lived, everyone under the vaulted      ceiling of Public Hall--all friends of Tubbs Jones--shared in      that group hug.       It was a hug that encircled the woman whose body lay in a      flag-draped casket that rested on a square of red carpet in      front of the stage: Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, who died of a      burst brain aneurysm on Aug. 20 at the age of 58.       Friend was a word heard over and over as the nation's most      powerful Democratic leaders, fresh from Obama's nomination in      Denver, joined religious leaders and Tubbs Jones' beloved      constituents, family and sorority sisters in testifying to      the immensity of Tubbs Jones' spirit.       Former President Bill Clinton, not scheduled to speak but      unable to help himself, called his relationship with Tubbs      Jones ``16 years of astonishing friendship.''       So astonishing that Tubbs Jones continued to support a      failing presidential bid by his wife, Sen. Hillary Clinton,      well after many of the congresswoman's constituents had voted      for Obama.       ``She was not a fair-weather friend,'' Hillary Clinton told      the crowd.       ``I certainly know what that means. Now, her friendship was      not uncritical. When she was your friend, she felt it her      responsibility to inform you of all the matters that needed      improvement.''       Obama, Clinton's opponent for the party's presidential      nomination, also counted himself among Tubbs Jones' buddies.       ``I am here today to pay tribute to an extraordinary      American and a devoted public servant, a mother, a daughter,      a sister, a wife and a dear friend to so many here in      Cleveland, so many in Ohio and so many across America.       ``And during the most recent contest, Stephanie and I were      on different sides, and we would see each other, she would      say to me, ``This is what it means to be a friend for me.'      All I could say is, `I understand.' ''       There were more words of praise and prayer from elected      officials, some quoting Shakespeare and Scripture, during the      three-hour-and-47-minute marathon of tributes.       Speakers included Sen. Sherrod Brown, Mayor Frank Jackson,      Cuyahoga County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora, Rep. Carolyn      Kilpatrick of Michigan and Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland.       And they told plenty of funny and poignant stories.       Perhaps the funniest and most poignant was recounted by      Bill Clinton, who recalled accompanying Tubbs Jones to Puerto      Rico on a primary campaign visit for his wife.       ``Now, how Stephanie became a native Puerto Rican in 15      minutes, I'll never know,'' Clinton said, warming to his      subject.       They went into a shop, Clinton said, where Tubbs Jones      admired a piece of locally made jewelry. Clinton bought it      surreptitiously and presented it to her.       ``She looked at me and laughed and she said, `You know, I      really like this,' she says. `It's not often a man'll give a      woman a piece of jewelry and not want anything for it.' I      totally lost it.''       So did Clinton's audience. As the laughter died down, the      former president moved in for the kicker.       ``I looked at her and said, `Stephanie, you have given me      and our family more, you have given your people and this      country more than you will ever know.' ''       In addition to the eloquent politicians who were gathered,      there were plenty of just plain friends who laughed and wept      and patted each other on the back to the rhythm of hymns like      ``Amazing Grace'' and ``Canaan's Happy Shore.''       Some of the late arrivals almost didn't make it into the      funeral.       At 11:30 a.m., about 30 minutes after the service began,      Secret Service officers blocked the entrance. ``The event is      closed,'' one told approaching visitors.       Within minutes, the number lingering at the entrance grew      to more than a dozen. They spoke in shared disbelief.      ``Stephanie would not want this,'' one woman said angrily.       Someone in charge agreed. Within minutes, the officers      stepped aside. Newcomers flowed into the cavernous auditorium      until well past noon.       One of the most moving speakers the Friends of Stephanie      heard Saturday was no politician or preacher.       She was a 16-year-old named Tiffany Robertson, a member of      an all-girls health careers class at Cleveland's Martin      Luther King Jr. High School that Tubbs Jones took under her      wing two years ago.       `` `This is the future,' '' Tiffany recalled Jones telling      the girls.       The congresswoman took time from her political and      legislative schedule to visit the class and take them places.      She took them to church one Sunday, but Tiffany had to work.       So Jones dropped by the workplace with Tiffany's classmates      in tow.       ``We're family,'' Tiffany told her classmates, who stood in      a show of unity with their peer.       ``We got to stick together. We got to carry on her legacy.      She was steward, protector and advocate to us.       ``I will miss her as a friend.''       ``There's a famous song a few years back . . . and the      refrain of the song says, `If you have a choice, to sit it      out or dance, I hope you dance.' And we all know that      Stephanie didn't sit it out, she danced.''--Tim Ryan, U.S.      Representative from Ohio.       ``Stephanie was the kind of political leader who needed      hours to go grocery shopping because everyone she saw wanted      a moment of her time, and she willingly gave it. Because if      you met Stephanie, she was your friend.''--Ted Strickland,      Ohio Governor.       ``Oftentimes, late at night, on the campaign trail, whether      the news had been good or bad, she would have a look in her      eye. Sometimes she would grab my hand, and she would say,      `Oh, I miss my husband, I wish he were here.' Well, they are      together now.''--Hillary Clinton, U.S. Senator.       ``That's not the air show. The rumbling you hear is the      rearrangement of chairs in heaven.''--Dennis Eckart, Former      Representative standing outside Public Hall as a jet roared      by.       ``I considered her my congresswoman as well. We talked all      the time about statewide issues.''--Michael Coleman, Columbus      Mayor.       ``Whenever Stephanie came in contact with young people, she      inspired them, she taught them, she mentored them, she stayed      in touch with them. Her legacy is in their legacy.''--Sherrod      Brown, U.S. Senator from Ohio.       ``Whenever we talked on the phone, she would say,      `Congresswoman, I love ya.' And I'd say: `I love you, too.'      She was a great congressman. She was a good friend. Thanks,      Stephanie, I love ya.''--Louis Stokes, former U.S.      Representative from Ohio.       ``For Stephanie, it wasn't enough to rise up from modest      circumstances and break so many barriers herself. She had to      reach back and pull others through the doors she opened.''--     Barack Obama, Democratic presidential nominee.       ``I want to let you know, Cleveland, that you were      represented by one of the best . . .Ladies and gentlemen, she      lived a life that was worth living.''--Kendrick Meek, U.S.      Representative from South Carolina.       ``I'll always know her as Aunt Stephanie. She had a big      smile.''--Erin Norton, 24, of Cleveland, whose uncle lived      next to Tubbs Jones.       ``All the good things she started, it's like she's still      living.''--Schuvar Murray, 37, of Cleveland.                                  ____                    [From the Blade, Aug. 24, 2008]                            A Leader Passes       Society's' downtrodden, disadvantaged, disillusioned, and      disconnected have lost an influential voice and ally in      Washington with the unexpected passing of Stephanie Tubbs      Jones, the first black woman to represent Ohio in the U.S.      House of Representatives.       The 11th District representative from the east side of      Cleveland died Wednesday after suffering a brain hemorrhage.       The loss to Ohio and the nation was described by one of her      colleagues as ``incalculable,'' and that was an      understatement. It was a setback for the cause of      impassioned, committed, gutsy leadership, especially for the      district, made up of east Cleveland and its nearby suburbs,      which Ms. Tubbs Jones served so tirelessly.       A decade ago, the 58-year-old Democrat was handpicked by      U.S. Rep. Lou Stokes to be his successor after his legendary      stewardship of that congressional district for 30 years. Over      five terms, Mr. Stokes said, ``she took it to a higher level,      a new level. She made me so proud.''       A gregarious leader, she also blazed trails for others with      a resume of many firsts--the first black woman to become a      judge of Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, as well as the      county's first black prosecutor, succeeding the storied John      T. Corrigan.       In Washington, she was also the first black woman to sit on      the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, where she was a      force to be reckoned with. Fiercely partisan, but not      necessarily predictable, she was that unusual politician who      said what she meant and meant what she said.       In 2001, she endorsed an unknown black lawyer for Cleveland      mayor over the more politically experienced Jane Campbell,      who eventually won. This year, she perplexed--and provoked--     her constituents with her unflagging support of Hillary      Clinton for president over newcomer Barack Obama.       But her word was her bond, said the Rev. Jesse Jackson.      ``It didn't waver in the wind.'' Like all congressional      Democrats, she was scheduled to serve as a super delegate at      the Democratic National Convention in Denver next week to      witness the formal nomination of Mr. Obama as the first black      candidate for president of the United States.       Ms. Tubbs Jones, who once said she considered herself a      voice for minorities across the country, would have reveled      in the moment. The loss of her fighting spirit will be keenly      felt, deeply mourned, and difficult to replace.                              {time}  1930  Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield at this time to Congresswoman Betty Sutton from the Ohio delegation, the able Representative from Akron, Lorain.
