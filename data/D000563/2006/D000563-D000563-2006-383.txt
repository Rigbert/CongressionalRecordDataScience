This $2 million is from our projects that only we requested, that we are prepared to give up for this medical research for the soldiers. Now what is the next argument? That we don't need it, when 1,700 of our soldiers have already suffered traumatic brain injuries? We are prepared to take it out of our own projects for soldiers who are going through this kind of an injury.  Why do you still resist it?  I yield the floor.
