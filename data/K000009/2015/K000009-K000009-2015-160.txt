Speaker, I rise today to call for the immediate release of Ukrainian fighter pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who remains illegally jailed in Russia.  Ms. Savchenko was captured by Russian-directed forces in eastern Ukraine in June of 2014 and transferred to a prison in Voronezh, Russia. She is still imprisoned there today, now in her second month of a hunger strike thatdemonstrates to the world the inhumanity of her capture.  We recall the shocking footage of her interrogation in which she was handcuffed to a metal pipe, and yet we are assured by Russia she is ``being treated well.''  Why, if Russia is not invading Ukraine, as we are so often assured by Russia, should they hold Ms. Savchenko at all?  Yesterday, January 26, was Free Savchenko Day, a global, digital effort to raise awareness to her ongoing fight. The campaign shines a light on the disrespect for international law the Kremlin continues to demonstrate.  I was honored to participate in that campaign and introduce, along with our colleagues from the Ukrainian Caucus, House Resolution 50, calling to mind her struggle and demanding her immediate release.  The hunger strike began on December 13 and her health continues to deteriorate.  Mr. Speaker, Nadiya Savchenko has been a beacon for liberty. I salute her bravery in the face of overt Russian aggregation. Her courage shines like a brilliant, brilliant beacon for liberty-loving people everywhere.  God bless her, God bless America, and God bless Ukraine.                          ____________________
