 President, I would like to congratulate our new colleague, Senator Sasse. There was a good deal of suspense attached to wondering what the junior Senator from Nebraska would have to say, as he chose to wait until the end of the year and to listen and begin to study the institution. I expect most people would not have predicted that the best lesson we were to hear about what is wrong with the Senate and what needs to change would come from somebody who just got here.  I think the fact that there were so many Senators on the floor to listen was a tribute to the great work the Senator has done here and the study he has put into this institution and what needs to be done on all of our parts to make it work better.  On behalf of all of the Senate, I congratulate the junior Senator from Nebraska on an extraordinary maiden speech.
