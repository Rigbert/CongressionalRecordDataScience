       Bipartisan efforts, such as the ``Warm in Winter and Cool      in Summer Act'' (S. 3186), which would add $2.53 billion in      LIHEAP funding for FY 2008 and split this funding equitably      between the LIHEAP base formula grant and the contingency      fund, are a step in the right direction. This approach will      help ensure that States receive an equitable share of the      energy assistance.  I thank the National Governors Association. The letter was signed by Governor Granholm and Governor Rell of Connecticut. We appreciate their support.  I come from a State where the weather gets 20 below zero. In a moment, I will be talking about what some of my constituents experienced last winter and the fears they have for the coming winter and why it is absolutely imperative that we substantially increase LIHEAP funding.  What I want to do right now is read about what is going on in America today, in July and in June of 2008, in terms of the impact that high temperatures are having on some of our most vulnerable citizens, primarily the elderly.  We gathered some headlines and brief articles about events and tragedies that are occurring right now.  From the Mississippi Daily Journal:       An autopsy report confirmed a Monroe County, Mississippi,      man died as a result of heat stroke Sunday.  Later on in the article it states:       When the temperatures hit the high 90s, North Mississippi      Medical Center emergency department starts seeing more heat-     related     illnesses, particularly heat exhaustion [hospital officials      said.]  Then there is an article, which I am sure you are familiar with, which comes from the Philadelphia Inquirer. This was June 14, 2008. This was rather astounding because Philadelphia is not in the middle of the South. This is the way the article reads. It says:       The National Weather Service warned last week that the      four-day hot spell that began June 7 could be deadly--and the      projection proved all too true. As of yesterday----  This is the article on June 14--       As of yesterday, the deaths of 17 people in Philadelphia      has been linked to the heat during those four days. Most lack      air conditioning in their homes. In several cases fans and      open windows proved insufficient.  That is from the Philadelphia Inquirer. I know that is one of the reasons you are such a strong supporter and why Senator Specter is also a strong supporter.  That was in Philadelphia. In Modesto, CA, ``Heat Claims Life of Elderly Modesto, California Woman.''  In Woodland, CA, ``4 Deaths Blamed on NorCal Heat Wave.''       Last week's Northern California heat wave is being blamed      for killing at least four people.  June 12, 2008, The Capital, the newspaper in Annapolis. It reads:       An elderly man was found dead inside his stifling Orchard      Beach, Maryland home early this week, marking the first heat-     related fatality in Anne Arundel County, Maryland in three      years.  The article goes on:       Maryland recorded 21 heat-related deaths in 2007, 43 in      2006 and 47 in 2005, according to the Maryland Emergency      Management Agency. The county Health Department said Anne      Arundel had three heat-related fatalities in 2005.       ``Every summer, we see an increase in call volume related      to heat-related emergencies,'' Chief Tobia said. And      tragically, this death highlights the absolute importance of      staying cool, staying hydrated and checking in on your      neighbors.''  Arizona Republic, Phoenix, AZ, June 9, 2008. Headline: ``69 Valley Facilities Give Water, Aid to Homeless.''       Blue Swadener, a spokesman for St. Joseph the Worker, said      there were 50 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County, AZ      between May and September 2007.  On and on it goes. This is only a sampling of headlines dealing with heat-related deaths. Let me talk a little bit about what is going on in some of the northern States, especially in Vermont. A couple of months ago, I asked Vermonters to write to me telling me about their experience with high energy costs and a very tough economy. These are some of the letters I received from Vermont. A moment ago we talked about what is going on in warm weather States, when the weather becomes very hot. This is from Vermont. The first letter comes from a mother who lives in rural Vermont:       We have two small children (a baby and a toddler) and felt      fortunate to own our own house and land but due to the      increasing fuel prices we have at times had to choose between      baby food [and] diapers and heating fuel. We've run out of      heating fuel three times so far and the baby has ended up in      the hospital with pneumonia two of the times. We try to keep      the kids warm with an electric space heater on those nights,      but that just doesn't do the trick . . . Please help.  That is what we are talking about. That is why we need to increase LIHEAP so that children do not get cold and end up in the hospital or that elderly people in the southern part of this country die or end up in the hospital because of heat exhaustion.  Another letter I received from a small city in Vermont:       I am a single mother with a 9 year old boy. We lived this      past winter without any heat at all. . . . To stay warm at      night my son and I would pull off all the pillows from the      couch and pile them on the kitchen floor. I'd hang a blanket      from the kitchen doorway and we'd sleep right there on the      floor. By February we ran out of wood and I burned my      mother's dining room furniture. I have no oil for hot water.      We boil our water on the stove and pour it in the tub.  I know there are a lot of reasons to vote against anything. Please do not hold these people hostage to the ongoing energy debate we face in this country. Yes, of course, we need an energy policy. Yes, of course, what we are doing today is absurd. But there are people who will die. There are people who will end up in the hospital. There are people who get sick. There will be people who have to take money out of their medicine budget, out of their food budget to pay for heat in the winter or air-conditioning in the summer. Let us not punish those people. I know all the excuses, all of the reasons that people can give for voting no. Hold them. Don't use them tomorrow. Let the people back home know you are going to stand up for some of the most vulnerable people in this country while we work on a national energy policy.  At a time when home energy bills are soaring, what this legislation does is basically double the amount of LIHEAP funding. It fulfills what the authorization level was. That is what it does, not more than that. What it understands, as I mentioned earlier, is that while millions of people today are receiving LIHEAP funds, millions more who are eligible for the program simply are not getting into it because there is not enough funding available. What happens is, as home heating prices soar, either fewer people will be able to receive benefits or else the benefits people receive will be simply inadequate because States have to cut back. That is why the National Governors Association is supporting this legislation.  I made this point the other day, but it is worth repeating: When there is a flood, when there is a fire, and then there is a natural disaster, CNN and the other TV cameras are there. They cover it. All of us are concerned about the enormous problems facing the Midwest in terms of the flooding there. We are concerned about the terrible forest fires taking place in California. As a nation, we have to address those problems. But I ask my colleagues to understand that just because CNN is not in a house which has no heat when the weather gets 20 below zero, don't think that is not as important an issue. Do not think that suffering is not as real. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control, over 1,000 Americans from across the country died from hypothermia in their own homes, not out on the street, from 1999 to 2002, which are the latest figures we have available. They froze to death in the United States. That is why LIHEAP as a program was created, and that is why we have to expand the mission of LIHEAP to address the reality of today, that while our economy is declining, energy costs are soaring. More and more people are in need of LIHEAP.  As I mentioned earlier, this is not only a cold weather issue. Over the past decade more than 400 people died of heat exposure in Arizona, including 31 in July of 2005 alone.  Let me wrap up my remarks by thanking all of the Members of the Senate--I think there are 52 or 53 cosponsors, including 13 Republicans--for their support. I thank the AARP and the dozens and dozens of other organizations for their support. I thank the National Governors Association for their support. Every person in the Senate is a politician. We know how the system works. We know we can give any excuse under God's sky for voting no on an issue. We can vote no any time we want to. We can write a press release explaining why we are voting no. I hope tomorrow Members of the Senate will not exercise that option. I hope tomorrow Senators will not force millions of the most vulnerable people--LIHEAP is primarily for the elderly; it is for people with disabilities, for families with kids--please, do not punish those people, do not force those people to go cold or get sick or die because of heat exhaustion because of the debate we are having here right now. There is widespread support that this legislation should be passed, that funding should be substantially increased. That is what we are doing.  I hope tomorrow we can have a very significant and good vote on this important piece of legislation so the American people can see that in the midst of all of this partisanship, Members of the Senate have come together to say that no one in our country will freeze to death this winter or die of heat exhaustion.  This is an important issue. The vote is tomorrow. I look forward to widespread support from both sides of the aisle.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                               National Governors Association,                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2008.     Hon. Harry M. Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of the      nation's governors, we     write to express our support for increased funding for the      Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for fiscal      year (FY) 2008. Bipartisan efforts, such as the ``Warm in      Winter and Cool in Summer Act'' (S. 3186), which would add      $2.53 billion in LIHEAP funding for FY 2008 and split this      funding equitably between the LIHEAP base formula grant and      the contingency fund, are a step in the right direction. This      approach will help ensure that states receive an equitable      share of the energy assistance provided, which is what      Congress envisioned when it authorized the multi-tiered      formula. This kind of equity is an important goal.       Additional funding will support critically needed heating      and cooling assistance to millions of our most vulnerable      citizens, including the elderly, individuals with      disabilities and families that often have to choose between      paying their heating or cooling bills and buying food,      medicine and other essential needs. With greater financial      support, states will be better able to maintain and      potentially increase benefit levels, as well as potentially      increase outreach to eligible families in need of rising      energy cost assistance.       Governors applaud bipartisan efforts to increase funding      for heating and cooling assistance and fully support adding      $2.53 billion in LIHEAP funding for FY 2008 to help our      nation respond to existing home energy needs.           Sincerely,     Governor Jennifer Granholm,       Chair, Health and Human Services Committee.     Governor M. Jodi Rell,       Vice Chair, Health and Human Services Committee.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from Florida.
