Mr. Speaker, today is a very sad day for this House. This morning when I got up, I wanted to cry, but the tears would not come.  Before we cast this one little vote, we all should ask the question:  Is this good for America?  Is this good for the American people?  Is this good for this institution?  When I was growing up in rural Alabama during the 40s and the 50s as a young child, near a shotgun house where my aunt lived one afternoon an unbelievable storm occurred.                              {time}  1115  The wind started blowing. The rain fell on the tin top roof of this house. Lightning started flashing. The thunder started rolling. My aunt asked us all to come into this house and to hold hands, and we held hands.  As the wind continued to blow, we walked to that corner of the house, and as the wind blew stronger, we walked to another corner; as it tried to lift another corner, we would walk there. We never left the house. The wind may blow, the thunder may roll, the lightning may flash, but we must never leave the American house. We must stay together as a family: one house, one family; the American House, the American family.
