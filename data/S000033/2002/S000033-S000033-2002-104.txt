 Speaker, today, I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this spring at the University of Vermont. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.                           UNDERAGE DRINKING                             April 8, 2002       MATT ALDEN. Good morning. Thank you, Congressman Sanders,      for this opportunity. As I stand before you today, first I'd      like to share a few facts about underage drinking.       According to the 2001 Vermont Youth Risk Behavior Survey,      69 percent of Vermont students have consumed alcohol. 58      percent of Vermont seniors have had at least one alcoholic      beverage in the past month. More importantly, one-third of      our Vermont eighth-graders have consumed alcohol in the past      30 days. One out of four Vermont seniors binge-drink monthly,      meaning they have consumed more than five drinks within a      two-hour timeframe. 32 percent of Vermont seniors ride with a      driver who has been drinking. 50 percent of young adult      crashes in Vermont were alcohol-related, and half of those      who died had been drinking. According to the 1999 Vermont      Youth Risk Behavior Survey, half the Vermont seniors are      sexually active. This may not seem relevant, but one-third      had consumed alcohol before engaging in such activities.      Underaged drinking costs society $216 per man, woman and      child in America, so therefore, we are not only losing human      lives, we are also incurring more and more debt because of      this problem. And lastly, according to the Mother's Against      Drunk Driving national survey, approximately 100,000 American      deaths were alcohol-related. This is two times more than the      population of Vermont.       As you can see, Vermont really has a problem with underaged      drinking. Today I propose three solutions that will help      Vermont's problem. My first two solutions come from the      Vermont Youth Summit to Prevent Underaged Drinking. This was      the first statewide summit held in America. Myself     and 51 other students from around the state gathered in March      2000 to create three recommendations to present to the      Vermont legislature.       The two I am promoting today are, require every state ID to      have a bar code or strip that can be swiped at the checkout.      The bar codes will code your birthday and, when swiped      through the machine, will tell the cashier if the buyer was      eligible to purchase the alcohol.       The second recommendation is to have more funding for the      Stop Teen Alcohol Risk Team. This is a team of local law      enforcement which is hired just for breaking up large teenage      parties where drinking taking place. Now, our state does not      give the START team a lot of money, and no extra incentives      are offered for working into the long night hours. If the      START program had more money, the goal of having a team in      each county would be met, thus making parties not such a      common place for teens to engage in illegal consumption of      alcohol.       The last and personal recommendation to help Vermont is      that, if someone underage is drinking with a blood alcohol      content above the legal limit, their license will be revoked      until they turn 21. The legal blood-alcohol content level for      a minor is .02, about one beer for an average-weight teen. I      feel that, if a minor knows he or she will not be allowed to      drive for a long period of time, they will think before      getting into a car while intoxicated.       Now the punishment is revocation of your license for 90      days, a fine, and alcohol-treatment classes. These are good      consequences, but people that are behind the wheel, drunk,      endanger everyone they pass on the highway. If a license was      taken away for a long period of time, they would realize the      importance of staying sober behind the wheel.       I know these solutions will not bring underage drinking to      a cease, but I believe, if it saves one person, it makes a      difference.       Thank you, again, Mr. Sanders, for your time and this      opportunity.                         PEN PALS WITH PAKISTAN                             April 8, 2002       BETHANY WALLACE: I'm Bethany Wallace, and what we're      talking about today is the pen pal program with Pakistan that      our school has, in conjunction with Sara Siad from Bennington      College, has established, and I guess what our hopes are is      that, eventually, a program like this will be established,      perhaps, statewide, and eventually nationwide.       The pen-pal program, we have sent two letters already and      gotten one in return. Sara Siad is a student at Bennington      College, and she is from Pakistan. I think she lives in      Karachi, which is the most modern city in Pakistan, and it's      kind like the metropolitan New York of Pakistan. And she has      worked in a lot of public schools there and seen an interest      that Pakistani students and young people have in American      culture, much like we have in Pakistani culture.       What she did was to establish the pen-pal program, and we      all wrote letters, and then she translated them and brought      them to Pakistan when she went back on Christmas vacation.      The students over there then wrote their letters, and she      brought them back to us, and that is how it has been kind of      working.       What it has done is opened a lot of doors to better      understand the Pakistani culture, especially when our image      of that culture has been so skewed by the media in light of      September 11th.       KERRY McINTOSH: It is just interesting, in the letters, we      see their perspective on things, but we also see how we are      more similar to the people in Pakistan than we would have      assumed. Like lots of us, there are just lots of different      assumptions we have about people in Pakistan and what their      views would be or something, and then they write in the      letters, and it seems like, wow, they're really a lot like      us.       I have two letters here. One of them is in Urdu, which is      the native language of Pakistan. But, as Sara has told us,      they also speak English fluently. And another wrote me a      letter in English. I will read an excerpt. Like, when she      talks about September 11th, she says. Like, first, just says,      hello and, like, greets me and tells me a little bit about      herself.       And now let's talk a little about the 11th of September.      First of all, I want to commiserate you. It was really a      shocking news. I know how hurt it must be for the people to      bear the loss of their dear and near ones. It was a real      horrible act of terrorism. While talking about terrorism, I      do agree with the U.S. approach. But had Afghanistan handed      over the culprit, it would have been much better.       You know, our President, Musharraf, was really in a bad      position. It was really tough for him, whether or not to help      the U.S., because some of the people in Pakistan were against      the U.S. But the majority of the Pakistani population      supported Mr. Musharraf's decision. But, you know, war isn't      an alternative for peace. I really wish the world was a      better place to live in.       I think I mentioned something political in the letter that      I had written to her first, assuming that--like, not in a bad      way, but just assuming that she would be a little more      critical of the U.S., but then I found out that she really,      like, was supportive, and that it is just like, a minority in      Pakistan that is eminently anti-American people like we see      protesting on the streets, and that they share our concerns      and hopes for world peace.       ERICA HOLLNER. Like Kerry was saying, the main thing I      think we are getting out of this is a better understanding of      Pakistan, because we have these views that are so      stereotypical, and we see--on TV and magazines, we see these      poor people and see the refugee camps, and we think that the      whole country is like that. But, in realty, a lot of the      families that we are exchanging letters with are similar to      us, and they're not poor, they have enough money to live      comfortably, and it's a lot like the U.S. in a lot of ways,      but we always think that it's all the same.       And Just that, they like the same kinds of things as we do.      And I remember reading one letter that a girl was very      interested in Princess Di, and you don't think of the fact      that they think of the same things as we do, and they know      about a lot of the same things too.       KATIE KERVORKIAN. We think that the program would be a      great way to teach tolerance, just so that other people can      understand what goes on, because many people don't know what      is going on in the subcontinental countries, the Middle East.      And to learn from someone that is our own age is different      than learning from magazine or TV.       BETHANY WALLACE. And what Sarah has pointed out is that      nothing is realty off limits in the letters. If we bring it      up first, then our pen pals aren't, you know, squeamish about      talking about it, about communicating their views, and it is      a great tool to better understand what is going on over      there.                               ____________________
