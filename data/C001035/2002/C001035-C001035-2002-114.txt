President, today I join Senators Wellstone, Kennedy, DeWine, and Bayh in introducing the National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act. This legislation would authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to oversee the creation of a secure web site that would link every domestic violence shelter and service provider in the United States and the National Domestic Violence Hotline.  The objective is to enable victims of domestic violence and their families who are seeking safety from abuse to more quickly and easily find the shelter and other services they so desperately need. The secure and confidential web site would keep a continuously updated, nationwide list of available shelter and services, such as transportation and children's services, for victims of domestic violence and their families.  Once the web site is operational, whenever a woman calls the Hotline, a shelter or other domestic violence project, the operator can immediately check the site and get an up-to-date listing of available shelters and services around the country. With a single phone call, a victim of domestic violence and her family can be placed in the most appropriate shelter to meet their needs or more quickly obtain the other services that will enable them to escape a dangerous situation.  Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women in the United States. In this country, a woman is battered every 15 seconds. It is estimated that one in five women admitted to emergency rooms is there due to battering. Almost one-third of the American women murdered each year are killed by their current or former partners, usually a husband. In the State of Maine, the overall crime rate dropped by 12 percent in 2000, but domestic violence reports increased by 12.5 percent. It is the leading cause of murder in Maine, resulting in over half the state's homicides.  Even when children aren't the target of family violence, those who witness abuse in their homes do not escape unscathed. Tragically, they too are victims, with effects that can include physical, psychological and behavioral problems. Moreover, many of the millions of children who suffer or witness abuse in their homes grow up to perpetuate the legacy of family violence. A report by the American Psychological Association found that a ``child's exposure to the father abusing the mother is the strongest risk for transmitting violent behavior from one generation to the next.''  According to one estimate by the American Medical Association, domestic violence costs the nation from $5 to $10 billion annually in medical expenses, police and court costs, shelters and foster care, sick leave, absenteeism, and nonproductivity. Add the untold costs in suffering and destroyed lives caused by domestic abuse, and the need to more effectively intervene and break the cycle of violence becomes even more compelling.  Information technology has improved many aspects of our lives in recent years, and it is time we used advances in technology to help victims and break the cycle of domestic violence. The National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act will do just that by more effectively helping women and children escape unsafe and violent situations.  To achieve the goal of linking the National Domestic Violence Hotline and every domestic violence shelter and service provider on an electronic network, the legislation authorizes the use of funds to provide Internet access and training to shelters that currently do not have the necessary technology. This is a critical element of the bill because only 43 percent of shelters in the United States have Internet access, leaving over half of all shelters without services that many of us now take for granted.  The National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act would create a national domestic violence website and secure network, and it will give service providers the tools to both contribute to and benefit from that network. By doing so, the bill would help ensure that hundreds of thousands of women and children in need of help to escape violence will find the safety and well-being they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
