 President, earlier today, my colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, asked that his substitute be printed again in the Record. Much has been said about this substitute amendment. The claim is made that this substitute will protect safety while complying with NAFTA. That is just plain wrong. This claim is indicative of the problem we have had in these negotiations--the fact that our opponents define compliance with NAFTA as gutting the safety provisions in our bill.  Lets look at the specifics of the McCain-Gramm substitute.  The McCain-Gramm amendment is a legislative sleight of hand intended to take the teeth out of the safety provisions that were approved unanimously by the Appropriations Committee.  They create loopholes large enough to drive a Mexican truck through.  Their amendment looks and sounds very much like the committee-adopted provisions when, in fact, the amendment weakens the committee-adopted provisions in several critical and dangerous ways.  First, the McCain-Gramm amendment completely does away with the requirement that all Mexican trucking companies undergo a thorough compliance review before they are given authority to operate in the United States. Instead of that requirement, the McCain-Gramm amendment substitutes a cursory ``safety review''.  A safety review is a much comprehensive review of a trucking company's operations. It is a quick and dirty paper check. It is not a thorough examination to ensure that a trucking company complies with all U.S. safety standards. It does not approach a compliance review in terms of ensuring that a trucking firm's operations are safe.  My colleagues should not be fooled. A safety review and a compliance review are not the same thing. They are twovery different things. A safety review should provide the American public with a whole lot less comfort than a compliance review when it comes to the operations of Mexican trucking firms.  Second, the McCain-Gramm amendment completely does away with the requirement that compliance reviews be performed on site at each trucking firm's facility. Every time a U.S. Motor Carrier Safety Inspector performs a compliance review on a U.S. trucking firm, it is done at the trucking firm's facility. Every time a U.S. Motor Carrier Safety Inspector performs a compliance review on a Canadian trucking firm, it is done at the Canadian trucking firm's facility. Now when it comes to Mexico, the McCain-Gramm amendment wants to allow compliance reviews to be conducted at the border. This is a farce.  A compliance review, by definition, requires the inspector to carefully review the trucking firm's vehicles, record books, log books, wage and hour records, and much, much more. You can't perform a compliance review at a remote site. It is not even a poor substitute.  There is a long list of abuses that can result if inspectors never visit a trucking company's facility. For the life of me, I can not imagine why the sponsors of the McCain-Gramm amendment want to allow those potential abuses on the part of Mexican trucking firms while insisting that every compliance review here in the United States and in Canada is performed on site.  Third, the McCain-Gramm amendment waives the requirement that the DOT publish critical safety rules before allowing trucks across the border. The McCain-Gramm amendment would allow the requirement to be waived by the Secretary by simply signing a letter stating that he will not publish these rules and sending it to Congress.  The provision unanimously adopted by the Appropriations Committee requires that critically important safety rules must be completed by the DOT before the border can be opened. These rules were not randomly selected. The rules that we require to be published before the border can be opened are targeted at the specific safety concerns surrounding Mexican trucks.  The McCain-Gramm amendment pretends to mandate that these rules go forward but simultaneously includes a provision that guts the same requirement. My colleagues--don't be fooled, the requirement in the McCain-Gramm amendment is a phony one that severely weakens the measures included in the committee-adopted provision.  Fourth, the McCain-Gramm amendment does away with the requirement that the inspector general certify that critical safety measures are in place before the border is opened.  Instead of requiring that the inspector general certify that it is safe at the border, the McCain-Gramm amendment simply requires that the Secretary of Transportation periodically submit reports to the committee on the state of problems at the border.  This is a monstrous loophole. It creates more and more paperwork in Washington while the Mexican trucks come streaming across our border. It completely guts a number of the critical requirements in the underlying committee provision.  The Committee on Appropriations receives a great many mandated reports by the Department of Transportation. Unfortunately, the record of the Department of Transportation in submitting reports to the committee is a poor one.  As of this date, the Department of Transportation is overdue in submitting more than 22 reports to our committee from five different agencies within the Department of Transportation. Some of the deadlines of these reports date as far back as December 1995.  This provision, frankly, is an insult. What our highway safety agenda needs is not more reports, it needs real improvements in the safety of the vehicles and drivers moving 18-wheelers across our country.  That observation is not only applicable to Mexican drivers, it is applicable to United States drivers and Canadian drivers as well. All the reports in the world are not going to improve the condition of highway safety in the United States.  What we need are firm mandates like those adopted by the Appropriations Committee to ensure that critical safety measures are in place before we face an influx of Mexican trucks that we are not ready for.  The provisions in the committee bill must not be watered down. The committee provisions won't stop trade across our border. But they will stop unsafe drivers and unsafe trucks from threatening the American public. These provisions must not be weakened.  Under our bill, when you are driving on the highway and there's an 18-wheeler with a Mexican license plate in front of you, you can feel safe.  You will know that the truck was inspected.  You will know that the company has a good track record.  You will know that an American inspector visited their facility--on site--and examined their records--just like we do with Canadian trucking firms.  You will know that the driver is licensed and insured.  You will know that the truck was weighed and is safe for our roads and bridges.  You will know that we're keeping track of which companies and which drivers are following our laws and which ones are not.  You will know that, if a driver is breaking our laws, his license will be revoked.  You will know that the truck didn't just cross our border unchecked, but crossed where there were inspectors on duty--ensuring our safety.  That is a real safety program. That program must not be watered down, weakened, or gutted, as is proposed by the McCain-Gramm amendment.  Mr. President, the committee bill is a solid compromise. It will allow robust trade--while ensuring the safety of our highways. I urge all Members to reject this effort to weaken the committee bill and endanger lives on our highways.                     woodrow wilson memorial bridge
