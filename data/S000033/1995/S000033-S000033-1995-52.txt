 Chairman, obviously, all of that is not working. Twenty years ago, as the gentleman knows, this country led the world in terms of the wages and benefits our workers received. With all of that genius, with all of that so-called worker-management cooperation, does the gentleman know what place our workers are now in the industrialized world? We are in 13th place. We are falling behind much of Europe and Scandinavia.  I would argue that if there is any reason that workers have enjoyed decent benefits, decent working conditions, and decent workers in this country, it is because they have had unions. The evidence is pretty clear that this team effort will make it harder for workers to join unions.
