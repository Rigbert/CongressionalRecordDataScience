If we do not allow a complete and full investigation, a split is inevitable. If a decision is made to protect this administration at any level at the expense of the credibility of this investigation, we are not serving the American people well.  Senator Rockefeller has tried time and time again to convince the chairman, the Republican chairman of this committee, that we need a complete investigation. He said repeatedly to Senator Rockefeller, I have been led to believe, what he said on the floor this morning: We are going to draw the line. We will not look into the use of intelligence.  That, sadly, I think, is the reason we are here today and tied in this political knot. It is time for an independent commission.  I yield the floor.
