President, S. 888, the Genocide Accountability Act, is the first legislation produced by the Senate Judiciary Committee's new Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, which I chair. It is bipartisan legislation that I introduced with Senator Tom Coburn, ranking member of the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee, Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator John Cornyn.  The Genocide Accountability Act would close a legal loophole that prevents the U.S. Justice Department from prosecuting individuals who have committed genocide. Under current law, genocide is only a crime if it is committed within the United States or by a U.S. national outside the United States. The Genocide Accountability Act would amend 18 U.S.C. 1091, the Genocide Convention Implementation Act, to allow prosecution of non-U.S. nationals who are brought into or found in the United States for genocide committed outside the United States.  I recently received a letter from David Scheffer, U.S. Ambassador at Large for War Crimes from 1997 to 2001, which makes clear the impact that the Genocide Accountability Act could have. Ambassador Scheffer's letter explains that the loophole in our genocide law hindered the U.S. Government's efforts to secure the apprehension and prosecution of former Cambodian dictator Pol Pot, one of the worst war criminals of the 20th century. If the Genocide Accountability Act had been law when Pol Pot was alive and at large, maybe the United States would have been able to bring him to justice.  The Genocide Accountability Act recently passed the Senate unanimously. I am hopeful that in short order the House of Representatives will pass it and the President will sign it into law.  The United States should have the ability to bring to justice individuals who commit genocide, regardless of where their crime takes place and regardless of whether they are a U.S. national. The Genocide Accountability Act would end this immunity gap in U.S. law.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Ambassador Scheffer's letter to which I referred printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was to be printed in the Record as follows:                                          Center for International                                                 Human Rights,                                                    April 6, 2007.     Re lost opportunities to achieve international justice.     Senator Richard Durbin,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, Committee          on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: you have asked me to recount how      limitations in U.S. federal law during the 1990's prevented      the Clinton Administration, in which I served as U.S.      Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues (1997-2001), from      ensuring the speedy apprehension and prosecution of the      former Cambodian leader, Pol Pot, on charges of genocide,      crimes against humanity, or war crimes (``atrocity crimes'')      prior to his death in March 1998. Because such limitations in      U.S. law remain, particularly with respect to the crime of      genocide, it may be useful for Members of Congress to      consider how historically devastating was this lost      opportunity to achieve some measure of justice for the deaths      of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians under Pol Pot's rule      from 1975 to 1979.       In June 1997 the then two co-prime ministers of Cambodia,      Hun Sen and Norodom Ranariddh, sent a letter to the      Secretary-General of the United Nations seeking assistance to      establish an international criminal tribunal that would      render justice to the senior Khmer Rouge leaders, none of      whom had been prosecuted with the sole exception of a highly      dubious in absentia trial of Pol Pot and his foreign      minister, Ieng Sary, in a Cambodia in 1979 shortly after the      fall of the Khmer Rouge regime. The jointly-signed letter in      June 1997 opened two pathways of action by the Clinton      Administration: the first continues to this day, namely how      to investigate and prosecute surviving senior Khmer Rouge      leaders and bring them to justice before a credible court of      proper jurisdiction; the second interrelated issue dealt with      effective measures to apprehend and hold suspects in custody      until they could be brought to trial.       Since no international criminal tribunal existed in 1997      that was specially designed to     investigate and prosecute senior Khmer Rouge leaders and      because the judicial and political situations within Cambodia      did not favor domestic prosecution at that time, we began in      late June 1997 to examine options for prosecution of Pol Pot      and his leadership colleagues before a yet-to-be-created      international tribunal or before either U.S. federal      courts or foreign domestic courts. We were receiving      signals that Pol Pot, who had been in hiding since his      fall from power in 1979, might be located and in a      position either to be captured or to surrender in a manner      that would facilitate his transfer to a court of competent      jurisdiction.       Among all the options we examined at the time, the most      desirable was the establishment of an international criminal      tribunal by authorization of the U.N. Security Council acting      under U.N. Charter Chapter VII enforcement authority. This      was the means by which the International Criminal Tribunals      for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda were created. I pursued      that option until the summer of 1999, when various factors      made it unrealistic and required a change of strategy that      ultimately resulted in the creation of a hybrid domestic      court in Cambodia called the Extraordinary Chambers in the      Courts of Cambodia. But because, beginning in mid-1997, we      began to experience episodes where the prospects of capturing      Pol Pot (and later one of his top officials, Ta Mok), were      quite high, I needed to find a jurisdiction (U.S. or foreign)      which would receive Pol Pot and hold him until the      international criminal tribunal could be created and then he      could be transferred to the jurisdiction of that tribunal. If      we chose or were compelled (by virtue of no foreign country      accepting Pol Pot) to transfer Pol Pot to U.S. territory, we      had to be prepared to prosecute him before a U.S. court in      the event the U.N. Security Council failed to create an      international criminal tribunal with jurisdiction to      prosecute senior Khmer Rouge leaders.       But Pol Pot was not a natural candidate for a genocide      prosecution before any U.S. court. Under 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 1091(d) (1999), only an American citizen who is charged      with committing genocide anywhere in the world or anyone      (including an alien) who commits genocide in the United      States can be prosecuted. This seemed incredulous to me at      the time, given the prima facie case against Pol Pot for      atrocity crimes, including genocide, and this rare      opportunity to capture and bring him to justice. Instead of      stepping forward immediately and making U.S. courts available      to prosecute this notorious individual, I had to wade into a      thicket of diplomacy to try to find a willing government      somewhere who would accept Pol Pot (if captured) and either      detain him until an international criminal tribunal was      created or prosecute him in its own courts.       Nonetheless, efforts were made by the Justice Department      (beginning in late June 1977) to explore options under U.S.      law for a possible prosecution of Pol Pot if he were captured      and brought to U.S. territory. Initially, attention focused      on whether any U.S. official personnel were victims of the      atrocity crimes of the Pol Pot regime. The roster of federal      agencies from which personnel could be identified for this      purpose was set forth in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1114. The Central      Intelligence Agency was not listed in that roster of      agencies. U.S. courts would have had jurisdiction over a      crime committed (in this situation, in Cambodia) against U.S.      personnel from one of the designated agencies in Section      1114. However, no such individual could be identified by the      Justice Department. Therefore, we lost our best opportunity      for jurisdiction for the reason that, according to the      Justice Department research, no U.S. government personnel (at      least from the agencies identified in Section 1114) lost      their lives under the Pol Pot regime. There were American      citizens who died in Cambodia during the relevant period      (1975-1979) of Pol Pot's rule, but they did not qualify      under U.S. law at the time as triggering federal      jurisdiction.       There was a second rational for prosecution of Pol Pot      which arose in March 1998 when we were very close to      achieving apprehension of Pol Pot and flying him out of      Cambodia or Thailand to U.S. territory. Justice Department      officials put forward a theory called the ex post facto      limitation analysis. It was a high risk gamble in federal      court that rested, essentially, as I recall, on applying the      customary law principles codified in the Convention on the      Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the      Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or      Degrading Treatment or Punishment to the events that      transpired in Cambodia in the late 1970's, and joining those      principles with the President's broad authority under the      foreign affairs powers of the U.S. Constitution. One must      remember that the Genocide Convention Implementation Act of      1988 (the Proxmire Act) was not adopted until 1988 and thus      acts of genocide committed during the late 1970's would not      have qualified in any event for U.S. prosecution even if the      standard grounds for personal or territorial jurisdiction      under the law were satisfied. The Justice Department      officials warned that there was no assurance whatsoever that      a federal court would be persuaded by the ex post facto      limitation analysis and if the judicial effort failed, then      Pol Pot might walk away free from U.S. detention and onto      U.S. territory. Ultimately, by September 1998, the Attorney      General signaled her unwillingness to attempt prosecution if      Pol Pot were brought to U.S. territory for any period other      than a very temporary stay (see below).       Of comparable concern to my Justice colleagues in 1997,      1998, and 1999 when either Pol Pot or Ta Mok or other senior      Khmer Rouge leaders were within our sights for apprehension      or surrender in Cambodia, was how to defeat a habeas corpus      petition by any one of them if they were detained on U.S.      territory or held by U.S. authorities on foreign territory.      That concern meant that Justice needed to be confident there      was enough evidence on the detainee to make a prima facie      case against him or at least provide sufficient documentation      to the court to ensure that the habeas petition would be      defeated. Although this concern was relevant for Pol Pot, it      became extremely significant with respect to other senior      Khmer Rouge leaders (such as Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary, Ta      Mok, Nuon Chea, and others) for whom the evidence had not yet      been collected to a degree and in a manner that satisfied the      Justice officials.       In response to this concern, the Justice Department      deployed lawyers to Yale University in New Haven, where      documents from the Pol Pot era were being stored, and      ultimately to the Documentation Center for Cambodia in Phnom      Penh, to examine documents that might implicate senior Khmer      Rouge leaders. I seem to recall that those research efforts      left the lawyers still concerned about whether a federal      court would dismiss a habeas challenge from any one of the      senior Khmer Rouge leaders.       These were critical arguments to factor into the overall      strategy. Justice officials advised that they would not want      to hold Pol Pot or his colleagues on U.S. territory for more      than about ten days if there was no likelihood of bringing      them to trial before a federal court. They also could not      rationalize any perpetual detention that would      unquestionably survive a habeas challenge. If we were not      prepared to prosecute the senior Khmer Rouge leaders in      federal court, including under the high-risk strategy of      ex post facto limitation analysis, then any detention on      U.S. territory must be exceptionally temporary (no more      than ten days), thus essentially serving as a way-station      to a confirmed onward destination (namely, a foreign      national court or an international criminal tribunal).       These significant concerns, prompted by the absence of a      genocide law that had jurisdiction over Pol Pot and senior      Khmer Rouge leaders and by concerns over habeas corpus      challenges in the federal courts, pointed us to a detention      strategy that stood a much better chance of defeating, if not      avoiding, a habeas challenge and ultimately using a      jursdiction (national or international) willing to prosecute      these individuals.       When the net was closing in on Pol Pot in March 1998, we      arranged with Palau that it serve as a likely destination for      Pol Pot, who would be flown there by U.S. aircraft with the      permission of the Government of Palau and the Government of      Cambodia. U.S. Marshalls would guard Pol Pot until a suitable      jurisdiction could be found for his trial (and we knew that      might take some time). After Pol Pot's sudden and untimely      (not to mention mysterious) death in Cambodia in late March      1998, we focused on using Palau as a detention site for any      other senior Khmer Rouge leaders who could be apprehended      and, with the permission of the Government of Cambodia,      transported out of Cambodia (or Thailand if anyone of them      had crossed the border during a chase) to Palau to await a      final destination for trial. But the dynamics of custody      evolved following Pol Pot's death. Arrangements for potential      detention on Palau were finalized and by August and September      1998, the internal argument prevailed that any custody on      Palau should be joint custody by Cambodian and American      guards, undertaken at the request of the Cambodian      Government, and preferably (though it was not essential)      achieved even at the request of the detainee. At that point,      we knew that most potential detainees (senior Khmer Rouge      leaders) did not wish to be incarcerated in Cambodia. Indeed,      we knew that shortly bcfore his death Pol Pot had reportedly      told journalist Nate Thayer that he was prepared to go to the      United States to face justice. We also knew by September 1998      that Ta Mok was not willing to surrender for a trial in      Cambodia, but we wondered whether that was a signal that he      might agree to stand trial outside of Cambodia.       The joint custody arrangement on Palau, especially if it      could be supplemented by the request of the detainee himself,      could greatly strengthen the Justice Department's case in the      event of a habeas corpus challenge to federal court by anyone      of the detainees that might be held in Palau. Even though      Palau was by then an independent nation, its former U.S.      territorial status and the fact of U.S. custody on Palau      raised enough concerns that the shield of joint Cambodian-     American custody, the request of the Government of Cambodia,      and the approval of the Government of Palau all combined to      reassure us of the viability of a Palau detention site. One      indeed was created; U.S. Marshalls were deployed in      anticipation of arrivals of captured senior Khmer Rouge      leaders; and even the U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, who      included Palau in his portfolio, at one point stood ready at      the site to receive the suspects. I need to      emphasize, however, that Palau was seen strictly as a      relatively temporary detention site until a proper and      willing national jurisdiction could be found or, with the      possibility of an international criminal tribunal, created      for     purposes of investigating and prosecuting these      individuals. But we had no expectation of it taking more      than several months to find suitable jurisdiction      (particularly given the high-profile reality of Pol Pot      finally in custody and our hope that having him in custody      would spur Security Council interest in finding a means to      prosecute him).       As it turned out, not a single senior Khmer Rouge leader      was ever captured with the assistance of U.S. authorities.      The cooperation of the Cambodian Government for detention of      suspects at Palau collapsed by early 1999. The plan would      have been activated if our efforts to capture Pol Pot had not      been scuttled by his sudden death in late March 1998. Our      vigorous efforts to capture Ta Mok (or secure his surrender)      during the rest of 1998 and into early 1999 finally were      overtaken when he was captured by Cambodian forces and      detained in Phnom Penh. Other senior Khmer Rouge leaders      surrendered under arrangements that kept them out of prison      in Cambodia, with the exception of Kang Kek Ieu (alias      Comrade Duch), the chief of the notorious Tuol Sleng prison,      who remains imprisoned to this day by Cambodian authorities      in Phnom Penh. So the habeas corpus concerns never were      tested even under the remote circumstances that would have      been presented with a joint custody arrangement in Palau.       The other story in this saga concerns my efforts to find      the alternative jurisdiction before which Pol Pot and his      colleagues could be held until transferred to a newly      established international criminal tribunal or prosecuted for      genocide and other atrocity crimes. In all of these efforts,      which I will describe briefly, the fact that the United      States was incapable of prosecuting the crime of genocide      against Pol Pot and the senior Khmer Rouge leaders was      diplomatically crippling. It forced me to concede that the      United States had not stepped up to the plate itself with      some reasonable application of universal jurisdiction for      genocide. How could I credibly persuade other governments to      stretch their domestic law to prosecute Pol Pot et al. when      the United States was not prepared to do so (and had as much      if not more reason to try to do so in the case of Cambodia      than, say, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, or Spain). If the United      States had had the legal tools wit which to prosecute Pol      Pot, but was hampered for some political or logistical      reason, at least then I could have argued with credibility      that a foreign government also has the responsibility to step      forward and bring this man to justice. So I was dealt a very      weak hand.       I pursued two tracks of diplomatic strategy to find a      jurisdiction willing and able to prosecute Pol Pot and the      senior Khmer Rouge leaders. Both tracks were launched      immediately in June 1997 when the first opportunity arose to      apprehend Pol Pot. The first track was to approach countries      either with some capability in their domestic criminal codes      to exercise a form of universal jurisdiction over genocide      and/or crimes against humanity or (we thought) might be      willing to find an innovative way to prosecute Pol Pot. These      countries at first included Canada and Denmark and later, in      April 1998, expanded to include Germany, Spain, Norway,      Sweden, Australia, and Israel. Each one of them declined the      opportunity I presented to receive Pol Pot for trial in the      event the United States Government arranged for his capture      and then transport to such country. Each one also declined      the opportunity to hold Pol Pot temporarily until a      suitable national court or international criminal tribunal      could be found or created for the purpose of prosecuting      Pol Pot and other senior Khmer Rouge leaders.       The second track of diplomatic strategy was to persuade      U.N. Security Council members to join us in approving the      establishment of an international criminal tribunal to      investigate and prosecute the senior Khmer Rouge leaders      (including Pol Pot while he was still alive). This proposal      went through various stages of evolution, and included plans      for sharing certain functions, such as the prosecutor and the      appeals chamber, with the International Criminal Tribunal for      the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In late April and early May of      1998 I worked closely with the U.S. Mission to the United      Nations to formally present a draft resolution, with a draft      statute for the tribunal appended, to other Security Council      members for their consideration. Concerns by other members      arose as to germaneness for the Council (i.e., whether there      still existed a threat to international peace and security in      Cambodia that would trigger Security Council jurisdiction),      whether the ICTY's jurisdiction (or perhaps that of the      International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda) should be      expanded, whether the Government of Cambodia would formally      request such a tribunal (which one permanent member      considered essential), and how the cost would be borne. China      and Russia, in particular, balked at the proposal and refused      to indicate any support whatsoever. Tribunal fatigue on the      Security Council also took hold to slow down the Cambodia      option. Another key factor was the advent of the permanent      International Criminal Court and concerns that an initiative      on Cambodia would shift attention and resources away from      that key priority for many of the Security Council members      (permanent and non-permanent).       Without any leverage to threaten U.S. prosecution in the      absence of an international criminal tribunal, I could only      press the merits of the issue as hard as possible, knowing      that achieving international justice for the atrocity crimes      of the Pol Pot regime was not a high priority for most other      governments. Indeed, for some it may have been viewed as a      threat to their own national interests. I would have      benefited, however, if at key junctures in the negotiations      over an international criminal tribunal I could have asked      whether our colleagues on the Security Council would be more      comfortable with a U.S. federal court examining the evidence      or would they find more palatable a tribunal of international      composition investigating Pol Pot's deeds. I never had the      opportunity to offer that choice in my talks.       By August 1999 I had exhausted my final efforts to achieve      a Security Council international criminal tribunal with both      the Government of Cambodia and with other Security Council      members. At that point the Clinton Administration shifted its      focus to creating a hybrid court in Cambodia and intensive      efforts led by late 2000 to what became the Extraordinary      Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, approved initially by the      Cambodian National Assembly in early 2001. But by August 1999      the prospect of looking to the United States as a plausible      jurisdiction for prosecution of genocide in Cambodia already      had become a distant memory.       In conclusion, I would stress that the inability of U.S.      courts to prosecute Pol Pot and the senior Khmer Rouge      leaders contributed to significant delays in bringing these      individuals to justice, delays that reverberate to this day      as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia      struggle to overcome one obstacle after another before      proceeding to indictments and trials. Several key suspects      died before they could be brought to trial, including Pol      Pot, Ke Pauk, and Ta Mok. Their fates--dead before justice      could be rendered--did not necessarily have to become the      historical record. We could have moved much faster and more      decisively in 1997 and 1998 to secure their custody, ensure      proper medical care, and bring them before a court of either      national or international jurisdiction if the reality of U.S.      jurisdiction for at least the crime of genocide had existed.      If we seek to influence others to prosecute the crime of      genocide, and if we aspire to arming our diplomats with the      arguments they need to influence other governments to accept      their responsibilities for international justice, we must be      able to demonstrate that our courts have, within reasonable      parameters, the jurisdiction to prosecute the crime of      genocide. Even if such jurisdiction may rest upon the      discretion of, say, the Attorney General under certain      extreme circumstances, we must be able to use it for the      worthy purpose of credible justice.       During the final negotiations for the Rome Statute of the      International Criminal Court in July 1998, I presented the      U.S. position that with respect to the crime of genocide, the      International Criminal Court should exercise universal      jurisdiction. That U.S. position in the negotiations was      partly influenced by our unfortunate experience with Pol Pot      months earlier.       I would hope that given all of this experience-stretching      back to the Holocaust and even earlier, and given the logic      that must apply to ending the crime of genocide, U.S. law at      long last could reflect the illegality of genocide committed      by anyone anywhere in the world and the ability of our courts      to prosecute the perpetrators of genocide, including when      they are non-citizens who stand on U.S. soil.           Respectfully,                                                   David Scheffer,         Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw/Robert A. Helman Professor of            Law, Director, Center for International Human Rights,            Northwestern University School of Law.                          ____________________
