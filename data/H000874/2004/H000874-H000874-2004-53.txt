Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would partially agree with my friend, the leader, which is better than most times. I would partially agree that the problem is not in this House; but it is my observation that the problem is in another house, not the other side of the aisle.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, is there a particular color of that house?
