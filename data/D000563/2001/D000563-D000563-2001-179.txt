I think all of us have been transformed by the experience and transformed by some of our fellow Americans and what they have said and what they have done.  Some of the things that have been written are extraordinary. In just one moment, I am going to submit for the Record one that I think is exceptional, a piece from the BusinessWeek magazine of October 1, 2001, by a writer named Bruce Nussbaum entitled, ``Real Masters Of The Universe.'' I will not read the entire article, but I will submit it for the Record. I would like to quote a few sentences from it. He said some things with which I agree and I think help to put our experience into some perspective:       A subtle shift in the American zeitgeist took place on      Sept. 11. It's hard to define, and it may not last. But on      the day of the World Trade Center cataclysm, the country      changed. Big, beefy working-class guys became heroes once      again, replacing the telegenic financial analysts and techno-     billionaires who once had held the Nation in thrall. Uniforms      and public service became ``in.'' Real sacrifice and real      courage were on graphic display.       Maybe it was the class reversals that were so revealing.      Men and women making 40 grand a year working for the city      responding--risking their own lives--to save investment      bankers and traders making 10 times that amount. And dying by      the hundreds for their effort. The image of self-sacrifice by      civil servants in uniform was simply breathtaking.       For Americans conditioned in the '90s to think of oneself      first, to be rich above all else, to accumulate all the good      material things, to take safety and security for granted,      this was a new reality. So was the contrast of genuine      bravery to the faux values of reality TV shows such as      Survivor.  He concludes:       Tragedy has the power to transform us. But rarely is the      transformation permanent. People and societies revert back to      the norm. But what is the ``norm'' for America? Where are      this nation's true values? Have we stripped too much away in      recent years in order to make us lean and mean for the race      to riches? It is hard to look at the images of the World      Trade Center rescue again and again. At least once, however,      we should look at what the rescuers are teaching us, about      what matters--and who.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From Business Week, Oct. 1, 2001]                      Real Masters of the Universe                          (By Bruce Nussbaum)       A subtle shift in the American zeitgeist took place on      Sept. 11. It's hard to define, and it may not last. But on      the day of the World Trade Center cataclysm, the country      changed.

Sea of Flags       Noteworthy, too, was America's quick return to family,      community, church, and patriotism in the aftermath of the      tragedy. People became polite and generous to one another      without prodding. On that day and the days that followed,      they told their wives and husbands and children and parents      and significant others they loved them. And the flags, the      sea of flags that appeared out of nowhere and spread      everywhere, worn by business-suited managers and eyebrow-     pierced, tattooed teenagers. As if by magic, city taxicabs,      building canopies, and nearly every truck in sight were      flying flags.       The offerings of food, money, and blood were overwhelming.      The generosity was unsurpassed in our memories. But the      manner in which perfect strangers went out of their way to      help one another in all kinds of situations was most amazing.      To the surprise of its residents, New York became a small-     town community. The day-to-day antagonisms among the      citizenry melted away.       The rush to church, synagogue, and, yes, mosque was equally      unusual. People returned to their religious ceremonies and      congregations in huge numbers for support and guidance. The      overflow at the doors demonstrated that many who had not      visited in years showed up to participate in the familiar and      comforting liturgies of their childhoods. They joined with      their neighbors in mourning.                             Lessons Taught       It was, for a moment, an old America peeking out from      behind the new, me-now America. We saw a glimpse of a country      of shared values, not competing interest groups; of common      cause, not hateful opposition. There were a few exceptions:      Jerry Falwell declaring we brought the death and destruction      down on ourselves because of homosexuality, abortion, and the      American Civil Liberties Union. A silly, stupid comment to be      dismissed in light of the comity of the day--but an extremist      remark nonetheless made in the name of God. How sad.       Tragedy has the power to transform us. But rarely is the      transformation permanent. People and societies revert back to      the norm. But what is the ``norm'' for America? Where are      this nation's true values?
