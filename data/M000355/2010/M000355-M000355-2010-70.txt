 President, both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate held many meetings this week to assess the priorities of our respective conferences.  I am extremely proud of the clarity my Republican colleagues have used to express what our priorities must be andthat we have listened to the American people. Last night, Republicans expressed the need to cut spending, reduce the debt, shrink the size and scope of the Federal Government, and help spur private sector employment--in short, change the way Washington is doing business to get our economy going again.
