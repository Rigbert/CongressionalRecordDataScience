President, I thank the chairman for his thoughtful comments and for working with us on this amendment. I hope at the appropriate time it can be adopted. I believe it is acceptable to Senator McCain. But I am unclear whether there is further clearance that needs to be done.  But, again, while the Senator is on the floor, I want to once again praise Senator Levin and Senator McCain for tackling this critical issue. It is complex. And it is important that the reforms make a difference to our military--to those who need these weapon systems, who need the material and the supplies that the contracting is procuring. It is also important that taxpayers be protected. There have been far too many cost overruns and schedule delays that hurt those who are on the front lines, quite literally.  I praise and thank the chairman again for his leadership in this area.  Thank you, Mr. President.
