 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend, George Mitnick, who I have known for more than a quarter-century. He passed away on August 6, 2005, at the age of 87, and I would like to take this opportunity to honor his life.  A devoted family man, George was married for 61 years to Willine Engel Mitnick. Together, they raised two daughters, Ronne Mitnick Hess and Karen Mitnick. He and his wife resided in Jasper, AL, until his passing.  George was born in Hartford, CT, on December 21, 1917, and attended college at the University of Connecticut. Upon graduation, he enlisted in the military and served in World War II. He was a captain in the 65th Infantry Division in the European Theatre and received two Bronze Stars for his service.  George Mitnick was very devoted to charitable efforts, making generous contributions in money, time and energy. Some of those organizations included United Cerebral Palsy and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. In addition, much of his philanthropic work was aimed at young people. Both the Mitnick Fellowship Fund and the Mitnick Wilderness Boot Camp helped youth in Alabama.  Well known as a business leader, he was a co-founder of Top Dollar Stores in the 1950s. The company, which expanded to over 250 stores, was acquired by Sav-A-Stop Company, and George served on the company's board of directors and on its executive committee. He also served as a director of the First National Bank of Jasper and First Commercial Bankshares.  George was very active in civic, professional and political organizations. He was committed to making a difference across the State of Alabama, dedicating much of his time to community organizations. He served as president of the Alabama Retail Association, the Jasper Chamber of Commerce and the Jasper Rotary Club. He was instrumental in founding the Walker Area Community Foundation and the Walker College Civic Concert Association.  He served on a number of boards including the Northwest Alabama Mental Health Center, the Walker County Association of Retarded Citizens, Walker Junior College and Walker Regional Medical Center. He was also very involved in the political process, playing an integral role in Americans for Good Government.  Active in the Jewish community in Alabama and across the nation, Georgeserved as president of the Temple Emanu-El in Jasper, AL and the Walker County Lodge of B'nai B'rith. In 2003, he was named ``Man of the Year'' by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, where he also served as a member of the executive board.  George Mitnick gave of himself so selflessly to the Jasper community and the State of Alabama. We are better off for having him a part of our State and our country, and I am fortunate to have known him and called him a friend. My deepest sympathies are extended to his wife, Willine, and his daughters, Karen and Ronne. May this tribute, in a small way, honor his life and memory.                          ____________________
