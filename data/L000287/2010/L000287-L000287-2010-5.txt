Mr. Speaker, long before a man finds a political party, he finds his principles. This debate about the ``Bush Tax Cuts'' is an opportunity to show the American people our principles--to show them that we stand for and believe in a strong middle class; to show them we believe in fiscal responsibility.  Forty-seven years ago, on the steps of The Lincoln Memorial, I criticized both the Republican and the Democratic party for doing too little for the working man and the disenfranchised. And now, as I stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives, I hope this is criticism I will not have to repeat today.  To my colleagues who fret or seek the cover of Republican votes I say, ``be not afraid.'' Be not afraid as history will judge us right. Be not afraid as the numbers are on our side. Be not afraid as an elected official is judged not by the number of years he has served, but by the cause he has served.  Stand up and show America the cause you serve. Stand up and show America your principles. If you value and believe in the strength of America's working families, then vote ``yes.'' If you truly believe in fiscal responsibility, then vote ``yes.'' But if partisanship and political games come first, then vote no and allow America to see you for who you are.
