President, I recently spoke on the floor about the disgust that I share with most Americans about the tactics of Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr and the disturbing spectacle of hauling a mother before a grand jury to reveal her intimate conversations with her daughter in a matter, which--even if all the allegations about the daughter's conduct were true--do not pose grave threats to the public safety. This matter does not, for example, involve any allegations of violence or drug trafficking conduct.  In this instance, as in others, Mr. Starr has scurried to apply all of the legal weapons at his command, but none of the discretion that he is obligated to exercise as one invested with almost unchecked legal authority. I also expressed my intent to introduce legislation to study whether, and under what circumstances, the confidential communications between a parent and his or her child should be protected. A number of professional relationships of trust are already protected by legal privileges, but not familial relationships. This is the legislation I introduce today.  Currently, under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, privileges are ``governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience.'' Thus, in the absence of any Supreme Court rules or federal statutes, courts look to the United States Constitution and the principles of federal common law to determine the applicability and the scope of privileges.  Legal academicians have expressed support for a parent-child testimonial privilege. The public policy reasons favoring such a privilege are numerous and relate to the respect we accord to fundamental family values. Recognition of such a privilege could foster andprotect strong and trusting family relationships, preserve the family, safeguard the privacy of familial communications and intimate family matters against undue government intrusion, and promote a healthy environment for the psychological development of children.  Despite these myriad reasons, there are indeed cases and circumstances when parents should be compelled in court to share what they know from their children. Indeed, courts have generally not been receptive to the parent-child privilege. Only four States--Idaho, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York--have adopted either by statute, or by judicial recognition, some form of a parent-child privilege. No Federal Court of Appeals have recognized this privilege nor has any State Supreme Court that has considered the issue. In my own State of Vermont, such a privilege is not recognized.  To my mind, and as a former prosecutor, prosecutors should show restraint before putting parents in the untenable position of making a legal determination as to whether their children should come to them for advice, or whether the parents instead should feel legally pressured to refer their own children to professional therapists, or lawyers, or doctors in order to protect the confidentiality of the child's communications. To be sure, there are some categories of cases, particularly cases involving grave threats to the public safety, such as violent or drug trafficking crimes, where the government can and should appropriately seek testimony from a parent about what a child has said. But we should all be clear about when prosecutors should also show restraint.  Courts have recognized privilege claims in a variety of professional relationships, ranging from attorneys to priests to psychotherapists. Yet the relationship between parent and child--the most fundamental relationship in our society--is generally not so protected in any circumstances. As one New York court explained:       It would be difficult to think of a situation which more      strikingly embodies the intimate and confidential      relationship which exists among family members than that in      which a troubled young person, perhaps beset with remorse and      guilt, turns for counsel and guidance to his mother and      father. There is nothing more natural, more consistent with      our concept of the parental role, than that a child may rely      on his parents for help and advice. Shall it be said to those      parents, ``Listen to your son at the risk of being compelled      to testify about his confidences?''--In re Application of      A, 61 A.D.2d 426, 403 N.Y.S.2d 375, 378 (1978).  We should consider the sorts of circumstances and the types of cases in which prosecutors should be asked to show some restraint before turning to parents to provide evidence against their children. That is why my bill calls for a study and report by the Justice Department on what these circumstances should be, and to develop prosecutorial guidelines accordingly. Specifically, these guidelines should identify when the communications between parents and their children should carry the same protections as preferred professional relationships, and the circumstances and types of cases when those communications should be subject to government scrutiny.  We cannot rely on the courts to formulate an appropriate parent-child privilege. The Third Circuit recently declined to recognize the parent-child privilege, noting that:       The legislature, not the judiciary, is institutionally      better equipped to perform the balancing of the competing      policy issues required in deciding whether the recognition of      a parent-child privilege is in the best interests of society.      Congress, through its legislative mechanisms, is also better      suited for the task of defining the scope of any prospective      privilege. . . . In short, if a new privilege is deemed      worthy of recognition, the wiser course in our opinion is to      leave the adoption of such a privilege to Congress.--In re      Grand Jury Proceedings (Impounded), 103 F.3d 1140, 1148, 1153      (3d Cir. 1996).  Likewise, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has made clear that ``courts have been reluctant to create new privileges, preferring to leave such matters to the legislature despite any policy reasons supporting recognition of a particular privilege.'' United States v. Riley, 653 F.2d 1153, 1160 (7th Cir. 1981).  Congress should accept this challenge. My bill is a start to the process of seeking expert input on the significant question of when the government may not compel parents to betray the confidences of their children, and when because of compelling need or the nature of the case or circumstances, parents should be required to reveal the substance of what their children have told them.  Thus, the bill I introduce today directs the Attorney General to develop Federal prosecutorial guidelines to protect familial privacy and parent-child communications in matters that do not involve allegations of violent or drug trafficking conduct. In addition, the legislation would direct the Judicial Conference to undertake a study and then give us a report on whether the Federal Rules of Evidence should be amended to explicitly recognize a parent-child privilege in cases not involving violent or drug trafficking conduct, and, if so, in what circumstances that privilege should apply.  While we should endeavor to provide the maximum protection for parent-child communications, we should also be careful not to unduly obstruct law enforcement. Nor should the rule be susceptible to litigious mischief.  Accordingly, the Attorney General and the Judicial Conference will need to address, as part of the study and report called for in my bill, a series of important questions, including:  (1) What communications should be considered confidential for purposes of the privilege and, specifically, should the privilege apply in both criminal and civil proceedings?  (2) Should such a privilege apply only to unemancipated minors, or also to adult children?  (3) Should only the child's communications be protected, or should a parent's communications to a child also receive protection?  (4) Should such a privilege extend beyond a child's natural parents to include step-parents or grandparents?  (5) Should such a privilege be subject to rebuttal if the government establishes a compelling need for the information?  This legislation is the first step in evaluating the merits and difficulties inherent in protecting familial privacy and the parent-child relationship against unwarranted intrusions by the government and by overzealous prosecutors. The public and these families themselves should not have to endure repeated scenes of mothers being marched into grand jury inquisitions to reveal intimate talks they may have had with their children about their private relationships. This is a far cry from allegations concerning violent or drug trafficking conduct. Let us find out what the Justice Department and Judicial Conference recommend about how we can best protect child-parent confidences in ways that comport with American notions of family, fidelity, and privacy, without compromising our public safety and the integrity of our judicial system.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1721       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CONFIDENTIALITY OF PARENT CHILD COMMUNICATIONS IN                    JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.       (a) Study and Development of Prosecutorial Guidelines.--The      Attorney General of the United States shall--       (1) study and evaluate the manner in which the States have      taken measures to protect the confidentiality of      communications between children and parents and, in      particular, whether such measures have been taken in matters      that do not involve allegations of violent or drug      trafficking conduct;       (2) develop guidelines for Federal prosecutors that will      provide the maximum protection possible for the      confidentiality of communications between children and      parents in matters that do not involve allegations of violent      or drug trafficking conduct, within any applicable      constitutional limits, and without compromising public safety      or the integrity of the judicial system, taking into      account--       (A) the danger that the free communication between a child      and his or her parent will be inhibited and familial privacy      and relationships will be damaged if there is no assurance      that such communications will be kept confidential;       (B) whether an absolute or qualified testimonial privilege      for communications between a child and his or her parents in      matters that do not involve allegations of violent or drug      trafficking conduct is appropriate to provide the maximum      guarantee of     familial privacy and confidentiality without compromising      public safety or the integrity of the judicial system; and       (C) the appropriate limitations on a testimonial privilege      for such communications between a child and his or her      parents, including--       (i) whether the privilege should apply in criminal and      civil proceedings;       (ii) whether the privilege should extend to all children,      regardless of age, unemancipated or emancipated, or be more      limited;       (iii) the parameters of the familial relationship subject      to the privilege, including whether the privilege should      extend to stepparents or grandparents, adopted children, or      siblings; and       (iv) whether disclosure should be allowed absent a      particularized showing of a compelling need for such      disclosure, and adequate procedural safeguards are in place      to prevent unnecessary or damaging disclosures; and       (3) prepare and disseminate to Federal prosecutors the      findings made and guidelines developed as a result of the      study and evaluation.       (b) Report and Recommendations.--Not later than 1 year      after the date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General      of the United States shall submit a report to Congress on--       (1) the findings of the study and the guidelines required      under subsection (a); and       (2) recommendations based on the findings on the need for      and appropriateness of further action by the Federal      Government.       (c) Review of Federal Rules of Evidence.--Not later than      180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the      Judicial Conference of the United States shall complete a      review and submit a report to Congress on--       (1) whether the Federal Rules of Evidence should be amended      to guarantee that the confidentiality of communications by a      child to his or her parent in matters that do not involve      allegations of violent or drug trafficking conduct will be      adequately protected in Federal court proceedings; and       (2) if the rules should be so amended, a proposal for      amendments to the rules that provides the maximum protection      possible for the confidentiality of such communications,      within any applicable constitutional limits and without      compromising public safety or the integrity of the judicial      system.                                 ______                                       By
