Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (S. 1785) to amend chapter 13 of title 17, United States Code (relating to the vessel hull design protection), to clarify the distinction between a hull and a deck, to provide factors for the determination of the protectability of a revised design, to provide guidance for assessments of substantial similarity, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                                S. 1785       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

TITLE II--INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROVISIONS     SEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO BAYH-DOLE ACT.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:       (1) Article I, section 8, clause 8, of the United States      Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power      ``[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by      securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the      exclusive Right to their respective Writings and      Discoveries''.       (2) The 96th Congress enacted Public Law 96-517, entitled      ``An Act to amend the patent and trademark laws'' (commonly      known as the ``Bayh-Dole Act'', in honor of its two lead      sponsors in the Senate, the Honorable Birch Bayh and the      Honorable Bob Dole), in 1980.       (3) For 15 to 20 years before the enactment of the Bayh-     Dole Act, Members of Congress considered, discussed, and      deliberated on the proper resolution of issues implicated by      the Act.       (4) Before the enactment of the Bayh-Dole Act, the United      States was confronted by great economic uncertainty and      presented with unprecedented new challenges from foreign      industrial competition.       (5) Before 1980, only 5 percent of patents owned by the      Federal Government were used by the private sector--a      situation that resulted in the American people being denied      the benefits of further development, disclosure,      exploitation, and commercialization of the Government's      patent portfolio.       (6) The Bayh-Dole Act established a ``single, uniform      national policy designed to . . . encourage private industry      to utilize government financed inventions through the      commitment of the risk capital necessary to develop such      inventions to the point of commercial application'', and      eliminated the 26 different Federal agency policies that had      existed regarding the use of the results of federally funded      research and development.       (7) The Bayh-Dole Act fundamentally changed the Federal      Government's patent policies by enabling inventors or their      employers to retain patent rights in inventions developed as      part of federally funded research grants, thereby promoting      licensing and the leveraging of contributions by the private      sector towards applied research, and facilitating the      transfer of technology from the laboratory bench to the      marketplace.       (8) Examples of the tangible products and technologies that      have resulted from the Bayh-Dole Act include, inter alia, an      improved method for preserving organs for transplant, a      lithography system to enable the manufacture of nano-scale      devices, the development of new chemotherapeutic agents, the      discovery of new therapies for the treatment of patients      diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and countless other      advances in materials, electronics, energy, environmental      protection, and information technologies.       (9) These new therapies, technologies, and inventions,      which have resulted from the collaborative environment      fostered by the Bayh-Dole Act, have directly contributed to      the ability of medical researchers to discover and      commercialize new treatments that alleviate patient      suffering, enhance the ability of doctors to diagnose and      treat disease, and target promising new medical research.       (10) The Bayh-Dole Act has stimulated two of the major      contemporary scientific trends of the last quarter century--     the development of the biotechnology and information      communications industries--and the Act is poised to continue      playing a central role in new fields of innovative      activities, including nanotechnology.       (11) The Bayh-Dole Act has resulted in benefitting      taxpayers by generating millions of dollars in annual      licensing royalties for universities and nonprofit      institutions--revenues that are reinvested in furtherance of      additional research and education programs.       (12) The incentives provided under the Act and the exchange      of technology and research between and among the research      community, small businesses, and industry, have resulted in      new cooperative ventures and the emergence of sophisticated      high-technology businesses, which provide a major catalyst      for innovation and entrepreneurial activity.       (13) More than 4,000 new companies have been created to      develop and market academic research and development since      1980, and it is estimated that nearly 2300 of these companies      were still in operation at the end of fiscal year 2003.       (14) Lita Nelsen, director of the Technology Licensing      Office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has      described the Bayh-Dole Act as ``one of the most successful      pieces of economic development and job-creation legislation      in recent history''.       (15) The Bayh-Dole Act was described in a 2002 article in      The Economist (US) as ``[p]ossibly the most inspired piece of      legislation to be enacted in America over the past half-     century. . . . More than anything, this single policy measure      helped to reverse America's precipitous slide into industrial      irrelevance''.       (16) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that      university administrators and small business representatives      considered the Bayh-Dole Act to have had ``a significant      impact on their research and innovation efforts''.       (17) A study of business executives found that 9 out of 10      identified the Bayh-Dole Act as an ``important factor'' in      decisions to fund research and development in academia.       (18) Howard Bremer, who served as patent counsel to the      Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation from 1960 to 1988, once      observed that, ``[o]ne important factor . . . is that the      success was achieved without cost to the taxpayer. In other      words, no separate appropriation of government funds was      needed to establish or manage the effort''.       (19) A 1998 GAO study found that the law had a positive      impact on all involved and that the increased      commercialization of federally funded research that resulted      from implementation of the Act had positively affected both      the Federal Government and the American people.       (20) The President's Council of Advisors on Science and      Technology reported to the President in May 2003 that the Act      ``dramatically improved the nation's ability to move ideas      from research and development to the marketplace and into      commerce'' and that the system put in place for transferring      technology from nonprofit institutions, which includes      universities and Government laboratories, to the private      sector has worked well.       (21) The Bayh-Dole Act states, ``[i]t is the policy and      objective of the Congress to promote the utilization of      inventions arising from federally-supported research or      development; . . . to promote collaboration between      commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations, including      universities; . . . to promote the commercialization and      public availability of inventions made in the United States      by United States industry and labor; [and] to ensure that the      Government obtains sufficient rights in federally-supported      inventions to meet the needs of the Government and protect      the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of      inventions''.       (22) The Congress finds that the policies and objectives of      the Bayh-Dole Act have been achieved and that the patent law      has played a critical role in stimulating technological      advances and disclosing useful technical information to the      public.       (23) The Congress finds that federally-funded research at      universities and Government laboratories and the partnerships      between such nonprofit institutions and the private sector      play a critical role in developing the technologies that      allow the United States to lead the world in innovation.       (24) The Bayh-Dole Act and its subsequent amendments, which      include the Trademark Clarification Act of 1984 (Public Law      98-620), have played a vital role in enabling the United      States to become renowned as the world leader in scientific      research, innovation, ingenuity, and collaborative research      that involves institutions of higher education and the      private sector.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the Bayh-Dole Act (Public Law 96-517) has made      substantial contributions to the advancement of scientific      and technological knowledge, fostered dramatic improvements      in public health and safety, strengthened the higher      education system in the United States, served as a catalyst      for the development of new domestic industries that have      created tens of thousands of new jobs for American citizens,      strengthened States and local communities across the country,      and benefitted the economic and trade policies of the United      States; and       (2) it is appropriate that the Congress reaffirm its      commitment to the policies and objectives of the Bayh-Dole      Act by acknowledging its contributions and commemorating the      silver anniversary of its enactment.     SEC. 202. FILING OF APPLICATIONS FOR EXTENSIONS OF A PATENT                    TERM.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:       (1) The Congress historically has provided vigorous support      for innovation in the useful arts by establishing a system of      patent protection for products and processes.       (2) Through section 156 of title 35, United States Code,      the Congress sought to promote the development of innovative      drugs by granting patent term restoration to companies to      recover a portion of the patent term for such drugs that was      consumed during the approval process conducted by the Food      and Drug Administration.       (3) Consistent with the historic purpose of promoting      innovation, patent legislation, and subsequent rules      promulgated by the United States Patent and Trademark Office      (PTO), have routinely given the PTO wide discretion to excuse      late filings and other mistakes that might otherwise result      in the forfeiture of underlying patent rights.       (4) Contrary to this routine practice, however, under      section 156 of title 35, United States Code, the PTO has no      discretion to excuse a filing that is even one day late.       (5) In order to be consistent with the intent of protecting      patent rights and promoting further innovation, the PTO      should be granted limited, circumscribed discretion to      consider patent term restoration applications filed in an      untimely manner.       (b) Filing of Applications.--       (1) In general.--Section 156 of title 35, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new      subsection:       ``(i) Unintentional Delay.--The Director may accept an      application under this section that is filed not later than 5      days after the expiration of the 60-day period provided in      subsection (d)(1) if the applicant files a petition showing,      to the satisfaction of the Director, that the delay in filing      the application was unintentional. Such petition must be      filed with the application in the case of an application      filed on or after the date of the enactment of this      subsection and must be filed not later than 5 days after such      date of     enactment in the case of an application which, on such date      of enactment, is pending, is the subject of a request for      reconsideration of a denial of a patent term extension under      this section, or has been denied a patent term extension      under this section in a case in which the period for seeking      reconsideration of such denial has not yet expired. The      Director shall make a determination on a petition under this      subsection not later than 30 days after the date on which the      petition is received. If no determination has been made on      the petition within that 30-day period, the petition shall be      deemed to be denied.''.       (2) Revival fees.--Section 41(a)(7) of title 35, United      States Code, is amended--       (A) by striking ``or for an'' and inserting ``for an''; and       (B) by inserting after ``reexamination proceeding,'' the      following: ``or for an unintentionally delayed application      for patent term extension,''.       (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this section      shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,      and shall apply to any application for patent term extension      under section 156 of title 35, United States Code, which--       (A) is filed on or after the date of the enactment of this      Act; or       (B) on such date of enactment--       (i) is pending;       (ii) is the subject of a request for reconsideration of a      denial of a patent term extension under section 156; or       (iii) has been denied a patent term extension under such      section 156 in a case in which the period for seeking      reconsideration of such denial has not yet expired.
