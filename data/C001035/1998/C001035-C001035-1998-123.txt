President, along with my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, I am pleased today to introduce legislation that would bring about the release of certain interests of the United States in property that the Federal Government conveyed to the State of Maine more than 90 years ago. The property in question, which is situated on a bluff overlooking the Kennebec River in Augusta, Maine, is known as the Kennebec Arsenal.  In 1905, the Secretary of the Army, acting pursuant to a Congressional mandate, executed a deed transferring the property to Maine. That conveyance was subject to the conditions that the property be used for what was then called the Maine Insane Hospital and that the United States could take possession should the President determine that the country had a need for it. In1980, Congress provided that the first condition be broadened to allow the property to be used for any public purpose. Today, I seek to complete the transfer process through legislation that would effectively eliminate the conditions attached to the conveyance.  Mr. President, the property is no longer needed for it former purposes, and my bill would set in motion a chain of events that would allow for new uses that would benefit not only the City of Augusta and the State of Maine but our entire country. With the exception of the Kennebec Arsenal, virtually all of the great arsenals of the nineteenth century have been demolished or so completely altered that their original appearance has been lost. The new uses contemplated by Maine would raise money needed for repairs that would maintain what historic preservation experts have described as the most perfectly intact of the nineteenth century arsenals.  To be more specific, the State of Maine and City of Augusta plan to form a nonprofit corporation to oversee the property. That corporation would seek out private parties interested in using the land and buildings for such purposes as a marina, a museum, and a restaurant. Those parties would provide the capital for infrastructure development that would likely include sidewalks, streets, water, sewer and other utility service, and landscaping. In addition, the Arsenal's retaining wall needs repair, and a marina cannot be established without substantial dredging of the river.  The objective of my bill is to open the way for these improvements and new uses by eliminating any reversionary interests of the United States. The existence of such interests is a barrier to the private sector making the long-term commitments required to fund the improvements. In other words, Maine needs clear title for this plan to go forward.  Mr. President, the Kennebec Arsenal occupies an important place in the history of Maine and the nation. It was established in 1827 to deal with the threat of invasion from Great Britain, either from across the sea or from Canada to the north. The possibility of such an invasion was seen as a major threat to American security during the first half of the nineteenth century.  Much of the tension with the British stemmed from our disputed border with Canada, and in the late 1830's that dispute nearly blossomed into a full-scale war. While the so-called bloodless Aroostook War proved to be more talk than action, it caused a flurry of activity at the Kennebec Arsenal, with newly fabricated munitions sent there in anticipation of full-scale fighting. Fortunately, cooler heads and the arrival of the spring planting season brought the parties to the negotiating table.  During the Mexican War, rockets and fixed ammunition were manufactured at the Arsenal and shipped to the front. During the Civil War, the post became an important depot of military stores. Indeed, a fear that Confederate guerrillas based in Canada would seek to burn the Arsenal led to the stationing of extra guards there, but despite the approach late one dark night of an unidentified boat, nothing came of this concern. During the latter half of the century, the Arsenal's importance declined, and in 1901, the Army posted an order for its abandonment. That process culminated in the legislation signed by President Theodore Roosevelt providing for the transfer of the property to the State for use as a hospital to serve the mentally ill.  Mr. President, I have offered this greatly abbreviated history of the Kennebec Arsenal to demonstrate the value of finding uses for the property that will guarantee its permanent preservation. That is the goal of the State of Maine and the City of Augusta, and this legislation will remove an anachronistic obstacle to the realization of that goal.  I thank you, Mr. President, and I hope to have your support for this very important legislation when it comes before the Committee on Armed Services.                          ____________________
