 President, earlier this year, Dr. David Roselle, a personal friend and longtime president of my alma mater, the University of Delaware, announced that he will retire in May. I have the greatest respect for Dr. Roselle and the tremendous job he has done at the institution I love.  The average tenure of a university president, I am told, is a little over 6 years, about the term of a U.S. Senator. When Dr. Roselle leaves, he will have served 17 years, equivalent to almost a three-term Senator. That is staying power that has let him turn the University of Delaware from a very good regional school into a university, known nationally for its academic excellence.  When constituents ask me: ``My child has gotten into this university or that university. Where should she go?'' I say go to that university they can get into now and are quite certain 10 years from now they would never be admitted. That certainly would have been my story at the University of Delaware.  Back when I was a student in the early 1960s, we had 4,000 undergraduates, maybe 400 graduate students. Today, there are 15,000 undergraduates and 3,000 graduate students. They come from all over the country and world.  But what is really different between then, and now, is not the quantity, but that even the highest caliber students must now worry about their ability to get in. During Dr. Roselle's tenure, the SAT scores of entering freshman has risen significantly.  All of us in public service have the goal to leave the place better than how we found it, and Dr. Roselle has clearly done that, on many fronts.  Physically, under his leadership, he oversaw the building and rebuilding of about two dozen structures, including a new sports/convocation center, a new center for the arts that opened recently, new laboratories, new residences, and new academic buildings. He brought technology into the infrastructure, so all campus buildings are 21st century ready.  Financially, he has nearly quadrupled the university's endowment, to $1.2 billion, far exceeding anyone's expectations. The number of endowed faculty positions has increased from 20 some 10 years ago to more than 100 today, allowing the university to attract excellent faculty members.  Since he arrived, he increased student aid from $19 million to $56 million and started scholarship support so more students can study abroad. The University of Delaware started the first Study Abroad Program in the world 80 years ago, and today, 40 percent of undergraduates spend some time learning abroad, increasingly important preparation for a job in today's global economy.  All of us in this Chamber should feel good about helping expand the university's scientific programs. During Dr. Roselle's tenure, Congress appropriated almost $90 million for defense work, primarily at the University's Center for Advanced Composite Materials. It has been put to good use. They have developed critical basic composite materials and production techniques to produce the lighter, more capable vehicles, guns, armor, and ships our military needs.  We also should feel good about the millions of dollars Congress has directed to the university to help fight avian influenza, develop clean energy technologies, and for biotechnology research, among other activities.  I also note that Dr. Roselle presided over Blue Hen football teams that combined had a 135-54-1 record and brought to Newark a national championship, a proud day for all of our alumni.  The list of his accomplishments is long, and I could go on. But it is not so much what he has built, as what the 70,000 students who graduated during his tenure will accomplish with the quality education he had such a strong hand in giving them.  Our alma mater has a wonderful line, ``We give thee thanks for glorious days beneath thy guiding hand,'' and it is certainly his hand as well as his head and heart that has guided the university into the wonderful institution it is today.  I know I speak for all of my colleagues in extending Dr. Roselle our heartfelt congratulations.                          ____________________[Page S10668]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID ROSELLE
