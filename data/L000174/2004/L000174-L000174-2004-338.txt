President, I regret the need to once again call attention to the fact that the Senate continues to neglect our obligation to respond to a crisis, caused by Federal policy, that is disrupting the operations of small and large businesses throughout the United States.  Two months ago the Department of Homeland Security announced that for the first time ever the annual cap for H-2B visas had been met. These visas are used by a wide range of industries throughout the Nation to fill temporary labor needs. In my home State of Vermont, they are used primarily by the tourist industry.  Across the country, businesses in a wide range of industries had developed plans that relied on the foreign employees who had always before been available to them. For years, these employers had applied in the spring for the employees they needed for the summer, filling positions for which they were unable to find American workers. The cap had never been reached, and they had no reason to believe this year would be different. I know that the March announcement came as a shock to many employers in my State, and dozens of them contacted my office to see what could be done. This setback fell equally hard on employers in other States.  In response to these requests, I joined with a substantial bipartisan coalition in introducing S. 2252, the Save Summer Act of 2004. Senator Kennedy is the lead sponsor of the bill, which has 18 cosponsors, including eight Republicans. Our bill would add 40,000 visas for the current fiscal year, providing relief to those summer-oriented businesses that had never even had the opportunity to apply for visas.  The following day, Senator Hatch introduced S. 2258, the Summer Operations and Services Relief and Reform Act. I do not believe that this bill, cosponsored exclusively by Republicans, is as effective a bill as S. 2252, but I would support it if it came before the Senate. Despite its sponsorship by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and by the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, S. 2258 has now been held hostage in the Republican cloakroom for 5 weeks.  Obtaining these visas takes weeks, if not months, because the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security must both sign off on them. I and others have repeatedly warned that we needed to pass legislation by May 1 if we were going to provide meaningful relief. That date has come and gone, and now it is too late to help many, if not all, of the businesses that had relied upon the availability of H-2B visas. It is beyond disappointing that at the Republican leadership in this body ignored my pleas and the pleas of so many Senators. And it is inexcusable that the Republican leadership ignored the pleas of business owners across the country asking for this emergency relief.  And so it is that a tiny minority of the Republican caucus has managed to frustrate the will of a substantial bipartisan coalition of Senators who have sought to raise the H-2B cap, thereby needlessly harming businesses throughout the Nation. Meanwhile, the Republican leadership has failed to make solving this problem a priority. Perhaps if the majority leader chose to devote floor time to issues that had substantial bipartisan support, instead of using the floor to set up symbolic votes whose results are known well in advance, we would not be in this position.  These businesses contribute much to the economies of our States. They deserve better treatment than they have received at the hands of the Republican leadership of the Senate.                          ____________________
