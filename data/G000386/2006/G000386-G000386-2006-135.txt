 The provision is intended to buttress current exemption standards by providing additional standards that must be met for a credit counseling organization to claim exempt status. As the Senator knows, the IRS recently has challenged the exempt status of several credit counseling organizations because they are operated for a substantial non-exempt purpose, substantial private benefit and private inurement. Certain of these organizations exist merely to generate income from the sale of debt management plans, while providing minimal exempt purpose activities related to credit counseling. The standards imposed under this provision are intended to augment, not supplant, the IRS efforts and to ensure that exemption from consumer protection laws applies only to those organizations that can satisfy stricter tax-exempt standards. I also want to assure the distinguished Senator from New Mexico that we will continue to monitor developments in this industry to ensure that only those entities that serve a sufficient charitable and educational purpose can claim tax-exempt status and that such tax-exempt entities do not generate significant revenues from activities unrelated to their exempt purposes. If it turns out that the additional standards imposed by this legislation do not have the desired impact, you can be assured that we will not hesitate to revisit this area.
