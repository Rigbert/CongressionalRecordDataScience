Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for the conference report accompanying H.R. 2605, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2000. This legislation contains $21,279,000,000 ($21 billion $279 million $969 thousand dollars) in new federal funding for programs of the Department of Energy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, Power Marketing Administrations, NRC, FERC, and the Appalachian Regional Commission.
