President, when Congress enacted the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) in 1999, I well remember, as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, that we amended the Copyright Act to authorize satellites to carry local channels into local markets. We knew at that time, however, that satellites would be unable to carry local TV stations on a must carry basis.  To address this limitation, we did two things. First, we delayed implementation of a full must-carry obligation until January 1, 2002, so as to give the industry time to upgrade their satellites to handle more channels. I regret that the satellite industry has challenged the must carry requirement on constitutional grounds, but also observe that a federal court recently threw out their lawsuit. Second we directed the FCC to make ``final determinations'' regarding license for alternative technologies that could deliver local channels on must-carry basis to markets that the satellites would not be able to serve.  I know my friend from New Hampshire shared my interest in this issue, as we both hail from states with television markets that are considered too small to receive local channels via satellite. Could my friend refresh for the record what last year's appropriations bill for the FCC had to say about this matter?
