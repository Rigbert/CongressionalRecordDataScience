 President, I rise today to honor a great Kentuckian, Mr. David Morgan, for his service to the Commonwealth and his commitment to the preservation of Kentucky's historic landmarks.  For the past 29 years Mr. Morgan has worked on preserving Kentucky's heritage, helping cities and towns utilize and revitalize their downtowns and historic sites.  On Sunday, December 3, 2006, the Louisville Courier-Journal published an article highlighting Mr. Morgan's many years of service to Kentucky. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record and that the entire Senate join me in thanking this beloved Kentuckian.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Dec. 3, 2006]                     Preservationist Bids Farewell                           (By Chris Poynter)       Most Kentuckians likely do not know David Morgan.       But they have certainly seen his work.       If you drive along Paris Pike--the road between Paris and      Lexington lined with famous thoroughbred farms--you've seen      the historic stone fences and picture-perfect rolling      landscapes that he helped protect when the road was widened.       If you've strolled the Main Streets of Kentucky's      downtowns--and marveled at the historic buildings--you can      thank Morgan for helping revive them.       And if you've seen the old trolley barn in western      Louisville that is slowly being transformed into the Kentucky      Center for African-American Heritage, Morgan deserves part of      the credit.       After 29 years with the Kentucky Heritage Council--the      agency that oversees historic preservation for the state--     Morgan is retiring and moving to Washington, D.C.       Morgan, 54, and his wife, Marcia, have bought a historic      home just blocks from the Capitol. They have a son, Ned, 18.       Morgan has spent his entire professional career at the      heritage council, rising from a staff planner in November      1977 to executive director, a position he's held since 1984,      when then-Gov. Martha Layne Collins appointed him.       He survived through Republican and Democratic      administrations, which friends and co-workers say is a      testament to his effectiveness, and he's been at the      forefront of saving historic properties from Paducah to      Pikeville.       His interest in preservation began as a child in Oxford,      Ohio, the son of a college professor and a stay-at-home      mother who sold antiques.       On a fourth-grade class trip to Yellow Springs, Ohio--named      for a spring that supposedly had curative powers--a young      Morgan lamented the demolition of the old Neff House hotel.       ``It is important to know how America was settled,'' Morgan      wrote in a school essay he still keeps. ``If you tore down      everything that was historical, people would forget how      America was settled.''       Morgan laughs at his simple six-paragraph essay now--but      the lessons he learned on that field trip are woven      throughout his life.       Preservation--though it began as a movement of upper-crust      white women--has expanded and matured and become more      inclusive. Morgan has changed the heritage council's mission      with that evolution.       He helped create the African-American Heritage Commission,      the Native American Heritage Commission, and the Military      Heritage & Civil War Preservation Program. He and his agency      worked to raise awareness about Rosenwald Schools--one-room      schoolhouses for black children that at one time dotted      Kentucky and the South--and he has helped preserve 60 Civil      War sites across the state.       In 1979, while still in his 20s, he started the Main Street      program to help revive Kentucky's decaying downtowns. The      program now includes 110 cities and towns across Kentucky and      is credited with helping breathe new life into desolate city      centers.       And he pushed to get Kentucky buildings and properties on      the National Register of Historic Places. Kentucky now has      41,000 properties and 3,200 historic districts, such as Old      Louisville, on the register.       That's the fourth-largest number of any state in the      nation, according to the National Park Service, which keeps      the register.       Though he's had many successes--including persuading state      transportation leaders to make historic preservation a key      component of the Paris Pike widening--all has not been      positive, Morgan admits.       He hasn't persuaded the state legislature to commit more      money for preservation.       ``We don't have the ability to give grants out, to start      projects on the local level,'' Morgan said.       He also laments that grassroots preservation groups have      been slow in forming. It's those organizations, such as      Preservation Kentucky, run by citizens, that have the power      to effectively lobby the legislature, Morgan said.       ``A lot of people don't consider themselves      preservationists,'' he said. ``But people who live in Old      Louisville in an old house, for example, are great      preservationists.''       Helen Dedman, whose family owns and operates the Beaumont      Inn in Harrodsburg, a restaurant, hotel and tavern housed in      an 1845 building, said Morgan had done much for Kentucky out      of the public eye.       ``He has touched people and places over the whole state,''      she said.       Dedman met Morgan when they were students at Centre      College.       ``He was the first person that I knew that really knew      about antiques,'' she said.       The two kept in sporadic touch over the years, but it      wasn't until 15 years ago that she and Morgan closely      reconnected because of newfound activism in preservation.       Dedman helped organize a tour of historic homes and found      herself ``falling in love with these old homes,'' she said.      She, along with others, formed the non-profit James Harrod      Trust to advocate for preservation in Harrodsburg and Mercer      County.       ``David has never lost his passion,'' Dedman said. ``It      didn't matter who you were, what class you were, what color      you were--if you had just a little bit of interest in his      preservation, he was your cheerleader, he was on your side.''       Historic preservation leaders from across Kentucky gathered      for a dinner in downtown Louisville last month to honor      Morgan. The location was befitting--inside the old Henry Clay      Hotel, a 1924 building that is being renovated into housing      and commercial shops.       Morgan has been an advocate of saving the structure,      commonly called the old YWCA.       Friends and co-workers roasted Morgan--poking fun at his      big nose, bushy eyebrows and black mustache--while viewing      pictures of him over the decades, with former governors and      first lady Laura Bush. Bush visited Louisville in 2004 and      praised Morgan and the heritage council for their work on the      ``Preserve America'' federal program.       Morgan, whose replacement will be named next year, said he      one day hopes to return to Kentucky. For now, he plans to      enjoy his free time and will likely find a job in      preservation in Washington.       ``Leaving this job is the hardest thing,'' he said. ``I've      put my whole life into it. There's not an inch of Kentucky in      the last 29 years I've not seen.''       ``It's an incredible place,'' he said, ``and its greatest      asset are its people.''                          ____________________[Pages S11681-S11682]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID MORGAN  Mr. McCONNELL.
