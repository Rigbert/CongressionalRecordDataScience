  Out of $1 that you, as a consumer, spend for food, the farmer gets 19 cents. Look at a $5 box of corn flakes. For an interview here, I bought a $5 box of corn flakes. I think I had to pay a little bit more because I bought it on the Hill. But the family farmer's share of that $5 box of corn flakes--and it happened to be a little bigger box than normal--was about less than 10 cents. I think the real figure is about 8 cents. That is what the farmer gets out of a box of corn flakes.  Yet the farmer is being blamed for the high price of food because we grow some corn to make ethanol because the American people, 30 years ago, were demanding that we go to a renewable, clean-burning fuel instead of depending upon dirty-burning petroleum, putting more CO2 into the air.
