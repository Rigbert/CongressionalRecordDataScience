Chairman, reclaiming my time, I had the opportunity to meet a little earlier today with representatives of PerkinElmer, a corporation which is a high-technology company based in Wellesley, Massachusetts; and we talked about neonatal screening for treatable, inherited disorders.  I mention that only in the respect that, again, we were talking about prevention and early intervention. These dollars, as the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) and the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman Porter) have pointed out, are dollars well spent; and the only reason, as the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) pointed out that they have not been included in this bill at this point in time is because the budget numbers were so very tight.  I want to thank the chairman, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) and I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter) as well for their willingness to work with us over the next few months to try to increase substantially the numbers dedicated to the immunization program so that we can make sure that every child in America receives the shots and immunizations that he or she needs to ensure at least to the safety that we can accord with those immunization shots.
