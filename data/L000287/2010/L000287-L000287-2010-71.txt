Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Stevie Wonder's song ``Happy Birthday.'' That song was such a fitting tribute to Dr. King and a rallying cry to create the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday that we celebrated last weekend and on Monday.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was my friend. He was my big brother. He was a prophet, and he was my hero. And above all, he was a simple human being filled with love, peace, and compassion for all humankind. Madam Speaker, I want to take the opportunity to thank my colleague, the chairman, Mr. Conyers, for the great and unbelievable role that you have played in makingthis holiday possible. When the historians pick up that pen and write about this period, they would have to write that you, John Conyers, paved the way to make it possible for people all over America and around the world to stop and celebrate the work of Martin Luther King, Jr.  We, as a Congress, as a Nation, and as a people are deeply indebted to you; and we will never, ever forget the role that you played. Stevie Wonder's song reminds us that there is a better way: the way of love, the way of nonviolence. Mr. Chairman, John Conyers, you never gave up. You never gave in. You and Stevie Wonder kept the faith, and you kept your eyes on the prize. Out of Detroit, out of that unbelievable city, you had the right stuff, the good stuff.
