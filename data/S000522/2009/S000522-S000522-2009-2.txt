Mr. Speaker, today the House has an opportunity to significantly limit public funding of abortion in a manner that replicates the Hyde amendment and applies it to the two new massive government health care programs created in the pending bill: the public option and affordability credit program.  The Stupak-Pitts amendment ensures that pro-life Americans will not be forced to fund, enable, or facilitate the killing of unborn children and the wounding of their mothers.  Supermajorities, more than 67 percent, oppose public funding of abortion. Protecting vulnerable unborn children and women from the insidious violence of abortion is the human rights cause of our time.  So please let's not gloss over or trivialize the fact that abortion dismembers, decapitates, starves to death, or chemically poisons innocent babies, and that the abortion act itself, euphemistically called ``choice,'' can in no way be construed to be compassionate, benign, nurturing, or health care. Abortion is violence against women and children. It is neither health care nor reform.  Support the Stupak-Pitts amendment
