 I want to thank Chairman Simpson for his bipartisan approach in preparing this bill. I also thank Chairman Hal Rogers and Ranking Member Nita Lowey for their efforts throughout.  To our dedicated staff--Donna Shahbaz and Taunja Berquam, the Republican and Democratic clerks, as well as the rest of the committee staff: Matt Anderson, Angie Giancarlo, Loraine Heckenberg, and Perry Yates--their countless long hours, late nights, weekends, and thoughtful insight are so critical to helping America prepare this legislation.  This bill funds transformative programs that unlock America's full economic potential, critical water resource projects, navigation and port operability, and breakthrough science advancements that are necessary for America's strategic and competitive posture. This bill undergirds our national defense through superior weapons, naval reactor research, and nonproliferation activities--all priorities that unite rather than divide us.  Chairman Simpson worked hard to incorporate the interests of Members from both parties. As a result, the bill's funding reflects priorities from both sides of the aisle. The chairman's efforts resulted in a bill which, with respect to funding levels, is reasonable; although, the trade-offs are not ideal.  The bill provides an increase of $259 million over the 2016 levels. It allows for stronger investments in the Army Corps of Engineers for critical projects in the Everglades and Great Lakes as well as additional funding to address flooding in areas like Houston. Notably, for the people of northern Ohio, the bill meets the need to comply with State law prior to the open lake disposal of dredged materials. The bill also provides robust funding for many areas at the Department of Energy.  It is sad, however, that the majority would jeopardize this good start by adding in ill-suited ideological or non-germane riders on the Clean Water Act, guns on Army Corps' lands, National Ocean Policy, and the California drought. I should not have to remind our majority colleagues that similar provisions imperiled the passage of this bill in the past. In fiscal year 2016, nearly all of the Democratic Members of the House voted against this bill with far fewer poison pill riders. The administration is on record with veto threats over nearly identical language. As such, I cannot support this bill in its current form.  Every year, this important bill sets the path for America's energy future, and I am happy to note that, more than ever before, America's course is set toward the true north of energy independence. In 2015, America produced 91 percent of the total energy consumed. This represents the 10th consecutive year of declining net energy imports. This translates into freedom.  Significant strides toward America's energy security should be applauded, but we must not lose our momentum by resting on our laurels. To finally free ourselves from our energy dependence, as well as to drastically cut dangerous carbon emissions, we must strongly support the Department of Energy's efforts to embrace the future.  I am disappointed by the $248 million cut, therefore, to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which is leading the charge into the new energy economy against stiff global competition from Europe and Asia. The solar energy account, in particular, yields serious benefits, with the solar industry projected to add 9.5 gigawatts of new energy this year--more than any other source. I am proud that my own district is active in this energy revolution, with First Solar, founded in Toledo, Ohio, the Nation's current leading solar company.  Wind energy is also expanding in northern Ohio, where the Great Lakes have the capacity to become the Saudi Arabia of wind, especially Lake Erie. Cleveland is poised to install the first national offshore wind turbines in a freshwater environment, and that is appropriate, given it was Cleveland where the first electric wind turbine was invented a century ago.  I would like to reiterate my concerns over the controversial riders that threaten not only the ultimate enactment of this bill but also our most precious resource--water. These provisions' inclusion does a disservice in our work, particularly given the serious water challenges many parts of our country face.  While I have concerns with the measure before us, I would like to express my deep appreciation for the chairman's hard work with us on so many issues. The gentleman from Idaho has ensured that the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee continues its tradition of bipartisanship, and he has been a gentleman throughout, as always.  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1730
