 President, normally in our country we don't applaud the death of anyone. We value life greatly. But today we do indeed applaud the death, the removal, of two of the most vicious criminals who ever lived. Yesterday we heard confirmation that the 101st Airborne--I can proudly say headquartered in Fort Campbell, KY--in a raid on a house in Mosul, killed Uday and Qusay Hussein, two of the biggest monsters who ever walked the face of the Earth.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two Associated Press obituaries be printed in the Record at this point, but I want to take a look at those obituaries because I think they tell you a lot about what this war was all about.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Odai Hussein, Oldest Son of Saddam       Baghdad, Iraq.--Odai Hussein, the murderous and erratic      oldest son of Saddam Hussein, controlled propaganda in Iraq      and allegedly oversaw the torture of athletes who failed to      perform.       The 39-year-old is No. 3 on the list of 55 most-wanted men      from the former Iraqi regime--only Saddam and younger brother      Qusai ranked higher. The three also are on a U.S. list of      former regime members who could be tried for war crimes.       As head of the paramilitary Fedayeen Saddam paramilitary      unit, Odai helped his father eliminate opponents and exert      iron-fisted control over Iraq's 25 million people. The eldest      of Saddam's five children, Odai was elected to parliament in      1999 with a reported 99 percent of the vote, but he rarely      attended parliament sessions.       Iraqi exiles say Odai murdered at will and tortured with      zeal, and routinely ordered his guards to snatch young women      off the street so he could rape them. The London-based human-     rights group Indict said Odai ordered prisoners to be dropped      into acid baths as punishment.       The Caligula-like Odai seemed proud of his reputation and      called himself Abu Sarhan, an Arabic term for ``wolf.''       But his tendency toward erratic brutality even exasperated      Saddam, who temporarily banished Odai to Switzerland after      the younger Hussein killed one of his father's favorite      bodyguards in 1988.       The bodyguard, a young man named Kamel Gegeo, arranged      trysts for the Iraqi president--notably with one woman who      later became Saddam's second wife. Worried that his father's      relationship with the woman could threaten his own position      as heir, Odai beat Gegeo to death with a club in full view of      guests at a high-society party, according to some reports.      Other reports said Odai killed Gegeo with an electric carving      knife.       Odai has once been a strong candidate to succeed his      father, but he was badly injured in 1996 in an assassination      attempt by gunmen who opened fire as he drove his red Porsche      through Baghdad. The attack left Odai with a bullet in his      spine that forced him to walk with a cane. Younger brother      Qusai was instead groomed to succeed Saddam, worsening      already uneasy relations between the two brothers.       Odai owned Iraq's most widely circulated daily newspaper,      Babil, which he used as a platform for regime propaganda,      published signed editorials full of bombastic rhetoric. He      also oversaw Al-Zawra, a weekly published by the journalists      union that he headed, and owned the popular Youth TV.       Much of Odai's notoriety abroad stemmed from his position      as head of the National Iraqi Olympic Committee, which was      accused of torturing and jailing athletes.       The London-based human rights group Indict said the      committee once made a group of track athletes crawl on newly      poured asphalt while they were beaten and threw some of them      off a bridge. Indict also said Odai ran a special prison for      athletes who offended him. The International Olympic      Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, said earlier this year      that it was investigating the allegations.       One defector told Indict that jailed soccer players were      forced to kick a concrete ball after failing to reach the      1994 World Cup finals. Another defector said athletes were      dragged through a gravel pit and then dunked in a sewage tank      so infection would set in.       Army officers also were fair game for Odai's outbursts of      violence. In 1983, Odai reportedly bashed an army officer      unconscious when the man refused to allow Odai to dance with      his wife. The officer later died. Odai also shot an army      officer who did not salute him.       Things were hardly better on the family front, where      relations between Odai and his uncles were especially bad.      Oadi reportedly divorced the daughter of one uncle, Barzan      Ibrahim Hasan, in 1995 after she complained of being beaten.      Odai shot and wounded another uncle, Watban Ibrahim Hasan.      Both uncles were captured after the war and are in the      custody of U.S. coalition forces.       While millions of Iraqis suffered dire poverty, Odai lived      a life of fast cars, expensive liquor and easy women. When      U.S. troops captured his mansion in Baghdad, they found a      personal zoo with lions and cheetahs, an underground parking      garage for his collection of luxury cars, Cuban cigars with      his name on the wrapper, and $1 million in fine wines,      liquor--and even heroin.       Odai's obsession with sex was evident everywhere: The house      was adorned with paintings of naked women and photographs of      prostitutes taken off the Internet, complete with handwritten      ratings of each.       There were bags and boxes of pills and medicines      everywhere--ginseng sexual fortifiers, heartburn medication,      the anti-depressant Prozac--and an Accu-Rite HIV Antibodies      Screening Test Kit was in Odai's office.       Nearby was a domed house believed to be the residence of      Odai's concubines, a bastion of bad taste with statuettes of      couples in foreplay, couches with fluffy pillows and a      swimming pool with a bar.                                  ____                  Qusai Hussein, Younger Son of Saddam       Baghdad, Iraq.--Qusai Hussein, Saddam Hussein's younger      son, held wide-ranging powers over the nation's ruthless      security apparatus that made him one of the most feared men      in Iraq.       Qusai is No. 2 on the U.S.-led coalition forces' list of      the 55 most wanted men from the former Iraqi regime, behind      only Saddam himself. He is also on a Bush administration list      of former Iraqi regime members who could be tried for war      crimes.       Quiet, handsome and every bit as brutal as Saddam, the 37-     year-old Qusai headed Iraq's intelligence and security      services, his father's personal security force and the      Republican Guard, an elite force of 80,000 soldiers      responsible for defending Baghdad.       He stayed out of the public eye and led a substantially      more subdued private life than his older brother Odai, who      collected luxury cars by the hundreds and had a habit of      ordering his guards to snatch young women off the street in      order to rape them. Iraqis nicknamed Qusai ``The Snake'' for      his bloodthirsty but low-profile manner.       Qusai was far more trusted by his father and appeared to be      his heir before the regime crumbled. In televised meeting      with top security and military men, Qusai was seated next to      his father, wearing well-tailored suits and dutifully noting      his father's every word.       An exiled dissident told The Associated Press that only      Qusai and Saddam's private secretary, Abid Hamid Mahmud al-     Tikriti, who was captured in June, were kept informed of      Saddam's whereabouts. Odai was thought to be too reckless to      be trusted with such information.       Experts do not believe Qusai played a significant role in      the Gulf War of 1991. But he was a leading figure of terror      in the conflict's aftermath, using mass executions and      torture to crush the Shiite Muslim uprising after that war.       Qusai also helped engineer the destruction of the southern      marshes in the 1990s, an action aimed at Shiite ``Marsh      Arabs'' living there.       The marshes--roughly 3,200 square miles--had provided the      necessities of life for tens of thousands of marsh dwellers      for at least 1,000 years. The area was destroyed through a      large-scale water diversion project intended to remove the      ability of insurgents to hide there.       Qusai also oversaw Iraq's notorious detention centers and      is believed to have initiated ``prison cleansing''--a means      of relieving severe overcrowding in jails with arbitrary      killings.       Citing testimony from former Iraqi intelligence officers      and other state employees, New York-based Human Rights Watch      said several thousand inmates were executed at Iraq's prisons      over the past several years.       Prisoners were often eliminated with a bullet to the head,      but one witness told the London-based human rights group      Indict that inmates were sometimes murdered by being dropped      into shredding machines. Some prisoners went in head first      and died quickly, while others were put in feet first and      died screaming. The witness said that on at least one      occasion, Qusai supervised shredding-machine murders.       On another occasion, a witness said, an inmate's foot was      cut off in prison torture room while Qusai was present. ``The      amputation had been carried out with a power saw during his      torture under the direct supervision of Qusai,'' the witness      told Indict.       Qusai was made chief of the army branch for the ruling      Baath party in 2000, meaning virtually all the army's      movements were under his supervision. Just before this year's     war began, he was put in charge of defending the nation's      capital and heartland.       Qusai was spared any real combat during the 1980-88 Iran-     Iraq war, although state television showed him conferring      with commanders. He did not do any of the compulsory military      service required of most Iraqi men.       Qusai wed the daughter of a respected senior military      commander. The couple, who later separated, had two      daughters.  Mr. McCONNELL. First, let's take a look at Qusay Hussein. Qusay was No. 2 on our list of 55 most wanted men from the former Iraqi regime, behind only his father Saddam. He is also on the Bush administration list of former Iraqi regime members who could have been tried for war crimes. Let's take a look at what he did, not only to help control the regime but apparently also for his own personal amusement. The AP says:       Quiet, handsome, and every bit as brutal as Saddam, the 37-     year-old Qusai headed Iraq's intelligence and security      services, his father's personal security force and the      Republican Guard, [which we all know was supposedly] an elite      group of 80,000 soldiers responsible for defending Baghdad.  That was his portfolio in the regime.       Iraqis nicknamed Qusay ``The Snake'' for his bloodthirsty      but low-profile manner. He was a leading figure of terror in      the conflict aftermath of the gulf war in 1991, using mass      executions and torture to crush the Shiite Muslim uprising      after the Persian Gulf war.  The AP says Qusay also helped engineer the destruction of the southern marshes in the 1990s aimed at Shiite Marsh Arabs who had lived there for over 1,000 years.       Qusay also oversaw Iraq's notorious detention centers and      was believed to have initiated ``prison cleansing''--a means      of relieving severe overcrowding in jails.  That is a unique way to deal with jail overcrowding--the way they did it in Iraq--by eliminating the prisoners.       Citing testimony from former Iraqi intelligence officers      and other state employees, New York-based Human Rights Watch      said several thousand inmates were executed at Iraq's prisons      over the past several years.  One of the things Qusay liked to do in overseeing these prison executions was to feed the prisoners into shredders. The lucky prisoners were the ones who got fed into the shredders head first because they died quickly. The unlucky prisoners were the ones who were fed into shredders feet first.  This was Qusay Hussein--eliminated by the 101st Airborne yesterday, No. 2 on our list of most wanted from the Saddam Hussein regime.       Qusay was made chief of the army branch for the ruling      Baath Party in 2000, meaning virtually all of the movements      were under his supervision.  This man was a complete monster. Thanks to the 101st Airborne, he is no longer able to terrorize Iraqi citizens.       Let's take a look at Uday, No. 3 on the list, the murderous      and erratic oldest son of Saddam Hussein.  He controlled the propaganda in Iraq and allegedly oversaw the torture of athletes who failed to perform. Talk about an incentive. In Iraq, if you were an athlete and you didn't measure up, you got to meet Uday Hussein, No. 3 on the most wanted list, only eclipsed by his younger brother, whose activities I just described, and his father, who is No. 1 on the list.       Uday was head of the paramilitary Fedayeen Saddam unit.      Uday helped his father eliminate opponents and exert iron-     fisted control over the 25 million people in Iraq. Iraqi      exiles tell us that Uday murdered at will and tortured with      zeal--  Murdered at will and tortured with zeal, and routinely ordered his guards to snatch young women off the streets--routinely ordered his guards to attack young women on the streets--to bring them in for his personal pleasure. So he was raping them.  Uday was fascinated with prisoners as well. Like his younger brother, he would order the prisoners to be dropped into acid baths as punishment. His tendency toward erratic brutality even eclipsed his father's. That is pretty hard to imagine--that you could be so outrageous and so brutal that you could outrate Saddam Hussein. But apparently that is what happened. He was temporarily banished after he killed one of his father's favorite bodyguards in 1988.       Much of Uday's notoriety abroad stemmed from his position      as head of the National Iraqi Olympic Committee, which was      accused of torturing and jailing athletes. The London-based      human rights group Indict said the committee once made a      group of track athletes crawl on newly poured asphalt while      they were beaten, and he also threw some of them off a      bridge. Indict also said Uday ran a special prison for      athletes who offended him.  This was Uday Hussein.       One defector told Indict that jailed soccer players were      forced to kick a concrete ball after failing to reach the      1994 World Cup finals. Another defector said athletes were      dragged through a gravel pit and then dunked in a sewage tank      so that infection would set in.       While millions of Iraqis suffered dire poverty, Uday lived      a life of fast cars and expensive liquor. When U.S. troops      captured his mansion in Baghdad, they found a personal zoo.  The man had his own personal zoo with lions and cheetahs--     and an underground parking garage for his collection of      luxury cars, Cuban cigars with his name on the wrapper, and      $1 million in fine wines, liquor, and even heroin.  This was Uday Hussein.  In this country, we rarely applaud the deaths of anyone. But these two monsters--No. 2 and No. 3 on the list of the regime that we are tracking in Iraq--will no longer be able to prey on the citizens of Iraq for their own amusement. No longer will Iraqis live in fear of night-time visits from the Fedayeen and the secret police. No longer will Iraqi athletes fear being tortured for failure to win a soccer game. No longer will young Iraqi brides be forcibly taken from their families on their wedding day to be exploited by Uday Hussein.  Knowing what we now know about the Saddam Hussein regime and its penchant for brutality, it is abundantly clear that as a result of ridding Iraq of this evil Iraqi, the world is a better place.  Are we finished with the job in Iraq? Not yet. But yesterday was a day of great progress. No. 2 and No. 3 are no longer available to prey on the citizens of Iraq. We believe No. 1--Saddam Hussein--is still alive. And we are on his trail. And he will been brought to justice.  I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
