President, I can explain this easily. It is a bipartisan amendment. I offer it on behalf of myself and Senators Thomas, Stevens, Roberts, Pryor, Sanders, Enzi, Hatch, and Whitehouse to restore the minimum allocation for States under the State Homeland Security Grant Program. Right now, in the underlying bill, it is proposed at .45 percent. Our amendment would restore it to current law which is .75. That means that every State would have, of the homeland security money, at least .75 percent of it.  I should point out, incidentally, as with current law, our State minimum, under our amendment, would apply only to 40 percent of the overall funding of this program. This may sound somewhat tricky, but what it means iswe have special funding for certain unique areas--ports areas, large cities and all--but this applies to only 40 percent of the overall funding.
