Speaker, I would like to pay tribute to an outstanding American, an outstanding soldier, and an outstanding officer who has contributed immeasurably to the good relations between the Army and the House of Representatives. On December 31, 1999, Colonel Carl J. Leininger retires after over 28 years of dedicated service to America and our great Army. Throughout his career, Carl Leininger has provided forward-looking leadership characterized by a unique intellect and strategic vision. He has served with distinction in positions of increasing responsibility from platoon to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, always demonstrating the highest degree of leadership and professionalism, while making lasting contributions to Army readiness and mission accomplishment.  As we honor his retirement, we note that Colonel Leininger's distinguished career has stretched nearly three decades, culminating in his service as Chief of the Army's Congressional Activities Division. In this position, Colonel Leininger has served as principal advisor to the Army's senior leaders for their personal meetings with Members of Congress, and for their testimony before committees of this House. He has ensured that the Army's senior leaders provide a coherent, cohesive and meaningful message to the Congress. Colonel Leininger has also contributed to the increasingly effective relations between the Army and the House with his active sponsorship of an annual Congressional Briefing Conference for the Army's Congressional Actions Contact Officers, allowing Members to connect with those managing the planning and programming of Army resources.  Colonel Carl Leininger was born in Pennsylvania, but grew up Indiana. Carl and I graduated together from Andrean High School in 1967. There our paths diverged, I staying home to attend Indiana University, and Carl heading to the banks of the Hudson to attend the United States Military Academy. While there, he played basketball for someone who has since become an Indiana institution, Coach Bob Knight. Graduating from West Point in 1971, Carl was commissioned a second lieutenant of infantry. After receiving his Airborne wings and Ranger tab, Carl's first assignment was as an infantry platoon leader in the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colorado.  Colonel Leininger then transferred to Military Intelligence, serving in intelligence assignments at battalion, division, the Army's Intelligence Threat and Analysis Center, and Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe. Carl also received a masters in political science from Yale, taught social science at West Point, and served as an Army congressional fellow to another Indiana legend, Representative Lee Hamilton.  For the last decade, Carl Leininger has served at the highest levels of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Army, and the Defense Department. He served as a speech writer to the SACEUR, the Army Chief of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense. He also servedas Chief of the Army's Congressional Activities Division. In these positions, Carl has exhibited that rare combination of Midwestern-bred common sense, Ivy League-honed scholarship, and West Point-forged sense of Duty, Honor and Country in making extremely complicated issues readily understandable for senior Defense and Army officials, Members of Congress, and the public at large.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and all of my colleagues join me in congratulating Colonel Leininger on a productive and happy retirement. I offer my personal thanks to my longtime friend, a soldier whose selfless service has truly made a difference, Colonel Carl Leininger.                          ____________________
