 According to reports, on Saturday evening, Deputy Hulsey was attacked while investigating a suspect and pronounced dead at the hospital hours later.  Deputy Hulsey proudly answered the call of public service with a decades-long career that also included time as a firefighter and a paramedic. His service left his community safer, and his sacrifice left it in grief. I stand with them in mourning his loss and honoring his service. The community will hold a candlelight vigil tonight to honor this Kentucky hero. The prayers of the Senate will be with them.                          ____________________
