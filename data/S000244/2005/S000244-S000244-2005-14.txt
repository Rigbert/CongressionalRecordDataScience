Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 4647) to amend the USA PATRIOT ACT to extend the sunset of certain provisions of such Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
