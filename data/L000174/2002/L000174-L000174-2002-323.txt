It is with much pride and admiration that I congratulate the United Way of Chittenden County for 60 years of service in the greater Burlington area.  For the past 60 years, the United Way of Chittenden County has been providing relief and assistance to its community. In October of 1942, founders Henry Way, C.P. Hasbrook, and I. Munn Boardman started the Burlington Community Chest. The chest's first campaign raised over $100,000 to help organizations like the Burlington Boys Club, the YMCA and the Salvation Army. Over the years, the chest evolved into the United Way of Chittenden County, one of Chittenden County's foremost benefactors, a community-based, problem-solving organization. This past year, the United Way of Chittenden County raised a record $3.75 million to help its neighbors, both local and afar. This is a remarkable sum, and one that reflects the strong commitment of the United Way to support the welfare and growth of Vermont and her people.  The United Way of Chittenden County has become much more than a fundraising organization. They now train volunteers and coordinate a vast number of mentoring opportunities in Chittenden County, working with both national programs, like America Reads and the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, and local groups, including Vermont's many museums, schools, and conservation societies. The United Way works to make Chittenden County a stronger community, tending to those in need. The many people who work and volunteer for the United Way become community supporters and community leaders. After graduating from law school, I was recruited to do my part and volunteer for the United Way of Chittenden County. It was a meaningful experience and one that has remained in the front of my memory during my 27 years in the U.S. Senate. Just as impressive as the volunteers of the United Way are those who benefit from the United Way's programs. They too become active and contributing members and leaders of their communities.  The organization's actions following the unspeakable events of September 11, 2001, demonstrated the strength and commitment of the United Way of Chittenden County. The United Ways of Vermont contributed $400,000 to the September 11th Fund, including over $200,000 from the United Way of Chittenden County. At the same time, the United Way of Chittenden County still managed to raise more funds for Vermont's programs than any previous year. This accomplishment is due in no small part to Campaign Chair Lisa Ventriss, whose devotion ensured that the United Way will continue helping Vermonters, even while it contributes to a national cause of such gravity and importance. This feat is a testament to the generosity and dedication of the United Way of Chittenden County, and of all Vermonters.  I would like to thank Gretchen Morse, the executive director of the United Way of Chittenden County, for her commitment to this organization's success and Vermont's well-being. Her leadership has helped keep the United Way of Chittenden County one of the most cost-effective charities of its kind. Indeed, 85 cents of every dollar collected by the United Way of Chittenden County goes directly back to the community, a number well above the national average. Given this organization's unyielding support, it is no surprise that the United Way State of Caring Index now ranks Vermont as the fifth most caring State in the Union.  Sixty years after its founding, the United Way of Chittenden County remains a model for charitable organizations across the State and across the country. I join the people of Chittenden County, VT, and the entire Nation in thanking the United Way for six decades of community service.                          ____________________
