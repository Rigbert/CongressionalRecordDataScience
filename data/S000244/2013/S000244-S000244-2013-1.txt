 I sponsored this legislation to improve the ability to protect the United States from terrorist attacks, including attacks using weapons of mass destruction or attacks involving ships and maritime platforms.  H.R. 1073 implements obligations of four multilateral counterterrorism treaties. Full ratification of the underlying treaties will not be achieved until Congress amends existing criminal provisions of the United States Code.  This legislation was prepared in full cooperation with our Democratic colleagues on the committee, following months of work by committee staff in consultation with the Departments of Justice and State.  The importance of this bipartisan legislation is evidenced by those who have joined me as original cosponsors: the gentleman from Virginia, Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte; Ranking Member John Conyers; and Crime Subcommittee Ranking Member Bobby Scott.  Two of these treaties concern nuclear and radiological materials, the sabotage of nuclear facilities, and the protection of nuclear facilities and materials used for peaceful purposes. The other two treaties relate to the use or targeting of ships or maritime platforms as a part of a terrorist attack, transporting of certain materials by ship for terrorist purposes, and the transport of terrorists by ship, among other things.  The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism was signed by President Bush on behalf of the United States on September 14, 2005. It requires the U.S. to criminalize certain unlawful acts relating to the possession and use of radioactive material and radiological dispersal devices and damage to nuclear facilities.                              {time}  1720  An amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which was adopted at a diplomatic conference on July 25, 2005, requires the U.S. to criminalize nuclear smuggling and sabotage of nuclear facilities. The 2005 Protocol to the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation requires parties to criminalize the use or targeting of a ship or a fixed maritime platform in an act of terrorism. The Protocol forbids certain maritime terrorism acts and the maritime transport of biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons, or their components, delivery means, or materials under specified circumstances. It also forbids the maritime transport of terrorist fugitives. The 2005 Protocol to the 1988 Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf criminalizes terrorist acts involving a fixed maritime platform.  To combat these types of terrorist threats effectively, we need both a comprehensive domestic legal framework and a broad international legal framework to facilitate international cooperation. Existing law may cover certain obligations under these treaties, but in order to fully comply and ultimately ratify the treaties, parties to the agreements are required to criminalize certain conduct and to fulfill extradition requirements and other obligations relating to international cooperation.  Parties to the underlying treaties are required to criminalize certain acts committed by persons who possess or use radioactive material or a nuclear device. And parties are obligated to ``extradite or prosecute'' alleged offenders. As they relate to maritime terrorism, the underlying treaties treat vessels and fixed maritime platforms as a potential means of conducting terrorism activity and not just as objects of terrorist activity.  Both the Bush and Obama administrations support ratification of these agreements, which have already received Senate advice and consent. Advancing this legislation strengthens international cooperation and information-sharing, and will ensure that the United States stays at the forefront of global counterterrorism and counterproliferation efforts. These measures are consistent with our domestic efforts to improve homeland security and to promote better international cooperation.  It is my hope the Senate will act swiftly to pass this legislation so that these important multilateral agreements can finally be ratified. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.
