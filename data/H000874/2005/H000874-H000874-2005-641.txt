Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the leader.  Given the time that is allocated to this bill, I presume, as the Leader has apparently indicated, that it is the expectation of the Committee on Rules to have a full amendatory process. My expectation is you are not going to have a fully open rule but that you would have some modified open rule. Am I correct on that?  I yield to the gentleman from Texas.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Obviously, I cannot anticipate what the Committee on Rules may do on this bill.
