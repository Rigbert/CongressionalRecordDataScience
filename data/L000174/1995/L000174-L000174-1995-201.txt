President, I am concerned that the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) continue to develop and implement the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC). This Center is the only on-line national database available to identify criminal illegal aliens.  The LESC is a valuable asset and essential to our national immigration policy. The Center provides local, state and federal law enforcement agencies with 24-hour access to data on criminal aliens. By identifying these aliens, LESC allows law enforcement agencies to expedite deportation proceedings against them.  The Center was authorized in the 1994 Crime Bill. The first year of operations has been impressive as the 24-hour team identified over 10,000 criminal aliens. After starting up with a link to law enforcement agencies in one county in Arizona, the LESC expanded its coverage to the entire state. In 1996, the LESC is expected to be on-line with California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington.  The House and Senate Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bills do not expressly provide funding for the LESC. The LESC is available now and is proving to be an effective resource for law enforcement agencies.  We owe it to states with illegal alien problems to support the only system available to identify criminal aliens. INS Commissioner Doris Meissner supports it. Commissioner Meissner recently wrote to me reaffirming INS' commitment to the LESC. I urge setting aside $3.8 million within the INS budget to allow the LESC to continue its valuable work. Accordingly, I ask the Chairman whether the bill will allow INS to continue to fund the LESC at $3.8 million for fiscal year 1996?
