 President, last week, a new book hit the stands titled ``Blood Sport.'' It is written by Mr. James B. Stewart.  The book is an account of the Whitewater issue. Many of us have had trouble understanding the issue. Reading this book helps. It makes a complicated financial scandal read more like a story.  Mr. Stewart was given access to sources by the White House. In part, it was because he is ideologically compatible with the Clintons. Those are Mr. Stewart's bona fides for the book he writes about the President and the First Lady.  In his own words, Mr. Stewart paints the character of the first couple this way:       [T]he Clintons themselves proved no different from their      recent predecessors in the White House, deeply enmeshed in a      Washington culture so accustomed to partisan distortion and      ``spin'' that truth is the most frightening prospect of all.  Let me repeat that last phrase, Mr. President: `` * * * that truth is the most frightening prospect of all.''  Mr. Stewart's observation seems to substantiate those of columnist Charles Krauthammer. On January 12, Mr. Krauthammer's column appeared in the Washington Post under the title, ``Why Whitewater Now?'' In it, he calls Whitewater ``a scandal that appears to be all coverup and no crime.'' He then asks the logical question: Why would there be a coverup if there's no crime? He asks the question of both Whitewater and Travelgate.  Here is his conclusion: ``Because the vanity of the Clintons is not that they are merely law abiding * * * but that they are morally superior.''  In Whitewater, the Clintons certainly are vulnerable. In October 1991, bill Clinton said: ``Let's not forget that the most irresponsible people of all in the 1980s were * * * those who sold out our savings and loans with bogus deals.''  Meanwhile, we now find that Mrs. Clinton drafted the option papers for Castle Grande on behalf of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. Federal regulators have called Castle Grande a sham operation. Isn't it fair, then, to lump the Clintons into the same category of, using Clinton's words, ``the most irresponsible people of all in the 1980s?''  In Travelgate, the Clintons are once again vulnerable. Using Mr. Krauthammer's words, the ``morally superior'' Clintons, had an interest in covering up their nonillegal actions. After all, just how morally superior can one be when sacking seven innocent employees for a relative and a rich Hollywood crony, who, both, by the way, advised the action and stood to profit from it?  And finally, there's Cattlegate. During the 1992 campaign, the Clintons railed against Wall Street's high rollers. We later learn that the First Lady's luck had turned $1,000 into $100,000. Once again, the target of the Clintons' railing might well have included the Clintons themselves.  Mr. Krauthammer sums this all up in a phrase: ``Political duplicity.'' He says: ``[T]he offense is hypocrisy of a high order. Having posed as our moral betters, they had to cover up. At stake is their image * * * ''  Mr. President, it is my view that there's a serious lack of moral leadership in the White House. By moral, I mean basic values such as honesty, trust, forthrightness. It is the quality most needed in the Presidency--in a President. The governed expect that their elected officials, their leaders, will be role models.  Franklin Roosevelt is a more credible source than I on this point. He once said: ``The Presidency is not merely an administrative office * * * It is more than an engineering job * * * It is pre-eminently a place of moral leadership.''  Clearly, FDR understood the importance of the First Family setting an exemplary standard for the governed.  I feel obliged to share these observations, Mr. President. Having long been a student of politics and history, I adopted a view held by another Roosevelt--Teddy Roosevelt. He commented on how important it is to criticize the President when warranted:       [I]t is absolutely necessary that there should be full      liberty to tell the truth about his acts * * * Any other      attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To      announce that there must be no criticism of the President * *      * is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally      treasonable to the American public * * * It is even more      important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about      him than about any one else.  Mr. President, I feel the same obligation felt by Teddy Roosevelt--to tell the truth about the President. Pleasant or unpleasant. And the crucial issue is the same one proclaimed by Franklin Roosevelt--moral leadership.  In my view, there is a void in this White House of moral leadership. As we approach a new era, a new millenium, and a new world, this is not desirable. How can we be leaders of the free world without strong leadership at home?  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
