President, today I am joining some of my colleagues from the Environment and Public Works Committee in introducing a bill to reauthorize the Economic Development Administration, EDA. EDA works with partners in economically distressed communities to create wealth and minimize poverty by promoting favorable business environments to attract private investment and encourage long-term economic growth.  I have long been a strong supporter of EDA. I believe the agency does an outstanding job of providing relatively small grants that help secure significant amounts of private investment in distressed communities across the country. Contrary to what some people would say, the government itself does not--frankly, cannot--expand the economy and create long-term jobs. That is the role of the private sector.  What the government can do, however, is help provide the right conditions for private sector investments to flourish. EDA does this in a myriad of ways, but primarily through infrastructure investments. I only wish more of the so-called ``stimulus'' bill enacted earlier this year had been dedicated to programs like EDA that are truly successful at spurring economic development.  Unlike the majority of the spending in the so-called ``stimulus'' bill, EDA investments actually provide economic benefits. In fact, studies show that EDA uses federal dollars efficiently and effectively, creating and retaining long-term jobs at an average cost that is among the lowest in government.  In my home State of Oklahoma, for example, EDA has worked long and hard with many communities in need to bring in private capital investment and jobs. Durant, Clinton, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Seminole, Elk City, Muskogee, Woodward, Shawnee, Claremore, Miami and Elgin are just some of the Oklahoma communities that have made good use of EDA assistance. In fact, over the past seven years, EDA grants awarded in my home state have resulted in more than 9,000 jobs being created. With an investment of about $33 million, we have leveraged another 32.7 million in State and local dollars and more than 625 million in private sector dollars. I would call that a wonderful success story.  Authorization of FDA's programs expired on September 30, 2008. I had introduced a reauthorization bill in July, 2008, and the EPW Committee reported a bipartisan bill in September 2008. Unfortunately the bill was not enacted. I again introduced my own reauthorization bill in February of this year. Today I am happy to join my colleagues in introducing a similar bill that I hope will be approved by the Committee and the full Senate in the very near future. Particularly in these difficult economic times, we should be doing all we can to ensure the continuation of successful economic development programs, and EDA reauthorization is an important step.                          ____________________
