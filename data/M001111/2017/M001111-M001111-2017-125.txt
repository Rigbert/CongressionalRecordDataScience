 President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his passionate remarks on this topic. I have had the opportunity over most of Friday and over the last 23 hours, to listen to my colleagues come to the floor and speak passionately about an issue they care about, speaking against DeVos. We heard very little passionate speaking for Betsy DeVos, but we heard a tremendous amount of passion against.  I want to thank the Senator from Ohio, in particular, speaking to the issue of the fact that Mrs. DeVos does owe a fine to Ohio that has not been paid. I find it incredulous that we are just dismissing that here and the Senators are voting for her.
