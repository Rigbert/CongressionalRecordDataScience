Under the previous order, we will have up to 1 hour of debate prior to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed. The cloture vote will be at approximately 11:45 a.m., and that will be the first vote of tomorrow's session. It is my hope that cloture will be invoked and further that we would be able to move to the bill without using the full 30 hours of postcloture debate. Once on the bill, we will move forward with the amending process. Senators should expect additional rollcall votes during tomorrow's session.  On behalf of the leader, I inform my colleagues we will have a busy week leading into next week's recess. In addition to the highway bill, we will act on the budget resolution conference report once it becomes available. There are a couple of important nominations expected to be reported out of the committee this week that we hope to act upon, as well. Rollcall votes are expected each day this week, and Senators are asked to plan their schedules accordingly.                          ____________________[Page S4215]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM
