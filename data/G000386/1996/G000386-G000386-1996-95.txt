 President, this information is included in the President's budget each year, thanks to my request a few years ago. Cargo preferences does cost taxpayers $600 million per year. One is from the fiscal year 1997 budget and the other is from the fiscal year 1996 budget.  Mr. President, the Federal Government relies only upon numbers from OMB or CBO. We cannot use numbers from our budgeting process that come from any other source.  The Senator from Alaska quoted cargo preference cost estimates that differ from the OMB numbers I quoted.  He knows, and we all know, that these non-OMB or CBO numbers cannot be used here.  I yield the floor.
