 CORNYN. Mr. President, that is a sad but true statement. It is unbelievable to me that the Mexican Government, under President Lopez Obrador, is doing more than congressional Democrats to try to solve this humanitarian and security crisis, but that is where we are.  Mr. McCONNELL. I would just add that I hope there is success in the Judiciary Committee to achieve some kind of bipartisan consensus so that we can solve the entire problem, not just the humanitarian crisis.  I thank the Senator from Texas.
