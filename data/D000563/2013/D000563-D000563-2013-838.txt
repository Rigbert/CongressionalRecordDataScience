 For 12 years, when Illinoisans walked into Senator Alan Dixon's office--and then later into Senator Paul Simon's office--there was a pretty good chance that they would be greeted by the friendly, warm smile of Yvonne Rice.  She would work with them to solve whatever problems they may have had or to make sure they got the help they needed.  Thanks to her efforts, more often than not those Illinoisans walked away happy--and with one less thing to worry about.  But her service to her community wasn't limited by the walls of a Senate office. She worked in the Illinois State government for many years before joining the Dixon team and then working with Senator Simon.  She also broke new ground when she became the first African-American nominated by a major party for county-wide office in Sangamon County--the capital county of my home State.  Yvonne truly was a remarkable, wonderful, and spirited woman.  She will be dearly missed by her children, stepchildren, grandkids, great-grandkids and all of those--including my wife Loretta and myself--who were fortunate enough to know her.                          ____________________
