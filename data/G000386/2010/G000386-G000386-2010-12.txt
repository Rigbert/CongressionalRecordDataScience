 President, I am going to take 2\1/2\ minutes to address what the Senator from Arizona said about some of the provisions in this bill. We keep having ethanol referred to as a subsidy.  Let me tell you about some of the subsidies that are in this bill because you might think that ethanol is the only one. Think in terms of the research and development tax credit. That is subsidy for big business that has been around for 30 years. Think about the Indian employment tax credit, the subsidy for new market tax credits, the subsidy for railroad track maintenance credit, mine rescue team training credit, the subsidy for employer wage credit for employees who are on Active Duty in the uniformed services, the subsidy for 15-year straight line cost recovery for qualified leaseholder improvements, the subsidy for the 7-year recovery period for motor sports entertainment complexes.  I don't quite understand, when there are 72 provisions in this bill that expired on December 31, 2009, and they are just being continued as some of them have been for 30 years, how somebody today is going to say that is bad tax policy and they did not say it over the last 30 years, particularly when it comes to a time when we know we need a balanced alternative energy program--balanced for whatever can be alternative energy because God only made so much fossil fuel. Obviously, we ought to be using petroleum. But should we import more petroleum from the 10 percent of the fuel used in motor vehicles coming from ethanol? Do you believe we ought to have a good national security program that is less based upon the requirements of imported oil?  I think we ought to look at this balanced program as being one of fossil fuel, one of alternative energy, and one of conservation and ethanol and biodiesel and wind and solar and all that is part of a balanced program, and they all have tax incentives.  I yield the floor.                             Cloture Motion
