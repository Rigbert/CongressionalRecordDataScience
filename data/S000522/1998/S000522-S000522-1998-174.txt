Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, first I want to commend the distinguished member of our Committee on International Relations for his amendment. I strongly urge its adoption.  The amendment of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) expands the responsibilities of the director of the new Office of Religious Persecution Monitoring in several ways. The net effect would be to give the director a role in advising the President and the Secretary of State on additional steps that the United States can take to advance religious freedom around the world, including in such areas as international broadcasting and international exchanges in personnel incentives for State Department employees.  Just to respond, and not to get back to general debate, but the gentleman from Florida raised a couple of issues against the bill. I do hope Members will realize that there is a very generous waiver provision, I think perhaps it is too generous, but it does provide for national security concerns. Also under the provisions of the bill, the sanctions can be waived if the President believes that it would substantially promote the purposes of this act.  It is about time we took religious freedom seriously. This legislation does so.  The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hamilton) earlier in the debate talked about the beheadings going on in Saudi Arabia. Usually they occur when somebody converts from being a Muslim to Christianity.  That is serious stuff. If we are going to look askance and act indifferent or raise our voice with nothing behind it, those beheadings will continue. But we must say very clearly and unambiguously that beheading people is something out of bounds and is truly egregious behavior, and certainly it is violative of all of the UN conventions, including the Declaration on Intolerance on Religion.                              {time}  1330  And so the stories need to conform, as do others, to these internationally recognized norms, and beheadings certainly are totally out of bounds, as is any other form of torture.  Mr. Chairman, I hope Members will support the bill, and again, I think this is a good amendment and I support it.
