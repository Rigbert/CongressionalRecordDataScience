 President, today I am privileged to honor Mrs. Virginia Ruth Long of Owsley County, KY. Mrs. Long, wife of Booneville mayor Charles Long, passed away at age 92 on March 27, 2012. A lifelong resident of Owsley County, Mrs. Long, a mother, beautician, and homemaker, was truly beloved by the Booneville community. It is with great respect that I recognize the First Lady of Booneville and her lifetime of commitment and service to Booneville and the people of her community.  Mrs. Long was born in Indian Creek, KY, on October 1, 1919. She graduated from Owsley County High School in 1938. Upon her graduation, she attended cosmetology school in Lexington. After completing her schooling, Mrs. Long returned to her home, Owsley County, where she opened the first beauty shop in Booneville.  In 1939, she married Charles Long. The two were married for 73 years and had two children: Charlotte and Charles Edwin. Mrs. Long not only raised her children and maintained the home but also worked for 62 years in her beauty parlor. She quickly became a staple of Booneville, and many women in Owsley County recall her being the first person to ever style their hair professionally.  Ruth's contributions to the Booneville community stemmed from running a business, raising a family, and playing a major role in her husband's public career. A World War II veteran and mayor of Booneville for 54 years, Charles Long is no stranger to public service. Through the many years that Charles has served the Booneville community, Mrs. Long remained a constant partner to him and accompanied him on many trips he made as Booneville mayor.  Though Ruth was a source of strength for her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Long equally relied upon one other. During one of Mr. Long's trips as Booneville mayor, Mrs. Long fell and broke her hip. Despite the demands of his public post, Mr. Long extended his trip by 3 weeks to help her recover from her injury. The couple was again tested in 2010 when their daughter, Charlotte, passed away. Though this tragic time was very difficult, as it would be for any parent who loses a child, Mr. and Mrs. Long's faith and reliance upon each other helped them to cope with such a great loss. Ultimately, Ruth was able to still find joy in her life through her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  Apart from being loved by her family, Mrs. Long was beloved by the Owsley County community. She was a faithful member of the First Presbyterian Church of Booneville. She was also famed for having the best angel food cake in the county. However, more importantly, it was her warm, inviting nature that caused members of the community to come to love and admire Mrs. Long. An avid storyteller, she was a friend to all. After her death, many members of the community said they became better people by knowing Mrs. Long.  I am honored to memorialize Ruth today as a lifetime servant of Owsley County. Without holding public office, she dutifully served her Booneville community through her devotion to her husband, Mayor Charles Long, and her life of friendship with its citizens. Kentuckians who live dedicated, humble lives of service like Mrs. Long are what make our Commonwealth strong. Today I ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in remembering Mrs. Virginia Ruth Long, the First Lady of Booneville, KY.  Mr. President, an article was recently published by the Booneville Sentinel, an Owsley County-area publication, recognizing the life of Mrs. Long. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Booneville Sentinel, May 10, 2012]              Tribute for the ``First Lady of Booneville''       Virginia Ruth Long was born in Indian Creek in Owsley      County on October 1, 1919. She later moved to Cow Creek, also      in     Owsley County, where she went to school at Athlenia Grade      School. She graduated from Owsley County High School in 1938.       Ruth attended beauty school in Lexington, Kentucky. After      graduating, she came back to Booneville, where she opened the      first beauty shop and worked until she retired at age 62.      Even after Ruth retired, her previous clients would talk      about what a talented hairdresser she was. A lot of women say      that she was the first person who styled their hair.       She married in 1939 to Charles Long, who retired at age 62      also. There are three days difference in their ages. They      have been married for 73 years. Her husband Charles has been      mayor of Booneville for 54 years, and Ruth accompanied him on      many trips he made as mayor with the Kentucky River Area      Development District.       They went to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., and      many other meetings and events together. On one particular      trip to Salt Lake City, she fell in the Mormon Temple and      suffered a broken hip, where she and Charles stayed for      almost 3 weeks. Ruth always had many stories and had a way of      making them sound exciting. Ruth lived a life that most women      don't understand. When WWII started December 14, 1942,      Charles was called to active duty. Daughter Charlotte was      only 3 years old. Ruth had a son, Charles Edwin, on February      14, 1943. She cared for their home and children until he      returned home at the port in San Diego where she met him on      December 14, 1945. Ruth traveled to meet Charles whenever he      was close enough.       Ruth said it kept her busy cooking and keeping Charles's      clothes clean. Ruth was always awfully proud of their two      children. Charlotte, their daughter, taught school for over      36 years in Owsley County until she passed away on April 8,      2010. Their son, Charles Edwin Long, has a barber shop in      Frankfort, Kentucky, where he lives. They have three      grandchildren, one deceased, and now they have five great-     grandchildren that they loved to be with. I remember when      Charlotte passed that Ruth had said that a child should never      go on before the parent. This was a difficult time for both      Ruth and Charles, but they were there for each other as they      had been many other times over the years.       Ruth has been a faithful member of the First Presbyterian      Church of Booneville for over 60 years and enjoyed going to      church to listen to Joe Powlas and to visit with friends      following. She had the name of having the best angel food      cake around. At all her dinners at home and away, they wanted      her to bring her angel food cake, and also her dressing at      Thanksgiving and Christmas.       Ruth was 92 years old when she passed away in the morning      on March 27, 2012. She had been in the Owsley County Health      Care Center for over a year. She was a strong lady and was      always proud to say that she had led a very fulfilling and      happy life. Many people have expressed how she had touched      their lives just to offer her friendship. She will be greatly      missed by her friends and family greatly.                          ____________________
