Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Ella Mae Record, who passed away last month in California. Ella Mae was the matriarch of the Record family in San Jacinto Valley. She will be deeply missed.  Ella Mae was born at home in Torrance, California, on January 18, 1929. Her family moved to the San Jacinto Valley on New Year's Day, 1937, where she enrolled in school. It was in school that she developed a love for music and sports. She was named the sports writer for the school paper, editor of the yearbook, and was elected student body president her senior year. Ella Mae's summers were spent working on the family ranch learning to drive cars, trucks, tractors and mules. She married Clayton Record, Jr. on August 21, 1948. They lived in San Luis Obispo while Clayton was enrolled at Cal Poly and began their family while living in a small trailer in ``Vetville.''  In 1952, they returned to the San Jacinto Valley where Clayton worked the family dairy and Ella Mae concentrated on raising the family. Her passion was golf which she began pursuing in 1960 at Gilman Hot Springs before becoming an active member of Soboba Springs. She was club champion at both and president of the Woman's Golf Association. She realized her dream of living on a golf course when she joined the Sunrise Country Club in Rancho Mirage where she finally got her hole-in-one. Ella Mae's other interests included photography, obtaining her pilot license, owning a quarter horse, jeeping in the riverbed and serving on several boards of important valley organizations. She was preceded in death by her husband, Clayton Record and her son Clayton ``Claytie'' Record. She is survived by her sons, Mike, Randy, and Keith; daughter, Nanci, 10 grandchildren, and 13 great grandchildren.  I extend my heartfelt condolences to the entire Record family, friends, and everyone fortunate enough to know Ella Mae. Although Ella Mae is gone, the many contributions she made to our community and family will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
