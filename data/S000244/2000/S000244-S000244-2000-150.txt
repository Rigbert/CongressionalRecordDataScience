Speaker, on June 6, the citizens of Turkey were once again reminded that the ground beneath them is not always stable. An earthquake, which registered 5.9 on the Richter scale, shook the Cankiri province in Central Anatolia, but its reverberations were felt in Ankara, Bolu, Duzce, Kirikkale, Corum and Kastamonu. There were at least three casualties, and 81 people injured, and considerable damage to buildings nearby.  I visited Turkey last January, after it had experienced significant, earthquakes in August and November of 1999 resulting in the death of more than 17,000 people and the estimated loss of property of $40 billion. The Turkish people impressed me with their resilience and strength. Individuals from all walks of life rallied to assist those that had been less fortunate.  This latest earthquake is another example of the difficult task ahead for the Turkish Government and its people. The good news is that some of the world's foremost scientists in both Turkey and the U.S. have been studying the Anatolian fault, which runs east to west along the length of Turkey. This cooperation between our two nations has not only led to an increased understanding of the potential earthquake dangers in Turkey but also in the United States.  Unfortunately, most earthquake experts suspect that another severe earthquake will hit Turkey in the next two decades. The earthquake is likely to hit near Istanbul along the Anatolian fault. Such a quake is likely to be devastating. More needs to be done to prepare for this eventuality.  The Turkish Daily News reported that the Turkish government, which was criticized for being late to take measures after the 1999 earthquakes, was prompt to reacting to the June 6 quake. Officials said that with the lessons they had learned from the previous disaster, they were well organized and fulfilled their promise to send immediate help to the region.  I hope this portends well for the future. Dealing with the destructive power of earthquakes--as Turkey and so much of the World has discovered--is something that requires immense advance planning.  By continuing to work together, U.S. and Turkish scientists can help by increasing our understanding of the phenomena, enabling generalized predictions and improved building design. I look forward to continuing this close working relationship between U.S. and Turkish scientists.  During this difficult and challenging period, our hearts and thoughts are with the citizens of Turkey. Working together, I hope we can reduce the pain of these terrible earthquake tragedies.                          ____________________
