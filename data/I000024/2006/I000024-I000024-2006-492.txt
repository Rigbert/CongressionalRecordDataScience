President, I thank the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. Before he leaves the Chamber, I want to applaud the work Senator Specter has done in getting these judges confirmed. It has been heavy lifting. We all know that. We also know probably from looking back, when we look back 10 years or 20 years from now on accomplishments, that perhaps getting these judges confirmed will be the major accomplishment of this legislative session.                          ____________________[Pages S3428-S3429]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL JUDGE EDWARD R.
