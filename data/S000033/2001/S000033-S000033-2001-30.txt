 Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's sentiments, and I am the first to admit that more work needs to be done. But I think the gentleman will agree with me. The gentleman has seen some of the best people in his State lose their farms and go out of business. I have seen the same thing. I think we have to work together. I think this is a good start. We do not have a lot of time. I would appreciate the gentleman's support for the amendment and work with us so that we can make this a good amendment for Wisconsin and the Northeast and the whole country.
