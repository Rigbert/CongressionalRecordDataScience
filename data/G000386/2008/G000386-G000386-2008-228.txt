 President, I would like to take a few moments to pay tribute to a remarkable teacher who has touched the lives of countless students in Davenport, IA. Miss Barb Hess is retiring after 46 years teaching various social studies courses at Davenport Central High School.  Many of us can think back to one favorite teacher who stands out amongst all the rest; who because of a unique combination of personality and teaching skills, was able to spark an interest in a certain subject or learning in general. Miss Hess has been such a teacherfor an extraordinary number of students. Her profound impact on her students and on Central High is attested to by her colleagues who wrote me an impassioned letter recounting her impressive career, as well as by a great many of her former students, including a member of my staff.  In the classroom, Miss Hess commands respect and maintains discipline with only a few softly spoken but firm words, making clear that appropriate behavior is expected. She holds high academic expectations for her students, challenging them to achieve their potential. Her courses, many of which she developed herself, push students to think deeply and critically. Her students know that she expects papers to demonstrate clear writing with well reasoned arguments backed by solid research. In a time of much discussion about lack of rigor in high school coursework, Miss Hess's classes stand out as an example of rigorous preparation for higher education and other life-enriching opportunities.  Her high expectations for her students are a natural outgrowth of the high expectations she sets for herself. Although Miss Hess holds both a bachelor's and a master's degree from Drake University, she has never ceased to enhance her own knowledge of the subjects she teaches. She can always spot plagiarism, often because she is intimately familiar with the original source.  Outside the classroom, Miss Hess has been the adviser for the student council starting in 1974 and has advised numerous other student groups and organizations. In fact, she has organized, advised, or assisted with more functions at Davenport Central over the years than can be tallied. Barb Hess has been a loyal ``Blue Devil'' since her student days, consistently supporting sports teams, fine arts events, and other extracurricular activities over the years.  Barb Hess is a fixture at Davenport Central High School, having achieved near legendary status among those familiar with the school. Her imprint on the institution will continue to be felt very strongly. Her imprint on the lives of her students will be even more enduring. The best teachers combine extensive content knowledge with a certain intangible ability to connect with students and to inspire them to excel in school and life. Miss Hess's ability to care about each student as an individual, and unique talent for bringing out the best in students of all kinds, places her among the best of the best. She will be missed in her classroom at Central High, but her legacy of improving the lives of generations of students will last forever. I thank Barb Hess for her years of service to Iowa's youth and I wish her the very best in her retirement.                          ____________________
