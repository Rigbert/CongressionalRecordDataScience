 President, I congratulate our new Senator from Wisconsin, a very important addition to our caucus and to the Senate--a man who has actually run a business, actually employed people and created wealth in his State and our country. Having someone in the Senate who knows how to do that at this critical moment is absolutely essential, and I congratulate the new junior Senator from Wisconsin.
