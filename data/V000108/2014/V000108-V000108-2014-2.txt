Chairman, I appreciate the recognition, and I would strongly emphasize that I join with my chairman and colleague from New Jersey in support of his amendment. So that there is clarity as to the purpose of his offering this amendment, I would reiterate two of his remarks.  Over the last few months, we have had several instances in which National Security staff has mandated that the Department of Defense and other agencies selectively withhold information from congressional oversight committees, and in one case specifically, excluding the Appropriations Committee. As the chairman rightfully pointed out, the Congress is vested exclusively with the constitutional authority to fund that defense, and the authority in this instance rests with the Appropriations Committee.  The committee has included clear direction in the Fiscal Year 2014 DefenseAppropriations Act and in the House-passed Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2015 for the Department to report on the conduct of various programs as well as the obligation and expenditure of associated funding.                              {time}  1715  This direction addresses not only funds expressly provided in the Department's appropriations bill but Department actions that may cause the reprogramming of funds provided by the Congress.  Accurate, complete, and timely reporting by the Department of Defense is essential for the committee to conduct its oversight responsibilities. It informs committee deliberations to prepare the annual appropriations bills. It helps prepare the committee for negotiations with the Senate, and at present, it will help the committee formulate recommendations on the recently submitted fiscal year 2015 budget amendment on the overseas contingency operations.  The committee's responsibilities for funding are specific. Article I, section 9 of the Constitution states:       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in      consequence of appropriations made by law, and a regular      statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all      public money shall be published from time to time.  I strongly urge the adoption of the gentleman's amendment, which underscores the constitutional prerogative of the Congress as well as of the Committee on Appropriations.  I yield back the balance of my time.
