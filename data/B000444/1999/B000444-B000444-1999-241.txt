 President, I want to, in the minute or so I have left, congratulate the chairman of the committee for a job very well done. The managers' amendment, which he sent to the desk, I might point out, amends the legislation to name this legislation the Admiral James W. Nance Foreign Relations Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001.  Bud Nance was a man who was a dear, close friend to the chairman, and a close friend of many of us in the Senate. He served this country with extraordinary distinction in the final years of his life. He served as staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee.  One of Bud Nance's objectives, which he shared with the chairman, was that this particular legislation become law, and he began to reestablish the relevance of and the bipartisan nature of the committee. He deserves great credit for that. I think the idea of naming this legislation after him is very fitting and appropriate.  I thank the chairman again for his cooperation, for his willingness to listen, and for his help. He is a lucky man to have had such a close friend.  I yield the floor.
