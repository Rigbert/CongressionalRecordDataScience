Chair, these amendments eliminate as no longer necessary the Federal administrative subsidy for the Southeastern Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration and the Western Area Power Administration. These massive energy subsidies amount to what I call unauthorized megamarks. These energy subsidies, that began three decades ago to develop only the West and South, now cost the rest of America billions of dollars.  In fact, the Northeast, Florida, the Midwest, the Great Lakes States are heavily subsidizing the power systems of the West and South. I have a map here that kind of shows the parts of America that have a Federal power umbrella and those that don't. And it's really shocking to look at what the utility rates are. In Idaho, with federal energy subsidies, it costs residential consumers $7.98 per kilowatt hour. But guess what, in Ohio, that has no subsidy, it costs those residential consumers $11.34. In Wyoming, with power subsidies, it costs $8.39. But in Connecticut, with no subsidy, it costs those citizens $19.35 a kilowatt hour.  To achieve real budget savings, we must address megamark spending, not just district-targeted earmarks, but massive megamarks. These regional Federal power subsidies illustrate the problem. In fact, those subsidies, over only some regions, are privileges that the other regions of our country can't afford anymore. These regions have outlived their welcome in terms of subsidy. Those regions need to compete in the free market just like the rest of our regions do. No more free rides, because America can't afford it anymore.  My part of America can't afford the largesse given to the energy power marketing authorities in the other regions. The Southeastern Power Administration has never been operationally self-sufficient. It has cost the taxpayers $545 million, over half a billion dollars, since created in 1950.  Similarly, the Southwestern Power Administration has never been operationally self-sufficient, costing the taxpayers over $707 million since it was created in 1944. And WAPA, the Western Power Authority, has never been operationally self-sufficient. It has cost the taxpayers over $7 billion since being created in 1978.  Twenty-seven years of continued appropriations to only some regions seems like plenty of time for those agencies to have business plans in place to yield self-sufficiency and compete in the real marketplace like the rest of us are expected to do.                              {time}  1950  In my region of the Nation, we have no Federal power subsidy. Ohioans pay 11.3 cents per kilowatt hour, but Utah only pays 8.7 cents. Arkansas only pays 8.8 cents. But New York pays 18.6 cents. New York has no Federal power marketing subsidy. Citizens where I live tax themselves separately and locally through local tax levies for economic development. The Federal Government has never helped us on our power costs. Our energy is provided through investor-owned utilities, and we have no Federal cushion to depend on. That's the reason recession causes tremendous hardships in free market regions like our own. How are Federal power subsidies to just some regions fair to all our taxpayers? After three decades, it's time to let three unauthorized power marketing administrations stand on their own two feet and compete in the free market, just like our region does. Balance our budget, cut the subsidies, cut the Mega-marks, cut regional favoritism that benefits the few at the expense of the many.  I ask to include in the Record a full State-by-State power cost analysis so all Americans can know who is being subsidized and who is eking it out and trying to compete in the real marketplace, the free marketplace. I ask Members here to support the Kaptur amendment to eliminate the Federal administrative subsidies for power marketing authorities.  Now let me point out that some of our power marketing authorities are doing it right, paying their own way. Take Bonneville, they did it right. There's a way to do it right and a way to do it wrong, and we shouldn't reward inefficiency. We should allow these subsidized institutions to compete in the free market and not make the other parts of America that are burdened by high unemployment and high power costs, to be giving favored treatment to other parts of the country that are not carrying their own load forward. Again, take a look at the privileged parts of America and then ask yourself who's paying for it. It's pretty clear what's going on here.  The Southeastern Power Marketing Administration was budgeted to be zero funded in the President's FY11 budget. The amendment would allow this 2010 funding to go to zero. But under the continuing resolution, they will continue to be funded at their 2010 levels in spite of being eliminated in the budget. There is a lot of bookkeeping going on here that doesn't treat all parts of America fairly. I ask my colleagues to do what we've had to do in our region, compete in the real marketplace. Support the Kaptur amendments.
