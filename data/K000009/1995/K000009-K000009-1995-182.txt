Speaker, the Republican contract calls parts of today's tax bill the American dream. Well, I, too, have an American dream. My dream is that we pay off the debts of this century and not pass on $4.7 trillion of debt to the next generation. This Republican bill will cost our taxpayers up to $700 billion over the next 10 years. Under the Republican bill it is absolutely wrong that households earning $200,000 would receive an average tax cut of over $11,000 while those under $30,000 receive a hundred bucks. In fact, working families with two children with incomes of up to $16,000 would not get anything, while those with adjusted gross incomes of up to $250,000 would receive a $500 per child tax credit.  This bill is a cruel dream machine. To make matters worse, huge corporations would no longer pay even the minimum tax. Vote for what is right. Do not wait for the next election. Vote ``no'' on this Republican bill.                          ____________________
