 Also, Mr. Leader, I know you did not anticipate this, but when do you expect to attempt to conclude with the D.C. appropriations bill? Will that be done next week?  Mr. DeLAY. I would expect that the votes on final passage of the D.C. appropriations bill could very well be held the evening of Tuesday, after the rolled votes on the Transportation-Treasury bill.
