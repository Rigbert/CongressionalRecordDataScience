Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), one of the very senior Members of this House, a Member who has risked literally life and limb on behalf of the right of Americans to vote. This is a Member who, long before I got to this House but throughout the years I have been in this House, for over 2 decades, has been one of the strongest voices for the civil rights of all Americans, the ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary.
