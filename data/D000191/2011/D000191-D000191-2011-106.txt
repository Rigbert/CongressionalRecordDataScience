Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy of Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Brian Lanker. Brian died on March 13th, ten days after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer.  Brian was a remarkable photographer. He was also a good friend. He began his career at the Topeka Capital-Journal in 1970--a paper nationally renowned for excellence in photojournalism. While at the paper, he shot a series on natural childbirth using the Lamaze method, which was not common at that time. The series culminated in a photo of Lynda (then Coburn) Lanker, Brian's future wife, giving birth to her son, Dustin. This ebullient photograph earned Brian the 1973 Pulitzer Prize.  Shortly after that achievement, Brian moved to Eugene, Oregon, to take a position as the director of graphics for the Register Guard. Under Brian's direction, photos became a significant part of the news story. He raised the paper's standard for photojournalism to new heights, and he was awarded two Newspaper Photographer of the Year awards for his effort. In a remembrance, Carl Davaz, the paper's then deputy managing editor, told David Dunlap that Brian always thought first about the reader when taking pictures, and used his talents to bring words-and-pictures together.  Brian became a freelance photographer after he left the Register Guard in 1982. He took breathtaking photographs for distinguished publications including LIFE Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and National Geographic. He was sought out for his photographic instincts and ability to capture single moments that told entire stories.  His proudest works, however, came when he collaborated with poet Maya Angelou on two books: ``I Dream a World,'' his portraits of black women of achievement; and ``Shall We Dance,'' a photographic documentary of dance in America. The debut showing for ``I Dream a World'' set attendance records at Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. It is now in its 14th printing, which made Brian particularly proud because it meant the stories of these distinguished women were being shared.  At the end of Mr. Dunlap's remembrance, he wrote about Carl Davaz' final visit with Brian. Brian simply told Carl, ``There's just so much left to do.''  Just before Brian died, two of his children, who had separately planned weddings for later in the year, chose to get married at Brian's bedside so he could share in their celebration. He died soon thereafter. Brian is survived by Lynda Lanker, a recognized artist in her own right, and their children Julie Coburn, Jacki Coburn, and Dustin Lanker.  For my part, I agree with you, Brian--there was just so much left for you to do. You are deeply missed.                          ____________________
