 President, we have made substantial progress today on the Defense Department authorization bill. Two important amendments were voted on and the chairman and ranking member processed a number of voice votes. So we made excellent progress and we intend to do that again tomorrow.  At 10 a.m., we will vote on the supplemental appropriations conference report. That will be the first vote of the day. Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the DOD authorization bill, and we hope to be able to process a number of amendments throughout the day. Chairman Warner and Senator Levin would like to get as many amendments in the queue as possible. The Santorum amendment on Iran is the pending business and we will be scheduling the vote on that in the near term.  I encourage Members to stay rather close to the floor on Thursday so we can make significant progress during tomorrow's session.                          ____________________[Page S5899]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
