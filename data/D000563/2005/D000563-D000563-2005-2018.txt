 We let down the Guard and Reserve yesterday. Military families and groups supported my amendment, but 58 Senators voted against it. They decided that the men and women serving in the military, risking their lives, were not entitled to any breaks when it came to filing bankruptcy because as they were overseas their families and businesses failed. That was the decision yesterday. Fifty-eight Senators said, no, they are not entitled to any special help.  Today we have a chance to give a helping hand to people facing medical crises. Over half of the bankruptcies in America involve people who faced a medical crisis and were crushed by it. They turned to bankruptcy court. Senator Kennedy gives them a chance in that court to come out with dignity and to start their lives anew. He gives them a chance to keep their homes. Is this unreasonable? I don't think it is. It is only fair. I gladly support the amendments of the Senator and thank him for offering them both.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Massachusetts.
