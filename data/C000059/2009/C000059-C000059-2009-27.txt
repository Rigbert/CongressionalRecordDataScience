Speaker, as many have said before, friendship is found and tested through adversity. The friendship between the United States and Israel has certainly been tried and proven true. Both our nations confront challenges that are rooted in extremism and terrorism. While America formerly found some comfort in distance, Israel stands as a true testament to freedom and democracy in the Middle East--but Israel does not stand alone. The commitments between Israel and the United States are not born out of mere necessity, but out of mutual respect and the common belief that all of mankind deserves to live in peace and freedom.  On the 61st Anniversary of the Independence of the State of Israel, I offer my gratitude and congratulations to a steady ally and friend.
