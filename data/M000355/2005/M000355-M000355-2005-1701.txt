 President, I rise today to honor a Kentuckian who has dedicated his life to saving the lives of others. Dr. Hiram C. Polk, Jr., the chairman of the University of Louisville's Department of Surgery in Louisville, KY, has become a leader in the medical field due to his relentless push for excellence.  In his 34 years as chairman of the department, Dr. Polk has trained over 200 surgeons who have gone on to become the best in their profession. He is the world's leading authority on surgical wound infections. He developed the now common application of perioperative antibiotics--that is when the patient takes antibiotics before surgery, so the medication is in the patient's tissue during operation.  Under Dr. Polk, the department has provided over $100 million in free health care to Louisville area indigent patients. The department has performed two successful hand transplants and the world's first implantation of an AbioCor artificial heart. And Dr. Polk is an honorary fellow of the very prestigious Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, Scotland, the oldest surgical college in the world.  Dr. Polk has also found time to engage in one of Kentucky's greatest passions--horse racing. He is an owner and breeder of several thoroughbreds, including Mrs. Revere, a four-time stakes winner at the racetrack that is home to the Kentucky Derby, Churchill Downs.  No wonder, then, that upon Dr. Polk's retirement after such a preeminent career, his colleagues have decided to honor him by naming the University of Louisville surgery department the Hiram C. Polk Department of Surgery. He is a model citizen for all Kentuckians, and has earned this Senate's respect.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article from The Louisville Courier-Journal about Dr. Polk's lifesaving career.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Feb. 4, 2005] A Passion for Excellence; U of L Doctor Leaves Enduring Mark Training                                 Surgeons                            (By Laura Ungar)       Part drill sergeant, part modern-day Socrates, Dr. Hiram C.      Polk Jr. briskly led medical residents and students through      University Hospital on early morning rounds this week.       Stopping in front of patients' rooms, Polk called on      residents to describe each case, then peppered them with      questions.       Sometimes he offered a compliment, such as ``Wonderful      question'' or ``That's exactly right.'' But more often, he      displayed a characteristic toughness, and his trainees      usually answered, ``Yes, sir.''       ``You're lost,'' he admonished the group outside one      patient's room.       ``You're not betting your life,'' he said to a resident      assessing a patient. ``You're betting his life.''       Polk is stepping down today after more than three decades      as chairman of the University of Louisville's surgery      department, where he has trained a legion of surgeons--about      230, which U of L officials say is more than any other      current surgical chair in the country.       Colleagues say a relentless push for excellence marked      Polk's tenure. That has given U of L's program a national      reputation as the Marine Corps of surgical residencies and      left him with a nickname based on one instance from his early      career: ``Hiram Fire-em.''       But it also has made him a teacher students always      remember, a strict father figure who strives to make them      better and leaves them with an internal voice telling them to      push themselves.       ``Dr. Polk demands excellence from his trainees and will      not accept mediocrity. And by demanding it, he often gets      it,'' said Dr. Kelly McMasters, a former resident under Polk      who is now the Sam and Lolita Weakley Professor of Surgical      Oncology and director of U of L's division of surgical      oncology.       Polk could go a little too far, ``could be too tough,''      said Dr. Frank Miller, a professor of surgery at U of L.       But Polk makes no apologies. Surgery ``is a serious, big      deal and you need to take that seriously,'' he said.      ``Striving to be the best you can be sometimes means telling      people, `I think that's stupid.' ''       Colleagues say Polk, 68, held himself to those same high      standards as he has helped build a nationally renowned      surgery department.       He has written or co-written hundreds of papers and journal      articles, dozens of textbook chapters and numerous books, and      served as editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Surgery      for 18 years.       He pioneered the practice of giving antibiotics within an      hour of surgery to stave off infection, which has become      commonplace.       And McMasters said residents who have risen to Polk's      challenge earn his loyalty, and return it. ``Most people are      pathologically loyal to Dr. Polk. He stands by his people 100      percent. . . . He's made my career. While he was firm and      strict as a teacher, he also has a very benevolent and loving      side.''                        Life-changing discussion       Polk attended Millsaps College in his hometown of Jackson,      Miss., at the urging of his father. He graduated at the top      of his class, and as a favor to a professor, he said, he      applied to Harvard Medical School, only to turn down a chance      to attend on scholarship because it was too far away. But      Harvard sent a premier physiologist to try to persuade Polk      to change his mind--an hourlong discussion that determined      the direction of his life.       ``He reinforced some of what my father said,'' Polk said.      ``He said I ought to go, end of discussion.''       Polk hated medical school until he got interested in      surgery. As a medical resident in St. Louis and a young      doctor and academic in Miami, Polk found mentors to emulate.      His reputation grew, and universities began to court him.       In 1971, at 35, he became U of L's surgery chairman, lured      by the promise of a department with potential, a growing      downtown medical community and a closet attraction to the      horse-racing scene.       One early decision was to not renew the contracts of six of      the residents who were there at the time, earning him the      ``Fire-em'' nickname--although he said he has let only five      more people go since then.       Colleagues who knew him during those early years remember      how Polk honed his skills in the aging Louisville General      Hospital, a relic of an older era with long hallways, an open      ward and few of the technological amenities of today. Polk      brought residents on bedside rounds there, firing questions      at them and demanding good answers, recalled Dr. Gordon      Tobin, a U of L professor and director of the division of      plastic and reconstructive surgery.       ``He fit right in with the other surgeons I met in that      era,'' Tobin said. ``The surgical personality is very      straightforward and blunt.''       Polk's reputation for demanding excellence was a draw for      some, said Dr. J. David Richardson, a professor and vice      chairman of U of L's surgery department.       ``I don't think people have really come here who are really      unaware'' how demanding it would be, Richardson said. ``It's      not a place to come and rest on your laurels and enjoy a      quiet kind of life.''       Dr. William H. Mitchell, a retired surgeon in Richmond,      Ky., was among Polk's early residents. He said Polk expected      him and his peers to be on their game at 7 a.m. ``whether we      were bright-eyed and bushy-tailed or not.''       ``If you ran out of gas, you'd better get pumped up. You      were expected to be cogent, coherent and well thought out,''      Mitchell said.       But Polk was mindful of tailoring questions to a trainee's      level of understanding, Mitchell said, and would be hardest      on senior residents. Also, many doctors-in-training saw      something beneath the harshness--intelligence, skill and      passion for his work.       Mitchell remembers a case presented in a conference in      which another resident stabilized the fractured jaw of a      motorcycle accident victim without calling for backup, even      though he had never seen such a fracture.       ``He fried him,'' Mitchell said of Polk's response. ``He      said: Don't undertake something you've never done without      backup.''       ``No question about it,'' Mitchell said, ``he made all of      us better doctors because he made us think about what we're      doing.''                           Family--and horses       Nurturing residents and building a department required long      hours.       ``He was busy and gone a lot,'' said his daughter, Susan      Brown, one of two children with his first wife. ``My mom kept      everything running for us.''       That didn't change her love and admiration for him, said      Brown, 44. And she said he has taken an active interest in      the lives of her three sons, attending sporting events with      them and talking medicine with two who have expressed an      interest.       Dr. Susan Galandiuk, Polk's 47-year-old second wife, said      she understands the long hours and is a workaholic herself.      She said Polk routinely gets telephone calls at their East      End home from doctors around the country asking for      professional and personal advice--and sees this as a      compliment, evidence of the relationships he has built over      the years.       Some of Polk's rare hours outside of work have been focused      on his love of horses. He and Richardson together are owner-     breeders whose horses have included Mrs. Revere, a four-time      stakes winner at Churchill Downs in the mid-1980s for which a      stakes race is named.       Richardson sees things in common between surgery and the      horse business, such as the reminders, every time a horse      gets hurt, of the fragility of life and success. Polk sees      common points, too, but noted: ``A good horse is better than      a good resident. You love them, and they try hard to be the      best they can be.''       Polk claims to have mellowed over the years, and links it      to his divorce, his remarriage, and the death of Mrs. Revere,      whose memory still chokes him up.       He said he also gained new perspective through four major      operations, including one for prostate cancer. And he has had      to adjust to changing times in medicine; he has been sued for      medical malpractice, usually in an administrative capacity,      and has had to work within new national rules limiting      residents' working hours to 80 a week.       But current trainees and friends haven't noticed a      mellowing. Cornelia Poston, a third-year medical student,      prepares diligently for rounds by writing questions on note      cards, studying the night before and carrying a book called      ``Pocket Surgery'' inside her white coat.''       You strive for perfection, and he demands that,'' said Dr.      Bryce Schuster, chief administrative resident. ``At times it      could be intimidating. But fear is a great motivator.''       Mitchell agreed. ``The residents still get sweaty palms,''      he said, ``but they still stand and deliver and give a      straight answer to a straight question.''       To celebrate Polk's career, colleagues, residents and      others have launched a $5 million campaign to rename the      department in his honor and secure an endowment for clinical,      education and research activities.       But his true legacy, colleagues say, may be best symbolized      by a picture of a tree in his office, with names of the      surgeons he has trained near the many branches.                          ____________________[Pages S1864-S1865]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    DR.
