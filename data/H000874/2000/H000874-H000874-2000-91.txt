Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1654, the NASA Reauthorization bill. This is an exciting week to bring this legislation to the floor as the crew of the Space Shuttle Atlantis prepares the International Space Station for full-time service. In addition to the Space Station, this bill provides funding for NASA's other priorities including the Space Shuttle Program and for the Earth and Space Science program.  I opposed this legislation when the House first took it up because of efforts to kill the Triana Satellite Mission. Triana, a project directed by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California in conjunction with the Goddard Space Flight Center in my District, would provide not only a real-time view of the Earth for distribution on the Internet, but will also include instruments to study solar influences on climate, ultraviolet radiation, space weather, and the microphysical properties of clouds. I thank my colleagues in the Senate for taking the partisanship out of this important program.  This conference report also authorizes significant funding for the Science, Aeronautics, and Technology Account. The $2.3 billion for Space Science will insure that the Hubble Space Telescope Program continues to provide us with phenomenal data over the next ten years. It is crucial that Hubble's successor, the Next Generation Space Telescope, receive the necessary support to match and surpass Hubble's success. In addition, the $1.5 billion for NASA's Earth Science programs will insure that programs like the Landsat, a cornerstone of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, can continue to study the Earth's global environment, and that the Terra Satellite, which has been vital in the past week in fighting wild fires in the west, receives the funding necessary for continuing operations.  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report and support NASA as we continue to explore our last frontier.
