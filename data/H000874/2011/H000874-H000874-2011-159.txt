 What they need is confidence in the management at the Federal level of the finances of our Nation. They had that confidence in the nineties when we had balanced budgets. They did not have that confidence in the last decade, and our economy shows the result. I certainly share the gentleman's view that, if we can give them that confidence, our economy will grow, and jobs will be created. I'm for working together to accomplish that objective.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
