 President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming. I urge people who are proponents of this bill and want me to yield them time to be here. When there is not anybody here, I will use some of that time, but I am very glad to quit and put my statements in the Record to accommodate my colleagues. It is just a case of if we don't want to waste any of this valuable time, get over here.
