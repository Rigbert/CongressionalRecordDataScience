Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1261 as written leaves out a significant portion of its targeted population that needs job training. My simple amendment would extend the eligibility requirement from 21 years of age to 24 years of age for training programs in the Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act. Existing job training programs such as Job Corps, YouthBuild, Conservation Corps, and others already use the age range 16 to 24. Extending the age from 21 to 24 will enable the Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act to coincide with organizations that benefit from it.  When young people drop out of high school, they are in a suspended state of adolescence, not taking responsibility for themselves financially or otherwise. They often are unable to get a job or support themselves or their children, if they have children. Furthermore, the needs of the 22- to 24-year-old high school dropouts are more like the needs of the 18- to 21-year-olds than their counterparts in their late twenties and thirties. The process of completing their high school education, preparing for the workforce, the world of work, and developing the values of responsibility and the sense of belonging to a community are the difficult tasks of youth, but some have taken a detour onto the streets or prison. When they get back on track, they still need to be mentored. They needhelp, a sense of purpose, a sense of direction. They simply have not learned the skills and responsibilities in the work world to be adults. This amendment will help our young people meet this goal.  Mr. Chairman, I have visited organizations such as YouthBuild and Job Corps. I must tell you they do good work. These are good and necessary programs to help our young people get ahead. I strongly urge my colleagues, all of my colleagues, to pass this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
