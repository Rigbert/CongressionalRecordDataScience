President, just last week we passed the HIRE Act, which included a tax credit offered by Senator Schumer and Senator Hatch to encourage companies to hire unemployed workers. It makes no sense for any of us to have voted for that bill and then not to support the amendment that I have offered.  The amendment I am offering would waive the onerous fines that are in this bill for small businesses that hire unemployed workers. If you voted for the HIRE Act giving a tax credit, why in the world would you support a policy of imposing penalties on businesses that hire unemployed workers?  Mr. President, I urge support of the amendment.
