 President, I'm submitting several amendments at this time in order to comply with the unanimous-consent agreement requiring the filing of amendments. The amendments I'm filing now are indications of what I intend to offer when the Senate is cleared to consider the bankruptcy bill later this year. As such, each amendment is a work in progress. I would therefore caution my colleagues not to view these amendments as cast in stone. In particular, Senator Torricelli and I are negotiating with the chairman of the Banking Committee on the details of the credit card disclosure amendment.                                 ______                                               GRASSLEY (AND TORRICELLI) AMENDMENT NO. 1732  (Ordered to lie on the table.)
