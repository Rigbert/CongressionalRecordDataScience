Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the substitute amendment should be soundly defeated as it would throw salt into the wounds of those parents who have implored this Congress to recognize under Federal law the loss of their loved, unborn child.  These mothers are not seeking recognition of the violence they have suffered alone. They are seeking recognition of the violence their unborn children have suffered as well. They are seeking recognition of the loss of their unborn child.  H.R. 1997 recognizes that loss; the substitute does not. This House has defeated this substitute amendment each time it has been brought up, with increasing margins during the 106th and 107th Congresses. We should increase that margin today.  A recent Fox News poll asked, ``If Scott Peterson is convicted of killing his pregnant wife, Laci, do you think he should be charged with one count of homicide for murdering his wife, or two counts of homicide for murdering both his wife and his unborn son?'' An overwhelming 84 percent of the American people responded that two counts, not one, should be brought.  These results are confirmed by two other recent polls that show support for two separate charges for violent criminals who harm mothers and their unborn children. Support for a separate charge for an unborn victim is 84 percent, according to a Newsweek poll, and 79 percent, including 69 percent of those who describe themselves as prochoice, according to another Fox News poll conducted in July. Each poll found that less than 1 in 10 Americans disagree.  I would ask my colleagues to join with the overwhelming majority of Americans who have responded to these polls, including those who describe themselves as being prochoice, to reject this amendment and not join with the very small minority, less than 1 in 10 of those who are polled, who would support the one-victim approach.                              {time}  1230  This substitute amendment embodies the extreme ideology of those who are unwilling to recognize an unborn child in the law in any context whatsoever. The term ``unborn child'' as used in H.R. 1997 has been widely used and accepted by judges, including the Supreme Court, and Justice Blackmun, the author of the Roe v. Wade decision itself. The term ``unborn child'' has been widely tested in court and has sustained all constitutional challenges in terms of a fetal homicide law. Removing that term and replacing it with the vague and untested language of the substitute would accomplish nothing, while risking grave confusion and jeopardizing the conviction of violent Federal criminals. The abstract language in the substitute, which points to injuries to a ``pregnancy,'' ignores the fact that violent criminals can and do inflict injuries on a real human being in his or her mother's womb. If an assault is committed on a Member of Congress and her unborn child subsequently suffers from a disability because of the assault, that injury cannot accurately be described as an abstract injury to a pregnancy. It is an injury to an unborn child. The bill recognizes that. The substitute does not.  Also, unlike the language of H.R. 1997, the substitute contains no exceptions for abortion-related conduct, for conduct of the mother, or for medical treatment of the pregnant woman or her unborn child. This omission leavesthe substitute amendment bare to the charge that it would permit the prosecution of mothers who have abortions who inflict harm upon themselves and their unborn children or doctors who incidentally kill or injure unborn children during the provision of medical treatment. For that reason, the substitute amendment will certainly be subject to a successful constitutional challenge. The underlying bill has been tested and proven constitutional.  Today's debate is not about penalties. It is about victims. H.R. 1997 recognizes unborn victims of violence. The substitute does not. In the name of unborn victims, including Conner Peterson, Heaven Lashay Pace, Zachariah Marciniak, Landon Lyons and the others who are not named today but are known and loved and missed by their surviving family, the substitute should be soundly defeated and the bill passed.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
