I thank my good friend Mr. Guthrie for yielding and for his support on this important legislation.  Mr. Speaker, Maalik was diagnosed with Hurler syndrome at 15 months old, a rare and life-threatening metabolic disorder. He had a curved spine, and he could not walk.  After receiving an umbilical cord blood transplant facilitated through the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank, Maalik is running around and is expected to have a normal lifespan. His mother, Krystal, said: ``My son is extremely happy now. He is energetic and more independent. The transplant saved his life.''  In like manner, bone marrow donations provide lifesaving transplants for a myriad of diseases. Clara was only 4 months old when she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. John had registered with the National Marrow Donor Program Be The Match as a bone marrow donor when Clara was only 17 days old. It turned out it was a perfect match for Clara. John's donation saved Clara's life. She is now thriving at 2 years of age.  Mr. Speaker, not only has God in His wisdom and goodness created a placenta and an umbilical cord to nurture and protect the precious life of an unborn child, but now, we find He has left a great gift behind. Immediately after birth, something very special is left behind, cord blood that is teeming with lifesaving stem cells.  Breathtaking scientific breakthroughs have turned medical waste--postbirth placentas and umbilical cord blood--into medical miracles, treating more than 80 diseases, including leukemia, lymphoma, and sickle cell anemia.  As a matter of fact, Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg of Duke University and president of the Cord Blood Association told Chairman Pitts' subcommittee on June 25 that sickle cell anemia can be cured with cord blood transplantation and that it has become one of the most optimal donor sources for patients with sickle cell disease.  H.R. 2820, under consideration by the House today, reauthorizes through 2020 the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005, a law I sponsored a decade ago, joined by Artur Davis of Alabama, legislation that cleared the Senate with the incomparable help of Senator Orrin Hatch.  That law built upon the excellent work of our distinguished late colleague Bill Young of Florida to facilitate bone marrow transplants and created a brand-new national umbilical cord blood donation and transplantation program.  Special thanks, Mr. Speaker, to both Chairmen Upton and Pitts for their outstanding leadership and help on this bill, as well as the strong support by Ranking Members Pallone and my good friend and colleague Mr. Green.  I am deeply grateful to our original sponsors, Ms. Matsui, Mr. Jolly, and Mr. Fattah, for their contributions and special thanks to Adrianna Simonelli, Katie Novaria, and Megan McCrum.  Today, Mr. Speaker, under the National Cord Blood Inventory program, contracts are awarded to cord blood banks to collect cord blood units donated after their mothers give birth. These units are then made available through the C. W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program, also called the Be The Match Registry.  The program provides a single point of access, enabling those in need of lifesaving transplants to search for a match via an integrated nationwide network of bone marrow and cord blood stem cells.  Americans willing to volunteer are at the heart of the success of this program. In reauthorizing it, we are grateful for the adult donors willing to donate bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells, as well as mothers who donate their baby's cord blood to public cord blood banks.  There are 13 public banks contracted through the NCBI, including the New Jersey Cord Blood Bank in my home State, which collects cord blood from five participating hospitals.                              {time}  1645  Mr. Speaker, it ought to be noted as well that, in addition to treating more than 80 diseases, cord blood units from the NCBI banks are also available for research on future therapies.  Indeed, Dr. Kurtzberg pointed out that, ``in addition to use in patients with malignant and genetic diseases, cord blood is showing enormous potential for use in cellular therapies and other regenerative medicine. Cord blood derived vaccines against viruses and certain types of cancers are currently under development and in early phase clinical trials. Cells, manufactured from cord blood units are being developed to boost recovery of the immune system. Cells regulating autoimmunity are also in clinical trials. These approaches, which often utilize cord blood banked in family banks, may help patients with type 1 diabetes, as well as other diseases,'' she testified just a few months ago.  She also pointed out that ``over the past 6 years, we have initiated trials of the patient's own cord blood in babies with birth asphyxia, cerebral palsy, hearing loss''; and she is doing some incredible work on an issue that I have worked on for over 20 years, and that is the issue and the disability known as autism.  Dr. Kurtzberg finally said, ``We've learned that when a donor cells are infused into one's body, they go to the brain and help heal the brain. When a child has a brain injury around birth, we can use their own cord blood cells to correct the damage that's occurred.''  Dr. Jeffrey Chell, of Be the Match--he is the CEO for it--noted that for many diseases, including blood cancers and sickle cell disease, cellular therapy is the best hope for a cure.  Last year, Mr. Speaker, I visited Celgene Corporation of Summit, New Jersey, to learn of their extraordinary efforts to use cord blood to heal diabetic foot ulcers, and they now have turned amniotic membrane, an old placenta, into wound management that has now advanced--it is on the market--past stage 3 clinical trials.
