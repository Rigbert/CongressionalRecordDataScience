President, with last night's votes on two district court nominees, including Judge James Gardner to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Senate has confirmed its 79th and 80th new judges since the change in majority last summer. In less than 15 months, we have confirmed more judges than the Republican majority confirmed in its final 30 months in the majority. We have been more than twice as productive as they were and Republicans are nonetheless complaining that we have not worked three or four times as fast as they did to fill vacancies that their inaction perpetuated. Similarly, in less than 15 months of Democratic control of the Judiciary Committee, we have confirmed more judicial nominees than Republicans did in the first 2 full years they controlled the Senate in 1995 and 1996, combined, and we have confirmed more judges than Republicans allowed to be confirmed in 1999 and 2000 combined. We have been more fair and more expeditious regarding judicial nominations than Republicans were during their prior 6\1/2\ years of control of the Senate.  Last night's vote is another example. The Senate has acted quickly on this nomination to the District Court in Pennsylvania. Judge Gardner was nominated at the end of April, received an ABA peer review in July, participated in a hearing in August, was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in September, and was confirmed last night. The Judiciary Committee has held hearings for 11 district court nominees from Pennsylvania and the Senate has now confirmed all 11 of them in just 6 months.  In addition, a Third Circuit nominee, Judge Brooks Smith of Pennsylvania, was also confirmed, although not without controversy based on his record. With the confirmation of 12 judges from Pennsylvania, there is no State that has had more Federal judicial nominees confirmed by this Senate than Pennsylvania. The Senate Judiciary committee and the Senate as a whole have done well by Pennsylvania. This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania were left unfilled during Republican control of the Senate, particularly regarding nominees in the western half of the State.  Despite the best efforts and diligence of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure confirmation of all of the judicial nominees from every part of his home State, there were seven nominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies were never given a hearing or a vote.  A good example of the contrast between the way the Democrats and Republicans have treated judicial nominees is the case of Judge Legrome Davis, a well qualified and uncontroversial judicial nominee. He was first nominated to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Clinton on July 30, 1998. The Republican-controlled Senate took no action on his nomination and it was returned to the President at the end of 1998. On January 26, 1999, President Clinton renominated Judge Davis for the same vacancy. The Senate again failed to hold a hearing for Judge Davis and his nomination was returned after 2 more years.  Under Republican leadership, Judge Davis' nomination languished before the Committee for 868 days without a hearing. Unfortunately, Judge Davis was subjected to the kind of inappropriate partisan rancor that befell so many other nominees to the district courts in Pennsylvania during the Republican control of the Senate. This year, the Democratic-led Senate moved expeditiously to consider Judge Davis, and he was confirmed in just 84 days. The saga of Judge Davis recalls for us so many nominees from the period of January 1995 through July 10, 2001, who never received a hearing or a vote and who were the subject of secret, anonymous holds by Republicans for reasons that were never explained.  In contrast, the hearing we had earlier this year for Judge Conti was the very first hearing on a nominee to the Western District of Pennsylvania since 1994, despite President Clinton's qualified nominees. It is shocking to me that this was the first hearing on a nominee to that court in 8 full years. No nominee to the Western District of Pennsylvania received a hearing during the entire period that Republicans controlled the Senate in the Clinton administration. In fact, one of the many nominees to the Western District, Lynette Norton, waited for almost 1,000 days, and she was never given the courtesy of a hearing or a vote. Unfortunately, Ms. Norton died earlier this year, having never fulfilled her dream of serving on the Federal bench. With the confirmation of Judge Conti earlier this year, we confirmed the first nominee to the Western District of Pennsylvania since October 1994.  Despite this history of poor treatment of President Clinton's nominees, the Democratic-led Senate continues to move forward fairly and expeditiously. Democrats have reformed the process for considering judicial nominees. For example, we have ended the practice of secretive, anonymous holds that plagued the period of Republican control, when any Republican Senator could hold any nominee from his or her home State, his or her own circuit or any part of the country for any reason, or no reason, without any accountability. We have returned to the Democratic tradition of regularly holding hearings, every few weeks, rather than going for months without a single hearing. In fact, we have held 25 judicial nominations hearings in the past 15 months, and we plan to hold our 26th judicial nomination hearing this coming Monday. We have held a confirmation hearing for judicial nominees every month since the Judiciary Committee was reorganized in July 2001, including two hearings during the August recess in 2001. In contrast, during the 6\1/2\ years of Republican control, there were 30 months in which Republicans held no hearings on judicial nominees.  By already holding 25 hearings for 96 of this President's judicial nominees in just 15 months, we have held hearings for more circuit and district court nominees than in 20 of the last 22 years during the Reagan, first Bush, and Clinton administrations.  While some complain that a handful of circuit court nominees have not yethad hearings, they fail to acknowledge that Democrats have held hearings for more of President Bush's circuit court nominees, 20, than in any of the 6\1/2\ years in which the Republicans controlled the Committee before the change in majority last summer. This is more nominees than received hearings in either of the first 2 years of the Clinton administration when the White House and the Senate were controlled by the same party. The fact that Democrats have treated this Republican President just as fairly as Democrats treated a President of their own party with regard to hearings for circuit court nominees is remarkable. Republicans have utterly failed to acknowledge this fairness. The myth of Democratic obstruction of judicial nominees fits the partisan Republican political strategy better than the truth.  The years of Republican inaction on a number of circuit court vacancies has made it possible for Democrats to have several ``firsts'' in addressing judicial vacancies. For example, we held the first hearing for a nominee to the Sixth Circuit in almost 5 years, that is more than one full presidential term, and confirmed her, even though three of President Clinton's nominees to the Sixth Circuit never received a hearing or a vote. One of those Clinton nominees waited more than 1,500 days and never received a hearing or a vote, up or down, by the Committee.  We held the first hearing on a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 years, including the entire period of Republican control of the Senate, and confirmed her last year, while three of President Clinton's Fifth Circuit nominees never received hearings or votes on their nominations. We also held the first hearing on a Tenth Circuit nominee in 6 years, and we have confirmed two of President Bush's nominees to the Tenth Circuit, while two of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit never received hearings or votes.  With last night's confirmation of Judge Gardner, the 12th judicial nominee from Pennsylvania to be confirmed in just 15 months, in addition to the other 79 judicial nominees confirmed in this short period, the Democratic-led Senate has had a record-breaking year of progress and fairness in the judicial confirmation process.                          ____________________
