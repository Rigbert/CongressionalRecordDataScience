 It is not voluntary because if you choose not to shut up, if you choose not to take the Government prescribed speech limits, you have to pay more for your television. So it is not voluntary. And it is not free because the broadcasting industry is called upon to subsidize campaigns and the postal patrons are called upon to subsidize campaigns. So it is neither voluntary nor free.  I thank very much my friend from Texas for pointing this out.
