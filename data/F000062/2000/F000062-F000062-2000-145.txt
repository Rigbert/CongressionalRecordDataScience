 President, if I may, I would like to have an opportunity to ask the Senator from Arizona a couple of questions. I thought he pointed out very ably the problem of a statute filling the void, the first problem being that the rights of the accused will always trump the rights of the victim. He pointed out very well and very ably and very specifically the situation that took place with respect to Oklahoma City.  Then we turned to the FBI to try to get the amount of coverage that could be achieved in the statute for victims across this great land. We were told that really the best we could do would be to protect by statute the 1 to 2 percent of victims who were victimized by violent crimes.  I think it is important that we discuss a little bit more why the Constitution will always trump a State law. I ask the Senator to lay that out once again.
