 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support this bill and provisions therein which underscore that a free, independent, and democratic Ukraine is in the interests of liberty everywhere, most especially the European continent, which largely shares America's constitutional values and respect for the rule of law.  The road ahead will not be easy. Ukraine faces enormous challenges in transitioning to a democratic society as Russia eats away at her eastern provinces and now begins to sabotage her internal assets. The incomes of ordinary people in Ukraine have dropped significantly. Consumer inflation for the year is up 16 percent at the same time the Hryvnia has depreciated sharply, forcing private consumption to drop precipitously and further pushing GDP to decline. Life for ordinary citizens has become increasingly unsympathetic. Liberty hangs in the balance. With winter's approach, economic pressures will further mount as Russia restricts gas supplies to Ukraine.  This is a time for attention to Ukraine, which holds enormous potential to be the world's breadbasket in this 21st century, if only political conditions are stabilized to allow a better future to be built for all.  One powerful dimension of Ukrainian society most often ignored by Ukraine's former leaders and by the world community is Ukraine's village women. Despite all obstacles, they continue to produce nearly half the foodthat that nation's citizens eat. In village after village, on plots that are small and open pastures, these stalwart women--many of them grandmothers--toil, using simple hand tools, worn out handcarts, wearing old boots, and planting seed and plants whose germ-plasma is nearly worn out. Their timeworn, horse-drawn wagons need tires to navigate the rough back roads. Their dwellings often lack water and indoor plumbing. Life is survival, and it is hard.  Empowering Ukraine's women to lighten their load and make their task a bit easier would be one important step our country and world leaders could take to allow Ukraine to transition through these delicate years to a better future.  For these reasons, the Appropriations Committee included language in the Defense bill directing the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees not later than 60 days after the enactment of this act describing additional assistance that the Department may provide to Ukraine, including out of its surplus warehouses.  The goal of our humanitarian efforts is to empower the women of Ukraine, who, despite enormous obstacles, literally hold their families and that nation together. It is to use humanitarian shipments from our country, from government surplus--anywhere in the world we can acquire it--to simply provide items to help them with their food production and preservation. Give to these village women: good seed, buckets, wheelbarrows, gloves, boots, shovels, scythes, hoes, rakes, plastic on rolls, fencing, carts, used tires that will fit their horse-drawn wagons, simple canning equipment for putting up fruits and vegetables, drying equipment, scissors, hand shovels, grass clippers, pruners, loppers, saws, hammers, small hoop houses, hose, rope, and string. And while we are at it, how about some shortwave radios so they can connect to the world beyond their meager circumstances?  We anticipate with other provisions in this legislation States with lift capacity, such as Ohio, can arrange Department of Defense humanitarian shipments through their National Guard Partnership for Peace programs to transport the above-mentioned agricultural tools and supplies to the Ukrainian women in their villages through charitable networks in that country.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to recognize this important inclusion in this bill. I thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Frelinghuysen, the ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, and all freedom-loving people everywhere for understanding the vital consequence of these provisions at this moment of history. I would like to include for the Record an article entitled ``Ukraine Faces Hurdles in Restoring Its Farming Legacy.''                [From the New York Times, May 27, 2014]         Ukraine Faces Hurdles in Restoring Its Farming Legacy                            (By Danny Hakim)       Zibolky, Ukraine.--Like many of her neighbors in this old      Soviet collective farm, Maria Onysko prefers to be paid in      grain instead of cash for the modest plot of land she rents      out.       ``I have two cows and four pigs, many chickens,'' said Ms.      Onysko, 62. ``So we use it for them.''       After the breakup of the Soviet Union, farmland in newly      independent Ukraine was divided among villagers, acre by      acre, creating a patchwork of agricultural endeavors that are      often inefficient or unprofitable. Some land is rented to      fruit growers, grain operators or large-scale farming      businesses. Some locals work small plots on their own. Some      acreage sits fallow, stuck in legal limbo after the owner has      died.       Ukraine was once the breadbasket of the Soviet Union, known      for its rich soil where grain, sunflowers and livestock      flourished. But farming production dropped sharply in the      chaotic decade after the collapse of communism, and recovery      has come in fits and starts. Production is only now returning      to peak levels of the 1990s, stymied by the corruption, red      tape and inefficiencies that have plagued the broader      Ukrainian economy for years and left the villagers living      humble existences.       Restoring Ukraine's farming legacy will be crucial to the      success of the country's newly elected president, the      billionaire businessman Petro O. Poroshenko. Such efforts      would go a long way toward fixing Ukraine's economy and      reducing its dependence on Russia. Agriculture once accounted      for nearly 20 percent of the gross domestic product; it is      now roughly 10 percent.       The potential became clear last year when a strong harvest      helped Ukraine avoid a drop in output. ``It was just because      of agriculture,'' said Pavlo Sheremeta, Ukraine's minister of      economic development. ``Otherwise, it would have been a      decline.''       Against the backdrop of the crisis with Russia, Western      interests are pressing for change. The European Union is      moving forward with a plan to bolster trade by lifting custom      duties on Ukrainian agriculture. As part of a deal with the      International Monetary Fund for up to $18 billion in loans,      the country's government must push through business reforms      that would help alleviate the problems with farming and other      businesses.       The hope is that such initiatives will also bolster the      confidence of foreign investors as the crisis abates. Big      multinationals have expressed tentative interest in Ukrainian      agriculture, but they have largely remained on the sidelines,      unwilling to invest in an industry hampered by structural      deficiencies and, more recently, the uncertainty with its      eastern neighbor.       ``If cheap capital comes in along with foreign investment,      and you have a good government without roadblocks, Ukraine      can close to double its production in the future,'' said      Roman Fedorowycz, a Ukrainian-American who returned here      years ago and now runs a farming company that grows mainly      corn, sunflowers and soybeans.       Even small improvements would make a big difference in a      highly inefficient industry starved for money. While roughly      70 percent of Ukraine's land is considered suitable for      agriculture, it has not been fully cultivated. The country's      yield per hectare of grain is about half that of the United      States, according to the World Bank.       Change won't come easy, given the challenges. Previous      governments have tried to restrict what crops farmers grow      and when they rotate crops, as well as limiting exports. Some      state inspectors lack cars to conduct on-site inspections, so      farmers must bring grain to them before shipping.       Selling farmland is also forbidden in Ukraine, a legacy of      its communist past. So fields remain cut up ``like      chessboards,'' said Georgiy Vaydanych, land manager for      Agrokultura, a Stockholm-based agricultural company that      rents 173,000 acres in many such villages. ``For the moment      we have 40,000 active landlords,'' Mr. Vaydanych said.      ``Forty thousand!''       Making matters worse, paperwork is costly and many      villagers never officially inherit the farmland after their      parents die. ``There is uncertainty on how to farm this land,      because we have the dead souls in the middle of our fields,''      Mr. Vaydanych said, in a reference to Nikolai Gogol, whose      19th-century classic, ``Dead Souls,'' is required school      reading here.       Even as the crisis in the east intensifies, life in the      agricultural west remains much the same.       A dirt road straddling tilled fields leads into this      village, with potholes so deep that drivers zigzag past each      other. There are horse-drawn carts, roosters crowing, elderly      women in kerchiefs and a church painted pale green topped by      bulbous spires.       Few in this pro-European area of Ukraine are nostalgic for      Moscow. Still, Oleg Gusak, head of the village council, said      life had not improved.       ``When it was a collective, the level of life was better,''      he said, explaining that it was once a larger operation that      harvested crops, had livestock and made clothing, furniture      and jams.       ``People even came from other regions, because we had so      much work,'' he said, adding, ``Now, it's not the same.''       Trouble raising capital at reasonable prices makes it      difficult to start or expand farms.       ``I have to pay up to 12 percent if I borrow in euros,''      said Taras Barshchovsky, an entrepreneur who founded T.B.      Fruit, which makes fruit juices and whose rented orchards      cover thousands of acres. He has expanded into Poland, where      he said he could borrow for less than 3 percent.       ``Those who work with Ukrainian banks in hryvnias,'' the      national currency, ``they pay up to 20 percent or more. I      don't believe you can profit and return money on that      percentage,'' he added.       And while other former Soviet bloc neighbors like Hungary,      Romania and Poland began easing their land sale restrictions      after joining the European Union, Ukraine has repeatedly      delayed lifting its moratorium, considering the move      politically risky in its agrarian society. In 2013, the      government of Viktor Yanukovych, the deposed Ukrainian      leader, extended the moratorium until 2016, after he expected      to stand for re-election.       ``I'm afraid if I sell my land in the future my children      will say their old grandfather drank away all their money,''      Hrynchyshyn Myroslaw, 62, said as he cleared a willow field      near another village.       With a laugh, he added: ``It depends how much you will pay      me. If there are enough zeros, you can pay me.''       Volodymyr Baran, 43, a tractor mechanic, said he would      never sell his six acres: ``The land is our bread.''       Such dynamics deter foreign investment, which has been      tepid for years. Despite some interest from China and      multinationals, large agricultural enterprises tend to be      Ukrainian owned, and recent prominent deals have been less      than they seemed. For example, Cargill paid a reported $200      million     for a stake in UkrLandFarming, an agricultural holding      company. But a Cargill spokeswoman emphasized that the shares      were collateral for a loan rather than a long-term      investment.       The rules make ``it so much more difficult to understand,      and to bring in investment,'' said David Sedik, a senior      official at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the      United Nations. ``It's not that a foreigner or a company has      to buy the land, but it breeds opaqueness in the sector. You      need transparent land laws.''       At his office, Mr. Vaydanych pulled out a village map and      showed how its 2,500 acres were divvied up among 507      villagers.       ``Every field is split, by little, little plots,'' he      explained.       Being a land manager requires a political touch. Mr.      Vaydanych goes from village to village handing out favors,      fending off competitors trying to outbid his rental      contracts.       A village chief, he said, ``may call us and tell us, it's      the wintertime, we have a lot of snowfall, so give us a      forklift to clean the road. O.K., well, we do that.''       ``He may say this electricity substation is broken so we      need urgently to repair it, or he's calling because the water      pump at school broke, so we replace it,'' he said. ``That's      the commitment that comes with the land.''       ``I wouldn't be surprised by any request,'' Mr. Vaydanych      said. ``It is about keeping everyone happy. That's my work.''
