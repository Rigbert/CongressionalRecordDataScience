President, this Saturday, the Green Mountain Audubon Nature Center in Huntington, VT will celebrate its 40th anniversary.  In 1964, Mrs. Christine Hires of Philadelphia, offered the 150-acre Vermont farm she had owned since 1940, to the newly formed Green Mountain Audubon Society. Mrs. Hires' dream was to keep the land open to visitors and in its natural condition. An open house was held on September 19 and 20 of that year. The Green Mountain Audubon Nature Center was established.  Since 1964, the center has grown to 255 acres of varied habitat including hardwood forest, cedar swamp, beaver pond, meadows, pristine stream and river edge. The original farmhouse and barn are currently used as office and program space for Audubon Vermont. The center also includes a sugar house, the ``Clubhouse'' for summer camps and programs and a full-scale replica of an Abenaki longhouse.  Annually, nearly 15,000 visitors enjoy the nature trails, bird and other wildlife watching as well as a variety of environmental education programs the center is known for. Some 4,500 children and adults take part in educational programs led by Audubon teacher-naturalists each year.  I want to congratulate Green Mountain Audubon on 40 years of bringing people closer to nature through environmental education, natural resources stewardship, its citizen science efforts and, of course, sound conservation advocacy. This weekend's celebration will honor the oldest operating nature center in Vermont and the many individuals who have contributed to its success. Well done.                          ____________________
