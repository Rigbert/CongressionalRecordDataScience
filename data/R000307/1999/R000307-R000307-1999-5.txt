In fact, since January of 1998, 56 Medicare-certified agencies in Kansas have closed their doors, largely as a result of the changes in the IPS. These are not the fly-by-night home health care agencies we hear about that sometimes are in the press. Many of these agencies have been in existence for 20 years. I have visited these agencies. There was a survey conducted by the Kansas Home Care Association that shows agencies have laid off an average of 42 percent of their staff. They are subsidizing their Medicare payments to the tune of $213,000. In 1997, many agencies decreased the Medicare patient visits by 63 percent. Your chart shows 6,600 people. I have asked Kansas to come up with the numbers of people who are affected. They are trying to do that. It could be in the hundreds; it could be in the thousands.  But one person, just one person is a valued individual. That is everybody's mom, dad, grandmother, or granddad. So from the standpoint of numbers, it is astounding what the distinguished Senator has put up on the chart with regard to this so-called IPS system. We are going through the same kind of problem. I am going to ask you, how much longer is this IPS mess going to be in effect? It was supposed to be a transition program to the prospective payment system, but they said, well, we can't do it that fast. I understand that because it does take a lot of work, but how much longer will we have to put up with this?
