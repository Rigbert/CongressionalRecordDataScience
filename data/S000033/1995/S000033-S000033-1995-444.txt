 Speaker, it is now crystal clear: when it comes to cutting corporate welfare the Republican majority in charge of the 104th Congress does not get it. They are determined to balance the Federal budget during the next 7 years on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans--our Nation's sick, elderly, and children.  Corporate welfare programs in the Federal budget add as much as $125 billion to the Federal deficit every year.  But Speaker Gingrich and the Republican budget that will be probably be approved by the Republican majorities in the House and Senate cut virtually nothing from corporate welfare over the next 7 years. Instead, they prefer to slash Federal funding for programs for millions of Americans who are struggling to provide for themselves and their families and for some measure of economic security.  Like many Americans, the members of the Progressive Caucus ask this fundamental question: Why won't the Republican majority cut the immense corporate welfare benefits provided every year by the Federal Government to very profitable corporations and wealthy Americans as an essential component of any fair plan to balance the Federal budget during the next 7 years?  This is very unfair. There is a better way. That is why today several members of the 49-member Progressive Caucus and myself introduced legislation to cut $800 billion in corporate welfare over the next 7 years. We call our legislation the Corporate Responsibility Act and it represents one of the foundations of the 11-part Progressive Caucus Alternative to the Contract With America and the rest of the GOP agenda in the 104th Congress.  We have identified dozens of tax breaks, subsidies, and other Federal benefits for corporations and upper-income taxpayers which should be considered for cutting or elimination. These cuts would save $570.8 billion over a 5-year period according to estimates by respected economists such as the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Committee of the Congress.  Some of these programs are outright subsidies, such as for Export-Import Bank loans. Others are indirect subsidies through charging less than market rates or nothing at all for goods and services sold to coporations--e.g., uranium enrichment, irrigation water, use of public land for grazing. Still others are indirect subsidies through government Purchases for unnecessary programs, such as the strategic petroleum reserve or the space station.  Tax expenditures are special provisions of the Tax Code which reduce rates, increased deductions, provide advantageous depreciation, or otherwise reduce the taxes corporations and wealthy individuals pay.  A number of reports have been issued on the subject of corporate welfare in recent months, and we have used data from all of them. However, every selection of programs that can be cut involves choices, and the principles that guided our selection should be made clear. In general, we have chosen to favor: Family farms over agribusiness; small businesses over multinational corporations; domestic investment and job creation as opposed to offshore production; consumer health and safety over short-term profitability; and sustainable economic development over environmental exploitation.  We have emphasized supporting the needs of the average working people of America and cutting programs in which taxpayers' money is used to help companies and wealthy individuals who can, and should, be self-sufficient.  A summary of this 80-page bill is available through my office. In it, the corporate welfare programs re grouped by the industries which benefit from them and are listed with estimates of their cost over a 5-year budget period based on the sources cited at the end of the summary. Projections were then estimated for an additional 2-year period to have some rough frame of reference for different approaches to balancing the Federal budget over the next 7 years.                          ____________________
