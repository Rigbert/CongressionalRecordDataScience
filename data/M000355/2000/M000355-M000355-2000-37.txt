 President, I rise today to recognize Mike and Joanne Duncan of Inez, Kentucky, for the successful internship program they continue to run for students in eastern Kentucky.  Mike and his wife Joanne founded an innovative summer-internship program in 1977 with the hope of encouraging young people to continue to work and live in their home state after college. To date, more than 100 people have participated in Mike and Joanne's program and have had the opportunity to intern at local businesses or participate in other leadership-building projects around the community. This program has given students a place to exchange ideas with each other and community professionals to help them prepare for their career. It is through experiences such as these that Mike and Joanne have helped to show interns that they can make a difference in their corner of the world. The program the Duncan's have created gives students an opportunity to see first-hand what the real, working world is like in their hometown and often results in the students' desire to return home after college to share their talents and skills with the community of their youth.  Mike and Joanne's work is known and appreciated throughout eastern Kentucky, and throughout the nation. In 1996, Mike was called the ``Mentor to Eastern Kentucky,'' by the Journal of the Appalachian Regional Commission. Also, the Los Angeles Times once described the internship program as being ``more akin to adoption.'' The impact of the Duncan's work reaches across county and state lines, and is surely an example for similar programs across the United States.  Mike and Joanne display an unswerving commitment to the people of Kentucky and possess the gratitude and respect of many. Their dedication to helping young Kentuckians succeed through countless hours of counseling and tutoring over the last 23 years is indeed admirable.  Congratulations, Mike and Joanne, on your tremendous success, and thank you for your many generous years of service to eastern Kentucky's youth. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others.                          ____________________
