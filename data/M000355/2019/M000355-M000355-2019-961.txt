  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Objection is heard.  The majority leader.                       Business Before the Senate  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, for the information of all of our colleagues, I want to provide an update on the remaining items the Senate needs to complete before we adjourn for the August State work period.  Here is what we need to accomplish before Members depart next week: We need to confirm well-qualified nominees to two open positions of utmost importance--the Deputy Secretary of Defense and our Ambassador to the U.N. These jobs are important, the nominees are impressive, and we need to confirm David Norquist and Kelly Craft next week.  Obviously, we need to pass the bipartisan funding agreement that President Trump's negotiating team worked out with Speaker Pelosi. The House will pass it today. The President is strongly in support of it. The Senate needs to pass it and put it on the President's desk next week.  We need to make more headway on the backlog of qualified judicial nominees who are waiting for confirmation, so next week we will also need to process a significant, bipartisan package of district court nominees.  That is our to-do list for next week--the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the U.N. Ambassador, the bipartisan government funding agreement, and a significant group of well-qualified judges. Not bad for a week's work. That is what the Senate will accomplish before we adjourn for August.                          ____________________
