 Let me say, I hope those who are listening to this debate understand the issue that is at stake here. It is the care of our children. When Senator Domenici speaks about 4.5 percent of the Federal budget going to the care of our children, that is not an overwhelming percentage. But I will tell you what is overwhelming, speak to the working families who show up every day at day care centers struggling to pay for quality, safe child care. Senator Dodd understands what their concerns are.  I hope this Senate will support his effort to finally let this Federal Government go on record as saying, yes, let us reward work but let us also care for the children. We pay a fortune when we fail with children. And we pay it every day. Let us invest some money to help families take care of their kids and in a safe, quality setting.  I yield back my time.
