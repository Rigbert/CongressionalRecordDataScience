Madam Speaker, today the House is considering the Senate amendments to H.R. 3060, the Antarctic Science, Tourism and Conservation Act of 1996. This bill brings U.S. law in line with the international agreement covering Antarctic environmental protection. The bill was referred to the House Resources Committee which I chair. In an effort to cooperate with the Science Committee, the Resources Committee agreed to let the measure be considered by the full House without amending the bill.  In the Senate, my Alaska colleague, Senator Ted Stevens, added an important amendment which I support. The Stevens amendment requires that the National Science Foundation provide Congress with a Polar Research and Policy Study by March 1, 1997. It will provide Congress with a status report on the implementation of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy; a comparison of Federal Arctic and Antarctic research efforts; and an assessment of what needs to be done to implement the Arctic Research Commission's recommendations for Arctic research.  The Antarctic environment is, of course, very important and I am pleased that we are acting on this bill to improve our understanding of that continent and its surrounding waters. However, the Arctic also faces many difficult resource management issues. These issues include how to fairly manage wildlife to meet the needs of native people in the Arctic, and how to deal with the massive pollution problems created by Soviet industrial and military use of Arctic land and water. The study called for in this bill will give us the information we need to properly allocate Federal logistical and financial resources in order to make sure that the Arctic and those that live there get a fair share of Federal research dollars.  I am glad that the House is acting to clear this bill today, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.
