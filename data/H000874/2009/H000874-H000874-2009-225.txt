 First of all, the gentleman puts a lot of thoughts and words into my mouth that aren't necessarily there. Let me say to the gentleman that as he knows, some 3\1/2\ months ago I did, in fact, come to the gentleman, I subsequently came to the leader and indicated that I thought that we could reach agreement if, in fact, we could reach an agreement on time limits; and I was prepared under those agreements to have the minority choose such amendments as they wanted to offer, rather than have the Rules Committee do that. That offer was rejected, as the gentleman knows. It was rejected relatively emphatically by Mr. Boehner in a meeting in my office, attended by Mr. Lewis, Mr. Obey, Mr. Boehner and myself.  Now you quote Mr. Obey. In November of '06 the American public decided that they wanted to change the leadership in the House and Senate. They did so. Mr. Obey took over as chairman of the committee, as he had been chairman in years past. Of the 12 bills, Mr. Obey brought 10 bills to the floor under open rules. We did so under the understanding that you would give to us exactly what we gave to you under time agreements. Notwithstanding that, we debated those bills for 50 hours longer than the time constraints that we had agreed in '06 with you, the year before, when you were in charge of the House of Representatives.  So Mr. Obey concluded--and I did as well--that those time agreementswould not be honored and were not honored. Now I know there is a disagreement between your side and our side as to why they weren't honored. But there is no disagreement that they took 50 hours longer to consider those bills than was the case in '06.  Now having said that, we then went to Rules. I offered an agreement some 3\1/2\ months ago that was rejected. We then went to the bills, and we had gone to markups. Now we had a markup just the other day in committee on the Financial Services bill and the Energy and Water bill. I'm not sure exactly the number of amendments that were offered but most of which were not germane to the bills. That markup took until after 1 a.m. in the morning on nongermane amendments.  You and I have been discussing, trying to come to grips with time constraints. But I will tell you that time constraints--and you've indicated, trust us on good faith. I tried to get some indication of what ``good faith'' means, what criteria could I judge good faith on. We haven't reached agreement on that. But I will tell you that during the CJS debate on the rule, Mr. Lewis was asked on the bill that came to the floor under an open rule--Mr. Lewis said this after being asked, ``Can we reach a time agreement?'' He said, Because of that--referring to the 127 amendments, et cetera, et cetera, that were preprinted in the bill, 104 of which were Republican amendments.  Now under an open rule, of course, as the gentleman well knows--which, by the way, he serves on a committee that hardly ever reports its bills under an open rule. Hardly ever does a bill come out of the Ways and Means Committee that has an open rule. It's closed. You guys decide what to do, you bring the bill to the floor, and say, Take it or leave it.  Now here's what Mr. Lewis said in response to that question: ``I think the time limitation you were discussing was like for 8 hours or something,'' which is essentially what the bill took in the year 2006 when you were in charge. ``I'm afraid my conference might very well have a revolution on its hands, and you might have a new ranking member,'' was in response to, could he agree to time constraints.  So I tell my friend that he is right. I have tried to reach an agreement on where we could have a time agreement, and you would offer such amendments as you deemed to be appropriate within the time frame agreed upon. Unfortunately we didn't reach such agreement. I talked to Mr. Obey about that, and I talked to the Speaker about that. I believe that had we reached agreement, we would have proceeded on that course.  Now that does not mean because we did not proceed on that course that I don't want to continue discussing it. I want to assure the gentleman of that, because I believe that the more open our debate is, the better we are. The gentleman is correct when he characterizes my feeling as that. But it has to be within the context of being able to get the American people's work done in a timely fashion. I know the gentleman has indicated he agrees with that. Unfortunately in 2007, the last time we really did appropriation bills--we didn't do them last year, again, because extraneous amendments were offered to a number of the bills in the Appropriations Committee, and we didn't move ahead on those, as you did not move ahead in some of your years. I think that was, from my standpoint, unfortunate.  But I tell the gentleman in closing that I am hopeful that as we move ahead, we can do so perhaps through agreement. Now in terms of Mr. Obey, Mr. Obey is the chairman of the committee. Mr. Obey and Mr. Lewis have talked. They have not reached agreement, as Mr. Lewis indicated he could not. And frankly, the subcommittee chairmen have not reached agreement. I'm sure that the gentleman understands that, as majority leader, I'm very concerned about what the chairmen of both the committee and the subcommittee feel in terms of how their bills are handled on the floor, and we try to accommodate them.                              {time}  1400
