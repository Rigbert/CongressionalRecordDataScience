McDonough High School Rams from Charles County on their victory in the Maryland 2A football State championship. In the December 4 championship game, the Rams defeated Middletown High School by a score of 21-14 at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.  Congratulations are especially due to coach Luke Ethington, who led an outstanding group of athletes to their first championship since 1990, to the players, and to all of the fans. This championship is the product of exceptional athletes and coaches, untold hours of hard work, and the passionate support of the community. I'm very proud of this team, and I congratulate all those involved in bringing home the championship title.                          ____________________
