 President, tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of the Energy bill. Under a previous agreement, we will immediately proceed to a vote on the passage of that bill. Following the disposition of the Energy bill, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill.  We have had a number of amendments offered to the bill, and we will begin working through those amendments tomorrow morning. Senators should expect votes in relation to amendments throughout the day tomorrow. It is our hope we will be able to move the bill to passage sometime during tomorrow's session. Following passage of the Interior appropriations bill, we expect to begin consideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill.                          ____________________[Page S7449]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
