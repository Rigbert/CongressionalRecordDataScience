 President, I noted on Monday of this week that the administration had taken an important step on drug policy. I think, however, it was very much a misstep, and I do not think the administration played fair in doing it. Each year, the Congress requires the administration to submit a list of countries to be considered for certification on drug cooperation. This is called the Majors List.  The list serves as a basis for considering whether the countries listed have fully cooperated with the United States to control drug production and trafficking. It is this list that the President then considers for certification on March 1 of each year.  This year, and in keeping with what seems to be a tradition with this administration, the list came up to the Hill very, very late. Because of this and because of the history of tardiness, I decided to send a message to the administration, one that seemed necessary to get their attention. So I put a hold on several ambassadorial nominations to send the signal that Congress takes compliance with this certification law on the Majors List very seriously. After more than a week's delay, we finally received the list. As a result, I removed my holds, but the list as a document contains an omission that deserves careful notice.  Left off the list were the countries of Syria and Lebanon. Not just left off, but what does that mean, ``left off''? In this backhanded way, the administration decided in one big step to certify these two countries as somehow fully cooperating with the rest of the world, in this case the United States, on drug policy.  Let's think about this for a moment. Syria has been decertified for over 10 years. Syria was not certified even during Desert Storm or Desert Shield when it was one of our allies in that war. Lebanon has just received a national-interest waiver--a decertification with somehow a get-out-of-jail-free card. Now, without debate or without substantive explanation, the administration has simply left these two countries off the list. This is a momentous change in policy. It reverses years of consideration, and it appears to ignore considerable evidence.  In the letter forwarding the list to Congress, the President makes two arguments for doing this. Neither argument stands up well.  The first argument seems to advance the idea that because Syrian and Lebanese cultivation of opium has dropped below 1,000 hectares, that this act alone justifies a reconsideration of their being on the list.  It may justify a reconsideration, possibly, but it hardly justifies backdoor certification, and this is backdoor certification. Even the State Department's own annual drug report makesit clear that both Syria and Lebanon remain major transiting countries for drugs. This criterion alone is enough to qualify for inclusion on the Majors List, but the administration then advances the argument that this is somehow OK, because the drugs do not come into the United States. There seems to be some belief in the administration that this is a justification for not keeping these two countries on the Majors List. However, it is apparent the administration does not read the law or doesn't even read its own reports.  But even if the facts supported removing Syria from the list, which they do not, the Congress deserves to be briefed on this momentous change beforehand. Israel and other European allies deserve notice of this dramatic change of our policy. The American public deserves a chance to understand the change. This did not happen. Instead, what we have is indirect certification. As a result, Syria will now escape serious consideration next March, despite evidence of significant trafficking and production of these illegal drugs.  When my staff first learned of the prospect of the change in policy, I told them to indicate to the State Department that this would be a very, very big mistake. I hoped that the Department would not take the step that they took.  I was of the opinion, however, mistake though it was, that if the administration wanted to proceed well, then it was their call. I did not extend my hold on the ambassadorial nominations to cover the issue of Syria, and I withdrew my hold on these nominations as soon as the list was delivered, late though it was. But this list raises yet another concern.  What we are left with, days before Congress adjourns, is a roundabout certification of Syria. I believe, as I said before, that such a decision is a big blunder. The way it was done does not do justice to the issue or the process of certification.  If it had not been done this way, imagine for a moment how the issue would have been handled. Next year, in February, the administration would have to make a decision to certify Syria or not based on the merits. It would have to make a case to Congress at that point and even to the public at that point for such a move. There may be some who believe that in that more straightforward environment, the same decision would have been made, but I doubt it.  With time to reflect and to consider, to publicly debate the issues and the facts, I seriously doubt that this administration would have certified Syria as fully cooperating in drug control. So not wanting to face the music, the administration did this behind-the-scene two-step instead. I hope the administration will reconsider, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in signing a letter to the President asking him to relook the issue.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter by myself from this body and Congressman J.C. Watts, who is leading the effort in the House of Representatives, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                Washington, DC, November 13, 1997.     The President of the United States,     Executive Office of the President, The White House,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We note with concern that you have not      included Syria and Lebanon on the annual Majors List sent to      the Congress. By this act, you have, in effect, certified      Syria as fully cooperating on drug control issues. The      arguments advanced in your transmittal letter to Congress,      however, seems to be based on assumptions supported neither      in the relevant law or by the facts. Even should the facts      justify the decision to ultimately certify Syria and Lebanon,      however, we are also concerned about the method by which this      momentous decision was reached. This change in policy and      approach was not discussed with Congress nor was there an      effort made to establish the justifications for this action.      Instead, the decision was made in a most indirect way at the      end of the Congressional year, thus precluding debate or      public discussion of the issues.       For these reasons, we hope that you will reconsider the      decision to place Syria and Lebanon on the Majors List. That      change will then provide the Administration, Congress, and      the public the opportunity to discuss the merits of this      decision publicly, with ample time to reflect on the      justifications for such a decision.           Sincerely,     Charles E. Grassley.     J.C. Watts.                          ____________________
