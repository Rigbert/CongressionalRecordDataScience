Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, if my colleagues are struggling to follow this debate between the cement kiln industry and the industrial incinerator industry, what they are doing is burning toxic waste, and they want to know how much they can emit from their smokestacks and there is a battle within these two industries.  I do not have a horse in this race, and this amendment really does not address that issue. This amendment gets down to what I think people in the gallery watching, and Members I hope, believe is the bottom line. When it is all said and done, no matter who wins or who regulates, is my family at risk or not? Is something coming out of that smokestack which can hurt me and my children? That is all we want to know.  The Durbin-Wilson amendment says the bottom line is the EPA should use one standard: Protect Americans from exposure to arsenic, benzene, dioxin, lead, and known cancer-causing substances. What is the debate here? Do we want to say they should not protect us? Why, of course they should.  These industries can work it out somewhere else. The Durbin-Wilson amendment is the bottom line as to what we expect from any agency which is dedicated to protecting public health.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Visclosky].  (
