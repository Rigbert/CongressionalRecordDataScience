Speaker, I rise tonight to request that the following letter be inserted in the Record.                               Congressional Ukrainian Caucus,                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2004.     Hon. Viktor Yanukovych,     Prime Minister of Ukraine.       Dear Prime Minister Yanukovych: As members of the      Congressional Ukrainian Caucus and long time supporters of      Ukraine's independence and economic growth, we are writing to      express our concern regarding an investment issue that      involves U.S. taxpayer funds.       The Congress established the Western NIS Enterprise Fund      (WNISEF) as a private equity fund to invest in small- and      medium-sized private enterprises in Ukraine (Moldova and      Belarus) in 1994. WNISEF was capitalized initially with $150      million by the U.S. Government, with the key aspect of      spurring foreign investment in Ukraine. Since its foundation,      the Fund has fulfilled its mission as envisioned by Congress,      making cumulative investment commitments of more than $73      million in 22 companies in Ukraine, as well as $3.8 small      business loans to 67 Ukrainian small businesses. The Fund has      attracted additional capital to these businesses of well over      the amount it has invested itself.       However, these accomplishments are now at risk of being      overshadowed by an investment dispute that threatens      Ukraine's foreign investment reputation and U.S.-Ukrainian      economic relations.       WNISEF recently filed an arbitration case against Ukraine      arising out of Ukraine's violation of the Fund's rights under      the U.S.-Ukraine Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT). it is a      disturbing investment issue implicating the fundamental value      of rule of law, contract and treaty obligation enforcement.       The case involves a WNISEF loan to the Ukrainian company,      Sonola JSC (Kirovohrad). After Sonola defaulted on payments      of the loan, WNISEF sought to collect the loan and, as in      accordance with the dispute settlement language of the loan      agreement, filed a claim for arbitration with the American      Arbitration Association, New York, USA. The arbitrator, and      subsequently the New York courts, upheld WNISEF's claim      against Sonola of $3.8 million.       Unfortunately, WNISEF has been unable to enforce the      international arbitration award in Ukraine's courts--twice      filing a petition     for recognition and enforcement of the award to the      Kirovohrad Oblast Court of Appeal during 2001-2002. The      Supreme Court of Ukraine has refused the Fund's appeal,      casting doubts as to the fulfillment by Ukraine of its      obligations under international agreements.       WNISEF has now been forced to file an action against      Ukraine to the International Centre for Settlement of      Investment Disputes (Washington, D.C.), alleging that the      actions of the Ukrainian judiciary have violated      international law, including Ukraine's obligations under two      important international agreements to which Ukraine is party.       We would like to ensure that the Fund is treated fairly      under the terms of the U.S.-Ukraine Bilateral Investment      Treaty. If WNISEF is not provided basic protection under      Ukrainian law, how can other potential foreign investors have      any confidence in Ukraine's foreign investment climate?       The Fund has repeatedly expressed its willingness to      resolve the dispute by way of negotiations and reaching an      amicable agreement. In order to prevent the potential      negative effects for Ukraine due to a hearing of this case at      the International Centre for Settlement of Investment      Disputes, we urge you to facilitate a prompt resolution of      this dispute.       Reducing investor risk and increasing investor confidence      are the keys to attracting additional foreign capital to      Ukraine, which will in turn create jobs, modernize factories      and bring numerous other benefits to the Ukrainian people.       It is our hope that American companies doing business in      Ukraine maintain full confidence in the Ukrainian system and      continue to contribute to its economic development. A prompt      resolution of the WNISEF investment dispute will enhance U.S.      confidence in Ukraine's commitment to foreign investment      protection.           Sincerely,     Marcy Kaptur,       Co-Chair.     Curt Weldon,       Co-Chair.                          ____________________
