President, this is excellent debate, great points have been made, as in all these things. But consider the fact this bill is not going anywhere. What we are doing tonight is like training to fight the Spanish Armada. We ought to put all these speeches in the Record. Of course, we will all spend the weekend reading each other's speech with due diligence, but then everybody could go home.  I just remind my colleagues of one thing, maybe the thing that will move us away from these Dracula hours of legislation more than anything else around here if--if--we do not lose our nerve and do apply the laws of this country to the Congress as applied to everywhere else: Starting January 1, paying time and a half for all the staff who have to stay around here when we go through this useless exercise. Instead of costing the taxpayers $15,000 or $20,000 an hour for this, it will start costing $40,000 or $50,000 an hour. Maybe--maybe--we will pass legislation, have debates during the daytime and not do the Dracula hours.  I yield the floor.
