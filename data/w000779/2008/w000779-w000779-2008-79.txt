President, for the next 33 hours, millions of Americans will face mindless, relentless, needless tax torture trying to shovel their way out from under an avalanche of bureaucratic forms as they struggle to complete their taxes.  Citizens Against Government Waste has calculated that Americans spend 4.3 billion hours each year filing their tax returns and complying with our tax laws. That is a lot of time to spend on something that is about as interesting as prolonged root canal work.  My guess is many Americans would rather read the phonebook than our Tax Code, and the phonebook is actually a lot shorter. So I am going to give one example of the heavy reading Americans have in front of us over the next 33 hours.
