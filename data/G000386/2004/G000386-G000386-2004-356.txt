 The first one deals with tomorrow's business and a vote on the Snowe amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to Snowe amendment No. 2937 regarding childcare occur at 12:15 on Tuesday March 30, provided further that no second degrees be in order to the amendment prior to the vote, with Senator Carper to be recognized for up to 10 minutes prior to the vote, and that the time be counted against any Democrat-controlled time.
