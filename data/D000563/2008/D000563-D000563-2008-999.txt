President, I am glad the majority leader has come to speak about this issue. It is hard to imagine what is going through the mind of the President that he believes he can make an argument tomorrow with the meeting at the White House, that we have been unreasonable in dealing with his nominations.  Senator Reid spelled out what happened. We tried, in many ways, to get some balance in nominations. That is done all the time so Republicans and Democrats will be appointed. It is done by both parties. I have seen it in the years I have been around the Senate. When Senator Reid made that offer in December, the White House said: No, they would not do it unless they could have this one nomination, Mr. Bradbury. And I will have to say I think Senator Reid went that extra mile, an extra 84 miles, as a matter of fact, and he basically said 84 of those Bush nominees would be confirmed.
