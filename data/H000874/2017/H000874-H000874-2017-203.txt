Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues--there are not a lot of people on the floor, Mr. Speaker, but I hope they are watching on television--to understand that the basic responsibility that we have of ensuring the functioning of the government of the people of the United States is one that we ought to perform in a responsible, effective, and timely fashion.  Mr. Chairman, I will work with you, and I will work with Mrs. Lowey over the next few days to ensure that next week we have a product that can pass this House because it has bipartisan support and is in the best interests of our country.
