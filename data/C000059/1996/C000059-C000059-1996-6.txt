Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1786) to regulate fishing in certain waters of Alaska, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1786       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DESCENDANTS' LAND USE.       (a) In General.--Local residents who are descendants of      Katmai residents who lived in the Naknek Lake and River      Drainage shall be permitted, subject to reasonable      regulations established by the Secretary of the Interior, to      continue their traditional fishery for red fish within Katmai      National Park (the national park and national preserve      redesignated, established, and expanded under section 202(2)      of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16      U.S.C. 410hh-1)).       (b) Red Fish Defined.--For the purposes of subsection (a),      the term ``red fish'' means spawned-out sockeye salmon that      has no significant commercial value.     SEC. 2. EFFECT ON TITLE AND JURISDICTION OF TIDAL AND                    SUBMERGED LANDS.       (a) Title.--No provision of this Act shall be construed to      invalidate or validate or in any other way affect any claim      by the State of Alaska to title to any or all submerged      lands, nor shall any actions taken pursuant to or in      accordance with this Act operate under any provision or      principle of the law to bar the State of Alaska from      asserting at any time its claim of title to any or all of the      submerged lands.       (b) Jurisdiction.--Nothing in this Act nor in any actions      taken pursuant to this Act shall be construed as expanding or      diminishing Federal or State jurisdiction, responsibility,      interests, or rights in management, regulation, or control      over waters of the State of Alaska or submerged lands under      any provision of Federal or State law.
