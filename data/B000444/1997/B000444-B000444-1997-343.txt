 President, today I am pleased to join Senator Leahy in introducing on behalf of the administration, President Clinton's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act, which the President announced last week in Boston.  Three years ago Congress passed the Biden crime bill into law. Today, the verdict is in--the law is working to reduce adult crime. For example, the projected violent crime rate is the lowest since 1991 and the projected murder rate is the lowest since 1971.  But we all know that, unlike adult crime, juvenile crime is on the rise. The statistics are all too familiar: Violent juvenile crime increased by 69 percent from 1987 to 1994; from 1983 to 1994 the juvenile homicide rate jumped 169 percent; and just recently, the Center for Disease Control has reported that the United States has the highest rate of childhood homicide, suicide, and firearm related deaths of 26 industrialized countries. We can and must do better than that.  The President's program is based in large part, on success stories from cities like Boston, MA, which developed a comprehensive community-based strategy to both prevent at-risk youth from becoming criminals and deal harshly with those already in the criminal justice system.  Boston's Operation Night Light sends probation officers on patrol with police to ensure that youth with criminal records stay out of trouble and to assist in the investigation of new crimes. And Boston's police force has joined with Federal law enforcement to target the illegal gun markets that supply most of the guns to gangs and violent youth.  The results have been dramatic: Youth homicides have dropped 80 percent citywide; violent crime in public schools dropped 20 percent in just 1 school year; and most impressively--not a single youth died from a firearm homicide during 1996. Now that is a record we could be proud of.  We are taking the same balanced approach to juvenile crime and drug abuse as we did in the 1994 Crime Act--tough sanctions, certain punishment and protection of vulnerable kids.  Like the Democratic crime bill I, Along with Senators Daschle, Leahy, and many others introduced earlier this year--S. 15--the President's juvenile crime initiative cracks down on violent juvenile offenders and youth gangs, takes concrete steps toward preventing drug and gun violence, and invests in programs that will get kids off the streets and into supervised programs during the after-school hours when they are most likely to be the victims of gangs and criminals or the customers of drug pushers.  The Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act proposes to use Federal law enforcement where its expertise and resources can best contribute to fighting crime and the spread of gangs. The act also seeks assistance for local police and criminal justice systems to help them address matters that we all know are local law enforcement challenges that they handle the best.  On the Federal level the President's bill: contains tough new Federal penalties applicable to gang activities such as racketeering, witness intimidation, car-jacking, and interstate firearms and drug trafficking; cracks down on juvenile gun use by extending the Brady bill to juveniles and requiring the sale of gun locks; makes juvenile records more accessible to police andeducators; and targets abuse of drugs popular among youths by giving the Attorney General emergency rescheduling authority.  But in recognition that the battle against youth crime and drug abuse is fought primarily in our communities and schools, the President's bill provides over $325 million annually to support State and local governments to: hire additional prosecutors to target gang and youth violence; create special drug and gun courts to handle violent juveniles more effectively; create safe-havens for at-risk youth; initiate systems of graduated sanctions so youth receive certain punishment for their first offense instead of a mere slap on the wrist; and promote use of curfews and put truants back in school where they belong.  The President also proposes to recraft the Federal Juvenile Justice Office by eliminating bureaucracies, streamlining programs, providing additional flexibility to States and localities, and sharpening the Office's focus on research and development. These are reforms that I have long advocated.  However, the President's reform proposal reaffirms our commitment to a few core principles that have worked well over the past 23 years--juveniles should not be housed in adult jails or lockups; juveniles in custody should be separated from adult criminals; status offenders should not be incarcerated; and where it exists, the disproportionate confinement of minorities must be addressed.  With the introduction of this legislation the administration, Senate Republicans, and Senate Democrats have now all made it a priority to address the problem of youth violence. Of course, there are other proven, effective crime control programs that I would like to pursue--such as extending the 100,000 Cops Program to put another 25,000 cops on the beat. I am sure there are initiatives which others would want to push.  But, instead of trying to pass an omnibus bill--which we all know will be difficult, if not impossible--I think that we should keep our focus on a targetted, specific bill which keeps our focus on the most immediate concern: youth violence and the criminal victimization of youth.  I look forward to working with the administration and my Republican colleagues to craft responsible legislation that will address the pressing concerns of the American public and be signed into law during this session of Congress.                                 ______                                       By
