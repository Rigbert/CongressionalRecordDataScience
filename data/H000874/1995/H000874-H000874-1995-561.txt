Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman making that point. As the gentleman knows, that amendment was supported overwhelmingly. It was supported by many of us who feel very, very strongly, as the gentleman has just articulated, the importance of AmeriCorps. That vote had nothing to do with AmeriCorps, although under the rule, as the gentleman points out, that was the way they found to fund that particular restoration. I think the gentleman makes a good point. We are certainly going to revisit that.
