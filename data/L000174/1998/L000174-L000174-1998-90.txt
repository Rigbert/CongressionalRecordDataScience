President, first, I alert my colleagues that I will speak a very short time. I am going to talk about a UC that I would have proposed but will not propose today but will explain why.  Earlier this month, the Republican majority came to the floor, unfortunately without prior warning, to propound a unanimous consent request for consideration of the Hatch-Sessions juvenile justice bill, S. 10. I see the distinguished Senator from Alabama here on the floor now. The UC was proposed late on Thursday afternoon. Unfortunately, it was after Senators had been informed there would be no more votes. In fact, I had already left for home in Vermont. We were unaware that they might want to proceed to S. 10 on Thursday.  My concern is that there had been a year of inaction on the bill. I had tried to propose some additional changes to the bill, which was voted on by the Judiciary Committee in July 1997, but I was unable to get any response from the other side of the aisle in the Judiciary Committee on that. There was also no attempt to get a response from this side of the aisle on the proposed UC.  I mention this because the failure of this Congress to take up and pass responsible juvenile crime legislation does not rest with the Democrats. And it is not going to be cured by any kind of a procedural floor gimmick.  Over the past year, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate and at hearings on several occasions about my concerns with the legislation. At the same time, I have expressed my willingness to work with the chairman of the full committee in a bipartisan manner to improve the juvenile crime bill.  I am not alone in my criticisms and in wanting to see changes in the bill. It has been criticized by virtually every major newspaper in the United States. It has been criticized by national leaders ranging from Chief Justice Rehnquist to Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund. The National District Attorneys Association, and other law enforcement agencies have also written me with their concerns about this bill.  I have also heard from numerous State and local officials across the United States, including the National Governors' Association, the Council of State Governments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. All of them have expressed concerns about the restrictions this bill would place on their ability to combat and prevent juvenile crime effectively.  In short, S. 10, as reported by the Judiciary Committee, is a bill laden with problems--in fact, so many that at last count the bill had lost nearly a quarter of the Republicans who signed on as cosponsors since its introduction.  The unanimous consent request that was proposed by the other side of the aisle, I believe, was patently unfair. It would have limited debate of juvenile justice and other crime matters. It would have permitted the Republicans to offer a substitute to their own bill but not allowed Democrats the same opportunity. The only additional amendments in order under their plan would be five on each side.  We just received from the chairman of the Judiciary Committee the day before yesterday, September 23, the latest version of S. 10 which contains over 100 different changes, but the Republicans want to limit us to 5 amendments. That is not a bipartisan effort to improve this bill.  While I appreciate that we are short of time in this Congress, and I understand why the Republican leadership would like to limit the number of amendments the Democrats may offer, of course, the decision to bring the bill up at the end of the Congress is that of the majority. I have no problem with that.  But we have worked diligently to pare down the amendments that the Democrats plan to offer to S. 10 from 64 to the 25 substantive amendments which I would have put in a proposed UC. Keep in mind what I said, also, that just a couple days ago we were handed the latest version from the other side with over 100 changes. We are talking about cutting Democratic amendments from 64 to 25 substantive ones that address the substantial criticisms leveled at this bill. I want to assure that Senate consideration of this legislation is fair, full, and productive. I do not appreciate, frankly, what appears to be almost a procedural ambush to move this bill forward in a way that allows consideration of all changes from the other side but very few from this side.  So, Mr. President, I am not going to make a unanimous consent request, but I ask to put this into the Record--not as a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record what I would recommend should be a unanimous consent request to be asked by the leadership entitled ``Juvenile Justice.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Juvenile Justice       I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the      majority leader, after consultation with the democratic      leader to proceed to Calendar No. 210, S. 10, The Violent and      Repeat Juvenile Offender Act and it be considered under the      following limitations:       That the only amendments in order be a substitute amendment      offered by Senators Hatch and Sessions, a substitute      amendment offered by the minority leader or his designee and      the following listed amendments, and that if either      substitute is agreed to that the substitute continue to be      amendable in two degrees:       Leahy--judicial review procedures in certain juveniles      cases; preservation of state presumption for prosecution of      most juveniles; access to juvenile records; separation      standard for juveniles in custody; crime victims assistance.       Kennedy--gun control measure; Hate Crimes Prevention Act;      reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency      Prevention Act.       Biden--prevention program for after-school activities;      increase funding for prosecutor/courts grant program; modify      requirements to qualify for funding from $150 million grant      program; gun ban for dangerous teens; preserve the sovereign      rights of native Americans by continuing the tribal ``OPT-     IN''; extension crime law trust fund.       Kohl--reauthorize title V programs; restoration of the jail      removal mandate.       Feingold--improve school safety; allow funds to be used to      identify early warning signs of potential juvenile offenders.       Durbin--relevant.       Bingaman--Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction      Act; to strike provisions relating to tobacco and alcohol.       Lautenberg--jump mentoring bill, S. 1461.       Wellstone--juvenile mental health protections.       Murray--restorative/community justice.       That there may be a managers package of amendments to be      cleared by both the majority and minority manager; and       I finally ask consent that following the disposition of any      or all amendments the bill read a third time, the Judiciary      Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R.      1818 and the Senate proceed to its consideration; all after      the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 10, as      amended be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill be read a third      time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill.      I further ask that following the vote the Senate insist on      its amendment, request a conference with the House and the      Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the      Senate.
