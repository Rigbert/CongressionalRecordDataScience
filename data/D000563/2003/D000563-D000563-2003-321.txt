 Let me make sure we understand exactly what this amendment does. I have spoken to the issue of teacher quality. There is $325 million in State grants for that purpose. I think this shows an increase in the teacher quality commitment which is important for us to make sure the No Child Left Behind Act succeeds. There is another $2 million for training teachers in technology.  How many times have we visited the classroom as Senators and found older teachers such as myself in age struggling to understand the new technology? The bill before us zeros that out. There is no money for preparing our teachers to use technology. This amendment adds $62 million, and $50 million for training teachers in math and science. It increases the investment by $50 million to a total of $150 million.  I think this is an extremely high priority when you consider the technical challenges facing us in this century. Finally, there is $12.1 million for school leadership which helps to recruit, train, and retain principals and assistant principals. These are the people who have the responsibility to make the school work.  I think this $450 million is money well spent--money that lets the No Child Left Behind Act have a chance to succeed. To shortchange it, unfortunately, will cause us to fall short of our promise and fall short of the mark in improving education across America.  I yield the remainder of my time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Does the Senator offer his amendment?
