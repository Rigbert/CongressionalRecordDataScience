Music.'' Mr. Szor ends his 55th season as the conductor/music director of the immensely popular Music under the Stars summer concert series held at the Toledo Zoo Amphitheater. Each summer our community happily anticipates the inception of another summer of the concert series of Music under the Stars. Because of Mr. Szor, music-lovers can rest in the Toledo Zoo's amphitheater taking in the beautiful sounds and sights of Toledo. Besides his dedication to bringing a collection of classical, patriotic and spirited pieces to Toledo residents, he holds an extensive list of additional credits.  In his early years after graduating with degrees from University of Michigan, he played bassoon with the Toledo Symphony, Toledo Opera Orchestra and the University of Toledo Woodwind Quintet and Trio as well as playing jazz saxophone in area bands and clubs. His conducting credits include the Casual concert series and other concerts with Toledo Symphony, twenty years with the Perrysburg Symphony Orchestra, guest conductor with the famous Goldman Memorial Band in New York City, and conductor/music director for opera, musical comedy and ballet theatre in the Toledo area. In the choral realm, he has been conductor/music director of The Toledo Choral Society for 49 years and was a director of church music for over 40 years. In addition to his conducting credits, he was a music educator serving for 32 years in the secondary and college levels in Toledo.  Mr. Szor has received numerous awards for his distinguished work, most recently including a national award from the American Hungarian foundation and the Ovation Award from the Vocal Arts Resource Network of Ohio. Toledo garners much pride in his commitment to evoke a mosaic of melodies to our community for decades. Sam Szor is an inspiration to conductors and musicians everywhere by his grace, ease and spirit toward music.                          ____________________
