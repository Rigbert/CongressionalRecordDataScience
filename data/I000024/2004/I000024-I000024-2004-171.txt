President, this amendment addresses the Energy Savings Performance Contract Program. It is a program that costs no money. It is all paid for by the savings that are accumulated. This has been cleared on both sides. Everyone is for it. I can't find anyone who is against it. The problem arose when CBO started scoring this after not having scored it. By its very nature, it will not cost any money.
