Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  I rise to make a couple of observations. The chairman of the committee just a few seconds ago--he would not yield to me--said, look, we are just cutting a little bit of money and the sky is not falling. Well, apparently the gentleman from Pennsylvania believes the sky is falling as it relates to the literacy council.   Other colleagues on his side of the aisle said, we ought to send the money out of Washington. We ought to let the local people make the decision. We ought to have local application. We ought to have local people working on that.  Is it not ironic that the first amendment offered is to add $5 million, and do you know where that $5 million goes? Here in Washington, not out to the States, not out to local school systems, not out to local literacy councils, here in Washington.  So, my friends, I say to you, we have had a lot of rhetoric about the awful Democrats that centralizing money in Washington, and the first amendment offered by the Republican chairman of the committee, of the authorizing committee, offers an amendment to restore totally $5 million which, if divided, obviously, into 50 states, means $100,000 a State. But it does not go to the States. It stays right here in Washington,  I find it a little bit ironic. I am not against it, by the way. I want to tell the gentleman from Pennsylvania, for whom I have a great deal of respect and with whom, as he knows, I agree on his comments in the earlier part of our debate where we need to make sure that programs work effectively. He and I agree on that, whether it is chapter 1, Head Start or any other program. I am not just spending these resources and not making sure they work. But the fact of the matter is, this money, as the distinguished ranking member knows, stays right here in Washington with all those Washington bureaucrats. I am shocked that this amendment would be offered.
