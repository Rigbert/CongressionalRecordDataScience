SANDERS. Allow me to finish my remarks. This is where we are. Where we are right now is a moment at which we either go forward or not, be serious or not. We hear day after day concerns about the deficit. What we know is the oil industry, year after year, has been enormously profitable. We know in 2009 a number of oil companies, including ExxonMobil, did not pay any taxes. Let's do something about it. Let's pass this amendment.
