The three committees, as you know, reported somewhat different bills. Those bills have been put together and there are additions and subtractions from that bill.  But I would say to the gentleman that the overwhelming part of that bill, as I have indicated, has been online for over 3 months. There have been literally thousands of town meetings with reference to the substance of the bill--not the specific bill that was just put on the line at 10 a.m. this morning. And now there are 8 million hits on the Rules Committee Web site, downloads. So Americans are doing what we indicated we'd give them the opportunity to do--and we wanted them to do.                              {time}  1830  I'm sure you have, I don't know whether you personally have, but I'm sure your side has downloaded it as well. From that standpoint, the notice that we promised to give is being given. It is a massive bill. It is a very consequential bill. We believe it's a very important bill for every American, every American family, every American business, and for our country.  That bill is going to get and has been getting, over the last, frankly, 8 months, where we have had a large number of hearings, from 2007 to this date, somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 hearings. I'm not sure of that specific number. I had it, but I can't recall it right now. There were markups on the bills, over 100 amendments presented in each committee and considered and voted upon.  So that this bill, as I said before in the colloquy last week, has had more discussion, more town meetings, has been read more extensively than any bill in the 29 years that I have been here in the House of Representatives.  So again, I would reiterate to the gentleman that this bill has received extraordinary oversight, extraordinary review, and extraordinary input from the citizens of this country and, indeed, in the markups of three committees, input from the members of the three committees.
