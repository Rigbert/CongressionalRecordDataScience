The reason they are not being used is because there is no timber in that area, which have been cut already, a very small amount of the Tongass. I am talking about State land.  By the way, can I ask the gentleman who just briefly spoke, or anybody: Have you been to the Tongass?  Do any one of you want to answer that? No. They are mimicking or parroting what has been fed to them.  This is not the United States of the Federal Government; it is the United States of America. You are taking away the right of a State of access to their land because of this action, and that is wrong.  I said we won it in court. You may not know that. We will win it again, because the law is very clear: There was to be no more in Alaska, but Obama did apply it.  So I am saying: Have at it. It is not going anywhere.  I shouldn't get excited. It is just the idea that you are supposed to be representing a form of government, and you should have a right to represent your district. That is your responsibility.  Stay out of my district, because you are not doing what is right for the State of Alaska, and that is my job. I say shame on you.  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
