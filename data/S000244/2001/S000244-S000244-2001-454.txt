Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) for yielding again.  Mr. Chairman, the problem is that it ended up not being technical in nature and it ended up changing substantive rights in the bill, which is something that we had decided to keep out of the technical amendment.  I would further point out to my friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), that the change was made prior to the Committee on Rules holding its hearing yesterday, and the amendment that was before the Committee on Rules was the revised text.
