 The DERA program, as the gentlelady is aware, was not in the administration's mark, and in this underlying bill, we provide for $10 million for the DERA program. As she well knows, throughout the country this is a way to remove old diesel engines that pollute, and this is something that actually works.  It's not a program; it's not a study; it's not some academic exercise. It's actually something that cleans up the air, so it's something I am very much supportive of. But right now EPA's Buildings and Facilities accounts are cut by nearly one-third. We have cut back these accounts substantially, and so we just can't support the offset in the bill.
