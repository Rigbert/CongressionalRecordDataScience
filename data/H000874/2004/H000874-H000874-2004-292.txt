Speaker, while all of us rightly focused on the continuing effort to secure and stabilize Iraq, none of us can close our eyes to the ominous and growing danger posed by the government of Iran.  That is why I strongly support this important bipartisan resolution brought to the floor today by the chairman and ranking democrat on the Committee on International Relations (Mr. Hyde and Mr. Lantos).  This resolution condemns in the strongest possible terms Iran's continuing deceptions and falsehoods to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the international community about its nuclear programs and activities.  For example, Iran failed to properly disclose the existence of a fuel enrichment plant and facility at Natanz, until both were revealed by an opposition group.  It confirmed that it had conducted research on uranium conversion processes, but only after it denied doing so.  According to a February report by the director general of the IAEA, Iran continues to engage in deception regarding its nuclear activities.  This resolution also calls on the United States, as well as all state parties to the treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to use (and I quote) ``All appropriate means to deter, dissuade, and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.''  The fact is, our national security demands that we do everything in our power to prevent Iran from developing and acquiring nuclear weapons.  The Iranian government is hostile to the interests of the United States. It is a state sponsor of terrorism.  It is a committed enemy of the state of Israel, our staunch ally and the lone democracy in this most volatile region.  It is vital that we speak with one voice on this issue of utmost gravity. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
