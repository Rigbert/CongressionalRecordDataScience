  Now, let me ask my friend from Oregon this. Obviously, before my Republican colleagues would go forward on radical legislation like this that would throw some 32 million Americans off of the health insurance they have, they have obviously consulted with doctors and hospitals to get their views as to the impact this legislation would have on patients and hospitals all over America.  What kind of testimony did the doctors make on this bill or the hospital administrators make?
