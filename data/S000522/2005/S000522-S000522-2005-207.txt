Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to conclude.  I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for this partnership resolution, as well as the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), and others. We had 27 cosponsors of this resolution.  Last July in the Commission on Security Cooperation in Europe, we held a hearing in Albania. We heard from a number of important and prominent witness, including representatives of MJAFT! which is the youth organization that is doing some important pioneering and important work in Albania today. I want to thank them for their work as well.
