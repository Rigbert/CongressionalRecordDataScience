Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from New York, the chairman of our full committee, and just to say a couple of words.  What were they thinking, lending money to a government like China to move people around involuntarily?  I was looking at an internal World Bank document and I cannot believe this. One of the people that they have hired will be working on an involuntary resettlement action plan. Involuntary. Not voluntary, involuntary.  I think the amendment is timely and important. This is not the first time, I say to my colleagues, in recent years that the bank's arrogance has resulted in tragedy for helpless citizens of a brutal regime. An Indonesian human rights advocate at one of my subcommittee hearings during the last days of the Suharto regime said that ``the people of Indonesia had nothing to say about creating that large debt but the World Bank is determined to democratize its repayment.'' The bank was warned that it was subsidizing corruption throughout and yet continued to do so. Here we have a mass transmigration of people against their will--and again, this is involuntary. I hope the gentleman from New York's amendment will prevail.
