 President, today marks the 34th anniversary of title IX. Since 1972, title IX has opened doors to athletics, education and success for millions of young women across our Nation. For 34 years, the program has increased participation under Republican and Democratic administrations, because title IX is not about politics it is about helping young women realize their dreams.  The statistics are amazing--millions of young women breaking down barriers. But behind these numbers, the lives of these women have been improved because of the changes brought about through title IX.  I have seen how title IX has changed the experience of women in my own family. When I went to school 30 years ago, the atmosphere was much different. Back then at Washington State University, I could only participate in a few sports, and women receiving athletic scholarships was unheard of.  The difference between my daughter's generation and my own could not be more stark. Women of my generation never had the chance to go to college on a sports scholarship, even though many deserved them. Some of my daughter's friends have done just that.  I am so proud of my home State of Washington, which is the first State in the Nation to boast two women Senators and a woman Governor. It is also home to WNBA champions the Seattle Storm.  There is no doubt that title IX has opened doors for women over the past34 years. The challenge for all of us today is to make sure that those doors of opportunity stay open for our granddaughters and great-granddaughters.  As we celebrate the anniversary of this important law, I urge President Bush and Secretary of Education Spellings to protect existing title IX policies and give every young girl in American the chance to experience the roar of a crowd--and not just cheer from the sidelines.                          ____________________[Pages S6455-S6456]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 THIRTY-FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX
