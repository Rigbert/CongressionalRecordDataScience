 President, I wish to recognize Louisville, Kentucky's, longtime meteorologist John Belski, whom a large swath of Kentuckians have relied on for accurate weather forecasts for over 23 years. After a long and successful career, John has retired. This September 8 he presented his final weather broadcast.  John began at WAVE-3 TV in Louisville in July 1987 and has been welcomed into Kentuckians' homes ever since. A typical morning for residents of the greater Louisville area began by tuning in to John for important details about the day's forecast.  Before joining WAVE-3, John worked in Louisville at WLKY-TV and also at stations in St. Louis and Columbia, MO. John's professionalism has earned him several awards, including 15 different Best of Louisville Magazine honors, the Best of Kentucky award by Kentucky Monthly magazine and the LEO Readers' Choice Award, just to name a few.  John was at the center of the hard-hitting winter storm in 1994, when Kentucky was blanketed with a record snowfall of more than 15 inches. In August 2009 he stood watch when a massive rainstorm produced large hail and flash flooding that caused major damage to some of Kentucky's most well known attractions, including Churchill Downs. And who could forget this time last year, when one of the most severe ice storms in Kentucky's history crippled the area, leaving 760,000 residents without power and causing 36 deaths across the State. Throughout it all, John's was a calm and steady voice, providing viewers with critical information.  Now that he has retired, I hope John will have more time to spend with his wife Lynn and his two daughters. John is not just known for his abilities as a meteorologist in Louisville. Whether it be partaking in one of the many county fairs or being present at the Kentucky Derby, John was always there, reporting. He is going to be missed enormously, and I would ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him on behalf of all Kentuckians for his service.  Mr. President, WAVE-3 TV recently published a story on the retirement of their friend, John Belski, and I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From WAVE3.com, Aug. 18, 2010]            Meteorologist John Belski Retires from WAVE 3 TV       Louisville, KY (WAVE).--WAVE 3 Meteorologist John Belski      will retire from WAVE 3 TV on September 8, 2010, it was      announced by Regional Vice-President & General Manager Steve      Langford.       ``Retirement for a deserving friend should always be looked      upon with happiness,'' said Langford. ``While I regret to see      John leave the airwaves, I respect his decision and wish him      and his family much happiness.''       ``This is an opportunity for me to explore some new      possibilities outside of the TV business,'' Belski said.      ``After all these years at WAVE 3 it's time for Kevin Harned      to take the reins and lead the weather team.''       Kevin Harned and John Belski first met when Kevin was in      high school. Harned wrote to Belski asking him to speak to      his 4-H Club in Nelson County. That meeting left an indelible      mark on Harned who persistently pursued his new career goal      to become a television meteorologist. ``John has been a great      mentor and a great friend,'' said Harned. ``We've covered a      lot of severe weather together and hopefully have helped to      keep our community safe from harm.''       John Belski first joined the WAVE 3 weather team in July      1987. Prior to that, he worked at WLKY-TV in Louisville and      also at stations in St. Louis and Columbia, Missouri. In      addition to his television forecasts John makes multiple      daily postings to his blog, Twitter and Face book sites. Over      the years John has been on the air on 18 different radio      stations and currently on 84 WHAS-AM and WMPI 105.3 FM. His      weather book ``Backyard Weather Folklore'' sold thousands of      copies.       ``For the past 23 years John Belski has been the calming      voice in the storm while protecting our viewers during severe      weather,'' said Langford. ``His folksy, friendly style of      forecasting has made him a favorite in our community.''       John Belski has received numerous awards from community      organizations and publications including 15 different Best of      Louisville Magazine honors, the Best of Kentucky by Kentucky      Monthly magazine and the LEO's Readers' Choice Award. He has      anchored Emmy Award winning coverage of severe weather and      received the Special Service Award from the National Weather      Service and the Mark Trail Award for public awareness of NOAA      weather radios.       John Belski will present his last weather broadcast during      WAVE 3 News at 6:00 p.m. on September 8, 2010.
