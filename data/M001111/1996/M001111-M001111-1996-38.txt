 President, I rise today to describe a project being undertaken by a remarkable organization in my home State of Washington. PeaceTrees Vietnam, the 20th international PeaceTrees Program sponsored by the Earthstewards Network, represents the dedicated work of individuals working to promote peace on a local and global scale.  For over a decade, Earthstewards has worked around the world to foster dialog between peoples of various countries, and to contribute to communities around the world. Earthstewards has organized PeaceTrees Programs in many communities, including Capetown, South Africa; Auroville, South India; Bluefields, Nicaragua; and Tacoma, WA. Now, this organization is embarking on a project in Vietnam.  Every week in Vietnam, a child is killed or maimed by the explosion of an antipersonnel landmine. At this time, there are over 58,000 leftover landmines and unexploded ordnance in the Quang Tri Province of Vietnam, the DMZ during the Vietnam war. PeaceTrees Vietnam seeks to eliminate the threat of these devices by removing landmines, planting trees, raising community awareness, and reducing the dangers of landmines in Vietnam and across the globe.  This important program has several phases. First, beginning this summer, landmines will be removed near the old Khe May military base in the town of Dong Ha in Quang Tri Province. American and Canadian retired military experts as well as Vietnamese local militia will extract these destructive weapons of war. Then, in November, a Friendship Forest will be planted in this area. Not only will this serve as a cooperative effort of the Westerners and Vietnamese who plant these trees, it will help set up a buffer to stop the dry, hot winds from Laos and restore life to deforested terrain.  Next, construction of a Landmine Awareness Education Center will begin. Educational displays will be created, so children and adults may understand how to identify potentially unsafe areas, and what to do if a landmine is encountered. Mine clearance will continue through 1997 in the thousands of hectares of the surrounding farm and forest land. This will allow citizens to productively and effectively utilize the land again, and will help re-forest the area.  As a member of the PeaceTrees Vietnam International Advisory Board, I am pleased to have the opportunity to assist efforts to make this landmine-ridden area safe again, and to raise awareness of the global problem of landmines. I applaud the work of all those who have helped organize and implement PeaceTrees Vietnam. Efforts such as theirs truly make a difference in the lives of countless individuals around the world.                          ____________________
