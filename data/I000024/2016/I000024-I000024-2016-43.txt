President, we are going to have a vote here shortly, and it is going to be one of the major, significant votes.  First of all, I know the occupier of the Chair is very aware of the things we have been doing in the committee called Environment and Public Works. Most of the stuff we have been doing is very meaningful, including the highway bill, the chemical bill, and now the WRDA bill.
