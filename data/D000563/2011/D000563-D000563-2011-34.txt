 It is important for us to move beyond this stalemate on an important issue that will literally affect 160 million working Americans.  Currently those working families enjoy a 2-percent payroll tax cut. For the average family in Illinois with a $50,000 annual income, it means $1,000 a year or more in terms of a tax cut. So if we fail to continue this payroll tax cut, families across Illinois and across America are going to see an increase in their payroll taxes of about $100 to $125 dollars a month. We cannot let that happen. These families are struggling paycheck to paycheck. We want to help them. We want to make sure we help this economy by putting more life into it, which creates more opportunity for profitability for business and new jobs.  We also need to maintain our unemployment insurance which we have provided during these difficult times for those families struggling to find work.  At this point it is clear we should move immediately--immediately--to consideration of the House tax cut bill, a bill which passed the House and should be taken up immediately in the Senate. There is no reason for delay. It has to be done before we go home. Let's not waste any more time. Let's bring it to a vote.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3630, which was just received in the Senate from the House; that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees prior to a vote on passage of the bill; that no amendments be in order prior to the vote, and that the vote on passage be subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold; further, that if the bill is not passed, it remain the pending business and the majority leader be recognized.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Is there objection?
