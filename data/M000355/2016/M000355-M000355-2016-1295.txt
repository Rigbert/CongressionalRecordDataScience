 President, today the Senate has an opportunity to pass bipartisan legislation that would add to our Nation's ability to hold North Korea accountable for its growing aggression. North Korea threatens regional stability and our own national security. It threatens allies in the region, especially South Korea and Japan.  As General Clapper stated yesterday, it is a country that will continue to advance its nuclear program. I would urge my colleagues to vote yes to the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act today so we can work toward keeping our Nation and our allies safer.                          ____________________
