Speaker, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic is one of the deadliest foes that we have faced in recent history. Like any foe, we must learn all we can about this deadly virus and take appropriate action to halt its assault on society.  One of the first steps in stopping the spread of HIV is to know if one is infected. A recent study showed that 90% of the people who knew their HIV status changed their sexual behavior, thus helping to stop the spread of HIV. This statistic illustrates the importance of knowing one's HIV status. I believe it is essential for all U.S. citizens to be aware of their HIV status. This will not only help them stay healthy, but it is the first step in preventing the transmission of HIV to other.  Unfortunately, many people in this country are unaware of their HIV status. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 900,000 people may be infected with HIV and nearly one-third of these individuals or 270,000 are unaware of their HIV status.  We must ensure that people have access to all FDA approved HIV tests. It is the simplest and cheapest form of prevention.  A barrier to HIV testing is that it is often perceived as painful because some testing requires blood samples taken through needles. Many people fear needles and therefore would rather not be tested than give blood.  I am pleased to learn that there is FDA approved technologies that do not require the use of needles. Companies like Calypte Biomedical, which is located in my own state of Maryland and in California, have focused on developing HIV diagnostic test than do not use needles, such as the HIV urine tests.  Why then are so many not being tested?  It has come to my attention that some facilities within the public health infrastructure are discouraging local community testing groups from using HIV tests that require only a urine sample. Some states have even passed legislation that prevents organizations from accessing FDA approved HIV urine testing technologies.  It is critical that our public health infrastructure, which receives Federal Medicare, Medicaid and block grant funds, supports all FDAapproved HIV testing systems. In our efforts to help people learn their HIV status, we must guarantee access to all HIV testing options, like urine testing.  A first step in this direction is to become involved in the upcoming National AIDS Testing Day. The National AIDS Testing Day is coordinated by the National Association of People with AIDS (NAPWA), which Calypte Biomedical supports.  I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to become involved with this effort.                          ____________________
