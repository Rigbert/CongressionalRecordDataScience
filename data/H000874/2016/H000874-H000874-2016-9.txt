Speaker, I want to say to the gentleman from California that I appreciate the fact that our offices work together, that the Speaker and the leaders' offices have been working together and that the committees have been working together.  I would urge, however this money is appropriated--whether it is appropriated within the CR, whether it is appropriated in the WRRDA bill itself--that the money needs to be made available before we leave this week because this is an issue that has dragged on for too long and the people of Flint are still in dire distress, which is terribly unfortunate given the length of this crisis and the causes of this crisis, in some respects.  Lastly, Mr. Leader, I asked this and you responded that December 9 was the date; but do you see any possibility of going beyond the 9th that we need to warn our Members about? We are hearing that both on the Senate side and on our side, that there is every expectation that next week will be the last week that we will be in session in the 114th Congress.  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman knows better than I--he has been here longer than I--that we can always set a date, but Congress sometimes has a problem making that date.  It is our hope that we can be finished by December 8, but no one can predict what happens on this floor, whether we have to be here longer. It is always my intention that Members understand, if the work is not done, we will not leave.  So we will not leave until we get a continuing resolution done and get WRRDA done. I believe that the prior work that we have done working together--and knowing where both of them are right now--that we can finish this up and be done on time.
