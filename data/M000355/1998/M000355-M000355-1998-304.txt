 President, this agreement has been cleared on both sides.  I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. today the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 2282, which is at the desk, and it be considered under the following agreement:  Two hours on the bill to be equally divided between myself and Senator Biden, or our designees; that no motions or amendments be in order except those agreed to by both managers; and that following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the bill be advanced to third reading and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, all without intervening action or debate.
