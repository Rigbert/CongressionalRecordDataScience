President, I say to the Senator from Georgia, I think it would be an interesting debate. We may reach that debate as to what is reasonably secure. There are some, as I understand it, 300 million people who cross our border with Mexico every year in legal status, for commercial purposes and otherwise, and whether we are secure under the Senator's amendment, I would have to listen to his arguments on who makes the certification and what are the standards for that.  If we had a situation where the fate of millions of people hinged on a subjective decision about reasonable security, I think that would raise some questions about whether we are moving forward and whether people would say: I can step out of the shadows now and I think at this point I am prepared to tell you who I am, where I live, where I work, and here are my records. If there is this uncertainty, at any given time you could stop the process.  I say to the Senator from Georgia, it would be an interesting debate and I am anxious to hear his side of the argument.  His is 1 of 100 amendments that have been filed. One of his other amendments we are prepared to take up immediately. I don't think that is the same one. We are prepared to take that up because we think it would move the bill forward in a constructive, bipartisan way.  I would like to hear the Senator's argument before making a final decision.
