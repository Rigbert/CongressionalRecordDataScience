 President, today, I am reintroducing legislation I first offered last year regarding the $150 veterans plot allowance to states. My bill would provide a payment for all veterans--not just some veterans--who are buried free of charge in a State veterans cemetery, if they are eligible for burial in a national veterans cemetery. I am pleased to be joined in this effort today by Senators D'Amato, Hollings, Roth, and Stevens.  The imperative for enacting this legislation is even greater today than it was when I introduced the same bill last May. Earlier this week, the Associated Press reported that our national cemeteries are fast running out of space. Of the 114 national cemeteries, 56--one short of half--are already full. And, space exists for just 230,000 more caskets and the cremated remains of just 50,000 more veterans. Compared that with the 27 million veterans living today who will be eligible for burial in a national cemetery.  For those familiar with veterans issues, these statistics will not come as a great shock. In fact, the rapidly dwindling space in national cemeteries is one of the main reasons that over a decade ago, Congress established the state cemetery grant program. In doing so, we hoped to encourage States to build State veterans cemeteries to ease the burden on the national cemetery system.  This Federal-State partnership has not only worked, it is a shining example of what the States and the Federal Government can do together. Since the creation of the program, over 25 States have built State veterans cemeteries--and there are now 42 such cemeteries throughout the United States. For States like Delaware, which do not have a national cemetery at all, the State cemetery program ensures that veterans will receive the dignified burial they deserve in a veterans-only cemetery, while being buried closer to home than if they were buried in a national cemetery.  Now, however, I fear that this partnership is at risk--precisely when we need it the most. The reason is because of an anomaly in the law. States are required to bury in a State-owned veterans cemetery those veterans who are eligible for burial in a national veterans cemetery--that is, all honorably [[Page S3061]]  discharged veterans. To help meet the cost, the Federal Government promised to pay a $150 plot allowance to the State for each veteran who is buried free of charge. But--and here is the catch--this payment is not made for all honorably discharged veterans. Rather, a State is eligible for the plot allowance only for burying veterans who meet a set of more restrictive criteria. Specifically, the plot allowance is paid only for those veterans who: First, were receiving veterans disability compensation or a veterans pension; second, died in a VA hospital; third, were indigent, and the body was unclaimed; or fourth, were, or could have been, discharged from the military due to a disability.  In short, State-owned veterans cemeteries exist to help relieve the Federal Government of its responsibility to bury all veterans in national cemeteries. At the same time, States do not receive the $150 plot allowance for burying all national cemetery eligible veterans. It seems to me that this disparate treatment is in conflict with the very purpose for which State veterans cemeteries were established.  And, because of the limits on the payment of the plot allowance, I have heard anecdotal evidence in recent years that some States may soon stop burying veterans free of charge. They claim that they cannot afford to do so when the Federal Government does not pay the $150 plot allowance.  To further complicate matters, last year, Congress extended eligibility for burial in a national cemetery to National Guard members and reservists who have served at least 20 years. By their eligibility for burial in a national cemetery, they are also now eligible for burial in State veterans cemeteries. But, of course, few, if any, will meet the four-point criteria I mentioned a moment ago--and the States will not receive a $150 plot allowance for their burial.  So, Mr. President, as we are asking more of State veterans cemeteries--through expanded eligibility and through decreased space in national cemeteries--and as State veterans cemeteries become more vital to the national cemetery system, we need to ensure that States continue to participate in the program. To guarantee that--and to be fair to the States--my legislation would simply provide States the $150 plot allowance for burying without charge any veterans eligible for burial in a national veterans cemetery. No more restricted criteria. No more contradictory goals. Only one simple and fair rule: If a State buries a veteran in lieu of burial in a national cemetery, the State is paid the plot allowance.  If my legislation were enacted, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that it would cost the Federal Government about $1 million annually. While my bill does not have offsetting reductions in other Federal spending to cover this cost, I am committed to finding such reductions before the measure is passed.  Mr. President, on this, the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima--at a time when we are honoring the brave men who fought there and the almost 7,000 who died there--it is well to remember that the Federal Government is duty-bound to give all of our veterans a decent and dignified burial. The legislation I am introducing today will help to ensure that we live up to that solemn commitment. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.                                 ______      By
