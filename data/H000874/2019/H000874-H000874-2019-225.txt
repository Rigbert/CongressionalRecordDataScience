The probability is the reason you wanted to work for that company was because the wages were good, the benefits were good, and safety conditions were good, which the union got, but he or she doesn't want to pay dues to the union. They don't have to join the union; they have to pay dues to the union.  I think it is somewhat ironic but demonstrative that when the gentleman speaks of safety regulations, very frankly, Republicans spent a lot of time, when they were in charge, passing reductions of regulations that we think undermine the safety of consumers, workers, and individuals.  We have a disagreement on that, Madam Speaker, but that is what we believe, and that is the tension here. We represent, I think, an attitude that we need to make sure that everybody plays by the rules so that people are safe.  In any event, we will discuss that further, I am sure, in the coming days, weeks, and maybe years.
