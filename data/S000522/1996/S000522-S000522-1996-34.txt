Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. Bereuter], my good friend, for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman Gilman for his leadership in ensuring the timely consideration of H.R. 3564, the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, a strong advocate of NATO enlargement, and Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I have consistently emphasized the importance of human rights in the expansion process. In addition, I am keenly interested in encouraging states interested in NATO membership to take concrete steps to strengthen civilian democratic control of the military.  During the International Relations Committee's consideration of this important initiative, language which proposed on each of these aspects of enlargement was approved with the Chairman Gilman's support, for which I am grateful.  As a result, Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today includes an unqualified statement that the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights are integral aspects of genuine security. The legislation also makes clear that the human rights records of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe interested in joining NATO should be evaluated in light of the obligations and commitments of these countries under the U.N. Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Helsinki Final Act. I would note that all 27 states of the Partnership for Peace [PfP] are participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE]. That membership has committed each to act in accordance with all OSCE documents, including the Helsinki Final Act.  Mr. Speaker, the enlargement process provides an excellent opportunity for countries desiring membership to demonstrate their commitment to the shared values of NATO--including respect for human rights--as well as their ability to fulfill the military and political obligations expected of all member states. Prospective members should meet the criteria set forth in the NATO Participation Act of 1994 and other relevant legislation before they are admitted as full members of NATO.  It is also important to recognize that the present process of enlargement is taking place under significantly different circumstances that existed when a limited number of states were added in the past. Given the growing number of countries actively seeking full membership in the alliance, it is essential to establish clear criteria which all new members must meet.  Mr. Speaker, in recent days there has been some discussion about including Croatia among the prospective recipients of assistance under this legislation. To set the record straight, nothing in the pending legislation precludes Croatia from receiving assistance provided that country--or any other prospective recipient--meets a series of criteria, including respect for human rights. I welcome the recent decision of the OSCE to deploy a mission to Croatia and look forward to the findings and recommendations of that group which could contribute to establishing the conditions necessary for Zegreb to pursue eventual membership in NATO. In the meantime, Croatia should press for inclusion in the PfP, widely viewed as the first step toward possible NATO membership.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to turn briefly to the issue of civilian democratic control of the military. At the outset, let me say that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have made tremendous strides in overcoming the legacy of communism. Perhaps one of the most delicate aspects of this transition has been establishing civilian control of the military an important prerequisite for those wishing to join NATO. Significant progress has been made in the emerging democracies leading to increased transparency with respect to military activities and budgets. Another key component, in my view, is the naming of a civilian to serve as minister of defense. Beyond mere symbolism, this action underscores the willingness of the military to subordinate itself to the democratic civilian leadership--a fundamental aspect of democratic society. I applaud those countries which have already undertaken this important step and encourage others to pursue that course.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation as a demonstration of our determination to move NATO expansion forward and our commitment to the people of East Central Europe, including those from the Baltic States and Ukraine, as they strive to overcome the legacy of communism and pursue democracy firmly rooted in respect for the rights and freedoms of the individual.                              {time}  1145
