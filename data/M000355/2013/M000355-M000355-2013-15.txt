 President, I rise today to congratulate a friend of mine and a good friend to the Commonwealth, Mr. James L. Hurley, on his recent inauguration as the 20th president of the University of Pikeville. A graduate of the class of 1999 himself, President Hurley's new post makes him the school's first alumnus to serve as president.  President Hurley was sworn in last month at the Eastern Kentucky Expo Center in Pikeville, KY. He succeeds former Governor Paul Patton in the position. Patton previously appointed Hurley as the institution's vice president and special assistant. James is a native of eastern Kentucky and is married to Tina, also an alumna of the University of Pikeville.  President Hurley, after earning his bachelor's degree at the institution he now leads, earned a master's degree in educational leadership from IndianaUniversity, a rank I in instructional supervision from the University of Kentucky, and a doctorate in higher education leadership and policy at Morehead State University. As an undergraduate he was a student-athlete on the Pikeville men's basketball team.  I commend President Hurley for his great achievement in reaching this position and certainly wish him all the best in his leadership of the University of Pikeville. I look forward to working with him to accomplish great things for the school, the region, and the Commonwealth.  Mr. President, an article that appeared in the University of Pikeville campus newspaper after the announcement of his ascension to the presidency described James L. Hurley's accomplishments and goals in his new position. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  [From the University of Pikeville Campus Publication, May 21, 2012]          Hurley Named University of Pikeville President-Elect       Pikeville, KY--The University of Pikeville Board of      Trustees has named James L. Hurley president-elect of the      institution, effective July 1, 2013. Hurley currently serves      as the vice president for enrollment and retention and      special assistant to the president.       The action was taken during the board's spring meeting May      18. University President Paul Patton informed the board that      he would not ask for an extension of his contract, which      expires June 30, 2013.       ``The Patton-Hurley team has brought us tremendous      progress,'' said Board Chairman Terry Dotson. ``The Hurley-     Patton team will continue that progress.''       An experienced educator and administrator, Hurley spent 11      years in the public education system, serving in numerous      roles, including as principal, assistant principal, dean of      students, teacher, and athletic coach. He joined Patton at      the University in 2009, providing leadership in the      administration of campus operations, program development,      strategic initiatives, recruiting, financial aid and      retention efforts.       Along with his wife, Tina, he is a graduate of the      University of Pikeville, formerly Pikeville College. He      earned his master's degree from Indiana University, a Rank I      from the University of Kentucky and his superintendent's      certification at Morehead State University. He will complete      his doctorate at Morehead in the fall.       ``James Hurley is bright, energetic, motivated and a self-     starter. He has been an integral part of the tremendous      progress we have made at the University these past three      years,'' said Patton. ``As our chief executive officer, he      will lead this University to new heights.''       The board also voted to establish the position of      chancellor, which Patton will assume on July 1, 2013. As      chancellor, Patton, who was governor of Kentucky from 1995 to      2003, will represent the University and concentrate on      fundraising.       ``I am humbled and honored by the board of trustees'      decision in naming me president-elect to succeed Governor      Patton next year,'' said Hurley. ``My wife and I love this      institution and we look forward to our continued journey with      the administration, faculty, staff and students at UPIKE.      Governor Patton's willingness to accept the role of      university chancellor will make for a seamless and smooth      transition.''       The announcement also has historical significance, as      Hurley will become the first alumnus to lead the institution,      which was established in 1889 to serve the youth of      Appalachia.       ``A great university can measure its worth by the quality      of its alumni,'' said Kay Hammond, president of the Alumni      Association. ``Vice President Hurley is certainly one of our      most accomplished. He has always sought to protect and      preserve all that is special about the University of      Pikeville.''                          ____________________
