 DeWine for himself and Mr. Coverdell) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1234, supra; as follows:       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following      new section:     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COLOMBIA.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Colombia is a democratic country fighting multiple      wars:       (A) a war against the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces      (FARC);       (B) a war against the National Liberation Army (ELN);       (C) a war against paramilitary organizations; and       (D) a war against drug lords who traffic in deadly cocaine      and heroin.       (3) Colombia is the world's third most dangerous country in      terms of political violence with 34 percent of world      terrorist acts committed there.       (4) Columbia is the world's kidnaping capital of the world      with 2,609 kidnapings reported in 1998 and 513 reported in      the first three months of 1999.       (5) In 1998 alone, 308,000 Colombians were internally      displaced in Colombia. Over the last decade, 35,000      Colombians have been killed.       (6) The FARC and ELN are the two main guerilla groups which      have waged the longest-running anti-government insurgency in      Latin America.       (7) The Colombian rebels have a combined strength of 10,000      to 20,000 full-time guerillas; they have initiated armed      action in nearly 700 of the country's 1073 municipalities,      and control or influence roughly 60 percent of rural Colombia      including a demilitarized zone using their armed stranglehold      to abuse Colombian citizens.       (8) Although the Colombian Army has 122,000 soldiers, there      are roughly only 20,000 soldiers available for offensive      combat operations.       (9) Colombia faces the threat of the armed paramilitaries,      5,000 strong, who are constantly driving a wedge in the place      process by their insistence in participating in the peace      talks.       (10) More than 75 percent of the world's cocaine HCL and 75      percent of the heroin seized in the northeast United States      is of Colombian origin.       (11) The conflicts in Colombia are creating spillovers to      the border countries of Venezuela, Panama and Equador:      Venezuela has sent 30,000 troops to its border and Ecuador is      sending 10,000 troops to its border.       (12) Venezuela is our number one supplier of oil.       (13) By the end of 1999, all U.S. military troops will have      departed from Panama, leaving the Panama Canal unprotected.       (14) In 1998, two-way trade between the United States and      Colombia was more than $11 billion, making the United States      Colombia's number one trading partner and Colombia the fifth      largest market for U.S. exports in the region.       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate      that--       (1) the United States should recognize the crisis in      Colombia and play a more pro-active role in its resolution;       (2) the United States should mobilize the international      community to pro-actively engage in resolving Colombian wars;      and       (3) pledge our political support to help Colombia with the      peace process.                                 ______                                       REID AMENDMENT NO. 1172
