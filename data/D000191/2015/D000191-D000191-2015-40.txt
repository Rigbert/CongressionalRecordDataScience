Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Actually, the amendment is to take money from New York City, Washington, D.C., probably Baltimore, Boston--I don't know--anyone who has a legacy transportation system that actually, until Ronald Reagan was President, pretty much was built without Federal dollars and run without Federal support and they have huge backlogs in terms of bringing them up to a state of good repair, 120-, 130-year-old tunnels.  This would just basically say: Let's put the money in the places which have the most modern transportation systems, built most recently, and probably built since Federal support was put in place by Ronald Reagan and stick it to the ones who did it on their own 130, 140 years ago and have been struggling to keep up and only had a partnership with the Federal Government since Ronald Reagan was President of the United States.  This does not go to the efficiency of an operation anytime anybody applies for a TIFIA loan or anything else. Theyare evaluated in terms of how they are going to be able to repay those loans at the fare box, out of the fare box, out of operating costs, not what their assets to liabilities are.  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
