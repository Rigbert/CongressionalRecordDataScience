 President, I am proud to be here with Senator Harkin. But I am not proud to be here because of the situation that we described to you, which is the flooding in our State of Iowa. I am going to show some pictures. Senator Harkin has some pictures. I am not going to refer specifically to the pictures during my remarks, but I think you can see from the New York Times, downtown Cedar Rapids, IA--City Hall here on an island between the rivers, kind of in the citadel of Cedar Rapids, and water has never been that high before. This is truly a 100-year flood.
