 We have now completed six appropriations bills. The gentleman has announced we will have a seventh--Financial Services--on the floor next week. Does the gentleman anticipate doing the balance of the five remaining appropriations bills before the September 30 end of the fiscal year?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman noted, as of last night, the House has now acted on six appropriations bills, which is halfway through, and, as I mentioned in the schedule announcement for next week, the House will begin consideration of the seventh bill with the Financial Services Appropriations Act starting on Monday evening. That is as much as I see for the next week, but as we move forward through the July calendar, I will keep you notified as we continue through.
