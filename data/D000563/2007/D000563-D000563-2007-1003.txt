 Yesterday I proposed this amendment with Senator Bingaman. The Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committees make important decisions, life-and-death decisions. They decide whether the drugs and medical devices which are going to be used in America are safe and effective. In other words, if a person in America has a prescription from a doctor and takes this drug, is it going to be good for their health, or bad?  This is a critical situation. If they make the wrong decision, if the advisory committee turns a dangerous drug loose on the market, it can have terrible consequences, so these committees literally have life-and-death decisions in their hands on approving drugs, on deciding what the warning labels say, deciding what you have to say in advertising. There might be a danger in these drugs. These advisory committees are the juries of scientific experts who have to make these calls. That is one of the most important decisions of our Government.  They are not just life-and-death decisions, they are decisions involving millions and millions of dollars. Drug companies spend a fortune over a long period of time trying to bring a drug tomarket. They would hope this will be a drug very popular and profitable for them and their shareholders. That is a natural inclination of a business. So the advisory committee not only decides the safety and efficacy of the product, it makes a decision which has a direct impact worth millions of dollars to the drug companies involved.  Do you know what we found out? We found out over the last 10 years many people sitting on these advisory committees, those who are actually sitting on the so-called juries and deciding the fate of these drugs, have a conflict of interest. Some of them were already receiving, from the companies that make the drugs, tens of thousands of dollars in consulting fees and speaking fees. It turns out they are on the payroll, some of them, of the very companies on which they are being asked to stand in judgment. That is a conflict of interest which people cannot accept and I cannot accept.  The Food and Drug Administration argues that there are so few experts that we have to sometimes turn to those who have a conflict of interest; there is no place else to go. So occasionally we have to put a waiver in and allow someone to sit on an advisory committee panel who frankly has a financial interest in the company they are making a decision about.  That worries me. Because if you are going to have truly objective jurisdictions, that are right for the consumers of America, that approve drugs or disapprove them on the merits, not because of some inclination or prejudice which you might bring to the table, you don't need these conflicts of interest.  So basically what Senator Bingaman and I have said is: Let's strengthen the conflict-of-interest provisions on advisory committees. Let's make certain that there is confidence in the process. We know what happened with Vioxx. There were 10 people sitting on the advisory committee who had a financial conflict of interest. Had they been removed from the deliberation, the panel would not have recommended they go back on the market, endangering the health of thousands of Americans.  How can you ever justify that kind of conflict of interest? Our language tightens it. What we are trying to do is to make sure the Food and Drug Administration, with this amendment, limits the number of waivers to one per each advisory committee meeting, allows advisory committees to receive information from guest experts who have a financial conflict but prevents those experts from participating in the deliberations.  They can come in and express their point of view and then leave the room before the deliberation and the vote take place. And also strengthen the provisions to increase the outreach for new experts. The Food and Drug Administration has to do a better job of cultivating this new cadre of trustworthy experts who can serve on these advisory committees.  We have 125 medical schools in this country, 90 schools of pharmacy, 40 schools of public health. If the FDA is more aggressive in filling the slots on the advisory committees, we can remove this shadow of doubt which is over this process.  Now, some will argue: Well, the FDA has come forward with draft guidance to improve this. This is draft guidance. They are suggestions. This is law. This tells them they will have to follow the law to avoid these conflicts of interest. This is not an idea that Senator Bingaman and I bring to the table without support.  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to have printed in the Record with my remarks letters from the Consumers Union, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and a broader letter from 11 different organization that support this amendment, that would reduce and eliminate the conflicts of interest when it comes to approving new drugs and medical devices. What is at stake is the integrity of the Food and Drug Administration, the integrity of the process, and making certain we can say, with a straight face to American consumers, the products that are coming to the market, the life-and-death decisions that are being made that bring them to the market are being made by people who do not have a financial conflict of interest with these devices. I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin-Bingaman amendment.  I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the Record after my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Consumers Union,                                                      May 8, 2007.       Dear Senator, Consumers Union, the nonprofit, independent      publisher of Consumer Reports, urges you to support the      Durbin-Bingaman amendment to S. 1082, the Food and Drug      Administration Revitalization Act. This amendment will help      ensure that FDA advisory committees responsible for assessing      a drug's safety are not inappropriately influenced by      scientists or others with financial ties to the affected drug      company.       A recent national survey by Consumer Reports National      Research Center found that Americans are extremely concerned      about the pharmaceutical industry's influence on the drug      safety process, as well as financial conflicts on FDA      advisory boards.       Sixty percent of those surveyed disapproved of allowing      doctors and scientists with a conflicting financial interest      to participate on advisory boards. And 84 percent of      consumers agree that drug companies have too much influence      over the government officials who regulate them.       This amendment would make it more difficult for the FDA to      issue financial conflicts of interest waivers to the      scientific experts who serve on its advisory committees. The      Durbin-Bingaman amendment would: limit the number of waivers      to one per advisory committee meeting; establish a specific      process to allow experts with a financial conflict to present      information to an advisory committee, while not permitting      them to deliberate or vote with the committee; and enhance      the FDA's outreach activities for identifying non-conflicted      experts to participate in advisory committees.       The integrity of the FDA advisory process is vital to      ensuring that decisions by federal policymakers benefit the      public, and not the agendas of any special interest.       Please support the Durbin-Bingaman amendment to S. 1082. If      you have any questions, please contact Bill Vaughan.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Vaughan,     Senior Policy Analyst.                                  ____                                                      May 8, 2007.       Dear Senator: The Union of Concerned Scientists strongly      urges you to support the Durbin-Bingaman amendment to the FDA      Revitalization Act, S. 1082. This amendment will help ensure      that the Food and Drug Agency's assessment of the safety and      efficacy of drugs is not inappropriately influenced by      scientists with ties to the drug companies affected by an FDA      approval decision.       This amendment would make it more difficult for the FDA to      issue financial conflicts of interest waivers to the      scientific experts who serve on its 30-plus advisory      committees.       Conflicts of interest can have serious consequences for      drug safety. For example, ten of the 32 scientists on the      February 2005 advisory committee that considered the safety      of Cox-2 inhibitors, including Vioxx, had ties to the drug      companies that made the products. The scientists voted to      permit the companies to continue marketing the drugs, even      though Vioxx had already been withdrawn from the market and      had been implicated in tens of thousands of deaths.       The Durbin-Bingaman amendment would: limit the number of      waivers to one per advisory committee meeting; establish a      specific process to allow experts with a financial conflict      to present information to an advisory committee, while not      permitting them to deliberate or vote with the committee; and      enhance the FDA's outreach activities for identifying non-     conflicted experts to participate in advisory committees.       The integrity of science is vital to ensuring that      decisions by federal policymakers benefit the public, and not      the agendas of any special interest. We at the Union of      Concerned Scientists are working to ensure that federal      scientists, and those who advise federal agencies, are free      to do their work without interference. This amendment will be      a constructive step in addressing the pervasive problem of      political interference in government science.       For all these reasons, we believe that the Durbin-Bingaman      amendment merits your support. Please call our Washington      Representative Celia Wexler if you'd like more information on      either S. 1082 or the amendment.           Sincerely,                                          Dr. Francesca Grifo,                           Director, Scientific Integrity Program,     Union of Concerned Scientists.                                  ____                                                   April 30, 2007.     Senator Jeff Bingaman,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Bingaman: We, the undersigned organizations,      give our wholehearted support to the amendment to S. 1082      that you plan to offer next week that would limit the number      of conflict of interest waivers allowed on Food and Drug      Administration advisory committees. This amendment would end      the vast majority of conflicts of interest while insuring      that the FDA has access to the best advice that this nation      has to offer.       The amendment would: require the FDA to engage in greater      efforts to find experts without conflicts of interest to      serve on its     advisory committees; limit the number of waivers that can be      granted to one per committee per year; and authorize the FDA      to hire experts who have conflicts of interest to make      presentations and answer questions at an advisory committee      meeting if the FDA believes their expertise is crucial.      However, these experts will not be allowed to vote or      otherwise participate in the discussions leading up to      committee vote.       The FDA advisory committee process has been severely      compromised in recent years. According to the agency's most      recent report, one in four experts advising the FDA received      waivers because they have financial ties to companies with a      stake in the outcome of advisory committee meetings. At the      February 2005 meeting which voted to allow continued      marketing of Vioxx and Bextra, nearly a third of the advisers      had ties to Cox-2 manufacturers and had their votes not been      counted, the vote would have been reversed.       The status quo is undermining the public's faith in the      ability of the FDA to protect it from unsafe or ineffective      drugs. We believe passing this amendment will help rebuild      the public's confidence in the integrity of the scientific      process at the FDA. Please circulate this letter among your      colleagues and encourage them to vote yes on the Bingaman      amendment.           Sincerely,         Center for Medical Consumers, Center for Science in the            Public Interest, Consumers Union, Government            Accountability Project, National Research Center for            Women & Families, National Women's Health Network,            Reproductive Health Technologies Project, Title II            Community AIDS National Network, Union of Concerned            Scientists, U.S. PIRG, Woody Matters.
