 We have become a point of entry for European goods that have shipped a container to New Orleans, and then will ship from New Orleans to Mexico in order to avoid the customs and tariff on European goods, and they add that into our balance of trade. Maybe one dock worker checks that container for 1 or 2 minutes of his or her day, but that was the total American contribution to that effort. But that counts as part of our exports to Mexico. It is, as my colleagues know, it is a transshipment.  I mean it is amazing, the lengths to which our Government has gone to try--and even when they get all done with that, they still have to show a deficit in October, and that was before we got to the devaluation, and does any American believe, or do any of those muckamucks really believe, that we can go on, year in, year out, running a trade deficit with the rest of the world of $120, $140, $160 billion, and someday the piper will not come due. We are not only exporting those jobs this year by running those trade deficits. Someday someone is going to ask us to cough up those dollars that we are shipping overseas. We have more than $1 trillion of Federal debt now. From 1917 until 1984 the U.S. Government was the largest creditor in the world, and now we are the largest debtor in the world. We owe more money to the rest of the world than all of those problem nations combined. Add them up, Brazil, Mexico, everybody else. Our trade debt is greater than every other nation in the world----
