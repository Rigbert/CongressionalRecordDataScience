 President, on behalf of the leader, I have some information here. For the information of all Senators, this morning the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the Treasury-postal appropriations bill. There will be 15 minutes of debate time, followed by two consecutive rollcall votes starting at 9:45 a.m. The first vote will be on the Hatch amendment regarding the White House Travel Office, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in relation to the Reid amendment on the same subject.  Following these votes, the Senate will consider the remaining amendments in order to the Treasury-postal appropriations bill, according to a unanimous-consent agreement reached last evening. It is hoped that the Senate can complete action on that bill by early afternoon.  Following disposition of the Treasury-postal bill, the Senate is expected to turn to consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention under the parameters of a previous consent agreement. It is possible that the Senate could complete action on that matter today, if debate time is yielded back. If the Senate cannot complete action on the Chemical Weapons Convention today, then votes on that matter can be expected to take place on Friday, before noon.  There will be no votes after noon on Friday, in order that the religious holiday can be observed.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
