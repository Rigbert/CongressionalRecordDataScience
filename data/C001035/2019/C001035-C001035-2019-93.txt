President, before I deliver comments on a bill that I am introducing, let me express my disappointment that the Senate will not be voting today on the amendment that Senator Jones and I have filed to eliminate the military widow's tax. This is a tremendous inequity, as is recognized by the fact that 75 of our colleagues have cosponsored our freestanding bill.  Nevertheless, I am heartened by the commitment and the compassion of the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Senator Inhofe, who has indicated his receptivity to dealing with this issue but in a different way on a different bill. I hope that today is just a temporary setback and that we can see this bill taken up as a freestanding bill by the entire Senate.  Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and ask that it be appropriately referred.
