President, on May 30, H. Sawin Millett will step down as commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, one of many positions he has held during a remarkable career of more than 55 years of dedicated service at all levels of government. I rise today to join the people of Maine in thanking him for his many contributions as he retires to his family, his farm, and his beloved hometown of Waterford, ME.  Sawin has served five Maine Governors--Republican, Democratic, and Independent--and in the cabinets of four. His energy, expertise, and commitment to responsible and accountable government have been applied to such diverse areas as education, finance, and mental health services.  Sawin served six terms in the Maine legislature and was lead House Republican on the Appropriations Committee during the last three. His institutional knowledge and keen understanding of the State budget process and fiscal operations has been invaluable to our State. Building on his early career as a teacher, coach, and principal, he was the first executive director of the Maine School Management Association and an assistant professor at the University of Southern Maine.  It is fitting that Sawin's life in public service began at the local level, serving as selectmen in the towns of Dixmont and Waterford, and as a town meeting moderator.  The appreciation of Sawin's service crosses party lines. When the announcement of his retirement was made, both sides of the aisle were united in praise for this generous mentor and effective leader who has always been devoted to the people of Maine.  I have had the privilege of knowing Sawin for many years. We served together in the cabinet of Gov. John McKernan, and I was fortunate to have him on my State staff during my first term in the Senate. I also have had the pleasure of knowing his wonderful wife Barbara, who has been a strong and loving partner for more than 57 years. On behalf of the people of Maine, I wish them health and happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________
