Speaker, nobody likes these high prices, and I think most folks understand the law of supply and demand. Worldwide, this last year, we pumped 126,000 fewer barrels of oil and we used a million barrels more each day.  We have said no to ANWR, we have said no to tar sands, we've said no to oil shale, we've said no to nuclear. Sierra Club, I'm told, has opposed solar in California. This Congress has not extended R for renewables. Yet, 85 percent of our offshore sites are off-limits.                              {time}  1345  I would like to put a letter that I received a copy of from the American Association of Petroleum Geologists into the Record that was sent to the Speaker. They conclude that policies that increase exploration costs, decrease the available time to properly evaluate leases and restrict access to Federal lands in the OCS do not provide the American people with short-term relief from high prices and undermine the goal of increasing stable long-term surpluses.  We can't waive a magic wand and say here it is. If you say 5 years, but you still require some 27 different environmentally-mandated permits that are required, with no shortening of the time that it takes to get those permits approved, you are not succeeding. In effect, what you are doing is telling the companies to go look someplace else. They are not going to look in America. They are going to look someplace else, because they may not have to comply with these same 25 different regulations that you have to comply with in this country. You can't just say 5 years, without shortening that process.  Now, I am sorry that I didn't talk to Mr. DeFazio before I used that chart, but he cited I think a Shell development in Alaska that doesn't have access yet to the pipeline that takes that oil down through to the bottom of Alaska. Without the pipeline permits, they have to cap the wells.                                           American Association of                                         Petroleum Geologists,                                                    June 23, 2008.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Steny Hoyer,     Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. John Boehner,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, and Minority      Leader Boehner: Given the on-going debate about access and      leasing activity on federal onshore lands and the Outer      Continental Shelf, I would like to offer some perspective, on      behalf of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists      (AAPG), on the science and process of finding oil and natural      gas.       AAPG, an international geoscience organization, is the      world's largest professional geological society representing      over 33,000 members. The purpose of AAPG is to advance the      science of geology, foster scientific research, promote      technology and advance the well-being of its members. With      members in 116 countries, more than two-thirds of whom work      and reside in the United States, AAPG serves as a voice for      the shared interests of energy geologists and geophysicists      in our profession worldwide.       AAPG strives to increase public awareness of the crucial      role that the geosciences, and particularly petroleum and      energy-related geology, play in our society.       Finding and developing oil and natural gas blends science,      engineering, and economics. It has distinct phases:      exploration, development, and production. And it is risky,      because finding oil and natural gas traps, places where oil      and natural gas migrate and concentrate, buried under      thousands of feet of rock is like finding the proverbial      needle in a haystack. Talent and technology increase our      chances of a discovery, but there are no guarantees.       What is exploration? Well, the grid pattern on a block map      makes it tempting to think of exploration as a process of      simply drilling a well in each grid block to determine      whether it contains oil. But because of the natural variation      in regional geology, one cannot assume oil and natural gas      are evenly distributed across a given lease or region.      Rather, exploration is about unraveling the geologic history      of the rock underneath that grid block, trying to understand      where oil or natural gas may have formed and where it      migrated. If the geology isn't right, you won't find oil      or natural gas.       Legendary geologist Wallace Pratt once observed, ``Where      oil is first found is in the minds of men.'' When preparing a      lease bid, geologists use their knowledge to identify the      specific areas in a region that they believe have the highest      likelihood of containing oil and natural gas traps.      Successful exploration begins with an idea--a hypothesis of      where oil may be found.       Since exploration is about developing and testing ideas,      some acreage available for leasing is never leased. That is      because no one develops a compelling idea of why oil or      natural gas should be there. Similarly, some acreage is      leased and drilled repeatedly with no success. Then, one day,      a geologist develops an idea that works, resulting in new oil      or natural gas production from the same land that others      dismissed as barren.       Once a lease is awarded, geologists begin an intensive      assessment. They collect new geological, geophysical, and      geochemical data to better understand the geology in their      lease area. They use this data to construct a geological      model that best explains where they think oil and natural gas      were generated, where it may have been trapped, and whether      the trap is big enough to warrant drilling.       If there is no evidence of a suitable trap, the explorer      will relinquish the lease and walk away. If they see a trap      that looks interesting, they schedule a drill rig to find out      if they are right. Drilling is the true test of the      geologists' model, and it isn't a decision to be made      lightly. Drilling costs for a single well can range from $0.5      million for shallow onshore wells to over $25 million for      tests in deep water offshore.       As the well is drilling, geologists continually collect and      evaluate data to see whether it conforms to their      expectations based on the geological model. Eventually, they      reach the rock layer where they think the trap is located.       If there is no oil or natural gas when the drill reaches      the trap they were targeting, they've drilled a dry hole. At      this point the explorers will evaluate why the hole is dry:      was there never oil and gas here; how was the geological      model wrong; and can it be improved based on what they know      from the drilled well? Depending on the results of this      analysis, they may tweak the exploration idea and drill      another well or decide the idea failed and relinquish the      lease.       If there is oil and/or natural gas, they've drilled a      discovery. Typically, they will test the well to see what      volumes of oil and/or natural gas flow from it. Sometimes the      flow rates do not justify further expenditures and the well      is abandoned. If the results are promising, they will usually      drill several additional wells to better define the size and      shape of the trap. All of this data improves the geological      model.       Based on this revised geological model, engineers plan how      to develop the new field (e.g., number of production wells to      drill, construction of oil field facilities and pipelines).       Using complex economic tools, they must decide whether the      revenue from the oil and natural gas sales will exceed the      past and continuing expenses to decide whether it is a      commercial discovery.       The process of leasing, evaluating, drilling, and      developing an oil or natural gas field typically takes five      to ten years. Some fields come online sooner. Others are      delayed by permitting or regulatory delays or constraints in      the availability of data acquisition and drilling equipment      and crews. Large projects and those in deep water may require      a decade or more to ramp up to full production.       As you can see, oil and natural gas exploration is not      simple and it is not easy. It requires geological ingenuity,      advanced technologies, and the time to do the job right. It      also requires access to areas where exploration ideas can be      tested--the greater the number of areas available for      exploration, the higher the chance of finding oil and natural      gas traps.       U.S. consumers are burdened by high crude oil prices.      Conservation and efficiency improvements are necessary      responses, but equally important is increasing long-term      supply from stable parts of the world, such as our very own      federal lands and Outer Continental Shelf.       As Congress considers measures to deal with high crude oil      prices, I urge caution. Policies that increase exploration      costs, decrease the available time to properly evaluate      leases, and restrict access to federal lands and the Outer      Continental Shelf do not provide the American people with      short-term relief from high prices and undermine the goal of      increasing stable long-term supplies.       I am happy to further discuss these ideas. Please contact      me through our Geoscience & Energy Office in Washington, D.C.      at 202-684-8225 or 202-355-3415.           Sincerely,                                          Willard R. (Will) Green,                                                        President.
