President, today I salute 10 outstanding young women from Oklahoma who have been honored by Red Lands Council of Girl Scouts in Oklahoma City, OK. Each has received the prestigious Girl Scouts of the USA Gold Award.  They were honored April 25, 1996, for earning the highest achievement award in Girl Scouting. The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. The Girl Scout Award can be earned by girls aged 14-17 or in grades 9-12.  Girl Scouts of the USA, an organization serving more than 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 25,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must fulfill five requirements: Earn four interest project patches, earn the Career Exploration pin, earn the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, and design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling the requirements of the award is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation between the girl and adult Girl Scout volunteer.  As members of the Red Lands Council of Girl Scouts, these young women began working toward the Girl Scout Gold Award in 1995, and all completed their projects in the areas of leadership and community service.  The earning of the Girl Scout Gold Award is a major accomplishment deserving of special public recognition and commendation.  I salute the following girls for their accomplishments and for their service to their community and their country:  Melanie Brockman of Girl Scout Troop 55. She helped design, organize, and  carry out a Special Kids Day. This was a program for the special education students in the community. The children were divided by age and abilities to provide them an opportunity to participate in normal activities. This very successful program gave each special education student a chance to feel good about themselves.  Kansas Conrady of Girl Scout Troop 569. She designed an overnight lock-in for sixth grade Junior Girl Scouts and Cadette Girl Scouts to discuss the contemporary issues of substance abuse, facing a family crisis, youth suicide, and teen pregnancy. Professionals were brought in to speak and share their knowledge with the girls, and the girls then participated in activities from the Contemporary Issues Program for Girl Scouts in a round robin format.  Melanie Foglesong of Girl Scout Troop 17. She undertook the massive project of cleaning and painting the Wichita Lodge at Camp Red Rock. She organized a work crew, collected supplies, and directed the cleanup from washing walls and windows through the painting of all the interior of the lodge.  Leslie Hooks. She planned a program to help Junior Girls Scouts through Senior Girls Scouts know the joys of sailing by learning the fundamentals of sailing and culminating in a hands-on sailing event.
