President, I am going to withdraw the amendment. I received a telephone call from the White House today, and it is very clear that this college tuition assistance program is very important to the President, and I understand it. It is something that was part of his budget, something that he believes would be very good for the children of the District of Columbia.  I have asked and received the assurance of the administration that when the District of Columbia makes next year's budget request, we are going to hold them to a very sensible yardstick. We are going to ask them whether their experiment worked. We are going to ask them whether or not this idea of a $59 million tax cut did, in fact, not only improve the quality of life in the District, but address the most basic problems--whether or not the crimerate has come down, whether or not children are better off, and whether or not the schools are improved.  The District of Columbia will be held accountable. With that assurance, I can assure those who are listening that if I am still serving on the subcommittee, as I expect to be, I will apply the same standard. To the D.C. City Council, I say: I don't think you can have it both ways. I don't think you can give away the money in a tax cut and meet basic needs in the city. You have 12 months to prove me wrong. I will be watching.  I will be offering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in a few moments that addresses some of the yardsticks and criteria we hope to use in measuring the performance of the D.C. City Council.  At this point, I ask how much time I have remaining under the unanimous consent request.
