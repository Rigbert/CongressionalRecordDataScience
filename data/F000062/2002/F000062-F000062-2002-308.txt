 I do so as an issue of basic fairness to help and protect those who have been hurt by the economic downturn. Unemployed workers need assistance now.  There are people in my State of California, and indeed across the country, who need an extension not because they have not been looking for a job, but because the downturn in the economy has made jobs difficult to keep, and even more difficult to find.  As I stated earlier this week, there are over a million people unemployed in California, and since September 11, unemployment benefits have run out for 190,000 Californians.  Because an average of 40 percent of Californians who go on unemployment exhaust their regular unemployment benefits, over 360,000 people in California alone could be helped by receiving this 13-week extension.  These are the people who would be immediately helped by an extension of unemployment benefits.  Throughout the United States, workers are running out of unemployment benefits while competing for less and less open jobs. In New York, there are 515,000 people without jobs, and over 90,000 of them have exhausted their unemployment benefits since September 11. The same is true for 86,000 Texans, 47,000 Floridians, and 52,000 people from Illinois. In Pennsylvania, over 300,000 people are unemployed, and almost 47,000 of them have exhausted their unemployment benefits.  Extending unemployment coverage will benefit more than 600,000 people nationwide, and help revive an economy that needs a boost to get back on its feet.  Since the program's inception in 1934, Unemployment Insurance has served time and again to act as a stabilizing device--providing direct economic assistance to people who are likely to spend any additional money in providing basic needs for themselves and their families.  The need is no different now. As an issue of basic fairness, I strongly believe that the Senate should act to extend UI benefits by 13 weeks.
