 President, last year the Senate passed the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act. A law which provides for the education of the spouse and dependent children of Federal law enforcement officers who die or are totally disabled in the line of duty.  The purpose of the legislation was to remove a significant financial burden from the families of these deceased officers and to allow them to continue on the educational path they would have followed had their parent or spouse not been killed in the line of duty.  This fall, several young men and women were able to go to college under this program. Unfortunately, this program is only available to the children of Federal law enforcement officers.  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act of 1998. This legislation will extend these same educational benefits to the dependents of all public safety officers--Federal, State, county, and local law enforcement officers, correctional officers, and fire and rescue personnel--who have given their lives in the line of duty.  Under my bill, the Attorney General will administer a program which will provide up to $4,485 per child, per year to attend a 4-year college. This is the same amount of educational assistance the Federal Government provides to veterans.  It is critical that we remember the families of those officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our streets and homes safe. This bill is intended to allow the dependents of public safety officers to continue with their education as they would have been able to do had their parent not been killed or totally disabled in the line of duty.  I have long been concerned about the plight of families of public safety officers killed in the line of duty--this summer, I introduced an amendment to the Budget Reconciliation Act which provides for the favorable tax treatment of survivor death benefits paid to the families of fallen officers. In that vein, this legislation offers assurance to those in the public safety profession--and even to those considering service as public safety officers--that their loved ones will be able to attain their educational goals in their absence.                          ____________________
