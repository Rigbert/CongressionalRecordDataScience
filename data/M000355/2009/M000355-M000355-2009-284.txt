 1493. A bill to designate the current and future Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Louisville, Kentucky, as the ``Robley Rex Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center''; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to honor a Kentuckian who is a true American hero: Robley Henry Rex.  When Robley passed away in April of this year just a few days shy of his 108th birthday, he was recognized across my State as Kentucky's last World War I-era veteran and hailed as a champion of his fellow service members.  Ninety years ago, Robley bravely put on his country's uniform and left Christian County, KY, where he was born and raised, to patrol the hills of France in the immediate aftermath of what was then called The Great War. After leaving the Army in 1922, he returned to the Commonwealth.  In the years following his Army service, Robley began volunteering at the Louisville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VAMC. He would go on to devote over 14,000 hours of service, right up until the last years of his long and productive life.  My legislation would name the current VA hospital in Louisville after Robley Rex. It also ensures that when a new VAMC is built, that future facility will also bear his name.  The idea to name this facility after Kentucky's pre-eminent volunteer on behalf of veterans came from a constituent of mine, himself also a veteran. Moreover, the Kentucky Department of Veterans of Foreign Wars had the very same idea and endorsed the proposal during its recent state convention. I'm just pleased that as a Kentucky Senator, I am in a position to make it happen.  I can't think of a more appropriate person to name the facility after than Robley Rex. And I can't think of a more appropriate source for the idea than the Kentucky veterans community.  The new VAMC will be vital to Kentucky's veterans, as well as to Louisville's economy. Once complete, the VA hospital will ensure that the men and women who served our country will receive the quality health care they deserve.  That devotion to ensuring quality care to our veterans is exemplified in the life and service of Robley Rex. How fitting that his fellow veterans--so many of whom knew Robley personally from his countless hours of volunteer service--will see his name above the door.  Finally, I note that this is bipartisan legislation. It enjoys the support of Representatives John Yarmuth and Ben Chandler in the other chamber. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1493       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ROBLEY REX DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                    AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER.
