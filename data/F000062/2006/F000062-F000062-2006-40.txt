 President, today I honor Dr. David E. Janssen, who is retiring after an impressive career spanning 40 years as a public servant in the State of California.  Dr. Janssen is retiring as chief administrative officer of the county of Los Angeles where he has served with distinction since August 1996. I extend to him my sincere congratulations for the decades of dedicated service that he has given to his Nation, his State, and his county.  For the past decade, Dr. Janssen has played an invaluable role in helping the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors accomplish its Federal and State legislative priorities.  While his many accomplishments are too numerous to list here, his most recent efforts clearly demonstrate just how much he has meant to Los Angeles county and my State over his entire career.  Dr. Janssen has advocated closely on important Medicaid reform proposals and helped to improve the flexibility of Federal foster care funds.  He coordinated and developed advocacy strategies with local government and housing and community development groups in the Los Angeles region to protect vital community development block grant funds.  Working to improve the county's health system, Dr. Janssen helped assure critical Federal funding guarantees and assisted in creating an action plan in the event of an avian flu epidemic. He also collaborated with the State's congressional delegation, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the administration to secure funding for Martin Luther King/Charles R. Drew Medical Center--King/Drew--in south Los Angeles, preserving critical, life-saving services, and ensuring that the patients served by King/Drew continue to have access to care.  In an issue that is of utmost importance to my State, he worked closely with key administration officials and members of Congress to ensure that Los Angeles Air Force Base would not be closed or realigned.  In terms of homeland security, Dr. Janssen led the county in working to boost funding and increase the allocation of first responder grants to local governments. Likewise, he supported legislation to adopt a threat-based formula that directs homeland security funds where they are needed most.  These are just some of Dr. Janssen's significant accomplishments on behalf of Los Angeles county and the State of California. As he retires, I extend my gratitude to him for his many contributions throughout a distinguished career. With sincere best wishes, I congratulate him upon his retirement from public service. I am pleased to join his many coworkers, family, friends, and associates in wishing him health, happiness, and good fortune in all his future endeavors.                          ____________________[Pages S11053-S11054]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     HONORING DR.
