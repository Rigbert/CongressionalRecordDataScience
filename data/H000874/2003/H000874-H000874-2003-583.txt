Speaker I rise today to recognize Point Lookout State Park and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Point Lookout State Park received a 2003 Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Grant for a project designed to enhance key sites and resources at the park. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources will match the grant.  The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, which includes more than 120 museums, State parks, wildlife refuges and other sites in five States and the District of Columbia, was created to enhance the experience of visitors to the Chesapeake Bay and its many roads, rivers and trails. Authorized by the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998, the Gateways Network is coordinated by the National Park Service in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Program.  During the past four years, Gateways Network Grants have funded new maps, improved signs, and expanded trails that have made visits to parks, wildlife refuges and water trails even more exciting and enjoyable than they had previously been. These grants help enhance the public's ability to learn and enjoy the Chesapeake's stories and significance, explore its natural and cultural resources, and become involved in helping conserve and restore the Bay and its watershed. Through these projects and other Gateways Network efforts more and more people recognize the Chesapeake as a true national treasure.  In 2003, the National Park Service is awarding $1,387,309 in grant funding, matched by over $2 million in partner contributions. Thirty-two grants are being made to Gateways throughout the Bay watershed in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Point Lookout State Park is receiving a grant of $39,320 and $39,415 in partner contributions.  The project proposed by Point Lookout State Park and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources will develop a series of up to 14 outdoor interpretive exhibits, or waysides, highlighting key sites and resources at the park. A number of exhibits will focus on Civil War era stories showing how the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River played important roles in the war. Additional exhibits willhighlight the Point Lookout lighthouse and the lives of lighthouse keepers. With nearly a half million visitors annually, Point Lookout provides a real Bay experience for many people. The new exhibits will greatly expand interpretive information for visitors and share more of the Bay story.  Mr. Speaker, it is with the assistance and vision of organizations such as Point Lookout State Park and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources that the Chesapeake Bay and the entire region has become the treasure that we know it to be today. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Point Lookout State Park and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources on receiving this grant and wishing them the best of luck in completing their project.                          ____________________
