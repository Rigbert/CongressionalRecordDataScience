 President, I do not often recognize non-Vermonters on the floor of the Senate, but I rise today to applaud the numerous and significant achievements of Dr. Sheila Crowley. Dr. Crowley recently retired as president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, after decades of advocacy to make sure people with the lowest incomes in the United States have affordable and decent homes. It has truly been an honor to work closely with Sheila on issues related to affordable housing.  I am particularly proud of our efforts to create the national housing trust fund, the only Federal program designed to build new affordable rental housing specifically for extremely low-income individuals. In the early 2000s, Sheila provided invaluable assistance to my office as we drafted the first House version of the trust fund and shepherded the legislation through its first votes in the House Financial Services Committee.  For the next 15 years, Sheila built grassroots support across the country for the trust fund, to keep the pressure on Federal lawmakers. Despite numerous setbacks--and one serious housing market collapse--she tirelessly advocated for addressing the significant housing needs of people with limited economic resources. It is a fitting testament to her tenacity that just as she prepared to retire, the Federal Housing Finance Agency began capitalizing the trust fund for the first time. Later this year, States will receive the first new Federal affordable housing production funds in decades, and for that, Sheila Crowley deserves an enormous amount of credit.  Not surprisingly, Sheila received the 2009 John W. Macy award from the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the Housing Leadership Award from the National Low Income Housing Coalition for her work on the National Housing Trust Fund campaign. But I am guessing the award Sheila will cherish most will be when, in the not-too-distant future, tenants move into the first trust fund financed affordable housing.  I cannot overstate the importance of Sheila's work and her accomplishments. We are experiencing nothing less than an affordable housing crisis on the national level. In order to afford the fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment, a minimum wage earner must work 102 hours per week, 52 weeks per year.  Throughout her tenure at the National Low Income Housing Coalition, Sheila was not just a resolute advocate; she was also a vital resource on housing policy to many members of Congress. She also worked closely with organizations focused on homeless services, family housing, AIDS housing, housing for people with disabilities, senior housing, and services for battered women and victims of rape.  And while her focus was national, Sheila often travelled to States to support local housing efforts, including in my State of Vermont. She was a frequent keynote speaker at Vermont conferences and a valued partner in developing local responses to our housing challenges. I know a great many Vermonters who worked closely with Sheila and hold her in the highest esteem.  I wish Dr. Sheila Crowley all the best in her well-deserved retirement, and I am confident her affordable housing efforts will continue to bear fruit for decades to come.                          ____________________
