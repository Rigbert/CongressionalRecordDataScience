 President.  Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, and myself. It is identical to the Homeland Security FORWARD Funding Act of 2005. That is S. 1013.  I am very pleased to be joined not only by my colleague from Texas but, as well, by Senators Boxer, Hutchison, Kerry, Martinez, Schumer, Clinton, Corzine, Kennedy, Lautenberg, and Nelson of Florida. And, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Mikulski to the list of cosponsors.
