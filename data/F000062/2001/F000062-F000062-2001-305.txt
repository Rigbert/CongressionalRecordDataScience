 Craig, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Crapo) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.                            S. Con. Res. 11       Whereas the New England Journal of Medicine has reported      that modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking, sedentary      lifestyle, poor nutrition, unmanaged stress, and obesity      account for approximately 50 percent of the premature deaths      in the United States;       Whereas the New England Journal of Medicine has reported      that spending on chronic diseases related to lifestyle and      other preventable diseases accounts for an estimated 70      percent of total health care spending;       Whereas preventing disease and disability can extend life      and reduce the need for health care services;       Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services has      concluded that the health burden of these behaviors falls in      greatest proportion on older adults, young children, racial      and ethnic minority groups and citizens who have the least      resources;       Whereas business leaders of America have asserted that      spending for health care can divert private sector resources      from investments that could produce greater financial returns      and higher wages paid to employees;       Whereas the Office of Management and Budget reports that      the medicaid and medicare expenditures continue to grow;       Whereas the American Journal of Public Health reports that      expenditures for the medicare program will increase      substantially as the population ages and increasing numbers      of people are covered by medicare;       Whereas the American Journal of Health Promotion reports      that a growing research base demonstrates that lifestyle      factors can be modified to improve health, improve the      quality of life, reduce medical care costs, and enhance      workplace productivity through health promotion programs;       Whereas the Health Care Financing Administration has      determined that less than 5 percent of health care spending      is devoted to the whole area of public health, and a very      small portion of that 5 percent is devoted to health      promotion and disease prevention;       Whereas research in the basic and applied science of health      promotion can yield a better understanding of health and      disease prevention;       Whereas additional research can clarify the impact of      health promotion programs on long term health behaviors,      health conditions, morbidity and mortality, medical care      utilization and cost, as well as quality of life and      productivity;       Whereas the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy      of Science has concluded that additional research is required      to determine the most effective strategies to create lasting      health behavior changes, reduce health care utilization, and      enhanced productivity;       Whereas the private sector and academia cannot sponsor      broad public health promotion, disease prevention, and      research programs;       Whereas the full benefits of health promotion cannot be      realized--       (1) unless strategies are developed to reach all groups      including older adults, young children, and minority groups;       (2) until a more professional consensus on the management      of health and clinical protocols is developed;       (3) until protocols are more broadly disseminated to      scientists and practitioners in health care, workplace,      school, and other community settings; and       (4) until the merits of health promotion programs are      disseminated to policy makers;       Whereas investments in health promotion can contribute to      reducing health disparities; and       Whereas Research America reports that most American      citizens strongly support increased Federal investment in      health promotion and disease prevention: Now, therefore, be      it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring),     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This resolution may be cited as the ``Building Health      Promotion and Disease Prevention into the National Agenda      Resolution of 2001''.     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that the Federal Government      should--       (1) increase resources to enhance the science base required      to further develop the field of health promotion and disease      prevention; and       (2) explore strategies to integrate life-style improvement      programs into national policy, health care, schools,      workplaces, families, and communities in order to promote      health and prevent disease.
