 President, I rise today in support of the legislation of my colleague Senator John Ashcroft to repeal the Social Security earnings limit. Under current law, workers aged 65-69, can earn only up to $17,000 without losing out on their Social Security benefits. This ``earnings limit'' penalizes hard-working seniors by docking them $1 for every $3 of earnings over the limit. In fact, an older worker's entire Social Security benefit could be eliminated by the earnings limit if he or she earns more than $45,944. A few years ago, I worked successfully to increase the limit to $30,000 by 2002. But we can do better. Penalizing older workers sends the wrong message to those who choose to stay in the workforce beyond normal retirement age. And in today's tight labor market, we need to do a better job about recruiting and retaining good employees. In fact, in my state of Iowa, the jobless rate for December was 2.2 percent. That rate is even below the national jobless rate of 4.1 percent. We cannot afford to discourage older Americans who want to work from remaining in the labor market.  I am a strong supporter of efforts under way this year to repeal the earnings limit. Eliminating the penalty would help 800,000 older workers who now lose part or all of their benefits simply because they have the will and ability to stay on the job after 65. From my home State alone, many Iowans have contacted me in frustration over the earnings limit.  For the first time in years, I am confident we can get the job done once and for all.
