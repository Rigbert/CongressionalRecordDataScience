President, I believe that the Senator from Iowa has raised an important point. we need to clarify how the amendment applies to targeted tax benefits. We would like the language of the amendment to capture a wide variety of situations where a small number of taxpayers receive special treatment. I hope that we can work with Senator DeMint, the Senate Finance Committee, and any other interested Senators to make appropriate changes to this amendment during conference, if not sooner, so that the language is clear and the outcome increases transparency and accountability.
