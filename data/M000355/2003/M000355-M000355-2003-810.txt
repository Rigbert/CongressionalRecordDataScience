 President, we have been negotiating all day with Senator Baucus, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, in the hopes of getting the Burma bill cleared, but, regretfully, that has not occurred yet.  Time is passing. I was at a meeting with the President just an hour ago. He brought up the issue. Both the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate are in favor of this bill. Both the chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee are in favor of this bill. My good friend, the assistant Democratic leader, is in favor of this bill. It is time to pass it.  We have been protecting, under a rule XIV procedure, the possibility of going to this bill tomorrow. But I must say, I think it would be a lot better to go to it tonight. So I have notified the Senator from Nevada that I am going to make the following unanimous consent request, and I will do that at this point.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tomorrow, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1215, the Burma sanctions bill, under the following conditions: 1 hour of debate equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the measure, with no intervening action or debate.
