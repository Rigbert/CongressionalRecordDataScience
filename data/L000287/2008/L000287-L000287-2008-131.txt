Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5781, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation.  People should not be punished for taking the time to care for new additions to their families. You must take time to take care of your child, your family, and yourself. It makes you a better person, a better parent, and in the long-term--a better employee. Pressure to jump back into work does nothing to ease mind, body, spirit, or financial pressures.  Simply said, the current policy is detrimental to many, many American families. The Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act shows that the federal government actually cares about American families.  Women who require leave to care for a new child, new employees who have do not have saved days, and those who have used all their leave suffer under the existing policy. These hard-working Americans are forced to choose between spending more time with their children and maintaining an income to support their family. Providing four weeks for paid parental leave and allowing existing leave to be used to care for new babies eases the pressures on federal employees and their families.  H.R. 5781 is just good, common sense policy, and, Mr. Speaker, we must act now. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5781.                          ____________________
