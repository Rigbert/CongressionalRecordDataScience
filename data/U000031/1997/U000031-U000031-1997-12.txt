Speaker, when I returned home last night and told mywife the sad story about Walter Capps leaving this place, the first thing she asked was about Lois.  A lot of us, in the 10 months that we were here, did not know Walter Capps all that well. I got to know him a little bit at Hershey, he and his wife both. He was an honest, decent guy that worked so hard for his constituents back in California. He was well-respected on both sides of the aisle. We are going to miss him.  Like a lot of Members in this House, he was not flashy. His name was not a household name. But I think it was his courage and wisdom and thoughtfulness that, in fact, made a difference for not only his constituents, but for this House as well.  We are going to miss him. We wish Lois and his family the very best in our prayers.                              {time}  1130
