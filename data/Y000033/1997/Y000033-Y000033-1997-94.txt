Mr. Chairman, I would just remind my colleagues that this Nation of ours is based on the constitutional right of private land. We must keep that. We are not a one-world group. We are the sovereign Nation of the United States of America.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 4\1/4\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth], a great chairman.
