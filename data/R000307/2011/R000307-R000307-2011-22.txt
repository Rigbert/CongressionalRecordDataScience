President, since the founding of our Nation, people the world over have looked to us as a beacon of light because of our freedoms. Others have watched the great American experiment with a perverse hope that it falls. We can only fail if we fail ourselves, if we fail to balance the budget and bring down the debt.  America has always proven itself. We will meet any challenge and confront any enemy. The enemy before us is our own fiscal irresponsibility. It is time to stop talking. It is time to start doing. It is time for the President to come up with a specific plan, and in meeting with Republicans and Democrats in the House and the same in the Senate, let's do our duty.  In some of the toughest early debates in our country, Americans were fortunate to have steady leadership in keeping a hand on the wheel. I hope Members of this Chamber and the current President of the United States can look to character, to leadership, to love of our country to guide us through these very trying times.  Every generation confronts a unique set of challenges. The challenge we face today is the $14.3 trillion debt--and growing. I am so hopeful we can close ranks and confront this enemy. We owe the American people and our forebears no less than victory in this fight.  I yield the floor.
