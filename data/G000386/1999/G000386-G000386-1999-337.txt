 President, yesterday I spoke about the hope that we could get a bipartisan agreement. I spoke also about the fact that I consider ag programs and Social Security and Medicare as social contracts that we have with segments of our population and the Government, and the extent to which, for the most part, those social contracts have been bipartisan when there have been changes made.  I welcomed the opportunity yesterday to have Democratic leaders and people interested in agricultural issues wanting to meet with Republicans to reach that bipartisan accord. An accord such as this is one where each side gives some. I think Republicans have given, the extent to which this is more than some magic $7.5 billion, but, there again, as the Senator from North Dakota explained, it is about halfway between the extremes of what both parties were offering.  What I know is very strongly felt by a lot of people on the other side of the aisle is that there should be a division of the cash infusion into agriculture between AMTA payments and LDPs. We on this side of the aisle believe more strongly about that than almost any other issue--that that is the wrong way to go, for two reasons: One, LDP is a convoluted way to get money to farmers; and the second one is that when we have an emergency such as this, we ought to be able to get the money to the community as fast as we can. This can be done within 10 days after the President signs the bill.  On the other side of the aisle, at least I can say for the Senator from North Dakota, they have given a lot in order to reach this compromise. It is very deeply felt by Republicans that all of this money should go out through AMTA. This is give and take on both sides, and I hope that it does get a massive amount of support so we can say we did something with a social contract that is bipartisan, which is a tradition of this body.  I yield the floor.
