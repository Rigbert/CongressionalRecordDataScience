Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I will get back to the gentleman.  What I am suggesting here is I do not want to see this happen, this to go on and on and on, and never be settled. If we can get the money from 1985 and not preclude the money beyond that and the earlier years, then I think we have achieved a goal. But right now, we know who is making the money out of this, and that is the lawyers who are presenting the cases and it is the lawyers for the government who are defending against government inaction, a malfeasance. So I am just saying, let us try to bring a conclusion to this, and let us really work on making sure from now on that the system works.  Now, I will say when Ms. Norton became Secretary, the first thing I did was call her up and said get rid of the BIA and that accounting firm for the trust fund because it is not working. Mr. Babbitt was cited for contempt. But that is not the only person, the person before him, all the way to 1906, the government has not acted as I think they should, and I agree with the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall), that is absolutely wrong. But right now we have to try to get this thing started so from now on we do not have the misuse of these funds and, in fact, the loss of these funds.
