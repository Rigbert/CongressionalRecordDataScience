 President, I rise today to recognize the remarkable accomplishments of the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce. They were selected as the winner, out of eight National finalists, in the 2010 Chamber of the Year competition sponsored by the American Chamber of Commerce Executives, ACCE. This is quite a feat, as the ACCE's Chamber of the Year is the Nation's only award that recognizes local chambers for their dual role in creating and leading businesses and communities.  Chambers wanting to apply for this award could do so if they had an exceptional year or if they had a program or initiative that went above and beyond expectations. With this in mind, the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce highlighted their success in developing the Chamber Leadership Initiatives for Northwestern Kentucky, C-LINK, alliance and the Owensboro Buys It! program in the application process.  C-LINK includes 12 chambers in the region and has been a leading proponent of Interstate 69 in western Kentucky, one of the largest transportation projects in the region, which has seen significant progress in the past two years. Owensboro Buys It! was started in 2009 to create local commerce and to teach small business leaders how to initiate an ``elevator pitch'' and sharpen their ability to gain and retain customers. When the chamber board of directors mapped out a strategic plan in 2008, they made it their goal to earn this award by 2012. Because of their hard work, they managed to beat even that audacious goal.  Under the leadership of chamber president Jody Wassmer, the board of directors, staff, and members of the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce made their hometown, their Commonwealth, and this Senator very proud. I ask my colleagues to rise and join me in congratulating them on this honor.                          ____________________
