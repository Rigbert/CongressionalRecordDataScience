 President, I thank the Senator from Illinois.  This is a simple amendment. It is an amendment that everyone here, on both sides of the aisle, should be able to support.  When President Bush was campaigning during the Republican primaries, he announced a 10-year across-the-board income tax cut plan. He said that increasing the budget surplus meant the Government was taking much too much money.  Steve Forbes had his flat tax, and Mr. Bush had his tax cut plan. He offered that plan at a time--to repeat what has been said on the floor before--when our economy was booming, when the stock market was still climbing. In late 1999, when the campaign was beginning and this plan was offered, the economy was growing at 8.5 percent. That is a very different circumstance than we have today. We just found out that the economy was still growing in the first quarter of this year, but not at 8.5 percent, at 1 percent.
