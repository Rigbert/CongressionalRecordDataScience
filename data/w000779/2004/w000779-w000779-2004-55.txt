President, at a time when there are record gasoline prices for the American consumer and record oil company profits, the Bush administration is filling our Strategic Petroleum Reserve at 2\1/2\ times the average fill rate. Over the last 2 years, the average fill rate has been about 120,000 barrels a day. Recently, it has been hovering around 300,000 barrels a day. Using the figures provided by the administration's Energy Information Administration Office, these policies would raise the price of oil per barrel about $1.50.  I come to the Senate today to say I believe the Bush administration's policies with respect to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve are hitting the American people with a double whammy. For the American people, more of their tax dollars are now being spent for filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and more of their take-home dollars are being spent on gasoline at the pump.  I come today to say if the Bush administration is not willing to at least reduce the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, I ask the Bush administration to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with a firehose. It is that simple.  Over the course of the year, the administration may say, we reach an average fill rate of 120,000 barrels a day.
