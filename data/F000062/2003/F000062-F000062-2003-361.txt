 President, I rise today to offer legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana Arreola, and Cindy Jael Arreola, Mexican nationals who live in the Fresno area of California.  Mr. and Mrs. Arreola have lived in he United States for nearly 20 years. They are the parents of Nayely and Cindy, who also stand to benefit from this legislation. The Arreolas also have three United States citizens children: Roberto, who is 11 year old; Daniel, who is 8; and Saray, their youngest daughter, who is six-years old. Today, Mr. and Mrs. Arreola, and her children face deportation.  The story of the Arreola family is quite compelling and I believe they merit Congress' special consideration for humanitarian relief. The Arreolas are in uncertain situation in part because of grievous errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been disbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it compelled an immigration judge to write the Executive Office of Immigration Review seeking his disbarment for the legal detriment he caused his immigrant clients.  Mr. Arreola has lived in the United States since 1986. He was an agricultural migrant worker in the fields of California for several years, and as such would have been eligible for permanent residence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers, SAW, program had he known that he could apply for it. Mrs. Arreola was living in the United States at the time she became pregnant with her daughter Cindy, but returned to Mexico to give birth to Cindy to avoid any problems with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It is quite likely that the family would have qualified for cancellation of removal but for the conduct of their previous attorney.  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family to remain in the United States is the devastating impact their deportation would have on their children: three of whom are U.S. citizens; the other two have lived in the United States virtually all of their lives. This country is the only the country they really know.  Nayely, the oldest child, is a junior in high school. She is an outstanding student with a 3.91 Grade Point Average who ranks fourth in her class of approximately 300 students. At her relatively young age, Nayely has demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals of citizenship in her adopted country. She has worked hard to achieve her full potential both in her academic endeavors and through the service she provides her community.  Nayely is a member of Advancement Via Individual Determination, AVID, a college preparatory program in which students commit to determining their own futures through achieving a college degree. Nayely is also President of the key Club, a community service organization. She helps mentor freshmen and participates in several other student organizations in her school. Perhaps the greatest hardship to this family if she is forced to return to Mexico will be her lost opportunity to realize here dreams and further contribute to her community and to this country.  As the principal of her high school wrote, ``[s]he epitomizes what we seek to instill in all of our students. She has accepted the challenges and has made a commitment to better her future, to better her life, and to better herself through education.''  It is clear to me that Nayely feels a strong sense of responsibility for her community and country. By all indication, this is the case as well for all of the members of her fine family.  I understand that the Arreolas also have other family who are lawful permanent residents here in the United States. Mrs. Arreola also has three brothers who are U.S. citizens and Mr. Arreola has a sister who is a U.S. citizen. It is my understanding that they do not have any family to whom they might return in Mexico.  According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any problems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their taxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked hard to support themselves. As I previously mentioned, Mr. Arreola was previously employed as a farmworker, but now has his own business repairing electronics. His business has been successful enough to enable him to purchase a home for his family.  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to enhance the values we hold dear. Enactment of the legislation I have introduced today will enable the Arreolas to continue to make significant contributions to their community and to the United States as well.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of Xavier De La Torre, Principal of Granite Hills High School, as well as the numerous letters of support our office has received from members of the Porterville community be entered into the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that Nayely's essay entitled ``If I Could Change the World,'' which she wrote at age 15, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Granite Hills High School,                                     Porterville, CA, May 7, 2003.       Dear Senator Feinstein: It is with a sense of urgency that      I write this letter in support of Nayely Arreola, a student      at Granite Hills High School. I have known Nayely for the      past three years and have found her to be an outstanding      student and a fine young lady with many of the personal      attributes I would want for my own daughters.       Nayely is a leader and a pioneer. She is among a very small      cadre of second language learners that have overcome      seemingly insurmountable conditions and adversities many of      us will never know and emerged as a respected scholar. She is      a classic success story. Nayely, with her spirit and drive,      has helped open and establish Granite Hills High School, the      newest high school in our community. She epitomizes what we      seek to instill in all of our students. She has accepted the      challenges and has made a commitment to better her future, to      better her life, and to better herself, through education.      Her leadership qualities were evident immediately, as she      became very involved in the Link Crew program, the American      Cancer Society's Relay for Life, the Porterville Celebrates      Reading program, and the Key Club.       As a first time principal of a new high school, I rely on      students like Nayely to establish a strong foundation for our      school. She and others like her have been instrumental in all      the success that we have had as a school in a relatively      short period of time. Much of this success has come on the      heels of adverse conditions. She is resilient and sees life      from an optimistic lens, something very difficult to teach.       As a student, Nayely is well liked by her peers, teachers,      and our learning community in general. A top student in her      class, Nayely is studious, polite, possesses a staunch work      ethic, and is determined to succeed in any endeavor she      pursues. I attribute this attitude to her parental      upbringing, her sense of moral obligation and a strong value      system. I have all the confidence in the world that Nayely      will be successful in life.       If there are any further questions, or if elaboration is      required, please contact me at your convenience.           Sincerely,                                               Xavier De La Torre,     Principal, Granite Hills High School.                                  ____                                    Granite Hills High School,                                     Porterville, CA, May 7, 2003.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Nayely Arreola is one of the most      conscientious students I have even had in school. When I      first met her last year, she introduced herself and said she      would be the top student in my advanced Placement U.S.      History class. As it turned out, schedule conflicts forced      her into a college prep class, but her intentions and      performance remained the same. She has been one of the very      top academic students. She also has demonstrated a deep sense      of patriotism and commitment to our country. Often times in      discussion, she has been the first to voice her support of      government policies and has an understanding of the complex      reasoning behind difficult decisions legislators and other      elected government people must make. In all the process of      having to return to Mexico, she has never once been negative      or derogatory towards the laws and procedures. Of all the      people who should be given residency, Nayely and her family      should be at the top of the list. They have demonstrated      their dependability, loyalty, hard work and individual      responsibility in their lives in this country. There is the      ``letter of the law'' and there is then the ``spirit of the      law.'' The Arreolas are a family that truly deserve the      ``spirit of the law'' in allowing them to stay and become      officially     citizens. They have consistently demonstrated their      intentions to be such for the last decade or more.                                                  Sally Howen,                                                    Social Science     Chair, Granite Hills High School.                                  ____                                    Granite Hills High School,                                     Porterville, CA, May 7, 2003.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Nayely Arreola is an outstanding      person. Having taught 30 years, I've met few students who are      as dedicated to working to improve themselves as Nayely. Not      only is she hard working, she is very intelligent. Nayely was      in my Geometry class two years ago and she not only worked      hard but she also has a wonderful understanding of the      connectedness of mathematics. She was always ready and      willing to help others who might not understand.       Nayely is more than just a shining example of a student,      she is also one of the nicest students I've ever had. She is      always courteous and respectful to everyone. I have never      seen her act unkindly to anyone around campus. She is the      type of person of intelligence, character and integrity that      this country desperately needs.       Nayely has the qualities that will make her a leader and a      peacekeeper in whatever situation she finds herself. If she      is deported to Mexico, she will do well there and enrich that      country. My hope and prayer is that she can stay and enrich      this country.       If there is anything I can do to help in her family's need,      please contact me.           Sincerely,                                                      Carol Bentz,     Teacher, Granite Hills High School.                                  ____                                    Granite Hills High School,                                                  Porterville, CA.       Senator Diane Feinstein: My name is Filomena Lewis and I      serve as the chairperson for the World Language Department      here at Granite Hills High School. I am pleased to be writing      this letter on behalf of Nayely Arreola.       It has been a pleasure having Nayely as my student. She is      among the top students in my Advance Placement Spanish      Language class. Nayely functions effectively in both      leadership and group roles. Her properly developed social      skills are well received by her peers.       Nayely is a terrific young lady. I have no doubt in my mind      that she will be a contributing asset to our society. I      highly recommend, with utmost regard, that Nayely be extended      every possible consideration to allow her to complete this      portion of her education at Granite Hills High School.           Respectfully,     Filomena Rocha Lewis.                                  ____                                    Granite Hills High School,                                    Porterville, CA, May 13, 2003.       To Whom It May Concern: It is a great pleasure to write      this letter for Nayely Arreola. One of Granite Hills High      School's most distinguished high academic students, Nayely is      a junior, the daughter of Esidronio and Maria Elena Arreola,      1384 E. Success Dr., Porterville, CA (559) 782-3278.       Nayely is currently earning a total grade point average of      3.9. She is enrolled in a college preparatory program called      AVID and is taking Advanced Placement Spanish Literature 3      and Advanced Placement English 3P. She also has nearly      perfect attendance.       Not only is Nayely excelling in academics, she also excels      and participates in various curricular and extracurricular      activities on and off campus. Including Grizzly basketball      and clubs. She also participates in her church youth group      activities at her church.       Nayely hopes to attend University of California upon      graduating from Granite Hills High School, where she will      major in medicine. Nayely also hopes to see how far she can      go with an honors program.       When asked what she liked about school, especially Granite      Hills, she said the instructors, classes and the academic      programs, especially AVID. She is our top AVID student in the      program.       Nayely across the years has also received many honors and      awards. Some of those being for leadership and the      Renaissance Academic Program here at Granite Hills. She has      also been on the Honor Roll for three years.       I know this student has all the tools to be successful in      life. She will definitely be a very successful individual.       I know Nayely on a personal basis. She has done so much to      be where she's at. She has achieved so many things because of      her efforts and motivation. She deserves so much in life. I      feel very proud of her.                                                 Raul B. Bermudez,     Guidance Tech., Granite Hills High School.                                  ____                                    Granite Hills High School,                                                  Porterville, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: It is with a grateful heart I write      to thank you for your recent support of Nayely Arreola and      her family. It has been my extreme pleasure to work with      Nayely at Granite Hills High for the past three years. Nayely      is by far one of the hardest working students I have met in      my twenty years of teaching. She is currently ranked fourth      in a class of three hundred students and has received honors      here at Granite Hills High. Recently she was selected as the      runner-up to Girls State. She is the President of the Key      Club where she has assisted in food, coat and toy drives for      the needy of our community. She is a LINK leader, which works      with freshmen, and I have known her as one of my prized      speech students. Last year she won the Club and Zone levels      of the Optimist Speech Contest and this year she was a Club      winner in the Lions Club Speech Contest.       It has surprised many that I, a conservative Republican,      would try to assist Nayely and her family with their problem      of gaining residency her in the United States. I believe our      country was founded with people just like the Arreola family      who came here with a dream to improve their lives and the      lives of their family. The Arreola family has proved that      they are honest, hard working, tax paying people. It is      unfortunate that they received poor advice from their first      attorney that caused them to have their case sent to the      deportation court. I truly believe if they had received      proper representation they would have received residency long      ago.       Nayely Arreola is more than a remarkable student, she is a      remarkable person. Everything she has done has been to      prepare here to go to a University here in the United States.      I spent almost a year teaching in Mexico and I beg our      Congress not to send her there. She is America's dream--her      contribution to our country will be great. I have watched      with great pride as she has grown into a wonderful young      lady, ready to take on the world.       Once again, I thank you for all your help.                                               Christine L. Amann,     Reading Specialist/Speech Coordinator.                                  ____                                    Granite Hills High School,                                    Porterville, CA, May 14, 2003.       To Whom It May Concern: It is with great pleasure that I      write this letter on behalf of Nayely Arreola, a student of      mine at Granite Hills High School.       Nayely is currently enrolled in my Chemistry class. She has      proven herself to be a conscientious, intelligent, hard-     working young lady. She consistently has the highest grade in      her class and often goes ``above and beyond'' on her      assignments.       I strongly support Nayely and her family in their quest for      legal residence in this country. I have no doubt Nayely will      one day be a successful, contributing member of our society.      She has the drive and determination to achieve any goal she      desires.           Sincerely,                                                Sara E. Silva,                                                Chemistry Teacher,     Granite Hills High School.                                  ____                                    Granite Hills High School,                                                  Porterville, CA.       Nayely Arreola is one of my top 5 Pre-calculus/Trig      students. This student is basically a model student. She is      the kind of student that teachers dream about. She is self-     motivated, intelligent, has a good heart, sincere, involved,      etc. etc. etc. Every teacher should get an opportunity to      have such a student.       It is truly sad that our government doesn't allow such      students to remain in the U.S. These kinds of students are      the ones that will help our country grow stronger. Students      like Nayely are the kind of resources this country needs. I      am in disbelief that other students that have no respect for      authority, do not care for education, and eventually, we will      have to pay for their existence in one way or another, are      allowed to stay. Yet great hard working people like the      Arreola family are obligated to leave this country.       The qualities that Nayely possesses are indeed rare. If our      students possessed half of her qualities we would be second      to no nation in terms of education. We can not afford to lose      these precious resources. If our country is to grow stronger      we must change our way of thinking. We must change our laws.      We must attract people like Nayely and abolish those that      harm our country. We are hurting ourselves by forcing Nayely      Arreola to leave this country. Howe can politics be so blind?           Truly,                                               Jose Velazquez,                                         Granite Hills High School     Trigonometry teacher.                                  ____                   If I Could Change the World . . .                         (By Nayely B. Arreola)       The world has changed dramatically throughout the years.      Disrespect, abuse, and quick judgment are major factors that      have caused human suffering. They are my main concern because      we need to value individuality. In my speech today I am going      to talk about three ways I feel we could change the world.       If I could change our interactions with elderly people, the      world would be a better place. I disagree with the      pessimistic attitude that some young Americans take towards      the elderly. Our country should honor and respect our senior      citizens. For example, in other countries convalescent homes      do not exist, because family members take care of their older      family members. They demonstrate an appreciation, and respect      by giving their elderly person a special significance in      their own life. The children take care of the parents when      they grow older and cannot do it themselves. The sons or      daughters give their loved ones a special value and view age      as a wonderful experience because they can learn from the      elderly family members. If this were not possible, then I      would change the convalescent homes from a hospital      environment to more of a home environment. In order to ensure      better treatment of the elderly the main focus should be on      their dignity, comfort, and well-being.       By keeping the elderly at home, the children can receive      love and attention from     someone other than their parents. Some kids come home to      empty houses when their parents are working hard to maintain      their career. Instead of watching TV, they can actually learn      something about themselves and the origin of their family      history. In order to change the world, we should appreciate      our elderly people because they have a lot to offer us.       Elderly people have a lot to teach us about the world,      society, and culture because they have grown wise throughout      the years. They can help us learn from their mistakes so that      we won't have to go through it again and learn the hard way.      It is an honor to sit by them and hear so many things that      they have encountered during their lifetime. We have      degraded the value of age in America drastically by      placing so much emphasis on youth and looking youthful.       Second, we have degraded the beauty of other races. I would      make people colorblind, so that they would not care about a      person's color or race. Prejudice ignores a person's      character, causing one person to feel superior over another      person. Racism has caused conflicts and problems throughout      history. A person who is racist does not know the big mistake      that he or she is making. They fail to truly meet the      wonderful people who they neglect.       Furthermore, another thing that I would change in the world      is the suffering and abuse of an innocent child. Children are      gifts from heaven, but when they go through a life of torment      or anguish, they reflect that later in their lives. These      children have low self-esteem.       Most of them repeat the same type of abuse toward their      children, causing the chain to repeat itself, again and again      throughout generations. The life of an abused child is a sad      life. If child suffering were eliminated, we would have      happier children, thus healthier adults. They would be      prepared to succeed in the light of success and would not be      left in the darkness of despair. It would make them view the      world as a wonderful place.       In conclusion, I cannot change the world into a wonderful      place or impact it without changing myself. If I were able to      change the world, I would begin with myself and erase all      evil within my heart, in hopes of setting an example for      others to follow. I can only change one life at a time in      order to change the world into honoring the life of an      individual. We cannot disrespect the elderly, judge a person      by their color or abuse a child who in its innocence didn't      ask to be born. We should show respect and dignity without      caring the size, age or color. We should get past the      fashion, clothes, and looking good in order for us to truly      be compassionate to see what lies in the depths of a person's      heart. In order to change our world the answer is definitely      in changing the hearts of our people. We must all do our      part. Today I have accepted this challenge--I ask you can      you?                                 ______                                       By
