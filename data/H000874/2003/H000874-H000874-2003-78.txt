Leader, reclaiming my time, the energy conference report. How likely is it that we will have that on the floor next week? Is the gentleman pretty confident that that will be here? I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, from all of the numerous meetings that have been held, it is my indication that progress on that bill has been very encouraging. A lot of hard work has been done on the Energy Policy Act, and we have every expectation that we could consider that bill next week.  If the gentleman will further yield, I would just point out to the gentleman, as the gentleman knows and the other Members, but especially to the new Members to this body, when we get into an end-of-the-session like this, these things are very hard to predict. Once a decision is made on a bill, it could usually come straight to the body for a vote, but sometimes these bills take quite a bit of time to work out the differences between the two Houses.
