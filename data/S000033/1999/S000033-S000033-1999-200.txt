 Speaker, I submit for the Record statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                          Drinking and Driving          (On Behalf of Chelsea Downing and Rebekah Blaisdell)       Chelsea Downing: Drunk driving has become a major problem      in the small towns of northern Vermont. Just a year ago, four      teens were killed in a car accident on their way back from      Canada. Alcohol was proved to be a factor in this crash.      Since the drinking age above the border is 18, teenagers      drive to Montreal to enjoy bar-hopping with their friends.      The driving coming home from the bars can be hazardous.       How can these problems be prevented? The question has      lingered in the minds of many, since the number of Vermont      traffic deaths involving drunk drivers under 21 have      increased. Stopping underaged drinking altogether is an      extremely difficult task. If we can reduce the driving while      young people are under the influence, serious deaths and      injuries can be prevented. We need to focus on the driving      aspect, because it yields much more serious consequences than      just drinking alone.       The teen curfew is one action the state legislature has      discussed. The curfew will prevent drivers under 18 from      being on the roads after 11 p.m. This would restrict      inexperienced drivers from being on the road when the risk      period is high. But it also restricts young people from doing      normal things, such as going to movies or the drive-in, or      simply getting together with their friends. People above 18      can still drive. These are the people who can drink legally      in Montreal. This curfew will not affect these teens, who      face a long drive home from the bars in Canada. We have proof      that this trip can be fatal.       The state of Vermont has recognized that we have a problem.      Increased numbers of police officers, strict DWI laws, and      teen curfews are a few of the things they are in charge of.      These measures can help solve the problem, but what really      will make the difference is what these teenagers are exposed      to in their everyday lives. Their school, friends, and      especially their parents are all responsible for the      decisions they will have to make.       Teens need to recognize the consequences of drunk driving--     that death can result. Real stories of the families who have      lost children to accidents best express these outcomes.      Schools should be obligated to hold assemblies for students,      telling them real stories about what could happen. These      presentations are necessary, especially for events such as      homecoming and the prom, where underage drinking and driving      is apt to occur.       Parents need to be involved in their children's lives,      especially during the high-risk years. Increasing awareness      is the best way to teach teenagers to consider the risks      before involving themselves in dangerous situations.       Rebekah Blaisdell: As everyone knows, life and death goes      hand and hand, but nobody ever tells us how to deal with it.      Family members die, our leaders die; but our classmates      aren't supposed to. Lately my life that had more death than      anyone would like to deal with. In the past month, two of my      classmates have died unexpectedly. Scott was a very good      friend of mine, and I have known Gary since first grade. I      will remember them forever, and they have a special place in      my heart.       In each of these cases, we will never know why they died,      if it was an accident or if it was of their own choice. This      decision is left up to those of us who are still here. We      will never know for sure, but every day I wonder     if there was something I could have done. I don't understand      why Scott and Gary had to die at such a young age, but my      life will go on. I have to come to terms with this senseless      loss. But lately, it seems the school has forgotten what      happened just a month ago. three days of extra counselors      because of Scott's death. Is that what his life was worth?      Three days?       I will never forget what happened during my senior year,      but soon this school will. In four years, nobody will know      Scott or Gary's name, and if they do, they won't understand      what happened to them or those around then. It bothers me,      because people should remember. Events like this should never      be forgotten, because if they are history will repeat itself      and more people will die.       Even if Scott and Gary's deaths were accidents, schools      should teach about depression, and provide a way for students      to get help for themselves. I know each school has guidance      counselors. But who wants to talk to somebody who might not      even know your name?       All my life, I've had to deal with depression. And most      people don't truly understand. I'm only 17. But already I      have had at least seven of my best friends attempt suicide,      and a couple have succeeded. People need to know where and      how to find help, and if they're finding help for a friend,      they need to know that their friend is not going to hate      them, and if they do, they're still alive, and that's the      point.       If people don't know or don't want to admit that they may      be depressed, there is a bigger chance that they will take      matters into their own hands. Depression is not a dirty or a      bad word, and people who are depressed aren't any different      from anyone else, they just need a little more support.       When it comes down to life and death, I've always opted for      life. Life may be tough, but death is so final. Once the      trigger is pulled or the plunge is taken, there is no turning      back. No matter how hard life is, it will always get better.                             Drug Treatment            (On behalf of Lucas Gockley and Aaron Gerhardt)       Lucas Gockley: We are here today to talk to you about the      methadone maintenance treatment for heroin addicts. Heroin a      highly addictive drug derived from morphine. Some of the      long-term diseases stemming from heroin use are weight loss,      heart disease, AIDS, and death, eventually.       In Vermont, heroin use is increasing dramatically. In 1994,      118 people in a state-run treatment center said they used      heroin. In 1996, 154 people said they were addicts. There has      been a 50-percent increase in heroin use in the Rutland area      alone. In 1997 in the Rutland area, there have been two drug      store robberies and one bank robbery by heroin addicts      looking for money to fund their habit. There have also been      eight deaths due to heroin overdose in just Rutland County in      1996 and 1997.       State police figures show that crime due to heroin      addiction has almost tripled in this state in a period      between 1996 and 1997. Here at the university, there is a      federally-funded detox center run by UVM's Dr. Warren Diggle,      and the figures show that 60 percent of the heroin addicts he      sees are repeat visitors.       Heroin use is on the rise in Vermont, and help for addicts      is virtually nonexistent. The only effective treatment is the      methadone maintenance treatment.       Aaron Gerhardt: Vermont has no real treatment facilities      which addicts who have a desire to get off of heroin can use.       One question to ask about methadone maintenance treatment      is, Does it work? In the European Archives of Psychiatry and      Clinical Neurosciences, researchers found that ``MMT''--or      methadone maintenance treatment--``centers have a real      efficiency, not only to reduce illicit opiate abuse between      50 and 80 percent, but also to reduce criminality, HIV risk,      and mortality, and also to improve social rehabilitation      without introducing other alternative substance abuse.''      Another study published in the American Journal of Drug and      Alcohol Abuse found that heroin addicts who go through      methadone treatment are less likely to use cocaine,      amphetamines, tranquilizers and marijuana. It is clear that      MMT does work.       The reason that MMI facilities need to be government-funded      is because, currently, Medicare and Medicaid do not cover      methadone maintenance treatments, and, frankly, the treatment      is too expensive for the average addict to pay for. So it is      much easier for them to stay home, using the welfare, and      continue using heroin, which just contributes to the cultural      stereotype of the freeloading drug addict. Government funding      can help ease the burden for the addict, and it shows a      concern on the part of the government to help the individual.      Instead of condemning them as criminals, it just makes them      seem more that they have a problem, instead of being bad      people.       Also, within these facilities, the need for confidentiality      is imperative. Addicts have to have a place where they can go      to and not feel threatened by the threat of prosecution,      persecution, and shame. The MMT centers need to have flexible      hours so that addicts who are trying to stay productive      members of society can go to them. A nine-to-five day for a      center being open is not that feasible for an addict who is      trying to hold a day job. Simply put, the best time for the      clinical centers to be open would be 24 hours a day, which,      granted, would be a little bit inconvenient for people, but      for the addict, it helps.       It is also very important that these centers have      counseling facilities available, and counselors available.      The chances of success in methadone maintenance treatment      greatly increases with psychotherapy. According to a 1995      study published in The Journal of Psychiatry, addicts who      underwent psychotherapy were much more likely to complete the      treatment and become well-rounded, productive members of      society once more, and stay off the heroin.       So, over all, the benefits to Vermont are clear: MMT helps      to lower crime, HIV risk, and death. Also, through MMI,      addicts are more likely to stay off drugs for the rest of      their lives and become productive members of society.       Congressman Sanders: Thanks. It sounds like you did some      good research.                               ____________________
