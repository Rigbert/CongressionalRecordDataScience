President, I am very pleased today to join my colleague, Senator Jack Reed, in submitting a resolution designating October 24th-30th as National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. This designation will help increase awareness of the significant dangers and prevalence of child lead poisoning across our nation.  Recently, Senator Reed and I held a hearing in Rhode Island to address the impact exposure to lead paint can have on children's health and development, and to explore ways to improve our efforts to prevent and eventually eliminate lead poisoning in children.  Great strides have been made in the last 20 years to reduce the threat lead poses to human health. Most notably, lead has been banned from many products including residential paint, food cans and gasoline. These commendable steps have significantly reduced the incidence of lead poisoning. But the threat remains, and continues to imperil, the health and welfare of our nation's children.  In fact, lead poisoning is the most significant and prevalent environmental health threat to children in the U.S. today. Even low levels of lead exposure can have serious developmental consequences including reductions in IQ and attention span, reading and learning disabilities, hyperactivity and behavioral problems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently estimates that 890,000 children aged 1-5 have blood levels of lead that are high enough to affect their ability to learn.  Today, the major lead poisoning threat to children in found in interior paint that has deteriorated. Unfortunately, it is all too common for older homes to contain lead-based paint. In fact, more than half the entire housing stock--and three quarters of the stock built prior to 1978--contain some lead-based paint. Paint manufactured prior to the residential lead paint ban often remains safely contained and unexposed for decades, but over time, often through the remodeling process or through normal wear and tear, the paint can become exposed, contaminating the home with dangerous lead dust.  Because of the prevalence of older homes in the Northeast, lead poisoning exposure is a significant problem in our region. In Maine, 42 percent of our homes were built prior to 1950. Although screening rates nationally and in my state are considered to be too low, the sampling that has been done in my state shows that in some areas of the state 7-15 percent of children tested have high blood lead levels. In some areas of our country, the percentage is even higher.  Next month, I will hold a hearing in Maine to address the lead-based paint threat in our homes, and what parents can do to protect their children from the risks associated with lead exposure.  Once childhood development is impaired by exposure to lead, the effect is largely irreversible. However, if the presence of lead is detected prior to exposure, then remedial steps can be taken, such as lead containment or abatement, to prevent children from ever being harmed by lead's presence in the home.  We are not helpless to stop this insidious threat. By raising awareness of the prevalence of lead paint in homes, and the steps that can be taken to prevent poisoning, we can stop the life-impairing effects of childhood lead poisoning. I urge my colleagues to support me in raising awareness about childhood lead poisoning by co-sponsoring Childhood Lead Paint Poisoning Prevention Week.                          ____________________
