 She is telling our colleagues--and I join with her--that we have accepted and are working through a lot of amendments on both sides of the aisle. There are a number of amendments that have been filed. We, as she pointed out, need to know if people are going to insist on amendments or if there is some way we can accommodate Senators, if they would come to the floor and meet with us, because in a few minutes we are going to vote. The leaders will be on the floor and they are going to want a report from us as to what is pending, because tomorrow we want to move this bill. This is a very important bill, as the Presiding Officer knows. We need to move on with it and not delay it more. We are back now in a new week and I think we can make some progress. If my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will meet with us and tell us if they want a vote, we will debate it and vote. If they want to see if we can work out something with them, we will do that. But it is our intention again to move this bill tomorrow.  Thank you, Madam President.
