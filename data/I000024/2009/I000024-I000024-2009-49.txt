 First of all, when the Senator from South Dakota talks about health care reform, there are some things we can do for health care reform that we have promoted for quite some time. Certainly, medical malpractice is very significant. It is a huge cost. Defensive costs are a very large part of our health care costs. HSAs came into being a few years ago, and we have pilot programs where they--let's keep in mind, health care is the only product or service in America that I know of where there is no encouragement to shop around. Well, if you have HSAs, this is encouragement because if you spend less, you can enjoy the benefits of that; that is, put that into other programs. So I think there are some things we can do.  The second thing I would say about the subject that was covered very well by the Senator from South Dakota is that we don't know for sure what is going to be in the bill that comes out, but we do know this: Speaker Pelosi, over on the House side, has said that any bill that comes out of conference is going to have a government option. So they can masquerade it, they can talk about co-ops, they can talk about all of these things; we are going to eventually get something that comes out of conference and it is going to have a government option. That is, some people would say, socialized medicine. You can't compete with the government and have a system that has delivered the benefits our system has.                             Cap and Trade  Secondly, the Senator from South Dakota could just as well be talking about another piece of legislation that is up right now; that is, the cap-and-trade bill. It is another one that has the same thing where you do not know the blanks.  Last Wednesday, there was a news conference by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and they gave this program--they talked about this new kind of cap and trade, but they did not give any specifics. Nothing that was in there was specific in terms of where is the cap, how does the trading take place, how does the rationing take place.  The bottom line is this, though: Anything that has to do with any kind of cap and trade is going to be at least--at least--a $300 billion annual tax increase. That was true back as long ago as the late 1990s when the Kyoto bill was up. We had the Kyoto bill; they did a study on this thing; it was done by the Wharton School of Economics. They said that the cost of this, if we were to comply with the restrictions of that treaty, would be somewhere between $300 and $330 billion a year. To put that into perspective, because sometimes it is confusing when you are talking about billion dollars and trillions of dollars, I remember the largest tax increase that was a general tax increase was back in 1993 in the Clinton-Gore White House, and it was $32 billion. So this would be 10 times that amount.  So we have had several bills in the Senate since that time, and I would only say this: This is a different debate. It is going to come up and we are going to have a chance to talk about it. But the bottom line is that the Administrator of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, a very fine person, a person who was appointed by President Obama, made the statement that if we were to pass the Waxman-Markey bill, something like that, sign it into law, it wouldn't have the effect of reducing CO2 at all. The reason is very obvious: We would only be doing that here in the United States.                    Amendment No. 2566 to H.R. 3326  Lastly, I did want to make one comment about a couple of votes that are going to come up, or at least one vote that is coming up at 3:45 today. My junior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, has an amendment. It is an excellent amendment. It is one I will support, although I have to say that I was tempted not to because I would only like to start the ball rolling, that if this body is willing to redefine what an earmark is, we could be unanimous on this side. An earmark should be an appropriation without authorization. This has been a 200-year fight between authorizers and appropriators, and if we will get to the point where we will accept the fact that if something has gone through the scrutiny of an authorization--the highway bill is a good example of this. We have 30 criteria in that authorization bill. We come up with criteria to determine how much should be spent in different categories. And on the floor, there are always things coming up that did not go through the authorization process, and therefore I would call those earmarks.  So I would only say this: In the amendment Senator Coburn has, it is going to address some 55 that are called earmarks, of which 6 were authorized. I would like to be able to take those six out. I don't know whether we can do that. It would be very difficult to do prior to the vote.  But nonetheless, for future reference, if we are going to talk about earmarks, I think we need to define what an earmark is. It is an appropriation that has not been authorized. That is the thing we need to get after, and that will be one of my new wars I am starting.  I yield the floor.
