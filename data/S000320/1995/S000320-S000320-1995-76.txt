 2241) for himself and Mr. Kerrey:  (Purpose: To establish the National Commission on Restructuring the                        Internal Revenue Service)       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:     SEC.  . NATIONAL COMMISSION ON RESTRUCTURING THE INTERNAL                    REVENUE SERVICE.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:       (1) While the budget for the Internal Revenue Service      (hereafter referred to as the ``IRS'') has risen from $2.5      billion in fiscal year 1979 to $7.5 billion in fiscal year      1996, tax returns processing has not become significantly      faster, tax collection rates have not significantly      increased, and the accuracy and timeliness of taxpayer      assistance has not significantly improved.       (2) To date, the Tax Systems Modernization (TSM) program      has cost the taxpayers $2.5 billion, with an estimated cost      of $8 billion. Despite this investment, modernization efforts      were recently described by the GAO as ``chaotic'' and ``ad      hoc''.       (3) While the IRS maintains the TSM will increase      efficiency and thus revenues, Congress has had to appropriate      additional funds in recent years for compliance initiative in      order to increase tax revenues.       (4) Because TSM has not been implemented, the IRS continues      to rely on paper returns, processing a total of 14 billion      pieces of paper every tax season. This results in an      extremely inefficient system.       (5) This lack of efficiency reduces the level of customer      service and impedes the ability of the IRS to collect      revenue.       (6) The present status of the IRS shows the need for the      establishment of a Commission which will examine the      organization of IRS and recommend actions to expedite the      implementation of TSM and improve service to taxpayers.       (b) Composition of the Commission.--       (1) Establishment.--To carry out the purposes of this      section, there is established a National Commission on      Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service (in this section      referred to as the ``Commission'').       (2) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of      twelve members, as follows:       (A) Four members appointed by the President, two from the      executive branch of the Government and two from private life.       (B) Two members appointed by the Majority Leader of the      Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private      life.       (C) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the      Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private      life.       (D) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of      Represtatives, one from Members of the House of      Representatives and one from private life.       (E) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the      House of Representatives, one from Members of the House of      Representatives and one from private life.     The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service shall be an      ex officio member of the Commission.       (3) Chairman.--The Commission shall elect a Chairman from      among its members.       (4) Meeting; quorum, vacancies.--After its initial meeting,      the Commission shall meet upon the call of the Chairman or a      majority of its members. Seven members of the Commission      shall constitute a quorum.

(5) Appointment; initial meeting.--       (A) Appointment.--It is the sense of the Congress that      members of the Committee should be appointed not more than 60      days after the date of the enactment of this section.
