President, there are publications given to us on the floor of the Senate. One of them is the Executive Calendar.  This Executive Calendar and parts of it may be characterized as a political obituary column because, you see, these are the nominees of the Obama administration for important posts across America--the names on here--and many of them have been sitting for months and some for over a year, and they are waiting for Senate action.  So far this Congress we have approved 17 Federal judges--2 circuit court judges, and 15 district court judges. There are 20 judicial nominees still sitting on this calendar. You think to yourself: Well, they must be pretty controversial if they are still sitting on the calendar.  Every single one of them was reported unanimously from the Senate Judiciary Committee. There were no dissenting votes, no objections. Still they just sit and sit and sit on the calendar.  Why? Well, we know we have a serious problem with not just these 20, but there is the fact that we have 87 vacancies in the Federal judiciary, many of them in an emergency situation.  Why? Why in the world would some of these nominees, some of whom have been supported by Republican Senators--why aren't they being called for a vote, a routine vote on the floor of the Senate? It is part of the obstruction that the Republican Party has decided to make part of their leadership in the Senate. And, of course, exhibit A in that obstruction is the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, occasioned by the untimely death of Justice Antonin Scalia.  It has been nearly 2 months since President Obama nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Scalia vacancy on the Supreme Court. It has been 3 months since Justice Scalia passed away--3 months--and still the Republican-led Senate has refused to consider President Obama's nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. We ought to be doing that right now.  Today we received all of the investigative materials and binders and questionnaire answers from Judge Garland--boxes and boxes, thousands of pages--available to be reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and every Member of the Senate. It is the Senate's constitutional obligation under article II, section 2, to provide advice and consent when the President submits such a nomination.  Mr. President, it is rare for a political figure or a publicly elected official to stand up and use the word ``never,'' but I am about to use it. We have never--never in the history of the U.S. Senate--denied a Supreme Court nominee from a President a hearing or a vote--never. For 100 years, these nominees have been sent through the Senate Judiciary Committee with a public hearing. And every pending nominee for an open Supreme Court vacancy has been voted upon at some point by Senators.  We had a press conference today, and we talked about the precedent. Senator Franken of Minnesota noted the time when John Adams had lost the Presidential election but filled a vacancy on the Supreme Court by nominating John Marshall to be a member of that Court. So here was John Adams, a defeated President, making a nomination to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.  In the Senate, in those days, there were still Founding Fathers, men who had actually written the Constitution. Five of them were Members of the Senate when John Marshall's nomination came before them. If there was ever a lameduck, it was John Adams, who had been defeated for reelection and had a few months more to serve but who made a nomination for the Supreme Court and, by voice vote, the U.S. Senate approved him, including the five Founding Fathers who joined in that effort.  The argument being made on the Republican side is: Well, we can't fill this vacancy until after the election. We have to wait to see if President Trump will be chosen by the American people, and then he will get to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court. Interesting. I missed it. I read the Constitution and thought for sure that President Obama was elected for 4 years in 2012. By the Republicans' math, it was 3 years and 2 months. He's a lameduck and has no power left. Well, they are wrong. By a margin of 5 million votes, Barack Obama was reelected President over Mitt Romney. Now this decision by the Republicans to stop this President from exercising his constitutional authority is just wrong.  What about Judge Garland? Judge Garland is one of the most extraordinary nominees ever presented to this Senate. He is now the chief judge of the DC Circuit Court. That is the second highest court in the land. He is well respected. He has received the endorsement of many different groups, and people who are conservative and liberal alike respect his judgment, as they should. He has done his job and done it well, but the Republicans in the Senate refuse to do their job. They say it is because they want the next President to fill that seat. I cannot even imagine the nominee that a President Donald Trump would send to the Senate.  Last week, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, a man named Reince Priebus, announced that Mr. Trump was the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. It is astonishing to me that Senate Republicans would seriously want to put Donald Trump in charge of filling Supreme Court vacancies. How would they explain that to their constituents? Most of them are saying they are not even going to attend the Republican convention for fear of what it will do to their political reputations, and yet they are trusting the judgment of Donald Trump to shape the highest Court of the United States of America?  Make no mistake. By failing to move on Merrick Garland's nomination now in a timely and fair way, Republicans have cast their lot with Mr. Trump. That is a risky bet for the American people. The American people also understand Merrick Garland is well qualified and rock solid. Every week we see more praise for him.  Last week, nine former Solicitors General, Republicans and Democratsalike, sent a public letter praising Judge Garland. The list of people who signed this letter includes prominent Republicans and Democrats: Ken Starr, Drew Days, Walter Dellinger, Ted Olson, and Paul Clement. We know the Solicitor General serves as the Federal Government's chief advocate before the U.S. Supreme Court. They know the Supreme Court as well as anyone, and they know a good judge when they see one. Here is what they said about Judge Garland:       As a group, we have argued hundreds of cases before the      United States Supreme Court and the Federal Courts of      Appeals. Each of us has served as the United States      Government's top representative before the Supreme Court. And      while we have served in different administrations, we are      unified in our belief that Judge Garland is superbly      qualified to serve on the Supreme Court if he were confirmed.      We are confident that Judge Garland would bring his      brilliance, work ethic, and broad experience to the cases      that come before him.  That is very high praise, isn't it? Clearly, President Obama selected a nominee highly regarded by advocates who know the Supreme Court better than most. Yet my Republican colleagues will not even give this superbly qualified nominee the dignity of a public hearing. They would rather keep a Supreme Court seat vacant for more than a year and allow the Court to deadlock for a year with 4-to-4 votes on key cases and wait in hopes they can roll the dice with President Donald Trump and his Supreme Court nominee. It is hard to fathom how this strategy is respectful of the constitution or in the best interest of our Nation.  Not only are Senate Republicans failing to do their job in considering Judge Garland's nomination, they are obstructing 20 other well-qualified judicial nominees who are currently pending on the Senate floor.  The Senate Republicans, as I have said, have held votes on only 17 judicial nominees this Congress. That is the lowest total in decades, far fewer than the 68 judges the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed in the last 2 years of George W. Bush's administration. Republicans are apparently content to leave vacancies on courts across the United States and even on the Supreme Court of the United States. Is that why they were elected, to leave vacancies on these courts? They cannot hide from the fact that there is a need in this country for competent jurists to guide us in these Federal courts.  I hope a few more of my Republican colleagues will come to their senses. Rather than saving judicial seats for Donald Trump to fill, they should do their job and give President Obama's well-qualified nominees a hearing and a vote, and they should start with Merrick Garland.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from these Solicitors General.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      May 5, 2016.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Reid,      Chairman Grassley, and Ranking Member Leahy: Each of us      headed the Office of the Solicitor General. Our service took      place under both Republican and Democratic Presidents. We      write collectively in support of Judge Merrick Garland's      qualifications to serve as an Associate Justice of the United      States Supreme Court. We believe that Judge Garland has      demonstrated the temperament, intellect, and experience to      serve in this capacity.       Merrick Garland has a history of excellence in the Law. He      served in high ranking Justice Department posts, as a partner      at a major law firm, an Assistant United States Attorney, a      law clerk on the United States Supreme Court, a law clerk on      the Second Circuit for the legendary Judge Henry Friendly,      and, of course, for nearly the last two decades, as a Judge      on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.      He presently serves as the Chief Judge of that Circuit, where      he is known for his collegiality and is widely respected by      his colleagues and litigants who have come before him.       As a group, we have argued hundreds of cases before the      United States Supreme Court and the federal Courts of      Appeals. Each of us has served as the United States      Government's top representative before the Supreme Court. And      while we have served in different Administrations, we are      unified in our belief that Judge Garland is superbly      qualified to serve on the Supreme Court if he were confirmed.       We are confident that Judge Garland would bring his      brilliance, work ethic, and broad experience to the cases      that come before him. Please do not hesitate to contact us if      you have questions.           Respectfully submitted,         Neal K. Katyal (Acting Solicitor General, 2010-2011),            Gregory G.
