President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in introducing the Positive Aging Act of 2013, which will help to increase older Americans' access to quality mental health screening and treatment services in community-based settings.  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important for States like Maine that have a disproportionate number of older persons. Sixteen percent of Maine's population is 65 or older, and, with the highest median age, Maine is the ``oldest'' State in the Nation. Moreover, our percentage of older adults is increasing; by 2030, more than one in five Mainers will be over the age of 65.  One of the most daunting public health challenges facing our Nation today is how to increase access to quality mental health services for the more than 46 million American adults living with severe, disabling mental disorders that can devastate their lives and the lives of the people around them.  What is often overlooked is the prevalence of mental illness among our Nation's elderly. Nearly one in five older adults in America have one or more mental health conditions. Moreover, older white males age 85 and older have the highest rate of suicide of any group in the country. Particularly disturbing is the fact that the mental health needs of older Americans are often overlooked or not recognized because of the mistaken belief that they are a normal part of aging and therefore cannot be treated.  While effective treatments exist for mental health disorders, it is estimated that nearly two-thirds of older adults with a mental health problem do not receive the services they need. Older adults with evidence of a mental disorder are generally less likely than younger and middle-aged adults to receive mental health services and, when they do, they are less likely to receive care from a mental health specialist. Failure to treat mental disorders leads to poorer health outcomes for other medical conditions, higher rates of institutionalization, and increased health care costs.  Fortunately, important research is being done that is developing innovative approaches to improve the delivery of mental health care for older adults by integrating it into primary care settings. This research demonstrates that older adults are more likely to receive appropriate mental health care if there is a mental health professional on the primary care team, rather than simply referring them to a mental health specialist outside the primary care setting. Multiple appointments with multiple providers in multiple settings simply don't work for older patients who must also cope with concurrent chronic illnesses, mobility problems, and limited transportation options. The research also shows that there is less stigma associated with psychiatric services when they are integrated into general medical care.  The Positive Aging Act builds upon this research and authorizes funding for projects that integrate mental health screening and treatment services into community sites and primary care settings. Specifically, the Positive Aging Act of 2013 would authorize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to fund demonstration projects to support integration of mental health services in primary care settings. It would also support grants for community-based mental health treatment outreach teams to fund demonstration projects to support integration of mental health services in primary care settings. To ensure that these geriatric mental health programs have proper attention and oversight, it would mandate the designation of a Deputy Director for Older Adult Mental Health Services in the Center for Mental Health Services, and it would also include representatives of older Americans or their families and geriatric mental health professionals on the Advisory Council for the Center for Mental Health Services. Finally, it would require State plans under Community Mental Health Services Block Grants to include descriptions of the States' outreach to and services for older individuals.  We are fortunate today to have a variety of effective treatments to address the mental health needs of American seniors. The Positive Aging Act will help to ensure that older Americans have access to these important services. I therefore urge my colleagues to sign on as cosponsors of the legislation, which has been endorsed by numerous mental health, aging, and health care organizations, including the American Psychological Association, the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, the American Geriatrics Society, and the National Association of Social Workers.                          ____________________
