 President, I appreciate the intent of the amendment. However, I have significant concerns and must oppose it. The research provided by this amendment is unnecessary. It duplicates, in fact, existing authority in the HHS.  More importantly, this amendment contains two damaging provisions. It directs the Food and Drug Administration to include information coming from these studies in approved product labeling, effectively taking the sole authority of the FDA to regulate prescription drug labeling and giving it to other, nonexpert sources.  This amendment also changes the fundamental research mission of the National Institutes of Health.  Further, these changes have not been considered by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over these programs.  This amendment is unnecessary. I urge my colleagues to defeat it.
