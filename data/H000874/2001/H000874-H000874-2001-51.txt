Speaker, I join with the Chairman in urging adoption of Senate Concurrent Resolution 67.  This is a housekeeping measure allowing the Chairman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee to designate another member of that panel to serve on the Joint Committee on Printing in his place during the 107th Congress.  By statute, the Senate membership of the Joint Committee on Printing consists of the Chairman and four members of the Committee on Rules and Administration. In order for the Senate to depart from that statutory scheme, the House must concur, hence this concurrent resolution.  Anticipating adoption of this measure, the Senate has adopted a simple resolution electing its members of the Joint Committee for the 107th Congress. If we clear this resolution, the Joint Committee on Printing can organize and proceed to its business. I urge an ``aye'' vote.
