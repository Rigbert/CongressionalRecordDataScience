President, I read with interest an article this week penned by the senior Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, about a dear friend, Senator Nancy Kassebaum. Amidst the partisan gridlock of today's Congress, it is hard to remember a time when Members from both sides of the aisle routinely came together for the common good, rather than for the sake of political ideology. As a daughter of a public servant, Nancy Kassebaum had civic duty in her blood and represented the State of Kansas for nearly two decades. During her time in the Senate, Nancy's leadership, and determination to fight for those who needed it most, was exemplary.  Her ability to put politics aside and work across the aisle has had a lasting impact on millions of women and children today. Nancy became the first woman to serve as Chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Here she worked to create the Office of Women's Health Research within the National Institutes of Health, and she fought tirelessly alongside Senator Ted Kennedy to protect abused and neglected children. Nancy was an invaluable resource as chair of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, and a strong champion condemning the apartheid atrocities during Nelson Mandela's incarceration. Nancy Kassebaum exemplified the determination and leadership it takes to make a remarkable legislator and I am equally proud to call her my friend.  I ask unanimous consent that the Politico article, ``Friendship without Ideology'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows                     [From Politico, Nov. 13, 2013]                      Friendship Without Ideology                         (By Barbara Mikulski)       (The following essay is part of a series in which dozens of      women will reveal what women they most admire. The series is      part of ``Women Rule,'' a unique effort this fall by      POLITICO, Google and The Tory Burch Foundation exploring how      women are leading change in politics, policy and their      communities.)       Few senators have left such a mark on the Senate as Nancy      Kassebaum. She was a dedicated and determined public servant      who always put people above politics. In the decade we served      together, I saw her advocate every day for her home state of      Kansas--whether it was in the committees or on the Senate      floor.       When I was first elected to represent Maryland in the      Senate, I was the only Democratic woman and Nancy was the      only Republican woman to serve in that chamber. In those      days, because there were so few of us, there was pressure for      us to act like celebrities instead of senators. Not only did      Nancy resist that pressure--it didn't even cross her mind.       Nancy accomplished tremendous things in her years as a      senator. But it wasn't just what she did, it's how she did      it. When I became a senator, she was so welcoming to me,      offering tips and insights in my early days navigating the      Senate. It's a tradition I have tried to honor as Dean of the      Senate Women, where I mentor and advise women who currently      serve as senators.       She was an inspiration, teacher, mentor and good friend--     and she still is.       The daughter of the governor from Kansas, Nancy came from a      family of public servants. In her first campaign, she used      the slogan, ``A fresh face, a trusted Kansas name.'' Yet      Nancy was a trailblazer in her own right, and a woman of many      firsts. She is the first woman to have represented Kansas in      the Senate; the first woman to have chaired a full      committee--the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources,      where we served together. We always agreed that it wasn't      about gender--it was about having an agenda.       She was independent minded. But she always voted with her      principles, and Kansas, first.       Nancy was an important leader in foreign affairs. As chair      of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs, her      expertise in African affairs was significant. In the mid-     1990s, with Nelson Mandela confined in jail, she was an early      and outspoken supporter of anti-apartheid measures in South      Africa. Above all, she advocated peace around the world, once      saying, ``Hatred and anger can destroy a nation, but they      cannot build a just and prosperous one.'' Her poignant words      still ring true today.       Yet while she was working to make the world a better place,      she never strayed from home.       As chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human      Resources, Nancy championed American families and children. I      loved working with Nancy on that committee, alongside      legislative legends like Sen. Ted Kennedy. As a social      worker, I was proud to serve as partners to make life better      for so many. We fought to protect abused and neglected      children, to increase the availability of child care for low-     income families and to preserve child care health and safety      standards. Because of her work, our most vulnerable      Americans--our children--are safer and healthier. And for      millions more, Nancy brought improved access to better health      care with the bipartisan Kennedy-Kassebaum Act in 1996.      Whatever the bill, she always offered pragmatic, affordable      solutions to pressing problems that affect American families.      I was proud to join her on many of those issues.       Together, we fought for groundbreaking research to help      understand devastating diseases. We founded the Office of      Women's Health Research at the National Institutes of Health,      so women could be included in medical research. It led to the      historic study on hormone treatment for women, which led to a      drop in breast cancer rates by 15 percent. Since then, the      Office of Women's Health Research has continued to publish      vital findings--on everything from symptoms of heart attacks      to the likelihood of osteoporosis. I'm proud to know that the      work Nancy and I did together has helped save lives, millions      at a time.       Nancy considered every vote with intellect and integrity.      She showed that a woman with voice and volition could be      formidable. Above all, she won the heart of Kansans as their      down-to-earth, but determined senator.       In 1996, she won the heart of Sen. Howard Baker as well. I      was delighted to be at her wedding to Howard, where Kennedy      and I joined them on the dance floor for the ``Bipartisan      Boogie.''       At one time, a Kansas newspaper claimed, ``the only thing      more popular than Nancy is wheat.'' For Nancy, it was never      about being first. It was about serving the people. And      Kansas couldn't have asked for anyone better.
