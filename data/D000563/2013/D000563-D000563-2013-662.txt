President, I wish to commend the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Murphy, as well as Senator Blumenthal. In the last 2 days they have come to the floor many times leading the floor debate and discussion on the pending legislation we will vote on soon relative to guns and gun safety. It is appropriate that they are here because, being the Senators representing Newtown, CT, they have personal attachment to the families who have weathered this tragedy.  This morning I met with those families in my office. Tears were shed, as you might expect.
