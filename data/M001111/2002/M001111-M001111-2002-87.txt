 President, I am pleased that Chairman Harkin and Senator Lugar accepted my amendment on rural telecommunications to the Farm Bill that passed the Senate yesterday.  My amendment simply adds a small planning component to the scope of acceptable activities for grants in the bill to help rural communities get connected to broadband telecommunications services.  Specifically, my amendment would provide access to broadband planning and feasibility grants to rural communities, with a maximum of $250,000 for statewide grants and $100,000 for regional grants. The total resources would be no more than $3 million per year for this purpose. State governments, regional consortia of local governments, tribal governments, cooperatives, and State and regional non-profit entities would be eligible to receive the grants.  As small and rural communities across the country try to get connected to advanced telecommunications services, they need help in the planning stage. And this amendment will give them the help they need.  Three years ago, I formed several working groups in my state to identify the primary needs of our rural communities and to find ways that our government can help meet those needs. We learned that many rural communities don't have access to advanced telecom services, like high speed Internet access. That lack of access is hampering their economic development and quality of life.  So I developed another working group to look for ways to help communities get connected to advanced telecommunications services. The members of my Rural Telecommunications Working Group held forums around the state that attracted hundreds of people. We tapped the ideas of experts, service providers and people from across the State who are working to get their communities connected.  They found that while urban and suburban areas have strong competition between telecommunications providers, many small and rural communities are far removed from the services they need.  We must ensure that all communities have access to advanced telecommunications like high speed Internet access. Just as yesterday's infrastructure was built of roads and bridges, today our infrastructure includes advanced telecom services.  Advanced telecommunications can enrich our lives through activities like distance-learning, and they can even save lives through efforts like telemedicine. The key is access. Access to these services is already turning some small companies in rural communities into international marketers of goods and services.  Unfortunately, many small and rural communities are having trouble getting the access they need. Before areas can take advantage of some of the help and incentives that are out there, they need to work together and go through a community planning process.  Community plans identify the needs and level of demand, create a vision forthe future, and show what all the players must do to meet the telecom needs of their community for today and tomorrow.  These plans take resources to develop. This amendment would provide those funds.  Providers say they're more likely to invest in an area if it has a plan that makes a business case for the costly infrastructure investment. Communities want to provide them with that plan, but they need help developing it.  Unfortunately, many communities get stuck on that first step. They don't have the resources to do the studies and planning required to attract service.  So the members of my Working Group came up with a solution: have the Federal Government provide competitive grants that local communities can use to develop their plans.  I took that idea and put it into a bill that I introduced in June 2001, S. 1056, the Community Telecommunications Planning Act of 2001. The basic structure of that amendment was incorporated into the Farm Bill.  When you think about it, it just makes sense. Right now the Federal Government already provides money to help communities plan other infrastructure improvements, everything from roads and bridges to wastewater facilities.  The amendment would provide rural and underserved communities with grant money for creating community plans, technical assessments and other analytical work that needs to be done.  With these grants, communities will be able to turn their desire for access into real access that can improve their communities and strengthen their economies. This amendment can open the door for thousands of small and rural areas across our state to tap the potential of the information economy.  I will work to ensure this provision is included in the final bill along with the other critical telecommunications initiatives that passed the Senate yesterday.                           butter/powder tilt
