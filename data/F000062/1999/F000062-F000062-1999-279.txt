 President, I rise today to introduce the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act of 1999. This bill would designate an 18,500 acre portion of the Otay Mountain region in Southern California as wilderness. The bill passed the House last week on a voice vote, with broad bi-partisan support.  Otay Mountain, which is located near the U.S.-Mexico border in eastern San Diego County, is one of California's most special wild places. The mountain is a unique ecosystem, home to 20 sensitive plant and animal species. The endangered quino checkerspot butterfly calls Otay Mountain home, and the only known stand of Tecate cypress, as well as the only known population of the Mexican flannel bush, also thrive on the mountain. For these reasons, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management first recommended Otay Mountain for wilderness designation in the 1980s.  In addition, Otay Mountain is key to San Diego County's habitat conservation planning efforts. The County has identified the region as a core reserve in the multi-species habitat conservation plan that it is currently developing.  Otay Mountain is scenic, rugged, and beautiful. The area is well worth preserving as wilderness for generations to come. This bill will ensure that San Diegans, and indeed all Americans, will be able to experience and enjoy Otay Mountain in all its unique splendor.  Unfortunately, in recent years Otay Mountain's sensitive habitat has been damaged by illegal immigration and narcotics activity in the area. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has worked closely with the U.S. Border Patrol to bring these problems under control, and they have experienced great success. This legislation would specifically allow Border Patrol and firefighting activities to continue in the new wilderness area, so long as they remain in accordance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. This provision in the legislation is specific to Otay Mountain and will not apply to any other wilderness area.  I want to thank Congressman Brian Bilbray for his leadership in introducing the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act and guiding it through the House of Representatives. I also want to thank Congressman Filner, who has been a steadfast supporter of the legislation, along with the Clinton Administration. The California Departments of Fish and Game and Fire and Forestry Protection support the bill, as do the Endangered Habitats League and other environmental groups. Finally, the bill has strong support from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors and the San Diego Association of Governments.  Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will move expeditiously to approve the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act and send the bill to the President for signature.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 848       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Otay Mountain Wilderness Act      of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the public land in the Otay Mountain region of      California is one of the last remaining pristine locations in      western San Diego County, California;       (2) this rugged mountain adjacent to the United States-     Mexico border is internationally known for having a diversity      of unique and sensitive plants;       (3) this area plays a critical role in San Diego's multi-     species conservation plan, a national model made for      maintaining biodiversity;       (4) due to the proximity of the Otay Mountain region to the      international border, this area is the focus of important law      enforcement and border interdiction efforts necessary to      curtail illegal immigration and protect the area's wilderness      values; and       (5) the illegal immigration traffic, combined with the      rugged topography, present unique fire management challenges      for protecting lives and resources.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Public land.--The term ``public land'' has the meaning      given the term ``public lands'' in section 103 of the Federal      Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702).       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary      of the Interior.

(b) Otay Mountain Wilderness.--The area designated under      subsection (a) shall be known as the Otay Mountain      Wilderness.     SEC. 5. MAP AND LEGAL DESCRIPTION.       (a) In General.--As soon as practicable after the date of      enactment of this Act, a map and a legal description for the      Wilderness Area shall be filed by the Secretary with--       (1) the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the      Senate; and       (2) the Committee on Resources of the House of      Representatives.       (b) Force and Effect.--The map and legal description shall      have the same force and effect as if included in this Act,      except that the Secretary, as appropriate, may correct      clerical and typographical errors in the map and legal      description.       (c) Availability.--The map and legal description for the      Wilderness Area shall be on file and available for public      inspection in the offices of the Director and California      State Director of the Bureau of Land Management.       (d) United States-Mexico Border.--In carrying out this      section, the Secretary shall ensure that the southern      boundary of the Wilderness Area is--       (1) 100 feet north of the trail depicted on the map      referred to in subsection (a); and       (2) not less than 100 feet from the United States-Mexico      international border.     SEC. 6. WILDERNESS REVIEW.       All public land not designated as wilderness within the      boundaries of the Southern Otay Mountain Wilderness Study      Area (CA-060-029) and the Western Otay Mountain Wilderness      Study Area (CA-060-028) managed by the Bureau of Land      Management and reported to the Congress in 1991--       (1) have been adequately studied for wilderness designation      under section 603 of the Federal Land Policy and Management      Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1782); and       (2) shall no longer be subject to the requirements      contained in section 603(c) of that Act pertaining to the      management of wilderness study areas in a manner that does      not impair the suitability of those areas for preservation as      wilderness.     SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATION OF WILDERNESS AREA.       (a) In General.--Subject to valid existing rights and to      subsection (b), the Wilderness Area shall be administered by      the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act (16      U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), except that for the purposes of the      Wilderness Area--       (1) any reference in that Act to the effective date of that      Act shall be considered to be a reference to the effective      date of this Act; and       (2) any reference in that Act to the Secretary of      Agriculture shall be considered to be a reference to the      Secretary of the Interior.       (b) Border Enforcement, Drug Interdiction, and Wildland      Fire Protection.--Because of the proximity of the Wilderness      Area to the United States-Mexico international border, drug      interdiction, border operations, and wildland fire management      operations are common management actions throughout the area      encompassing the Wilderness Area. This Act recognizes the      need to continue such management actions so long as such      management actions are conducted in accordance with the      Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.) and are subject to      such conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate.     SEC. 8. FURTHER ACQUISITIONS.       Any land within the boundaries of the Wilderness Area that      is acquired by the United States after the date of enactment      of this Act shall--       (1) become part of the Wilderness Area; and       (2) be managed in accordance with this Act and other laws      applicable to wilderness areas.     SEC. 9. NO BUFFER ZONES.       (a) In General.--The designation of the Wilderness Area by      this Act shall not lead to the creation of protective      perimeters or buffer zones outside the boundary of the      Wilderness Area.       (b) Nonwilderness Activities.--The fact that nonwilderness      activities or uses can be seen or heard from areas within the      Wilderness Area shall not, in and of itself, preclude      nonwilderness activities or uses outside the boundary of the      Wilderness Area.                                 ______                                       By
