President, I discussed this with the distinguished majority leader. I will make this unanimous-consent request.                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 2082  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2082, the 3-month extension of the PATRIOT Act, that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table. And I do that because that would keep the PATRIOT Act in existence after December 31.
