  Mr. President, the bottom line is that this is a vote about values. This is a way to define, very simply, what you value most. If you value giving 5-percent relief to people with estates over $3 million, instead of 3 percent, more than you value allowing tens of thousands of Americans to get up to $3,300 in relief on their taxes, which can be to do everything from paying tuition to paying the light bill, middle-class families, then vote against us.  Make no mistake about it. My friend from Arizona is right. This is a moral question. This is about value. I know where I stand. I am interested to see where the Senate stands.
