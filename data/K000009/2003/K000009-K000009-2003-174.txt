Speaker, Saturday, May 31, 2003 begins the centennial celebration of All Saints Episcopal Church in Toledo, Ohio. I am pleased to commemorate this momentous and joyous occasion by sharing it with my colleagues and for inclusion in the Congressional Record.  On June 3, 1903, five people under the leadership of Reverend William A. Grier founded the church as an Episcopal Mission Church. It was the only Negro Mission in the Toledo Episcopal Region. The church became a parish of its own in 1952. Since then, it has grown and remained a neighborhood anchor. It even experienced a rebirth in the last decade, with a new sanctuary and office in 1998, and a new parish hall in 2002.  In addition to its celebration dinner, the church has invited the members of neighboring churches to spend an evening with them in prayer, song, and scripture. On Tuesday, June 3, All Saints will observe its 100th birthday with a Holy Eucharist Service.  As it has since its founding 100 years ago, All Saints Episcopal Church continues to follow the words of Matthew 5:16, ``Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.'' It remains a beacon of hope and a sanctuary of praise while its congregants forge ahead on a path begun a century ago and built upon through successive generations. We congratulate All Saints on reaching this milestone, and look forward to its life and work in a new century.                          ____________________
