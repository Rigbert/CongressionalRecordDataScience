Chairman, reclaiming my time, my problem is I want to have 5 minutes. If the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) can do that on unanimous consent, I will not object.  Mr. Chairman, I want to read a couple of portions of speeches that have been given recently about this issue, and I would hope my colleagues on the Republican side would listen.  I came into the Chamber to make my remarks as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kasich) was speaking. Shortly thereafter, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) spoke. Both of those gentlemen in 1991 voted on the Durbin amendment that the President did not have to come to Congress for approval of taking military action. Both the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kasich) and, I might add, the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell) in 1991 took a different position with respect to the President's authority.
