Speaker, let me reclaim my time for a second.  I had somebody divide it out for me. What it works out to is that every 28 cars that come up from Mexico to the United States, we send down 2 cars, and in trucks it is even worse. For every 33 trucks that are built by these companies sent into our market, we send down there about a third of a truck. It is absolutely upside-down.
