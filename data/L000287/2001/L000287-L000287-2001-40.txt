Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), my friend and my colleague, for yielding and for going on this trip. I want to also take the time to thank all of the staff of Faith and Politics, staff from the Capitol, the Capitol Police, and others that assisted us in making this trip a very successful trip.  We have come a distance in the past 36 years toward laying down the word on race, toward creating a truly interracial democracy. We are on our way toward the building of the beloved community. We are not there yet; but during the past 36 years, we traveled such a distance.  Those signs that I saw in Selma that said ``white men,'' ``colored men,'' ``white women,'' ``colored women,'' they are gone. They will not return.  Today, in Selma, Alabama, in Montgomery, in Birmingham, you have biracial government, black people, white people working together to create a sense of community, to create a sense of family.  If there is anything we learned from this trip, even here in the House, the people's House, the House of Representatives, we can create a sense of family, one family, one House, the American House, the American family.                          ____________________
