 Mr. President, we are voting on our 42nd judicial nominee to be confirmed since last July when the Senate Judiciary Committee reorganized after the Senator majority changed. With the confirmation of Robert Randall Crane to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas--and I predict we will accept him--the Senate will have resolved 7 judicial emergencies since we returned to session a few short weeks ago, 14 judicial emergencies since I became chairman.  As of this week, the Senate has confirmed more judges in the last 9 months than were confirmed in 4 out of 6 years under the Republican leadership. I have heard some inaccurate statements--I am sure innocently enough but mistakenly--by my friends on the other side of the aisle. As of this week, we will have confirmed, in 9 months, more judges than were confirmed in 4 of the 6 total years under the Republican leadership. In fact, the number of judicial confirmations over these past 9 months exceeds the number of judicial nominees confirmed during all 12 months for the years 2000, 1999, 1997, and 1996.  During the 6\1/2\ years the Republicans controlled the Senate, judicial nominations averaged 38 a year. We have done more than that in 9 months. In the past 9 months, we have had more hearings for more nominees and had more confirmations than the Republican leadership did for President Clinton's nominees during the first 9 months of 1995.  On the chart we took 9-month increments. In the first 9 months that the Republicans led the committee, they had 9 hearings; we had 14; they confirmed 36 and we confirmed 42. Looking at the first 3 months of the session, we will have confirmed 14. During the first 3 months of each session they were in charge the following occurred: In March 1995, they confirmed 9; in March of 1996, they confirmed 0; by March of 1997, they confirmed 2; by March of 1998, the high-water mark, they had 12; by March of 1999, they had 0; by March of 2000, they had 7; by March of 2001, they had 0; we have done 14.  We tried to have a pace faster than the Republicans when they chaired the Judiciary Committee, when they controlled the Senate, and so far we have done that. Some have expressed concern how this Senate, under this leadership, has handled nominations of President Bush. So far he will have won 41 out of 42 nominations. As great as the football team is in Nebraska, they would be delighted to win 41 out of 42, as would any team.  In 1999, when the Republicans controlled the Senate, in the whole year, they confirmed 26 district judges and 7 circuit judges. In the year 2000, for the whole year, they confirmed 31 district judges and 8 circuit judges. In the first 6 months of last year, when they controlled the Senate, they had 0. In the past 9 months--remember, these are comparing whole years--in the past 9 months, we have had 35 district judges, 7 courts of appeal.  Take the average number of days between nomination and confirmation, figuring we have to wait extra time for the ABA: they took 182 one year; 212 days another year; 232, another; 178, another; 196, another. The Democrats average considerably less.  Reviewing today's nominations illustrates the effect of the reform process that the Democratic leadership has spearheaded.
