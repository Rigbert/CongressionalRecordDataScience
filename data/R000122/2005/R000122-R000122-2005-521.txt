President, today, March 1, is National Sportsmanship Day. A project of the Institute for International Sport at the University of Rhode Island, National Sportsmanship Day is the largest initiative of its kind in the world. Now in its 15th year of promoting the highest ideals of sportsmanship and fair play among America's youth, the day will be observed in over 13,000 schools in all 50 States. The day will involve more than 5 million students, teachers, administrators, coaches, and parents in discussions on the issue of sportsmanship.  National Sportsmanship Day was first championed by Rhode Island Senators Claiborne Pell and the late John Chafee. This year, National Sportsmanship Day will honor these Senators; USA Today, which conducts an annual National Sportsmanship Day essay contest, and its sports editor Monte Lorell; the President's Council on Physical Fitness; the Old Dominican Athletic Conference, which has reinforced the values of sportsmanship among its teams; and Playing for Peace, an international organization which uses basketball and sportsmanship to bring young people together from communities such as Belfast, Northern Ireland and Johannesburg, South Africa.  I am proud Rhode Island is home to the Institute for International Sport and National Sportsmanship Day, and pleased to see the positive influence it has had on youngsters across the Nation during its 15 years of promoting the best in athletics.                          ____________________[Page S1862]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY
