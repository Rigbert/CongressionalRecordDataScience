Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes, and I would like to make a couple of points.  First of all, this legislation has to be read in conjunction with the Detainee Treatment Act which was signed into law last year. That law provides for a procedure to review whether or not someone is properly detained as an enemy combatant. So the business of indefinite detention is a red herring.  Secondly, this legislation itself creates a number of new rights for detainees and people who are tried before military commissions. Let me enumerate them. There are 26 new rights:  A right to counsel provided by the government at trial and throughout appellate proceedings; an impartial judge; the presumption of innocence; standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.  The right to be informed of the charges against the defendant as soon as practicable.  The right to service of charges sufficiently in advance of trial to prepare a defense.  The right to reasonable continuances.  The right to peremptorily challenge members of the commission. That is something nobody has in the United States against a Federal judge.  Witnesses must testify under oath and counsel, and members of the military commission must take an oath.  The right to enter a plea of not guilty.  The right to obtain witnesses and other evidence.  The right to exculpatory evidence as soon as practicable.  The right to be present in court, with the exception of certain classified evidence involving national security, preservation of safety or preventing disruption of proceedings.  The right to a public trial, except for national security or physical safety issues.  The right to have any finding or sentences announced as soon as determined.  The right against compulsory self-incrimination.  The right against double jeopardy.  The defense of lack of mental responsibility.  Voting by members of the military commission by secret written ballot.  Prohibition against unlawful command influence towards members of the commission, counsel, and military judgments.  Two-thirds vote of members is required for conviction, three-quarters is required for sentence to life or over 10 years, and unanimous verdict is required for the death penalty.  Verbatim authenticated record of trial.  Cruel and unusual punishment is prohibited.  Treatment and discipline during confinement the same as afforded to prisoners in U.S. domestic courts.  The right to review the full factual record by the convening authority, and the right to at least two appeals, including two in article 3 in Federal appellate court. That is one more appeal than the Constitution gives United States citizens.                              {time}  1545  So what's the beef? There are 26 more rights that are created in this legislation. Vote down the legislation, you vote down all of these new rights.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) and ask unanimous consent that he be permitted to yield portions of that time as he sees fit.
