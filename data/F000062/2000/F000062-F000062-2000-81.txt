 President, I am pleased today to join the administration and, particularly the Vice President, in introducing the Social Security Number Protection Act of 2000.  This legislation is designed to curb the unregulated sale and purchase of Social Security numbers, which have contributed significantly to a growing range of illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.  Mr. President, in 1997, I introduced S. 600, the Personal Privacy Information Act, with Senator Grassley after watching in dismay as one of my staff downloaded my own Social Security number off of the Internet in less than three minutes.  Nothing much has changed. For a mere $45, one can go online and purchase a person's Social Security number from a whole host of web businesses--no questions asked.  Why is it so important to stop the commercial sale of individuals' personal Social Security numbers? Once a criminal has a potential victim's Social Security number, that person becomes extremely vulnerable to having his or her whereabouts tracked and his or her identity stolen.
