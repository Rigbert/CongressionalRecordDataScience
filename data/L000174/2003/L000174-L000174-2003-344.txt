President, I have discussed this with the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. I have not heard any request from any of the members of the Judiciary Committee, chairmen or otherwise, on this. I have heard a number of members on the other side of the Judiciary Committee attack people on this side for not allowing judges to go through. This will make 145 of President Bush's judges going through. I was concerned because we have done so many by voice vote that my friends on the other side of the aisle have been so critical of this side for not allowing judges to go through. They may not have realized they were going through because we have voice-voted so many.  Because my good friend from Mississippi has asked me this as a personal matter, I have no objection to the request of the majority leader.
