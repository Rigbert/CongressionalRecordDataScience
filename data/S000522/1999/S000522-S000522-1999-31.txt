Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 2116, the Veterans Millennium Health Care Act.  Health care as we know it is changing. New technology allows for better treatment, better diagnosis and greater opportunities than ever before.  But as we approach the 21st century, the Veterans Administration must also change to address the needs of our veterans. This bill accomplishes that objective.  Mr. Speaker, my district contains one of the highest concentrations of veterans in the country. I have held town meetings across my district to listen to their concerns. The veterans I represent have advocated many of the provisions contained in this bill.  From requiring the VA to enlist the help of veterans organizations in developing enhanced service plans, to allowing the VA to contract for needed hospital care, the provisions contained in H.R. 2116 will benefit the VA for years to come.
