President, recently 14 of our colleagues brought to us a bipartisan plan to avoid what I thought was the majority leader's shortsighted bid for one-party rule. As part of the plan to avert the nuclear option, which would have changed more than 200 years of Senate tradition and precedent, rules protecting minority rights and checks and balances, those Senators have agreed to vote for cloture on this controversial and divisive renomination. I have no doubt they will follow through on their commitment, but in all likelihood, it is going to result in the appointment for life of a judge for Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit whose disturbing view of the Constitution would set back life for American workers and consumers more than 100 years and remove protections for people and their communities we now take for granted.
