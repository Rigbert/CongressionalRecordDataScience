President, in a short while, the Senate will have a cloture vote on Mr. Azar's nomination to run the Department of Health and Human Services. The debate will be about a lot more than that. It is a question of whether the Trump administration should be allowed to take this country backward on health and to discriminate against Americans. It is a question of whether the attacks on Medicaid should continue and whether this administration will be held accountable for its broken promises on lower drug prices, insurance for all, no cuts to Medicare or Medicaid.  I regret to say to the Senate today that I have no confidence that Mr. Azar will change course at the Department of Health and Human Services. I do not support his nomination, and I urge a ``no'' vote today.  I yield the floor.
