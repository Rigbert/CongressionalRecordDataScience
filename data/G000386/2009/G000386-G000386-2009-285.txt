 President, I think our colleagues know that the issue of health care reform is hopefully on a fast track in the sense of getting something done this year. This is a very big project to get underway. Senator Baucus and I have laid out an ambitious schedule for enacting a bipartisan health reform bill, and I think there are a lot of facets of it that we have to expect people who are not on the committees--Senator Kennedy's committee on the one hand and Senator Baucus's committee on the other hand--will have to take into consideration. I am asking, through a series of speeches I will give this spring, for people who perhaps don't think about the issue of health care reform because they do not serve on the committees to think of various things.  Today, I wish to address an issue we often read about in newspaper accounts--and the most recent one comes from a Wall Street Journal article I had a chance to read--that comes up as a reminder when people think about health care reform that we ought to take into consideration. I often refer to Canada, I suppose because a lot of Americans are familiar with the health care system in Canada, and we have a lot of our constituents who ask us why we don't put in place what they have in Canada. We refer to that system as single payer. We often run into people who say: Well, don't do what they are doing in Canada. I think a lot of our colleagues here would support single payer. So obviously, when these things are discussed in America at the grass roots level, I think we ought to be constantly reminded of this here as we debate health care reform, and a lot of our colleagues need to be thinking about this a long time before legislation comes to the floor.  We have a lot of work ahead of us if we want to see meaningful legislation that will accomplish our three main goals of health care reform: lower cost, expanded coverage, and better quality.  Let me say that again: Lower cost, expanded coverage, and better quality.  As we roll up our sleeves, it is helpful to look to our neighbor to the north, Canada, for some lessons about what works and what does not work. Some of the proposals that are being discussed--the public plan option, rationing of care, and a Federal health board--will make our current market-based health care system that we have in the United States more similar to the Canadian health care system. Some like that. Some do not like it. My purpose is to be raising questions that our colleagues ought to be considering.  The Canadian health care system might seem like a good idea to some of my colleagues, but this should make anyone who values access to care and the doctor-patient relationship very nervous. Canadian patients often wait months or even years for necessary care. It has become so bad that some patients are suing the Government in Canada to gain access to care. One Ontario man suffering from headaches and seizures was told he would have to wait 4\1/2\ months for an MRI. Instead of standing in line, he did what a lot of Canadians do. He traveled across the border to Buffalo for an MRI. It was there he discovered he had a malignant brain tumor. When he returned to Canada, he was told again it would be months before he could have surgery, so once again he traveled to Buffalo, for surgery. Another Canadian man waited in pain for a year before he could see a doctor about his arthritic hip. Once he finally saw the right specialist he was told that he would need a state-of-the-art procedure to resurface his hip, but sadly the Canadian Government told the 57-year-old gentleman he was ``too old'' to get the procedure. He was also prohibited from paying for the surgery with his own money. Similar to so many other Canadian patients, he is taking his case to court.  These court cases gained traction in 2005, when the Canadian supreme court ruled that patients suffer physically and psychologically while waiting for treatment in Canada's Government-run system. The court also concluded that the Government's controls over basic health care services impose a risk of irreparable harm and even death.  As some people propose that the Government take a more active role in our Nation's health care system, I hope we can agree that access to a waiting list is not access to health care. We all agree we need to fix our health care system but, as we try to fix it, let's not make it worse. Let's learn from our neighbors to the north. Let's not force patients in America into a one-size-fits-all Government-run system.                   Comparative Effectiveness Research  I would like to speak on another matter, about an important provision tucked away in the $1 trillion spending bill that passed last month. During the debate, Members spent a lot of time talking about big-ticket health care provisions--Medicaid, COBRA, Health IT. But one issue that did not receive enough attention was a term that a lot of our colleagues are not familiar with, but every colleague needs to become familiar with--this phrase ``comparative effectiveness research.'' I still haven't figured out how spending money on comparative effectiveness research is actually stimulative, but this is one of those things that probably should not have been in the stimulus bill--but it was there and is now law.  I am even willing to guess that a lot of Members do not even know what comparative effectiveness research actually is, but in the so-called stimulus bill, we increased our investment in this research from about $30 million to $1 billion. That is over a 3,000-percent increase for something a lot of Members don't know about and can't even define--and I am not sure I want anybody to ask me right now to define it in the purest sense. This makes me a little nervous.  Mr. President, $1 billion is a lot of money, but maybe it is money that even people in comparative research might not even know what they are spending the money for.  Some policy experts have expressed concerns that this drastic increase in funding will help establish the United States version of England's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, also referred to as--I don't know whether the English pronounce it ``nice'' or ``niece,'' I am going to say NICE.  So you are not misled, many patient groups consider NICE to be anything but nice. NICE was created by the British Government in 1999 to decide what treatments, prescription drugs, and medical devices the British Government is going to pay for. In other words, you are having bureaucrats and/or politicians interfere in decisions that in America we normally leave to the doctor and the patient. Put another way, NICE was created for the Government to ration care and ultimately save money.  If the Congress of the United States was passing something to ration care, I will bet a good number of people in this country would get up in arms. For example, a news story printed in August entitled ``UK's''--meaning United Kingdom's--``NICE says `No' to four new cancer drugs.'' It detailed how the NICE panel concluded that the four drugs would extend people's lives, but somehow you cannot use them because they are not cost-effective.  So, under England's single-payer Government system, patients were prohibited from getting those drugs, regardless of what the patient or their doctor might have thought. It was not until there was public outrage about that decision that made newspaper headlines around the world that NICE then reversed its decision about at least one of those drugs. The three other drugs are still considered too costly to give to patients.  Another article in the New York Times on December 8, 2008, was entitled ``British Balance Benefit vs. Cost of Latest Drugs.'' This article told the story of Bruce Hardy, a British citizen who was diagnosed with kidney cancer. Mr. Hardy was unable to get a particular drug that would have extended his life because NICE determined the drug was not ``cost-effective.'' That is because NICE has decided the British Government can only afford to pay about $22,000 for every 6 months of life.  Get this. The Government of England is putting a value on life of about $22,000 for every 6 months of life. This may be acceptable in a government-run single-payer health care system, but here in the United States only two people should be involved in deciding what treatment, drug or device to use, and those two people would be, on the one hand, the doctor; on the other hand, the patient.  We do not need the Federal Government standing between patients and their doctors. We do not need bureaucrats in Washington denying patients with terminal cancer access to the newest and most promising experimental drugs. We do not need the drug companies to have undue influence over our system either.  I think my work overseeing, as congressional responsibility dictates, the Food and Drug Administration, gives me some authority to speak in this area, that drug companies should not have undue influence. I have been a leading advocate for increasing oversight of drugs and device manufacturers. In fact, I have introduced legislation to make manufacturers report payments to patients so we can make sure we do not have conflicts of interest getting in the way of high-quality care. I have also supported drug importation and legislation to prohibit brand-name manufacturers from gaming the system to prevent lower cost generic drugs from getting to the market. So I am not down here today to defend the drug companies or device industry. They can do that on their own, and I think they do it very well. But I think it is legitimate to be concerned about patients. I don't want some faceless, unelected Government panel keeping patients in Iowa or anywhere from getting the lifesaving treatment they need.  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I received from 60 patient groups, from the breast cancer advocates to muscular dystrophy, to name two, expressing concerns about using comparative effectiveness to ration care.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 January 26, 2009.     Hon. Daniel Inouye, Chairman,     Hon. Thad Cochran, Ranking Member,     Committee on Appropriations, The Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Harkin, Chairman,     Hon. Arlen Specter, Ranking Member,     Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Labor, Health          and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Inouye, Ranking Member Cochran, Chairman      Harkin and Ranking Member Specter: We are writing to urge you      to ensure that any comparative effectiveness research (CER)      included in the economic stimulus package establish a      legislative framework that is strong and patient-centered.      The goal of CER should be to arm individual patients and      their doctors with the best available information to help      assess the relative clinical outcomes of various treatment      strategies and alternatives, recognizing that this will vary      with circumstances. When used appropriately, comparative      clinical effectiveness information can serve as a valuable      tool that can contribute to improving health care delivery      and outcomes by informing clinical decision making. By      focusing on quality of patient care, such research also can      help us achieve better health care value. However, we are      very concerned that the House legislation and accompanying      report language could have unintended and negative effects      for patients, providers and medical innovators, leading to      restrictions on patients' access to treatments and      physicians' and other providers' ability to deliver care that      best meets the needs of the individual patient. Rather, we      believe any provisions related to comparative effectiveness      should:       Focus CER on comparative clinical benefit, rather than      cost-effectiveness. Any legislation should state that funding      will be used only to support clinical comparative      effectiveness research, and define clinical comparative      effectiveness as research evaluating and comparing the      clinical effectiveness of two or more medical treatments,      services, items and care processes and management.      Additionally, CER should not encourage a generalized, ``one-     size fits all'' approach. Rather, it is necessary to design      studies and communicate results in ways that reflect      variation in individual patient needs, that help patients and      doctors make informed choices, and account for differences      among patients including co-morbidities, sex, race and      ethnicity. Recognizing these differences is important to      allowing patients optimal treatment today and to encouraging      the development of innovative targeted therapies which will      advance personalized medicine.       Be conducted through an open and transparent process that      allows for patients, providers and other stakeholders to      participate equally in governance and input, starting from      the research planning stage. There are many challenges in      successfully conducting and communicating high-quality,      patient-centered CER. Therefore, comparative effectiveness      programs should include transparent decision-making      procedures and broad stakeholder representation to enhance      the credibility and usefulness of such studies.       Ensure that research supports providers in delivering the      best possible care to their patients. To maintain a focus on      patient and provider needs, the research entity should not      engage in making policy recommendations or coverage      decisions. Patients may respond differently to the same      intervention and the needs of the individual must be taken      into consideration. Imposing rigid, federally-proscribed      practice guidelines, which fail to recognize such variations,      among patients can lead to poor patient outcomes and      increased health care costs.       Comparative effectiveness information that reflects      interactions among all of the various components of the      health care system has the greatest potential to empower      clinicians and patients to make more appropriate decisions.      In addition to comparing scientific treatment interventions,      research should also focus on how innovations in care      delivery models, such as disease management programs, may      produce better health outcomes.       We look forward to working with you to create a system that      improves information about clinical outcomes, ensures that      patients continue to have access to life-saving     treatments and the tools necessary to advance a better      quality of life for all Americans.
