 President, I congratulate the Senator from California for at least moving in the right direction, recognizing that the cost of campaigns has gone up dramatically.  If the Senator from California is willing to respond to a couple questions, I do wonder, in the Senator's proposal, since the underlying bill would take away 40 percent of the budgets of the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee, and 35 percent of the budgets of the Democratic Senatorial Committee and the Republican Senatorial Committee--and I know from reading the newspaper that many Senators on your side are concerned about what this proposal is going to do to the parties, regardless of how they may be voting--I was curious why the Senator made no change at all in the amount of money an individual could give to a political party in order to try to provide some opportunity to compensate, in hard dollars, for the dramatic loss of funds that this underlying bill will provide by the elimination of soft dollars?
