Mr. Speaker, as the 104th Congress convenes today, I am pleased to introduce the Voting Rights of Homeless Citizens Act of 1995. The purpose of this legislation is to enable the homeless, who are citizens of this country, to vote. This bill would remove the legal and administrative barriers that inhibit them from exercising that right. No one should be excluded from registering to vote simply because they don't have a home. But in many States, the homeless are left out. That is not right. That is not fair. That is not the way of this country.  During this century, we have removed major obstacles that prevented many of our citizens from voting. Not too long ago, people had to pay a poll tax or own property to vote. Women and minorities were prohibited from casting the ballot.  Before the civil rights movement, there were areas in the South where 50 to 80 percent of the population was black. Yet, there was not a single registered black voter. In 1964, three young men in rural Mississippi gave their lives while working to register people to vote. Many people shedded blood and many died to secure voting rights protection for all Americans.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is very fitting to introduce this bill today because 30 years ago today, on January 4, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson proposed that we ``eliminate every remaining obstacle to the right and opportunity to vote.'' Eight months later, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law, making it possible for millions of Americans to enter the political process.  Our Nation has made progress. But we still have a long way to go to make sure that every citizen is properly represented on Capitol Hill, in the State house, on the city council and on the county commission. I have dedicated my life to ensuring that every American is treated equally and that everyone has the right to register and vote. I ask my colleagues to join me in opening the political process to every American, even those without a home. I urge my colleagues in the House to join with me in cosponsoring and supporting passage of the Voting Rights of Homeless Citizens Act of 1995.                          ____________________
