Obviously, however, Mr. Leader, as the gentleman knows, what that does is it precludes Democrats from participating in committee consideration, offering amendments in committee to the subject legislation.  My question to the gentleman is, in the event that that is done, would the gentleman bring that to the floor with an open rule that would allow amendments to be offered as Members see fit so that we could have some full consideration of that piece of legislation on the floor of the House of Representatives?  Mr. DeLAY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. As the gentleman knows, the Committee on Rules will take that up under consideration and perhaps the gentleman should contact the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) on that question as it relates to this bill. I am not advised as to what the Committee on Rules will do.
