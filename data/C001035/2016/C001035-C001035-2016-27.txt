President, today I wish to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the town of Guilford, ME. Located in the heart of the beautiful Maine Highlands on the banks of the mighty Piscataquis River, Guilford was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today.  Guilford's incorporation on February 8, 1816, was but one milestone on a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, Maine's Western Mountains were the hunting grounds of the Abenaki Tribe. The reverence the Abenaki had for the natural beauty and resources of the region is upheld by the people of Guilford today.  Early settlers at the dawn of the 19th century were drawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and fast-moving waters, which they turned into productive farms and busy mills. With the Piscataquis providing power, Guilford became one of the premier manufacturing communities in northern New England, with skilled workers producing everything from textiles and furniture to toothpicks and violin strings. The wealth produced by the land and, by hard work, innovation, and determination, was invested in schools and churches to create a true community.  Guilford is a town of patriots. Throughout the town's history, the men and women of Guilford have stepped forward to serve our Nation, and the veterans memorial stands in solemn tribute. It is significant that a highlight of this year's bicentennial celebration was the rededication of the Guilford Memorial Bridge in their honor.  Guilford is a town of involved citizens. The active historical society, volunteer fire department, and library are evidence of a strong community spirit. The planning and volunteerism that have gone into this yearlong bicentennial celebration are evidence that Guilford's spirit grows only stronger.  This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years. It is an occasion to celebrate the people who for more than two centuries have worked together and cared for one another. Thanks to those who came before, Guilford has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
