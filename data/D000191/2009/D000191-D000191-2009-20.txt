  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it's hard to reform health care. You have got to take on some of those powerful special interests in America. Perhaps that's why it's been 139 days since the Republican leadership announced they would have an alternative, but they don't have one yet.  Perhaps it's because at the heart of this is the insurance industry. Most people don't know, but the Republicans do know very well.  The health insurance industry is exempt from antitrust law. They do not have to play by the same rules as any other American business. They can and do collude to jack up rates. They can and do collude to divide markets and exclude competition.  They can do anything they want, and it's legal. They are outside the antitrust law of the United States of America. The Democratic bill will repeal this unfair antitrust exemption, bring real competition to this industry for the first time since the 1940s. The Republicans don't want to touch that with a 100-foot pole or maybe a $10,000 contribution.                          ____________________
