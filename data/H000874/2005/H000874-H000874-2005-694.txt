Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. I think her reading of the letter is an example of all that we are hearing from Americans: Congressman, this Tax Code I cannot understand. Congressman, this Tax Code costs me a lot of money and a lot of time to comply. And I want to comply and I want to be honest and help my country but, golly day, I am having trouble figuring it out. Will you please make it fair? Will you please make it simpler and just make it work better for me, for my family, and for the country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to someone who is working very hard to do just that for his constituents and all Americans, the newest member of the Committee on Ways and Means, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel), who does an extraordinary job.
