 At the end of the week, the doctors' reduction in reimbursement will go into effect. There is a way to prevent that, and that is to do a short-term extension to give us an opportunity to do what we have done in the past on these measures, and that is negotiate a settlement. That has been prevented by my good friend.  I think we have discussed this issue long enough. We have others waiting to debate the supplemental.
