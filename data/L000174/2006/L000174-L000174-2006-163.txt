President, I would like to congratulate The Hospitality and Information Service, THIS, of Washington, DC, on its 45th anniversary. Since 1961 THIS volunteers have welcomed diplomats and their families to Washington, providing friendship, assistance and an understanding of Washington and the United States.  THIS is a nonprofit organization that was established in 1961 at the suggestion of Angie Biddle, then Chief of Protocol, to help the hundreds of newly arrived diplomats and their families adjust to Washington. In 1961 there were 101 Embassies with 1,200 diplomatic families. Today embassies total more than 170 with 4,000 diplomats and families in Washington. THIS' 400 volunteers provide a variety of services and programs to help diplomats and their families learn about Washington through English and seven foreign language conversation groups and a book club. Programs include forums for discussion of issues that are world-wide in scope, such as health, human rights and education. They also conduct programs on government affairs, performing arts, architecture and American history.  THIS plays an important role in welcoming foreign diplomats to Washington and has made a difference in the lives of diplomats from many countries. As just a few have said:  ``I would like to thank THIS for the wonderful work that you do and for your warm and friendly attention.'' Miriam Barak--Israel  ``I express both my pleasure and my gratitude to the THIS organization as a whole. THIS is a wonderful vehicle by which the best of America is portrayed. Such an organization can only be an influential force for good.'' Ann Robinson--Great Britain  ``THIS is a fantastic organization. It makes me feel very welcomed and comfortable . . . THIS has given me better understanding of the U.S. life and society and also given me some new good American friends.'' Ingela Beiming--Sweden  ``THIS is a window that opens Washington for us and lets us experience and know it. It opens opportunities to meet different people.'' Marilia Bulhoes--Brazil  Congratulations to THIS and its volunteers on 45 years of service to the diplomatic community.                          ____________________
