 So I rise to express my strong opposition to three specific detention provisions in the Defense authorization bill.  There was some discussion on the Senate floor that the Intelligence Committee had reviewed these. This is not true. I would like to read a letter that I sent to the majority leader that was signed by every Democratic member of the Intelligence Committee on October 21.       We write as members of the Senate Judiciary Committee--  Because there were some Judiciary Committee members on this.     and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to express      our grave concern with subtitle D, titled Defense Matters of      title 10 of S. 1253, the National Defense Authorization Act      for Fiscal Year 2012. We support the majority of provisions      in the bill which further national security and are of great      importance. But we cannot support these controversial      detention positions.  Then we go on to say--and I will not read the whole letter. I will put the whole letter in the Record.       The executive branch must have the flexibility to consider      various options for handling terrorism cases, including the      ability to prosecute terrorists for violations of U.S. law in      Federal criminal court.       Yet, taken together, sections 1031 and 1032 of subtitle (d)      are unprecedented and require more rigorous scrutiny by      Congress. Section 1031 needs to be reviewed to consider      whether it is consistent with the September 18, 2001,      authorization for use of military force, especially because      it would authorize the indefinite detention of American      citizens without charge or trial . . .  I will stop reading here, but again, I want to emphasize this point. We are talking about the indefinite detention of American citizens without charge or trial. We have not done this at least since World War II when we incarcerated Japanese Americans. This is a very serious thing we are doing. People should understand its impact.  I want to outline the provisions in the Armed Services bill that would further militarize our counterterrorism efforts and ignore the testimony and recommendations of virtually all national security and counterterrorism officials and experts. We have heard from the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the general counsel of the Defense Department, and John Brennan, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. Every one of them opposes these provisions. They have to carry them out. They are the professionals responsible for so doing. Yet, we are going to countermand them?  The first problematic provision, section 1032, requires mandatory military custody with no consideration of the details of individual cases. The bill mandates military detention of any non-U.S. citizen who is a member of al-Qaida, or an associated force, whatever that may be, and who planned or carried out an attack, or attempted attack, on this country or abroad. Here is the problem: The Armed Services Committee ignores the administration's request to have this provision apply only to detainees captured overseas. Therefore, any noncitizen al-Qaida operative captured in the United States would be automatically turned over to military custody.  Military custody for captured terrorists may make sense in some cases, but certainly not all. Requiring it in every case could harm our Nation's ability to investigate and respond to terrorist threats and create major operational hurdles. For example, the FBI has 56 local field offices around the country. It is staffed with agents who can arrest, interrogate, and detain. The military does not. As has been the policy of Republican and Democratic Presidents before and after 9/11, the decision about where to hold a prospective terrorist should be based on the facts of each case, and should be made by national security professionals in the executive branch.  In a letter, Secretary Panetta said this week that this provision ``restrains the executive branch's options to utilize, in a swift and flexible fashion, all the counterterrorism tools that are now legally available.''  He added that the bill as written ``. . . may needlessly complicate efforts by frontline law enforcement professionals to collect critical intelligence concerning operations and activities within the United States.''  This is the man who ran the CIA and is now running the Department of Defense, and we are going to ignore him? Are we saying it doesn't make any difference what he says? I am not part of that school of thought. I think what he says does make a difference.  I ask unanimous consent to have Secretary Panetta's November 15 letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     The Secretary of Defense,                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2011.     Hon. Carl Levin,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to express the Department of      Defense's principal concerns with the latest version of      detainee-related language you are considering including in      the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year      2012. We understand the Senate Armed Services Committee is      planning to consider this language later today.       We greatly appreciate your willingness to listen to the      concerns expressed by our national security professionals on      the version of the NDAA bill reported by the Senate Armed      Services Committee in June. I am convinced we all want the      same result--flexibility for our national security      professionals in the field to detain, interrogate, and      prosecute suspected terrorists. The Department has      substantial concerns, however, about the revised text, which      my staff has just received within the last few hours.       Section 1032. We recognize your efforts to address some of      our objections to section 1032. However, it continues to be      the case that any advantages to the Department of     Defense in particular and our national security in general in      section 1032 of requiring that certain individuals be held by      the military are, at best, unclear. This provision restrains      the Executive Branch's options to utilize, in a swift and      flexible fashion, all the counterterrorism tools that are now      legally available.       Moreover, the failure of the revised text to clarify that      section 1032 applies to individuals captured abroad, as we      have urged, may needlessly complicate efforts by frontline      law enforcement professionals to collect critical      intelligence concerning operations and activities within the      United States.       Next, the revised language adds a new qualifier to      ``associated force''--that acts in coordination with or      pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda.'' In our view, this      new language unnecessarily complicates our ability to      interpret and implement this section.       Further, the new version of section 1032 makes it more      apparent that there is an intent to extend the certification      requirements of section 1033 to those covered by section 1032      that we may want to transfer to a third country. In other      words, the certification requirement that currently applies      only to Guantanamo detainees would permanently extend to a      whole new category of future captures. This imposes a whole      new restraint on the flexibility we need to continue to      pursue our counterterrorism efforts.       Section 1033. We are troubled that section 1033 remains      essentially unchanged from the prior draft, and that none of      the Administration's concerns or suggestions for this      provision have been adopted. We appreciate that revised      section 1033 removes language that would have made these      restrictions permanent, and instead extended them through      Fiscal Year 2012 only. As a practical matter, however,      limiting the duration of the restrictions to the next fiscal      year only will have little impact if Congress simply      continues to insert these restrictions into legislation on an      annual basis without ever revisiting the substance of the      legislation. As national security officials in this      Department and elsewhere have explained, transfer      restrictions such as those outlined in section 1033 are      largely unworkable and pose unnecessary obstacles to      transfers that would advance our national security interests.       Section 1035. Finally, section 1035 shifts to the      Department of Defense responsibility for what has previously      been a consensus-driven interagency process that was informed      by the advice and views of counterterrorism professionals      from across the Government. We see no compelling reason--and      certainly none has been expressed in our discussions to      date--to upset a collaborative, interagency approach that has      served our national security so well over the past few years.       I hope we can reach agreement on these important national      security issues, and, as always, my staff is available to      work with the Committee on these and other matters.           Sincerely,                                                  Leon E. Panetta.
