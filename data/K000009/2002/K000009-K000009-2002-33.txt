Speaker, I rise along with my dear colleagues, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson), the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones), to pay lasting and precious tribute to our colleague and dear friend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall).  Without question, this is a gentleman of the House. I think his appointment to the Committee on Rules and to that particular position which governs our deliberations as a body is a testament to the talent that he brought to our institution and the manner in which he has executed it and risen in the esteem and effectiveness as a Member of Congress.  He has served honorably through the quarter century that he has given to the Congress and the people from his home district in the Greater Dayton, Ohio area.  At every fork in the road, he has elevated this institution as a person and also as a political figure. So rarely do those that really do good get their day in the sun. The newspapers tend to cover those who may have strayed from the straight and narrow, and it is particularly a pleasure today as an Ohioan to say that this man deserves our attention and appreciation.  I have watched the gentleman change over the years. Not that the goodness and the caring was not always there, but I have watched a depth of concern grow for the suffering of the world, in forgotten places, whether it is in our country or on another continent far from places where most Americans will ever travel. He has confronted the face of suffering. He has held dying children in his arms, and he has not walked away from that horrible, horrible thought of the fragility of life and what he as a person can actually do about it.  I have seen other concerns become less important. Some, in fact, of the unimportant moments that consume so many of the hours here sometimes in a day, the procedural motions and all of the paraphernalia that goes with holding together a large country like ours and its governing institutions, but for Tony, the depth, the passion that has grown because of what he has seen globally has transformed him and helped transform us through association with him to a greater understanding of our needs as a people; and, indeed, the people of the world.  As I watched Tony with some of his friends, Mickey Leland and Bill Emerson, also distinguished Members for so many years, I watched them travel together and bring back to us knowledge that we did not have. Through those efforts to change the way in which America feeds the world, to change the way in which we look at hunger, to create the Congressional Hunger Center here, to bring the young people of America to the Nation's capital and to get them engaged in one of the most perplexing and searing experiences one can have, and that is to meet people who do not even have enough food to survive for one day.  We see in Afghanistan and other places people eating dirt to stay alive, and it is difficult to imagine that any one of us in our own lives would ever confront that and actually take on a position where that becomes the norm. Yet to fly in the face of that and to keep walking is what the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) means to me.  I have seen the photos of his trips to Africa and North Korea; and I have also been with him in Dayton, Ohio, going through empty food pantries, trying to work with farmers that he tried to get to donate apples, and to bring those into these feeding centers, to try to find excess food that would be available in that metropolitan area and to make it available to the poor in his region and our State. He has been unrelenting in his commitment.  I think that the President has made an extraordinary appointment in nominating the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) as our ambassador to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. He will do a stellar job.  I know that every single person whose life he touches and what he brings back to us and what he can tell us about how to be better citizens of our country and the world is something that he alone can do and will do for us. We will again be the better for that service.  I will say to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) that I will miss him very much. As an Ohio Member, I have truly enjoyed serving with him, getting to know him and Janet, his family, the kindness and the gentlemanly behavior you have always demonstrated toward me, and I know is the same with every other Member in this Chamber. God bless you and keep you safe and healthy in your travels. It has been my honor to serve with you, Tony. Come back often. You are a great American. Some day that Nobel Prize, I hope, will find its way into your home.                          ____________________
