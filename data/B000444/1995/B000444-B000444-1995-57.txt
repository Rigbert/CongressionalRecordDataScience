 President, I rise today to express my deep sorrow, my shock, and my anger over the cowardly assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.  Yitzhak Rabin will be remembered as a man of extraordinary courage and unusual vision who lived in a time when both of these traits were scarce.  I first met Yitzhak Rabin when I called on Prime Minister Golda Meir during my first visit to Israel in 1973. As two individuals who shared a commitment to Israel's well-being, our paths crossed on numerous occasions over the course of the next 23 years. I saw him for the last time in October when he came to Washington to commemorate the 3,000th anniversary of King David's entry into Jerusalem.  Yitzhak Rabin was a man who did not mince words--a quality which earned him the respect and trust of a country which has a reputation for toughness. To anyone who encountered him, it was immediately evident that his overriding concern was for the security of his fellow countrymen.  He was born into the small community of Jews in Palestine, which later formed the core of the nascent State of Israel. He went on to play a key role in the war of independence; commanded the army that unified the city of his birth; served in key Government posts; and, in perhaps his finest hour, he drew upon the lessons of half a century of defending his people to pursue the path of peace which promises to secure the future of the nation he helped create.  Yitzhak Rabin's ability to distill the fundamental choices facing his nation was a quality born of his unique experience as a soldier and a statesman. He articulated in stark terms the reasons why Israel's long-term security hinged on the success of the peace process. He viewed the status quo as unacceptable, because it meant continued violence into the indefinite future and possibly the eventual loss of Israel's Jewish character. He saw that possibility clearly and he believed Israel had to reject it in favor of a path of enlightened self-interest--pursuing an agreement on the basis of land for peace, preserving Israel's Jewish character, achieving normalcy with long-hostile neighbors, and securing Israel's long-term survivability.  Mr. President, many are now suggesting that this terrible assassination was the isolated act of a madman. I wish it were true. But I think that all of us know better.  This act was not perpetrated in a vacuum. It occurred against a backdrop in which a culture of hate and violence was being promoted actively by people who should have known better and behaved more responsibly. The extreme rhetoric was not confined to Israel. Unfortunately, some in this country added their voices to the alarmist cries.  There is a lesson in this for all of us. For while words alone do not kill, they can encourage others to do so. Those who employed hyperbolic rhetoric for the sake of political gain must bear some measure of responsibility for creating a climate in which a cold-blooded assassination could be contemplated as a patriotic and pious act.  I hope that those who irresponsibly stoke the fires of hatred will use this slaying of a great man to look deeply within themselves and change their ways.  Mr. President, this is in many ways Israel's most difficult and emotionally wrenching hour since here creation 47 years ago, because the assassin's bullet was aimed not only at Yitzhak Rabin but also directly at the very heart of the democratic process in Israel. It is a commitment to democracy that has distinguished the Israeli nation from its neighbors in the Middle East and has been the enduring foundation of the long, traditional friendship between Israel and the United States.  As one of the founders and defenders of the independent State of Israel, as its Prime Minister, and most of all as a devotee of democracy, Yitzhak Rabin personified the process that made possible the progress toward peace in the Middle East. He also understood how violence could threaten both the process and the peace--just moments before he was shot he spoke against violence, which he said had recently taken, in his words, ``* * * A shape which damages the framework of fundamental values of Israeli democracy.''  It was that framework of democratic values the assassin was out to destroy--and it is designs of just such antidemocratic violence which Israel and the friends of Israel must deny in memory of Yitzhak Rabin.  I believe that we have already begun to erect that memorial. I believe that this assassination, as deeply as it has shaken us personally, will serve to reinforce the bonds of friendship between Israel and the United States. I believe that we will summon the resolve to successfully complete the unfinished journey on the path of peace embarked upon by Yitzhak Rabin. I believe that his last and greatest gift to his people, to all the peoples of the Middle East, and to the entire world will come to pass, and he will not have died in vain.  And I will remember him as a friend, as a great soldier and statesman--and not as a man who lost his life to violence, but as a man of peace who renewed the life of his Nation.                          ____________________
