President, there has been a great misunderstanding around here as to how we came up with offsets, how we are going to take care of paying for an additional amount of money in this package.  I compliment the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, along with the ranking minority member of the committee, Senator Baucus, for the hard work they have put in on this legislation and, quite frankly, disagree with the criticism to which they have been subjected.  I want to reemphasize, if I could, that it is important we get this legislation done. I am very pleased we have two more amendments that are down here. The deadline for the filing of amendments is now over as of right now. We do have several amendments. We are going to invite these people to bring their amendments down. I am pleased there are two amendments that are already down here. We look forward to taking up those amendments.  I yield the floor.
