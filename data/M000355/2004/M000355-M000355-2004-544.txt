 As the Senator indicated, in school that is what tort law was about. If one was not negligent, if they did not cause the harm, they should not be held liable. We have gotten away from that in this country. It is a very dangerous trend. It is time for the Congress of the United States to begin to redress this imbalance. I thank my friend from Alabama.  Mr. President, on the matter before us upon which we will be voting cloture on the motion to proceed tomorrow, the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Protection Act introduced by Senator Gregg and Senator Ensign, this is our third attempt this Congress and our second attempt in 6 weeks to try to do something about the medical liability crisis that is forcing patients all across the country to go without critically important medical services. On both previous occasions, a majority of the Senate has voted to try to solve this problem.  Unfortunately, though, only one brave soul on the other side of the aisle voted to support even taking up such a measure.  But hope springs eternal and maybe the third time is a charm. So we come back to the Senate to try once again to give our colleagues on the other side of the aisle a chance to join us in implementing real reforms for a problem that is all too real for many of our fellow citizens.  As we did the last two times, we brought reform legislation to the floor. We are offering the American people a proven remedy--not a placebo. The bill we hope our colleagues will let us consider, like its two predecessors, is based upon California's successful MICRA reforms. The Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act would allow plaintiffs to recover unlimited economic damages--up to a quarter of a million dollars in noneconomic damages and punitive damages up to the greater of a quarter million dollars or twice the economic damages.  We recognize the reluctance of some of our colleagues to implement MICRA's reform on a nationwide scale, proven though these reforms are. So rather than propose the comprehensive reform we tried to advance last year for all medical practitioners, we are attempting a modest first step. The provisions in S. 2207 would apply only to two of the medical specialties that are suffering the most in this crisis: OB/GYNs and emergency care services. That is all this bill would touch.  Though extremely modest in scope, this bill is crucial to protecting the doctors who practice in these two areas and the millions of American patients who rely on them. For example, OB/GYNs provide some of the most critical medical services. Sadly, they also bear the highest premiums. As a result, women and children across our country are placed in danger as they struggle oftentimes unsuccessfully to find even basic obstetrics care.  In addition, emergency room doctors are the primary care physicians for many Americans. According to the Alliance of Specialty Medicine, each year there are 110 million visits to emergency departments. More than 90 percent of these visits are patients who need to be seen in 2 hours or less. And approximately 28.3 million Americans visit the emergency room each year due to an accident or unintentional injury. Ninety-nine percent of those patients will recover after receiving lifesaving care from an ER or trauma center.  Thus, when ER doctors and trauma care physicians curtail their practices or go out of business altogether because of the medical liability crisis, the people who suffer the most obviously are the American families.  Let us turn to the crisis in Kentucky. This chart illustrates Kentucky's crisis in obstetric services.  Sixty percent of Kentucky's counties are without OB/GYNs.  This chart takes a look at the counties. The red counties, which the occupant of the Chair and our colleagues can see, are many counties. Sixty-nine of one hundred twenty counties in Kentucky have no OB/GYN.  In addition to that, the next chart illustrates the availability of emergency services in Kentucky. 43 percent of Kentucky's counties are without emergency room physicians. That is 52 of the 120 counties.  All of the red counties all across the Commonwealth of Kentucky have no ER doctor at all--none.  Another 21 percent of Kentucky counties have only one specialist in emergency medicine for the entire county.  So you can see in our State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, there is a serious crisis--an absence of OB/GYN care and an absence of emergency room doctors. A principal reason for that, not surprisingly, is the medical malpractice crisis that we have in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  This is a serious problem. We have county after county in crisis. Just to give you an example, Perry County in southeastern Kentucky technically has a practicing OB/GYN. But that one doctor stopped delivering babies during the last year. If you are in Perry County, it doesn't do you much good. They have an OB/GYN but she does not deliver babies.  Eighty-two of Kentucky's one hundred twenty counties don't have either an obstetrician or have one obstetrician.  This is a serious problem in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Six weeks ago, when we were asking our colleagues to consider the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act--S. 2061-- I discussed the crisis in obstetric and gynecological services in my home State of Kentucky.  Kentucky does not have liability reform. Not surprisingly, liability insurance rates for OB's in Kentucky, for example, increased 64 percent in just 1 year, from 2002 to 2003. Also not surprisingly, in just the last 3 years, Kentucky has lost one-fourth of its obstetricians. Moreover, Kentucky has lost nearly half its potential obstetric services during this time, when one factors in doctors who have limited their practices.  According to the Kentucky Medical Association, 60 percent of the counties in Kentucky do not have any OB-GYNs.  Other counties, such as Perry County in southeastern Kentucky, technically have a practicing OB-GYN, but that one doctor has stopped delivering babies within the last year. So if you are in Perry County, that doesn't do you much good.  Another 8 counties--like Greenup, Lawrence, and Johnson Counties in northeast Kentucky--have just one OB-GYN in each county.  So if you are a woman in these counties, you had better hope that there isn't another woman having a baby at the same time you are, or that the doctor is not out of town or busy with another patient. If that happens, then you are going to have to drive through the hills on the back roads of eastern Kentucky to try to find a doctor to deliver your baby.  All told, 82 of Kentucky's 120 counties have no OB's or have just one OB.  Now, you may be thinking that, although this is far from ideal, couldn't the women in these situations simply go to the emergency room and have an ER doctor deliver their baby? Maybe in the old days women could do this, but they can't do this anymore.  Another casualty in the medical liability crisis has been in the provision of emergency medical services. According to the Kentucky Medical Association, medical liability premiums for ER physicians increased, on average, an astounding 204% from 2001 to 2002!  The situation of Dr. David Stanforth is illustrative. He is a partner in an emergency medicine group serving three hospitals in Northern Kentucky. Dr. Stanforth had his malpractice insurance cancelled 3 years ago and then switched insurance policies to obtain coverage. His premiums have since tripled to $800,000 per year, even though there wasn't a malpractice award against his ER group during that period.  The result of situations like Dr. Stanforth's are all-too-predictable.  According to the Kentucky Department of Public Health, 43% of Kentucky counties do not have any doctors specializing in emergency medicine. Another 21% of Kentucky counties have only one emergency room physician. All told, then, 64% of Kentucky counties do not have any ER doctors or have only one ER doctor for the entire county.  To come back to the crisis in obstetric services that I was discussing, if you are a woman in eastern Kentucky who is delivering a baby, not only are you not going to be able to find an O.B. to delivery your baby. You are not going to be able to find an ER doctor to help you either. Instead, you are going to have to drive until you find some doctor--any doctor--if you're lucky, to help with your delivery.  Unfortunately, too many women are not so lucky. They end up delivering their babies in the backseat of a car or on the side of the road.  This situation cannot continue. I applaud Senators Gregg and Ensign for their determination to do something about this crisis. I hope my colleagues on the other side will let us try to solve this problem with meaningful reform and will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed.  I thank the Chair.  I will conclude by saying the principal reason for the crisis is the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance, and the inability of these physicians, dedicated though they may be to public health and serving people in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, who simply can't afford to stay in business. They cannot make a living doing what they went to medical school to do and what they want to do with their lives, which is to take care of women and babies and to save people in the emergency rooms of the Commonwealth.  We will have an opportunity tomorrow, once again--as I said earlier, hopefully a third time will be a charm--to take the simple step of going to the bill and giving us an opportunity in the Senate of addressing what is indeed a national medical crisis.                          ____________________
