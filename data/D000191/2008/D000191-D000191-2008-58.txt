And then there's the speculators.  Today, the largest holder of oil resources in the United States of America is not ExxonMobil, not Shell, not Conoco, name all of our oil companies. No, it's Morgan Stanley on Wall Street, through their speculative activity, followed by Goldman Sachs and followed by others who are speculating and driving up the price of this market.  We have credible testimony from Wall Street experts, if we reined in the speculation which was created by the Enron loophole--remember Enron? Texas corporation, Ken Boy Lay, the President's best friend. He's dead. Enron's bankrupt. He would have gone to jail for fraud. But the loophole lives on, and we're all paying at the pump. An estimated 50 percent, according to Wall Street experts, is going into speculative activities, but they don't want to take on speculative activities. They just want to talk about one thing, and that is, they want to drill in ANWR.  Well, guess what, ANWR was made a national wildlife refuge in 1950. The Naval Petroleum Reserve was made a petroleum reserve by Warren Harding. Now, why was this a natural preserve and this an oil preserve? Because they know there's more than 10 billion barrels of oil under here. Republicans change it from a naval reserve to a national reserve, and Bill Clinton actually leased it. And yesterday, George Bush announced he's going to lease more of it.  There's 10 billion barrels of oil under this. That's our Saudi Arabia. They've drilled 25 wells, but they haven't tried to connect to the Alaska pipeline. They've capped the wells and they're sitting on them. And why are they sitting on them? Because they think if they keep manipulating the market they can make as much money as possible today and even more down the road. They are sitting on supplies of oil, and they are failing to develop what they could.
