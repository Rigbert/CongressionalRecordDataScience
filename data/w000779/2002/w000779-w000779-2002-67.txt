President, I wish to discuss with the distinguished leader from Nevada and the chairman of the committee and the distinguished minority member the amendment I have with Senator Smith.  This is an extremely important amendment. We have been trying to work out the details with respect to the majority and minority. I want to make sure that our right to offer that amendment is protected.  It is not clear to me, with respect to the unanimous consent request posed by the distinguished Senator from Nevada, that our right to offer the Wyden-Smith amendment, which is of enormous importance to the State of Oregon, would be protected. If I could yield to the distinguished chairman and ranking member so this point could be clarified, I am speaking on behalf of both myself and the Senator from Oregon.
