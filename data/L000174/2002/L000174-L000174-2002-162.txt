I want to take this opportunity to say a few words about the importance of section 2015. A primary reason for the creation of the ICC is to remove the uncertainty and protracted negotiations surrounding the establishment of ad hoc tribunals to try those accused of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. In the future, the ICC may be the only venue for bringing to justice those accused of these heinous crimes.  The Dodd-Warner amendment simply ensures that the United States can assist the ICC, or other international efforts, to try foreign nationals accused of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. It is not difficult to think of a number of instances when it would be in the interest of the United States to support such efforts. For example:  What if 50 Americans, traveling overseas, are brutally killed by a suicide bomber and the ICC attempts to bring to justice the perpetrators of this horrendous act?  What if a group of terrorists commits war crimes against U.S. military personnel who are posted abroad and the ICC is involved with efforts to bring them to justice?  What if the ICC prosecutes some future Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic, or Osama bin Laden who is responsible for the deaths of thousands of people?  Would we want the President of the United States to be hamstrung by ASPA in these, or a number of other cases, and prevented from actively supporting efforts by the ICC to bringthese types of notorious criminals to justice? Of course not.  Finally, I want to point out that Mr. Hyde also goes to great lengths to provide an interpretation of sections 2004, 2006, and 2011. Although I was not involved with the negotiations on ASPA with the Administration, I must say that the State Department's efforts with the House on this issue were miserable, and I know this is not typical of the way the Department represents U.S. interests abroad.  The explanation that the State Department offers for supporting ASPA is that it did so in exchange for releasing the U.N. dues. This does not withstand the most basic scrutiny.  In the wake of the September 11 attacks, there was overwhelming support in Congress to assist with efforts to prevent and respond to international terrorism. After September 11, without any quid-pro-quo, the Senate voted to confirm Ambassador John Negroponte to the position of U.S. representative to the United Nations. I am confident that the State Department, with a little ingenuity, could have persuaded the Republican majority in the House to meet our obligations to the United Nations--something that is clearly in our national security interests--without having to agree to support ASPA.  In any event, I take issue with Mr. Hyde's interpretation of sections 2004, 2006, and 2011, even though they are heavily qualified by the Dodd-Warner amendment. Again, one should look to legislative history only if the text of the provision is unclear, and in this case the text of ASPA is clear and does not support his reading. For example, there is nothing in the waiver language concerning the President's executive authority or authority as Commander-in-Chief that limits the waiver to a subset of this authority. Moreover, ASPA clearly states that the waiver applies to ``any action or actions . . .'' not to ``some'' actions.  For Mr. Hyde's interpretation to be correct it would be necessary to add language to the provision such as: ``if it would be unconstitutional for Congress to restrict the exercise of this authority.'' Moreover, ASPA states that it applies to ``any action'' taken by the President as Commander-in-Chief or exercising ``the executive power'' of the Presidency. If the President has the constitutional authority to take an action, this provision permits him to do so, notwithstanding any other language in the bill. It is not relevant whether Congress could have prohibited such actions.  Further, no matter what was said between those who negotiated ASPA, Mr. Hyde's interpretation of the provision was not necessarily in the minds of the majority of Members voting on ASPA because it simply was not mentioned during the House or Senate debates. These waiver provisions complement section 2015 which is highly relevant in interpreting them, as Senator Warner alluded to during the Senate debate. Congress decided that it did not want to tie the President's hands if he determined that it makes sense for the United States to cooperate with any international body, including the ICC, in prosecuting foreign nationals accused of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.  I want to thank Senators Dodd and Warner for their efforts to ensure that ASPA does not include overly-burdensome restrictions on the President that prevent the U.S. from cooperating with the ICC. I also want to thank Senator Dodd's staff for providing valuable advice on this issue.                          ____________________
