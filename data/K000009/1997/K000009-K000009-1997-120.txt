Speaker I rise in support of the motion of disapproval and ask the question: Why renew the terms of an abnormal relationship that is not working? Have freedom and liberty of the Chinese people expanded? No. Repression has increased. Has the United States earned income from this trade deal? No. Our trade deficits with China have exploded, as we watch China spend their dollar reserves to arm themselves militarily while they keep their tariffs against our goods at 40 percent, and give us no reciprocity in their market. For America, freedom should mean more than selling fertilizer.  John F. Kennedy inspired the world when he said that human progress is more than a doctrine about economic advance. Rather, it is an expression of the noblest goals of our society. It says that material advance is meaningless without individual liberty and freedom.  Exercising economic sanctions against South Africa's repressive regime resulted in an advance of freedom. But in our Chinese engagement, America's efforts have resulted in creating more powerful oligarchs that feast off our misdirected trade policies.  Upend this abnormal trade relationship, support the motion to disapprove.
