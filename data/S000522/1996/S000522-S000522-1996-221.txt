Mr. Speaker, I recently had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Louis Pulcrano, coach of a unique group of students from Monmouth and Ocean Counties, NJ. These outstanding young women are members of ShoreCheer International, dedicated to excellence in cheerleading and service to their communities.  Not only have these athletes earned prestige for themselves in national and international cheerleading competitions, the young women have demonstrated great virtue and devotion in caring for those in need around them.  I was particularly moved by a special visit the young women of ShoreCheer made recently to Montoursville, PA, in a effort to help comfort those mourning the loss of family and friends who perished in the TWA Flight #800 tragedy. The cheerleaders spent time with their peers at the Montoursville High School and delivered messages of support and love. Once again, in a moment of sadness and need, these young women offered their time and energy to brighten the lives of others.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully submit for the Record, an article written by the girls' coach, which outlines their numerous achievements and contributions to the community. I would first like to include a list of the names of the young women of ShoreCheer, so that we can all applaud their notable athletic distinction and, most importantly, the great kindness they show to others--something that impacts us all.       Senior All-Stars: Beth Allen; Wendy Dailey, Traci Mayer,      Jill Balinski, Beth Hager, Heidi Farnham, Shannon O'Malley,      Lauren Petty, Suzanne Heyniger, Kelly MacDonald, Melissa      Lennon, Erin Lacey, Kristi Pilgrim, Brittany Larkin.       Junior Prep All-Stars: Laura Stogdill, Jenifer Vienna,      Lauren Rogers, Anna Norcia, Danielle Berkely, Kristine      Triola, Charolette Yorgenger, Nicole Gashlin, Kyle Allen,      Rachelle Rose, Meghan Ward.       Junior All-Stars: Krystle Berryman, Jenny Biancella, Julie      Biancella, Caitlin Bilotta, Gina Cifelli, Brianna Dwyer,      Amanda Foderaro, Megan Jakubowski, Lauren Krueger, Tara      Luchetti, Nicole Masiero, Kristen McCormick, Lauren      McCrossan, Melissa Millen, Krissie Previte, Amber Tempsick,      Lauren McCormick.                                  ____                                         With so much negative publicity directed toward today's      youth, we in New Jersey take great pride in a very special      group of young athletes, who have emerged, not only leading      their State, but leading their Nation as well in the      promotion of pride, honor, and dignity.       They have been called, ``A fine example of what the youth      of America can accomplish'' by President of the United      States, Bill Clinton, as during the past 7 years of their      existence, ShoreCheer International, a cheerleading,      educational, and community service program for youth of all      ages, has won 125 trophies on the local, State, national and      international levels and over 100 honors and recognitions all      on the national and international levels for their community      service and caring for others in need.       These very special young adults have accumulated some very      special achievements over the past 7 years. They have coached      one of our Nation's few cheerleading squads made up of      handicapped children and successfully trained and entered      them in major cheerleading competitions in 1993, 1994, and      1995. A music video was made of these dedicated young ladies      working with these special children and it ended up being      used as a training tape for Special Olympics in China. In      1994, the group produced a second music video promoting the      ``Cheerleaders Fighting Cancer'' program, challenging every      cheerleading squad in America to donate 5 percent of all      money raised to help put an end to the disease of cancer.      That same year, they were selected and honored for the second      time by the President of the United States for winning the      1994 CANAM International Sportsmanship Award, presented to      just one out of 60,000 cheerleading squads in North America.       They were 1995 International Championship trophy winners in      Myrtle Beach, SC, where, after saving up for this trip for a      year, gave up their only day of sun and fun on the beach,      visiting and paying tribute to the local police, visited a      nursing home where they delivered homemade cookies and      ended their day visiting a hospital, delivering personal      get-well messages to every patient in the hospital and      stuffed animals to every child there as well.       In 1992, they were selected as one of just two high school      youth groups out of over 400 high schools in their State to      speak and perform at the Governor's Summit on Drug and      Alcohol Abuse and have lectured numerous other young adults      on the dangers of drug, tobacco, and alcohol abuse and the      importance of practicing proper values.       Members of ShoreCheer were selected by the motion picture      industry to coach movie star Chirstina Ricci, star of      ``Casper,'' ``The Addams Family,'' ``Mermaids,'' ``Then and      Now'' for her next motion picture, ``Last of the High      Kings.'' ShoreCheer Senior All-Star Lauren Petty was selected      and featured on the front cover of American Cheerleader      Magazine as ``National Cheerleader of the Month'' for      February 1996. This year, and for the third year in a row,      ShoreCheer will be representing cheerleaders from across the      Nation as they have been selected and will perform in the      Miss America Pageant Parade in Atlantic City.       Program cheerleaders have raised and donated funds to Hale      House in New York City for babies born addicted to alcohol      and drugs, to the Make-A-Wish Program, to the New Jersey Food      Bank, the Red Cross, and Cheerleaders Fighting Cancer. They      have twice performed half-time shows for the NBA New Jersey      Nets.       The program received its spots highest honor when it was      selected and won the 1995 National Outstanding Cheerleading      Program of the Year Award for 1995-96. And most recently, 21      ShoreCheer International cheerleaders made a 500 mile, 10      hour round-trip to Montoursville, PA, on a mission of love      and caring and to help in the healing process in a      community which lost 21 of its members, including 16 high      school students, in the TWA Flight 800 tragedy. The      ShoreCheer girls met with the Montoursville High School      Cheerleading Squad and presented them with six large      megaphones containing close to 1,000 signatures and      messages of support from cheerleaders all over the      Northeast United States, a red rose for each family of the      victims and had a star officially named ``LoveCheer 800''      in honor of those lost in the TWA tragedy. It was the      words spoken by ShoreCheer cheerleader Lauren Petty which      bonded the two groups together in a very special      friendship as Lauren spoke these words of the twenty one      victims:       ``By reaching out with our hearts, no distance is too great      to conquer and it is the love in our hearts that has brought      us here today. And as the fingers of their love and the      fingers of our love reach out and touch each other here      today, we have bonded with them in eternal friendship--21 new      friends who will be with us in mind and heart always.''       The six megaphones will be placed on the Montoursville      Athletic Field where two of the victims who were cheerleaders      would normally cheer during the football season.       To date, ShoreCheer International Cheerleaders have      performed live in front of over 2 million spectators from      every State in the Nation and their dedication to dignity,      honor, respect, pride, community, and those in need has won      them recognition on four continents. This very special      program and its very special young athletes can best be      described by the words of the Governor of Alaska, Walter J.      Hickel, ``All of America is proud of you!''                          ____________________
