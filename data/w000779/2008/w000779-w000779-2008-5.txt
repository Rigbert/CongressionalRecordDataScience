President, I wish to recognize a great Oregonian, Nancy Neighbor Russell. Not long ago, Nancy woke up and demanded that her family take her to see the Columbia River Gorge. It was not an unusual request because Nancy has been a tireless and fearless defender of the gorge for more than a quarter century. The scenic beauty of the gorge was her passion and protecting it was her crusade.  What made this trip different was that Nancy suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, often referred toas ``Lou Gehrig's disease.'' Taking her to visit the place she loved most would not be easy. Her family hired an ambulance, placed Nancy in the back, and drove east from her home in Portland. Once there, Nancy saw her beloved gorge for the last time. On September 19, 2008, Nancy Neighbor Russell passed away.  While she is gone, her legacy is not. No individual has had the lasting and profound impact on a Pacific Northwest's landscape as Nancy Russell has had on the Columbia River Gorge. In my hometown newspaper, The Oregonian reporter Katy Muldoon described her this way: ``a lion in conservation circles, a fearless but graceful negotiator, a dogged fundraiser, a mentor to young leaders and an inspiration to anyone who had the pleasure of hiking or hunting wildflowers with her on the grassy slopes above the Columbia River.''  Anyone who has seen the Columbia River Gorge know that its steep cliffs, dramatic rock formations, and graceful waterfalls makes it one of the most beautiful places on Earth. It is the crown jewel of a Pacific Northwest landscape filled with a treasure trove of natural beauty. But it took someone like Nancy Russell to recognize that the gorge's beauty, drama, and gracefulness needed to be protected. She would devote the rest of her life to making sure it was.  In the early 1980s, she founded the Friends of the Columbia Gorge and began an unprecedented effort that in 1986 resulted in passage of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act. As Congressman of the Third Congressional District at the time, I was proud to stand with friends and allies to vote for this historic legislation. That act preserved the gorge while protecting the valuable orchards and agriculture lands and acting as a catalyst to the tourism and recreational values so important to the communities along the Columbia.  But Nancy didn't stop there. She continued to push the Federal Government to purchase important pieces of property from willing sellers so that stunning views of the gorge would remain open to the public. She personally purchased more than 30 properties and donated them to the public so hikers could enjoy them for generations to come.  Today, the Columbia Gorge faces issues that Nancy would have never contemplated three decades ago. Fortunately, Nancy Russell leaves behind what may be her greatest accomplishment--an organization with members who are inspired by her vision and determined to follow in her footsteps. The gorge may have lost an ardent supporter, but it has not lost support. I am confident that Nancy's children and grandchildren, her countless friends, and Oregon's and Washington's leaders on both sides of the aisle will honor her by continuing to protect this great legacy.  On those times when I return to Oregon and my flight takes me over the Columbia River Gorge, I will think of Nancy Russell and her last visit there. Knowing what I do about Nancy and all that she did for that beautiful area, it will be hard to think of anything else. I pay tribute to her life well-lived today and thank her and her family for all of her many, lasting accomplishments.                          ____________________
