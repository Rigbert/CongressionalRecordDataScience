Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 292) to amend title 4, United States Code, to add National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day to the list of days on which the flag should especially be displayed.  The Clerk read as follows:                                H.R. 292       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.        This Act may be cited as the ``Korean War Veterans      Recognition Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. DISPLAY OF FLAG ON NATIONAL KOREAN WAR VETERANS                    ARMISTICE DAY.        Section 6(d) of title 4, United States Code, is amended by      inserting ``National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, July      27;'' after ``July 4;''.
