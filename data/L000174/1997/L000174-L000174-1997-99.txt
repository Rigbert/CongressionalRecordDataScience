 Mr. President, there are serious issues here. One, of course, is about pretending a landmine is something else, in a last-minute attempt to avoid being embarrassed by being left out of an international treaty that the United States called for a year ago. It is embarrassing. We urged other nations to negotiate a treaty, and when they did we stayed out of the negotiations untilthe last minute and then we said we would not sign it.  But another serious question is what to do with certain types of antitank mines that the United States has in its arsenal and that are packaged with antipersonnel mines.  I fully understand how important the Pentagon considers these weapons to our defense. I have spoken with people in the Pentagon about this. I do not intend to minimize this problem. What I am saying, though, is face the problem, be straight about it, do not play word games.  Because it is just as important that the United States support a landmine ban. If we are not going to be among the 100 nations that sign the treaty in Ottawa this December--and I understand that is the President's decision--then we need to find a way to remove the obstacles that keep us from signing, because I the United States needs to be part of this treaty. If that means redesigning our antitank mines, then that is what we ought to do.  We need to sign the treaty as soon as possible, because as remarkable an accomplishment as it is, without the United States it is never going to achieve the international ban that everyone, including the President, wants. No country has the ability that the United States has to broaden support for the treaty and obtain adherence to it. Nobody can exert the leadership that the world's only superpower can exert. The American people do not want the United States to use a weapon that does not belong in the arsenal of civilized nations. They do not want the United States to be standing in the way of a treaty that will set a new moral standard for the next century. As the most powerful Nation, it is time to put an end to the doublespeak and the excuses and get busy solving the problem.  Mr. President, I said when I spoke in Oslo to the representatives of nations and organizations that were meeting there, I dream of a century, a new century, when armies of humanity dig up, disarm, and destroy landmines and nobody--nobody--puts new landmines down. Think what a century that would be for the children and the children of the children in those countries.  Think what that would mean to the United States when it sends peacekeepers around the world, when it sends humanitarian workers, missionaries, doctors, whatever. Think what it would mean if they did not have to face the constant threat of landmines.  Think what it would mean if we could go into countries that today have to spend their scarce resources to import food because their people cannot go into their fields to plant or to harvest, fields that are death traps because of landmines. There might be only one landmine in a field, but if you do not know where that landmine is, there may as well be a hundred.  Think what it would mean if we could go to countries ravaged by civil war and now reaching toward democracy, to help them rebuild the infrastructure they need and not have to spend money on removing landmines, expending $100 to $1,000 to remove a $3 or $5 landmine.  Think how wonderful it would be if our country did not have to fund, every year now to the tune of $5 million, the Leahy War Victims Fund which pays for artificial limbs--something that is supported, I say with gratitude, by every Member of this Senate, Republican and Democrat. But think if we did not have to do that. Think if we would not have to see children learning to walk on crude prosthetics. Think what a different world it would be.  We have worked to ban nuclear testing. We have worked to ban chemical weapons. Far more civilians have died and been injured and maimed by landmines than by nuclear weapons or chemical weapons.  We can find a way to protect the legitimate defense needs of the United States and to maintain our legitimate obligations around the world whether on the Korean Peninsula or anywhere else. We can do that and still be part of the remarkable global effort to ban landmines.  Mr. President, I have been in many countries where I have gotten out of a car and been told where I should walk, to be careful, that I should step only here, not a foot away. I remember in one country I was about to step off the road and somebody grabbed my arm and yanked me back because there were landmines there.  These are things I remember, and they are a daily terror for people who live there.  Mr. President, let us join together to bring that to an end.                               Exhibit 1               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 24, 1997]           Clinton Directive on Mines: New Form, Old Function                            (By Dana Priest)       When is an antipersonnel land mine--a fist-sized object      designed to blow up a human being--no longer an antipersonnel      land mine?       When the president of the United States says so.       In announcing last week that the United States would not      sign an international treaty to ban antipersonnel land mines,      President Clinton also said he had ordered the Pentagon to      find technological alternatives to these mines. ``This      program,'' he said, ``will eliminate all antipersonnel land      mines from America's arsenal.''       Technically speaking, the president's statement was not      quite accurate.       His directive left untouched the millions of little devices      the Army and Defense Department for years have been calling      antipersonnel land mines. These mines are used to protect      antitank mines, which are much larger devices meant to      disable enemy tanks and other heavy vehicles.       The smaller ``protectors'' are shot out of tanks or dropped      from jets and helicopters. When they land, they shoot out      threads that attach themselves to the ground with tiny hooks,      creating cobweb-like tripwires. Should an enemy soldier try      to get close to the antitank mine, chances are he would trip      a wire, and either fragments would explode at ground level or      a handball-sized grenade would pop up from the antipersonnel      mine to about belly height. In less than a second, the      grenade would explode, throwing its tiny metal balls into the      soldier's flesh and bones.       In the trade, these ``mixed'' systems have names such as      Gator, Volcano, MOPMS and Area Denial Artillery Munition, or      ADAM.       These mines, Clinton's senior policy director for defense      policy and arms control, Robert Bell, explained later, ``are      not being banned under the president's directive because they      are not antipersonnel land mines.'' They are, he said      ``antihandling devices,'' ``little kinds of explosive      devices'' or, simply, ``munitions.''       Not according to the Defense Department, which has used      them for years.       When the Pentagon listed the antipersonnel land mines it      was no longer allowed to export under a 1992 congressionally      imposed ban, these types were on the list.       And when Clinton announced in January that he would cap the      U.S. stockpile of antipersonnel land mines in the inventory,      they were on that list too.       At the time, there were a total of 1 million Gators,      Volcanos and MOPMs, as well as 9 million ADAMs. (Only some      ADAMs are used in conjunction with antitank mines, and those      particular devices are no longer considered antipersonnel      land mines.)       The unclassified Joint Chiefs of Staff briefing charts used      to explain the impact of legislation to Congress this year      explicitly state that Gators, Volcanos, MOPMS and ADAMs are      antipersonnel land mines.       So does a June 19 Army information paper titled ``U.S.      Self-Destructing Anti-Personnel Landmine Use.'' So does a      fact sheet issued in 1985 by the Army Armament, Munition and      Chemical Command.       As does a recent Army ``Information Tab,'' which explains      that the Gator is ``packed with a mix of `smart' AP      [antipersonnel] and `smart' AT (antitank] mines.''       And when Air Force Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, vice chairman of      the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed reporters at the White      House on May 16, 1996, he said: ``Our analysis shows that the      greatest benefit of antipersonnel land mines is when they are      used in conjunction with antitank land mines. . . . If you      don't cover the antitank mine field with antipersonnel mines,      it's very easy for the enemy to go through the mine field.''       A diplomatic dispute over the types of antipersonnel land      mines Ralston was describing then and arms control adviser      Bell sought to redefine last week was one of the main reasons      the United States decided last week not to sign the      international treaty being crafted in Oslo, Norway.       U.S. negotiators argued that because these mines are      programmed to eventually self-destruct, they are not      responsible for the humanitarian crisis--long-forgotten mines      injuring and killing civilians--that treaty supporters hoped      to cure with a ban, and therefore should be exempt from the      ban.       Also, because other countries had gotten an exemption for      the type of antihandling devices they use to prevent soldiers      from picking up antitank mines--U.S. negotiators contended      that the United States should get an exemption for the small      mines it uses for the same purpose.       Negotiators in Oslo did not accept Washington's stance.      They worried that other countries might seek to exempt the      types of antipersonnel mines they wanted to use, too, and the      whole treaty would soon become meaningless.       The administration was not trying to deceive the public,      Bell said in an interview yesterday, bristling at the      suggestion. Given the fact that the U.S. devices are used to     protect antitank mines, ``it seems entirely common-sensical      to us'' to call them antihandling devices.       Said Bell: ``This was not a case of us trying to take mines      and then define the problem away.''                               Exhibit 2            [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Sept. 19, 1997]                           Clinton's Stumble       Sen. Patrick Leahy is charitable to President Clinton in      his statement, printed below, about the treaty negotiated      this week in Oslo, Norway, banning anti-personnel land mines.       Leahy says he is convinced Clinton wants to see land mines      eliminated and that Clinton's commitment is real.       But his statement also contains a damning account of      Clinton's pusillanimous surrender to the Pentagon and his      incompetent, eleventh-hour effort to negotiate a compromise.      Leahy, a champion of the international effort to ban land      mines, covers up his scorn for Clinton's effort with the      barest fig leaf of decorum.       The land mine negotiations are an excellent lesson in why      the U.S. Constitution ensures that control of the military      remains in civilian hands. In a democracy, the U.S. military      is an instrument of the people, not a separate warrior caste.      Thus, it is up to the civilian government to institute the      humanitarian standards and the political boundaries that      reflect the people's values. Clinton chickened out.       Clinton used Korea as an excuse, but in doing so he failed      to make the necessary calculation; the marginal difficulty of      reconfiguring our defenses in Korea weighed against the daily      carnage the land mine treaty is designed to prevent.       About 100 nations have signed on to the treaty, which      forbids them to use, produce, acquire, store or transfer      anti-personnel land mines. They have also agreed to destroy      current stocks and to remove any mines they have in place.      Further, they have agreed to assist in the care of land mine      victims.       The treaty represents an extraordinary response, outside      the usual bureaucratic channels of the United Nations, by the      governments of the world to a popular demand for change.       U.S. participation is necessary, however, if the ban is to      become a true worldwide ban. That's because there is no      chance those nations who have not signed will join the ban      until the United States does. These include China, Russia,      India, Pakistan and Israel, all of which could continue to      serve as sources for land mines for terrorist organizations.       Thus, Leahy is holding to his goal of making the United      States a signatory of the treaty. A bill of his that has 60      co-sponsors would have established a ban on use of land mines      by the United States in 2000. The prospect that that bill      might pass goaded the Clinton administration into joining the      Oslo talks in the first place.       Now Leahy plans to consult with participants in the Oslo      talks, including the Canadians who have led the treaty      movement, plus Clinton and members of Congress, to determine      how best to move the United States toward signing the treaty.      Pushing the Leahy-Hagel bill, which includes an exception for      Korea under some circumstances, is one option.       It is clear Clinton needs to be reminded he was elected by      the people, not by the Pentagon, and that the people believe      progress in ending use of this barbaric weapon is important.      Leahy scoffs at the notion that the most powerful nation in      the world requires this primitive weapon to protect itself.      The message to policymakers in Washington must be that it is      shameful the United States has failed to join a worldwide      effort to make the world a safer and more civilized place.
