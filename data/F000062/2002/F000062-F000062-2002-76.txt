 President, Senator Hutchison and I authored this amendment on behalf of Senators Thurmond, Domenici, Bingaman, Biden, Carper, Wyden, Gordon Smith, Frist, and Thompson. The amendment would include in the military construction bill five projects that were authorized by the Senate during consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act. These projects include a parking garage at Walter Reed Medical Center in the District of Columbia; an Anechoic testing chamber at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico; a control tower at Dover Air Force base in Delaware; a Joint Readiness Center at Eugene, OR; and a composite maintenance complex in Nashville, TN.  All of these projects have been authorized. They meet all the requirements of the military construction program, and I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.
