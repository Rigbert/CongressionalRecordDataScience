Speaker, the Republican-controlled Congress is shambling to the end of one of the lightest workloads in decades without a hint of embarrassment, New York Times, 9/24/04. No budget, no budget enforcement plan. No energy bill. No highway bill. No intelligence reform. No export tax relief. No welfare reform. Eleven of 13 appropriations bills still on the desk. Lost jobs.  The 108th Congress is a do-nothing Congress, contemptuously arrogant and disdainful of long-established political and parliamentary procedures. So said Al Hunt in the New York Times.  Norman Ornstein's much simpler, much more pointed observation about the 108th Congress. ``Pretty pathetic,'' said Norm Ornstein. And the last 24 hours have been a stunning testament to the pathetic product of this 108th do-nothing, do-bad Congress.                          ____________________
