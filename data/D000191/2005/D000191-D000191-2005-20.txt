  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the President breezed through a senior center yesterday, and he said, well, the Medicare drug plan seems perplexing, but he urged seniors to sign up anyway. It's a good deal, he said, of the program.  Well, it's a great deal for the pharmaceutical industry because it protectstheir profits, and they get subsidies. It's a fabulous deal for the private insurance industry because they are getting subsidized to offer plans which they can change on a daily basis in terms of senior benefits, and seniors can only sign up once a year; but it isn't necessarily a good deal for many seniors. So the President gave bad advice.  Very low-income seniors, yes, they should, if they are not covered by another plan, look very carefully at their options and probably sign up. Others with very high prescription drug costs who don't have another plan, perhaps, but some would be losers under this plan. Many others, it is questionable whether they should sign up, and the government is not making it easy for them.  Minimally, we should extend the penalty deadline. After all, if the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies can change the seniors' benefits on a daily basis, why is it seniors can only sign up for one plan a year, can't change plans and will be penalized if they don't sign up by May?                          ____________________[Pages H11510-H11511]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                           MEDICARE DRUG PLAN  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
