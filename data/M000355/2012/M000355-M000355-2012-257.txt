 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an innovative, beneficial, and truly essential organization in a quest to better understand and serve fellow Kentuckians diagnosed with autism: the Highlands Center for Autism in Prestonsburg, Kentucky.  The Highlands Center for Autism is making great progress in an attempt to better comprehend the extent of a condition which many people are unfamiliar with. Autism is a term used to describe complex developmental brain disorders that young children are most likely to show symptoms of during their first few years of life. The Centers for Disease Control has released a statistic that predicts 1 out of every 90 children will be diagnosed with autism. Not even 10 years ago, fewer people had ever heard of autism, and if they had, they probably didn't understand the full extent of it. Now with new cases being diagnosed each day, understanding autism is becoming increasingly more important.  Therefore, now more than ever, there is a need for contributions from organizations like the Highlands Center for Autism. The professional team at the Highlands Center uses the breakthrough Applied Behavior Analysis--ABA--method, which has been proven to dramatically reduce symptoms and improve life quality. Dr. Shelli Deskins of Paintsville, KY, has experience working with the ABA method. She previously worked with victims of post-traumatic stress disorder in Hazard, KY. Since her tenure began at the Highlands Center in January 2009, she has worked fervently to transform it into the successful organization it is today.  The truly one-of-a-kind Highlands Center is a private, year-round day school that serves as a beacon of hope and respite for the students enrolled and their families. The Center operates on the ideal that all children deserve the opportunity to laugh and play to become healthy, happy, and productive adults. The staff and volunteers provide an optimistic outlook for those enrolled, and provides their families with home visits and frequent reports on each child's daily progress.  I am honored to be able to have the opportunity to stand before my colleagues of the United States Senate and honor the tremendous work being done by the Highlands Center for Autism. It is inspiring to know that an institution involved with making scientific strides such as this is located in the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. I would like to thank those involved with the Highlands Center for Autism and congratulate them for their unparalleled dedication and service to this cause.  There was recently an article published in an eastern Kentucky magazine, the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, which gave the public a glimpse into the groundbreaking work being done by the Highlands Center for Autism. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the Record as follows:          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]                      Highlands Center for Autism       Kathy sits almost still at her desk as her teacher writes a      word on an erasable pad, shows it to Kathy and says,      ``wagon.'' The 8-year-old little girl looks at the word and      repeats, ``wagon.'' ``Good saying `wagon!' '' her teacher      praises.       Five-year-old Jerry sways a bit back and forth, making      noises his teacher doesn't understand. ``Use your iPad to      tell me what you want,'' she softly tells him. He points to      icons on the device's screen and the words I WANT A DRINK OF      WATER appear. ``Good making a sentence!'' she compliments.       Kathy and Jerry are students at the Highlands Center for      Autism, and there is more than one amazing achievement going      on here. It is amazing that Kathy is able to sit still and to      read; it is amazing that Jerry is able to communicate his      needs, and it is truly a miracle that the Center exists at      all.       Autism is a term used to describe a group of complex      developmental brain disorders that typically appear during      the first three years of life. Very skilled professionals      often can see autism signs as early as six months, but      children are often not diagnosed until 12 to 18 months, and      many times much later. Symptoms manifest a wide spectrum of      behaviors impacting development of social interaction and      communication skills. Every individual is affected      differently. Many need to be taught what most people consider      basic behaviors--nodding yes or no, making eye contact,      eating with utensils, playing, potty training.       As recently as 10 years ago, the majority of people were      completely unaware of the condition. Today, however, public      awareness has risen as more children are being diagnosed,      dramatically increasing the number of affected families.      According to the Centers for Disease Control, one out of      every 90 children will be diagnosed with autism. There is no      known cause or cure, and children do not ``outgrow'' it, but      research has shown that early intervention using Applied      Behavior Analysis (ABA) has a dramatic impact on reducing      symptoms and improving life quality.       A major problem with achieving that crucial early      intervention is a lack of facilities providing help,      especially in communities outside major metropolitan areas.      Even getting into a diagnostic program can take a year or      longer. Many families who can afford it move near a treatment      center in order to get help for their children.       In early 2008, a group of local families approached      Highlands Health System with the idea of forming a      partnership to establish a local center for ABA treatment for      their children who had been diagnosed with autism. They had      been primarily on their own, searching first for a diagnosis      of what was happening to their children and then, after      diagnosis, seeking treatment. They knew that ABA is a proven,      evidence-based treatment with decades of solid scientific      research supporting its effectiveness.       After their meeting with the parents and additional      research revealing that a research-based program specifically      for children diagnosed with autism did not exist anywhere in      or near Kentucky, Highlands was prompted to move toward      fulfilling this need. Their research also indicated that the      Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Center for Autism offered one of the      most prestigious treatment programs in the country. After a      visit to the Clinic by a group of representatives, Highlands      was ready to work towards establishing the first program of      its kind in Kentucky.       A community meeting revealed an astonishing amount of      support from local families, schools, health departments,      social-service agencies and government officials, leading to      Highlands entering into a consulting agreement in September      of 2008 with the Cleveland Center for Autism to work toward      the goal of ``mirroring'' Cleveland's program in      Prestonsburg.       Highlands owned an apartment building near the hospital      which became the Center's facility. Next began the search for      a director for the program. Another one of those ``miracles''      happened when they found Dr. Shelli Deskins, a Paintsville      native who was working in Hazard treating children with post-     traumatic stress disorder and who had an impressive      educational background and experience in ABA.       Dr. Deskins was approached by the hospital in November of      '08. She began at Highlands in January of '09 as the Center's      only employee and with her office in a former elevator shaft      in the main hospital building! Aided by Karen Sellers,      assistant to Highlands's president, Dr. Deskins set about      creating the Center for Autism. She did everything from      helping with facility renovation, writing and establishing      procedures, ordering supplies, interviewing and hiring staff,      finding children anything necessary to create an outstanding      and one-of-its-kind, facility-based treatment center. Even      though she was already trained in ABA and had a doctoral      degree, she also spent six weeks at Cleveland's Center to      thoroughly absorb their program's procedures.       From the beginning, Dr. Deskins and Highlands have insisted      that the Center be ``The Best,'' with no shortcuts or cutting      corners. The original staff went to the Cleveland Clinic for      two weeks to train in the Clinic's methods and learn their      procedures, and Cleveland staff members followed them back to      Prestonsburg to help open the Center. The Highlands Center      staff continues with follow-up training periodically. The      children at Highlands receive one-on-one attention from the      highly trained and dedicated instructors. Dr. Deskins says      staff members know very quickly if working with children      diagnosed with autism is something they want to do.       The Center for Autism is a private, year-round day school      and has seven students enrolled at this time, but expects to      be at their capacity of 10 by summer. Currently, the children      range in age from 3 to 14, and include students whose      families have moved here from Alabama, Virginia, and Texas.       The Highlands Center is not a place where you can drop off      your child to be ``fixed'' it requires total commitment from      the parents. Home visits are made by Dr. Deskins and each      child has a data book recording daily progress. Home      communication notes are sent home on a daily basis.       The Center is guided by the principle that all children      deserve the opportunity to laugh and play and to become      healthy, happy, and productive adults. The Highlands Center      for Autism is well on its way to becoming a regional and      national resource for the diagnosis and treatment of children      with autism.                          ____________________
