Speaker, today Representative Tom Davis and I have introduced a bill to provide the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division and the United States Park Police with the same locality pay adjustments as other Federal employees.  In the FY 2001 Omnibus Appropriations Act, Congress included a bill called the Law Enforcement Pay Equity Act. The purpose of the Act was to improve officer retention within the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division and U.S. Park Police. The Act's aim was to improve officer retention by raising the Uniformed Division and Park Police pay scales so that they were equivalent or similar to other pay scales in the Metropolitan area.  However, Section 903 of the Act froze the rate of locality pay the employees of the Uniformed Division and U.S. Park Police receive at the level in effect in the year 2000. This freeze in locality pay has caused the Uniformed Division and Park Police pay scales to lag behind the compensation scales of other agencies competing for the same workforce.  In the Washington, DC Metropolitan area, Officers of the Uniformed Division and the U.S. Park Police are currently locked into a locality rate of 9.05%, but the standard locality rate for U.S. Government employees in the Washington area is 11.48%, a difference of 2.43%.  By fixing this problem, the median salary of an Officer with thirteen years of service would increase by $1,375 per year.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, in essence, unlocks the freezer door, opens it up, and allows the locality pay to thaw to normal levels. At a time when the Uniformed Division and Park Police are trying to increase morale and maintain top rate officers, this bill is a small but significant signal that Congress cares about their welfare. This bill fixes what I consider an unfair technicality and provides them with equitable locality pay.                          ____________________
