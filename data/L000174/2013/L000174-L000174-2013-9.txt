The message is very clear. The message to the NSA is now coming from every branch of government, from every corner of our Nation: NSA, you have gone too far. The bulk collection of Americans' data by the U.S. Government has to end.  The review group came to the same conclusion that I have about the utility of the section 215 phone records program, the same conclusion that Judge Leon found just the other day, calling it unconstitutional. They said the section 215 program was ``not essential to preventing attacks and could readily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional section 215 orders.''  They say what many of us have been saying, that just because we can collect massive amounts of data doesn't mean we should do so.  The report states:       Although we might be safer if the government had ready      access to a massive storehouse of information about every      detail of our lives, the impact of such a program on the      quality of life and on individual freedom would simply be too      great.  Senator Lee, I, and others have legislation to curtail this. I think for the sake of our Nation and the sake of our Constitution we should.  In October, I introduced with Senator Lee the USA FREEDOM Act--a bipartisan and bicameral bill that ends the dragnet collection of Americans' phone records and recalibrates the government's surveillance authorities. This is commonsense legislation that has broad support from legislators across the political spectrum, civil liberties groups, and technology companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Yahoo.  I welcome the report and call on the President to immediately consider implementing the recommendations that can be achieved without legislation. I have invited the members of the President's Review Group to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next month, and look forward to discussing their important recommendations.
