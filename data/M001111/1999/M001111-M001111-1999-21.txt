 President, I am introducing a bill today to make sure we treat America's veterans with the compassion they deserve. They have sacrificed so much of their personal lives for our country. And with this bill, I want to show them we appreciate their service, and we will be there when they need help.  When veterans need medical care, they file a claim for benefits with the Veterans Administration. It requires researching information over many years and from many different government organizations.  Traditionally, the Veterans Administration has helped veterans research and file their claims. That's the way it should be.  But a series of recent court decisions have changed that--and made it harder for veterans to file their claims. I want to set the record straight. The VA has a duty to assist veterans in filing their claims.  So today, I am introducing legislation to amend Title 38 of the United States Code to clarify and improve veterans claims and procedures.  My legislation clarifies that the Department of Veterans Affairs has a duty to assist veterans in preparing all of the facts pertinent to a claim for benefits. The VA has historically aided veterans in gathering information from the federal bureaucracy so they can file a claim.  Let's not forget--the claims process was set up to aid our veterans. It's important to all veterans, especially those with severe mental and physical disabilities.  Homeless veterans need help. Elderly veterans need help. And family members--who sacrifice to care for veterans--need help from the federal government.  Anyone who has ever dealt with a veterans claim for benefits knows this is a very difficult process. It can be frustrating for veterans who--even in the best of circumstances--may be forced to wait several years for a claim to be approved and granted. Veterans already pay a heavy cost for delayed benefits. They often face financial, family, and health problems, as they try to resolve their claims.  Yet, as we speak, the claims process at the VA is becoming even more difficult for America's veterans and their families.  Through a series of court decisions, the VA's historic duty to assist veterans has been set aside. The courts responsible for veterans claims have determined that it is now the individual veteran's responsibility to file a well-rounded claim before they can get assistance from the VA. The effect has been to place the burden on the individual veteran to gather information--service records, medical records, and other documentation--from the federal government in order to file a claim.  Mr. President, the courts have decided our veterans in need of assistance must go it alone. Homeless veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder must now prepare their claims without assistance from the government they sacrificed for. Veterans who are sick, mentally or physically disabled, indigent, or poorly educated now face new barriers to assistance they may be legally entitled to receive. Veterans without the financial resources, time or familiarity with the claims process system must navigate through the bureaucracy without federal assistance. That's not the way we should treat America's veterans.  Clearly, the courts have misinterpreted Congressional intent. The Veterans Judicial Review Act was signed into law during the 100th Congress with the following language,       It is the obligation of the Veterans Administration to      assist a claimant in developing facts pertinent to his claim      and to render a decision which grants him every benefit that      can be supported in law while protecting the interests of the      Government.  Somehow the courts interpreted that language differently. My objective in introducing legislation today is not to quarrel with the courts. I simply want to reassert congressional intent and re-establish the VA's duty to assist veterans. My legislation simply confirms the Congress believes it is important and appropriate for the federal government to assist veterans in preparing claims for benefits.  Mr. President, this legislation is widely supported among those who work on veterans benefits claims every day. Numerous veterans advocacy groups, including the Disabled American Veterans, strongly support my legislation. This bill has original cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. It is a bipartisan response to a real problem confronting America's veterans.  Let's do the right thing for America's veterans and particularly for those veterans who need the government's assistance the most.  I urge prompt Senate consideration and passage of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
