Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Carlos Boozer, Corey Cogdell, and Matt Emmons, three Alaskans who recently returned from competing in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing. These three Alaskans, joined by their fellow athletes from across the country, traveled to Beijing, and represented the United States in an extraordinary manner. The U.S. Olympic team distinguished the United States from other nations by winning 110 medals, the most of any country. Carlos Boozer, Corey Cogdell, and Matt Emmons each won medals, and boldly represented the United States in their specific competitions.  I truly believe that the importance of the contributions of these three talented Alaskan athletes to our country cannot be overstated, which is why it is important that we honor their great accomplishments. For this reason I am introducing the following resolution to honor these three athletes for their accomplishments and representation of our country.                          ____________________
