 Lynn backed away from his assertion that straight pay did not exist. So they said it didn't exist, and now you see an assertion backing away from that. While he never used the term ``straight pay,'' he did not try to disassociate himself from the policy. His description of the policy was generally accurate, though somewhat incomplete.  I raised essentially the same question with Mr. Lynn in a recent letter, dated January 29, 2009, because of his appointment to this position of Deputy Secretary of Defense. Regrettably, he provided essentially the same answers in a letter dated February 3, 2009.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record those two letters, documents 15 and 16.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 2009.     Mr. William J. Lynn,     Senior Vice President, Raytheon Company, Arlington, VA.       Dear Mr. Lynn: I am writing to follow-up on six questions I      submitted for the record at your nomination hearing before      the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month.       Two of my questions pertain to a potential conflict of      interest flowing from your status as a registered lobbyist      with the Raytheon Company. Four of the questions pertain to      your efforts as the Department of Defense (DOD) Chief      Financial Officer (CFO) to bring the department into      compliance with the CFO Act. I am eagerly waiting for your      answers to my six questions.       Since submitting those questions for the record, I have had      an opportunity to retrieve and examine certain archived files      on DOD financial management issues that I investigated in the      late 1990's while you were the DOD CFO and Comptroller. I      came across two files of particular interest as follows: 1)      ``Straight Pay;'' and 2) ``Pay and Chase.'' These are DOD      payment policies that were either attributed to you and/or      adopted while you were the department's Chief Financial      Officer in charge of such matters. My follow-up questions      pertain to these matters.       In 1998, when you were CFO, ``Pay and Chase'' was a term      used to describe DOD vendor payment policy. With ``Pay and      Chase,'' the Pentagon paid bills first and worried about      tracking down the receipts later. Sometimes receipts were      found; sometimes not; And sometimes no effort was made to      look. This is how DOD ended up with billions of dollars in      unmatched disbursements. As I understand it, this was SOP      when you were CFO. It was unofficial policy. It was practiced      but not authorized in government regulations or law.       Secretary of Defense Cohen attempted to legalize ``Pay and      Chase.'' He wanted to make it the law of the land. He      forwarded his proposal to the Senate on February 2, 1998 as      part of a larger package of so-called defense reforms. At      that point in time, you were CFO, and this matter fell      directly under your area of responsibility. ``Pay and Chase''      was just one small piece of the Defense Reform Act of 1988--     also known as the Defense Reform Initiative (DRI). ``Pay and      Chase'' was embodied in Section 401 of that bill. It was      touted as a measure to ``streamline'' DOD payment practices.       Section 401 would have authorized DOD to pay bills without      receipts with no dollar limit. It would have required only      random after-the-fact verification of some receipts. And it      would have relieved disbursing officers of all responsibility      for fraudulent payments that might have resulted from the      policy.       There is nothing in my files to indicate Section 401 of      Secretary Cohen's DRI became law. I believe ``Pay and Chase''      continued as an unofficial policy and evolved into another      troublesome one known as ``Straight Pay.'' This policy was      initially approved by you in a signed memorandum on December      17, 1988.       On January 19, 1999, I wrote to you, expressing grave      concern about ``Straight Pay.''       Prior to the implementation of ``Straight Pay,'' the      Defense Finance and Accounting Center (DFAS), Columbus, Ohio      had a pre-validation policy that required all disbursements      over $2,500.00 be matched with obligations prior to payment.      When a bill was submitted to the center for payment, a      technician searched the database for the supporting      obligation or contract. If one could not be found, a red      warning flag was allegedly run up the pole. Was it a      duplicate or fraudulent payment? Your ``Straight Pay'' policy      raised the pre-validation threshold to $500,000.00.      ``Straight Pay'' allowed the technician to ignore the warning      signals and make payments up to $500,000.00 without checking      documentation. Then the accountants at the center were      directed to create bogus accounts for negative unliquidated      obligations or ``NULO'' to cover the payment. The bill was      then paid from the bogus account with a negative balance. The      center had six months to locate valid supporting obligation.      If a valid, matching obligation could not be found within      that time frame, then the center would cover the payment with      other available funds with no further investigation.       In my letter to you, I drew some comparisons between      ``Straight Pay'' and the scenario in the case of Air Force      Staff Sergeant (SSGT) Robert L. Miller, Jr. You may remember      the Miller case. I examined that case--and others like it--in      great detail at a hearing before my Judiciary Oversight      Subcommittee on September 28, 1998. As Chief of Vendor Pay at      another DFAS Center, SSGT Miller had pursued his own version      of ``Straight Pay.'' With full access to the Integrated      Accounts Payable System, SSGT Miller was able to create      obligations, where none existed, and to generate nearly a      $1,000,000.00 in allegedly fraudulent payments to his mother      and girlfriend. He was not caught until a co-worker blew the      whistle.       Mr. Lynn, on the surface at least, your ``Straight Pay''      policy appeared to authorize DFAS technicians to do      essentially what SSGT Miller allegedly did--create false      bookkeeping entries to cover large payments in the absence of      supporting documentation. Your policy left the barn door wide      open to fraud and mismanagement. At the time, the General      Accounting Office agreed with that assessment.       Also, at the time, I told you and other senior officials--     and spoke extensively about this problem on the floor--that      ``Straight Pay'' was a dangerous, misguided, irresponsible,      and unbusinesslike policy. Furthermore, it was totally      inconsistent with various provisions of Title 31 of the U.S.      Code, Money and Finance.       American taxpayers deserved to know that their hard earned      money was being protected and properly accounted for under      your leadership at DOD. So please help me understand your      position on ``Straight Pay.'' It seemed to be completely      inconsistent with your responsibilities under the CFO Act. As      CFO, how could you endorse such a policy?       Your prompt response to my questions would be appreciated,           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member.                                  ____                                                 February 3, 2009.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for your letter of January      29, 2009 concerning my tenure as Under Secretary of Defense      (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer from November 1997      to January 2001. You asked specifically about two payment      practices: ``Pay and Chase'' and ``Straight Pay''.       The Denver Center of the Defense Finance and Accounting      Service (DFAS) initiated the ``Pay and Chase'' pilot 'in      early 1997 in order to achieve more timely payments. It was a      limited test that allowed certain payments under $2,500 to be      made based on matching a proper invoice to the corresponding      contract. Receipt and acceptance was followed up after the      payment was made. The pilot was discontinued by October 1997      when the DoD General Counsel and DFAS General Counsel found      that matching a proper invoice and contract alone was not      legally sufficient to make a payment. The Department proposed      legislation to Congress in 1998 called Verification After      Payment that would have authorized making payments from the      invoice/contract match, but that request was later dropped      without Congressional action.       ``Straight Pay'' is an informal term used to describe the      practice of making payment based on a three way match of a      proper invoice, receiving report and contract when an      obligation has not yet been recorded in the accounting      records. ``Straight Pay'' recognizes the government's legal      obligation to make payment and was used to ensure contractors      were paid on time and to reduce payment backlogs and      associated interest penalties due to late payments. Under      ``Straight Pay'' policies, payments could not be made on an      invoice alone. But if DFAS had a proper invoice together with      a valid contract for the goods/services and a valid receiving      report that the goods/services had been delivered, payment      could be made without a matching obligation. DFAS then      contacted the Military Services to update the     accounting records, ensuring that the expenditure was      recorded and valid.       The Defense Department has two important obligations: to      ensure that those who provide goods and services to the      Department are paid on time pursuant to the Prompt Payment      Act and to make certain there are proper controls that ensure      the Department has received the goods and services pursuant      to a valid contract. At a time when the Department faced a      backlog of unpaid invoices and mounting interest costs due to      late payments, ``Straight Pay'' was an attempt to draw the      right balance between those objectives by reducing late      payments while still ensuring that the Department had      received what it paid for and that the accounting records      were accurate.       Best practices require that all proper invoices be matched      with a receiving report and contract, and that the obligation      be pre-validated in the accounting records prior to payment.      The Department made progress toward this pre-validation      objective while I was Under Secretary. And I understand that      further progress has been made since I left. If confirmed, I      will work with the Chief Financial Officer and the Military      Departments to achieve this important goal.       Finally, you raised the case of Air Force Staff Sergeant      Robert L. Miller, who defrauded the Department in a series of      activities between October 1994 and June 1997. The Miller      case did not actually involve ``Straight Pay''. It did,      however, expose significant internal control weaknesses      within both DFAS and the Air Force. As a consequence of the      Miller case, I directed DFAS to take a series of corrective      actions, including revising internal control guidance to      ensure better segregation of duties, reviewing and adjusting      vendor payment access to the minimum number of personnel      needed to properly conduct business, ensuring proper      documentation existed to pay invoices, and correcting      deficiencies in computer system security. In addition, DFAS      in November 1999 established an Internal Review office to      examine its systems and operations for weaknesses and      potential cases of fraud.       As you requested, I have also included answers to the six      questions you submitted for the record after my nomination      hearing on January 15, 2009. Looking ahead, if confirmed as      Deputy Secretary of Defense, I will do my utmost to      strengthen the Department's financial management and internal      controls designed to prevent fraud. I will also work to      accelerate the modernization and integration of the      Department's management information systems. From my earlier      DoD tenure, I know the obstacles to achieving this, but I      also know its vital importance. In this era of increasing      fiscal strain, financial stewardship at the Department of      Defense is essential, and I look forward to making that      happen.           Sincerely,                                             William J. Lynn, III.                    Senate Armed Services Committee                        Questions for the Record   (To consider the following nominations: William J. Lynn III to be  Deputy Secretary of Defense; Robert F. Hale to be Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer; Michele Flournoy to be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; and Jeh Charles Johnson to be     General Counsel, Department of Defense. Witnesses: Lynn, Hale,                            Flournoy, Johnson)       Senator Chuck Grassley                          Financial Management       93. Mr. Lynn, as the Under Secretary of Defense      (Comptroller), you were the Department's Chief Financial      Officer (CFO). That position was established by the CFO Act      of 1990. Section 902 of the CFO Act states: ``The CFO shall      develop and maintain an integrated agency accounting and      financial management system, including financial reporting      and internal controls.'' This requirement existed for at      least 5 years before you became the DOD CFO. While you were      CFO, did DOD operate a fully integrated accounting and      financial management system that produced accurate and      complete information? If not, why?       Answer: The DoD financial and business management systems      were designed and created before the CFO Act of 1990 to meet      the prior requirements to track obligation and expenditure of      congressional appropriations accurately. The CFO Act required      the Department to shift from its long-time focus on an      obligation-based system designed to support budgetary actions      to a broader, more commercial style, accrual-based system. To      accomplish this transformation, several things needed to be      done. First, the Department created the Defense Finance and      Accounting Service (DFAS) to consolidate financial      operations, which was accomplished in 1991 before my tenure      as Under Secretary. Second, the Department had too numerous      and incompatible finance and accounting systems. From a peak      of over 600 finance and accounting systems, I led an effort      to reduce that number by over two thirds. This consolidation      effort also strove to eliminate outdated financial management      systems and replace them with systems that provided more      accurate, more timely and more meaningful data to decision      makers. The third and most difficult step in developing an      integrated accounting and financial management system has      been to integrate data from outside the financial systems.      More than 80 percent of the data on the Defense Department's      financial statement comes from outside the financial systems      themselves. It comes from the logistics systems, the      personnel systems, the acquisition systems, the medical      systems and so on. On this effort, we made progress while I      was Under Secretary but much more needs to be done. If      confirmed, I will take this task on as a high priority.       94. Mr. Lynn, under section 3515 of the CFO Act, all      agencies, including DOD, are supposed to prepare and submit      financial statements that are then subjected to audit by the      Inspectors General. While you were the CFO, did DOD ever      prepare a financial statement in which all DOD components      earned a ``clean'' audit opinion from the DOD IG? If not,      why?       Answer: In the 1997, the Department of Defense had twenty-     three reporting entities, only one of which, the Military      Retirement Fund, had achieved a clean audit. Over the next      four years, the Department under my leadership as Under      Secretary earned a ``clean'' opinion on three other entities:      most importantly, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service      in 2000, followed by the Defense Commissary Agency and the      Defense Contract Audit Agency in 2001. We were unable to      obtain clean opinions on the other reporting entities. The      primary reason for not earning clean opinions on the      remaining entities was the difficulty of capturing data from      non-financial systems and integrating that data into the      financial systems in an auditable manner. It is my      understanding that the Department still faces the challenge      of integrating financial and non-financial systems to support      the auditability of the DOD financial statements.       95. Mr. Lynn, as CFO, what specific steps did you take to      correct this problem?       Answer: Under my leadership, the DOD instituted several      important efforts to achieve a ``clean'' audit opinion. The      primary effort was described in the Biennial Financial      Management Improvement Plan (FMIP) which was submitted to      Congress in 1998. That plan merged previous initiatives with      new ones into a single comprehensive effort to achieve both      financial management improvement and auditability. To      directly address auditability, the FMIP included an effort in      collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget, the      General Accounting Office, and the Office of the Inspector      General to address ten major issues identified by the audit      community: 1) internal controls and accounting systems      related to general property plant and equipment; 2)      inventory; 3) environmental liabilities; 4) military      retirement health benefits liability; 5) material lines      within the Statement of Budgetary Resources; 6) unsupported      adjustments to financial data; 7) financial management      systems not integrated; 8) systems not maintaining adequate      audit trails; 9) systems not valuing and depreciating      property, plant and equipment; and 10) systems not using the      Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. Due to this      effort, substantial progress was made on most of these issues      and several were resolved, including valuation of the      military retirement health benefits liability, the reduction      of unsupported adjustments to financial data, and the      identification of environmental liabilities.       96. Mr. Lynn, 18 years after the CFO Act was signed into      law, DOD is still unable to produce a comprehensive financial      statement that has been certified as a ``clean'' audit. It      may be years before that goal is met. If DOD's books cannot      be audited, then the defense finance and accounting system is      disjointed and broken. Financial transactions are not      recorded in the books of account in a timely manner and      sometimes not at all. Without accurate and complete financial      information, which is fed into a central management system,      DOD managers do not know how the money is being spent or what      anything costs. That also leaves DOD financial resources      vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse, and even outright      theft. The last time I looked at this problem billions--and      maybe hundreds of billions--of tax dollars could not be      properly linked to supporting documentation. As Deputy      Secretary of Defense, what will you do to address this      problem? Please give me a realistic timeline for fixing this      problem.       Answer: The Department needs stronger management      information systems. I can assure you that, if confirmed, I      will be committed to improving financial information and      business intelligence needed for sound decision making. I      have not yet completed my review of all the information      needed to provide a specific timeline; however, I will      continue to examine this issue, including consideration of      this and other Committees' views as well as the resources      needed for the audit, before forming my assessment of how      close DoD is to a clean audit.                     Potential Conflict of Interest       97. Mr. Lynn, as a Senior Vice President of Government      Operations at the Raytheon Company, you were a registered      lobbyist until July 2008. Correct? How long were you a      registered lobbyist?       Answer: I was a registered lobbyist for Raytheon from July      2002 to March 2008.       98. Mr. Lynn, in his ``Blueprint for Change,'' President-     elect Obama promises to ``Shine Light on Washington      Lobbying.'' He promises to ``Enforce Executive Branch      Ethics'' and ``Close the Revolving Door.'' He promises: ``no      political appointees in an Obama-Biden administration will be      permitted to work on regulation or contracts directly and      substantially related to their prior employer for 2 years.''      Raytheon is one of the big defense contractors. As Deputy      Secretary, Raytheon issues will surely come     across your desk. If you have to recuse yourself from      important decisions, you would limit your effectiveness as      Deputy Secretary of Defense. How will you avoid this problem      for 2 years?       Answer: I have received a waiver of the ``Entering      Government'' restrictions under the procedures of the      Executive Order implementing the ethics pledge requirements.      The waiver, however, does not affect my obligations under      current ethics laws and regulations. Until I have divested my      Raytheon stock, which will be within 90 days of appointment,      I will take no action on any particular matter that has a      direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of      Raytheon. Thereafter, for a period of one year after my      resignation from Raytheon, I also will not participate      personally and substantially in any particular matter      involving Raytheon, unless I am first authorized to do so      under 5 C.F.R. Sec.  1A2635.502(d). In addition, for the one      year period covered by Section 502, I have agreed not to seek      a written authorization for the handful of issues on which I      personally lobbied over the past two years. If confirmed, I      pledge to abide by the foregoing provisions. I would add that      I have not been exempted from the other Executive Order      pledge requirements, including the ones that restrict      appointees leaving government from communicating with their      former executive agency for two years and bar them from      lobbying covered executive branch officials for the remainder      of the Administration.
