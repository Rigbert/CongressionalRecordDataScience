 President, I rise today to congratulate the Los Angeles Lakers for winning the NationalBasketball Association championship for a second year in a row.  The Lakers overcame internal conflict and numerous injuries to go on to a remarkable season.  They put together a remarkable string of victories at the end of the season to bring home another World Championship to the City of Los Angeles, winning 23 out of 24 of their final games and going 15 and 1 in the playoffs--the best playoff record ever.  This Lakers team demonstrated what it truly means to be a champion and represents the best of what the city of Los Angeles has to offer.  Led by the inspired play of Shaquille O'Neal and the coaching of Phil Jackson, the Lakers swept through the opening three rounds of the playoffs--easily defeating the talented Portland Trailblazers, Sacramento Kings, and San Antonio Spurs.  In the final round, the Lakers faced a gritty Philadelphia 76ers team led by the incomparable Allen Iverson. Iverson and the Sixers showed tremendous determination and heart, handing an overtime defeat to the Lakers in the first game of the series.  But as the series moved on, the Lakers outmatched the Sixers and proved, once again, that they were the best team in professional basketball.  This was truly a team effort: Shaquille O'Neal, the series Most Valuable Player, dominated the Sixers on both ends of the floor, averaging 33 points per game, 15.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists, and 3.4 blocks in the final series.  With his unselfish play, Kobe Bryant provided the spark for the offense--in game four, for instance, he scored 19 points, had 10 assists, and had 9 rebounds.  Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Robert Horry and Brian Shaw made significant contributions to the championship--each cooly made three point shots at critical points in the series.  Horace Grant and Ron Harper provided the veteran experience that helped the Lakers push back the 4th quarter surges of the Sixers.  And finally, Tyronn Lue, deserves honorable mention for his dogged defense against Allen Iverson, especially in Game 1. Without his play, the Lakers would have been unable to contain the speedy Sixer guard.  Once again let me congratulate the Los Angeles Lakers for their victory. It was a great effort by a tremendous team.  I look forward to another winning season next year.                          ____________________
