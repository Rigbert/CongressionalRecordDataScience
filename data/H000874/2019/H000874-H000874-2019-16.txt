Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, my friend articulates many things that have no basis in fact and believes, in my view, that if he says it enough times that people will believe them. To that extent, I think he mirrors the President of the United States, who does the same thing.  First of all, the rules have been followed. Secondly, the evidence that has been adduced is overwhelming and has not been controverted.  John Bolton, when talking about this deal, which we believe is an abuse of power, said that this was the equivalent of a drug deal. That is John Bolton.  My friend has talked for many weeks about how the Mueller report found nothing.  First, let me read from the Mueller report something that was not part of an article but certainly informs us as to the intent and the feelings of the President of the United States.  The Mueller report said this: ``Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including Russian interference and obstruction investigations.  ``The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels.  ``These actions,'' the Mueller report said, ``ranged from their efforts to remove the special counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General's recusal, to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation, to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses and the potential influence of their testimony.  ``The special counsel did not reach conclusions because''--and this is critical, and the whip constantly ignores this when he says the Mueller report found nothing.  ``The special counsel,'' it says, ``did not reach conclusions because Department of Justice guidelines prohibit indicting a sitting President. Therefore, the Mueller report makes clear, however, that it does not exonerate the President by saying this. If we had confidence''--the whip may want to hear this.  The Mueller report said: ``If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. But, based upon the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment that the President did not, in fact, participate in obstruction of justice.''                              {time}  1445  But because DOJ, for whom the counsel worked--not a special prosecutor, the special counsel--counsel demurred, essentially refused to make a judgment that he thought he was unable to make. But he made it clear that they could not find that the President did not obstruct justice.  Let me say something else. There are a number of people who thought the Mueller report and the Mueller investigation had great effect:  Paul Manafort, pled guilty to lying;  Roger Stone, convicted;  Michael Cohen, the President's counsel, convicted, in jail;  Michael Flynn, convicted of lying, the national security adviser appointed by President Trump, convicted;  Rick Gates, the deputy campaign manager for President Trump, convicted;  George Papadopoulos, who the President claimed was his foreign policy adviser--or one of his foreign policy advisers--convicted, pled guilty, served a short period of time, and now is a candidate for Congress on the Republican ticket in the State of California.  They all think that the Mueller report had some consequences. That is the context in which we see this crowd. No wonder so many of them didn't want to testify.  And when Mr. Sondland testified the first time and then, after that, he saw some of these convictions, he amended his testimony.  He came in and said, oh, yes, there may have been some discussion about a so-called quid pro quo or a bribery or extortion. He didn't say those words. Those are my words. He talks about obstruction of Congress and how there was no back and forth, and he says, well, they could have gone to court.  As a matter of fact, we have gone to court time after time after time. And guess what, Mr. Speaker, the court has said that Congress is entitled to that discovery. Now, they keep appealing it.  Mr. Speaker, that is the President's modus operandi, which he has pursued all of his adult life. When people said he owed them money; when people said he didn't fulfill a contract; when people said he should do this, that, or the other, he almost invariably took them to court and delayed and delayed and delayed.  There is an editorial in ``USA Today'' which says this: ``Trump has met the impeachment investigation with outright and unprecedented defiance.'' We share that view.  No President in history has refused to cooperate with the Congress of the United States in the exercising of its constitutional responsibility of oversight other than this President. Those are the facts.  This is not ``The Washington Post'' or ``The New York Times.'' That editorial went on to say: ``Allowing this obstruction to stand unchallenged would put the President above the law and permanently damage Congress' ability to investigate misconduct by Presidents of either party.''  Now, Mr. Speaker, I would again reflect that Articles of Impeachment under the Constitution of the United States are what Mr. Mueller said was the appropriate option if the Congress believed that this President ought to be held accountable for abuse of power, because he said he couldn't do it because the Justice Department policy said he couldn't do it.  We have had hearings. Those hearings were participated in by the Republican side of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle. Time was divided equally between the sides for questioning of witnesses.  The witnesses were an ambassador hired by Secretary Pompeo, appointed by the President to represent us; Mr. Sondland, a close friend of the President's, apparently, or at least a big contributor of the President's, appointed by the President, who came back and said no.  Certainly, I believe there was a quid pro quo that, if you didn't start an investigation, if you didn't announce that in public, then there wouldn't be the $391 million that you needed to defend your country and to defend freedom in Ukraine, which this Congress had, in a bipartisan way, sent to the President of the United States and that the Defense Department and others had certified reforms contemplated by that legislation had been effected, and they recommended the payment of that money.  And in addition, you could not have a meeting with the White House if this didn't happen.  So my friend continues to say no wrongdoing; nothing; no crimes; no this, that, and the other. That is not the case, Mr. Speaker. And no matter how many times he says it, whether it is an editorial in ``USA Today'' or an editorial in some other paper or articles in some other paper or--I will tell my friend--people with whom I talk on your side of the aisle--I will not name their names--they, like Zelensky, would be afraid of retribution, just as Mr. Sanford found out that disagreeing would incur the wrath of the President of the United States and get a response, either in a tweet or some other way.  Mr. Zelensky is in a very difficult position. The freedom of his country, the security of his people, he believes, are contingent upon whether President Trump will treat him fairly and as consistently as the Congress would want them treated.  So I say to my friend: We are going to move ahead. We will all have a chance to vote on these articles, and we will have a chance to debate them. And then the Senate will have a trial, if, in fact, articles pass this House. And that trial will be where the President, presumably, will offer witnesses.  But I find it interesting, Mr. Speaker, that Republican Senators are quoted frequently saying, we ought to have no witnesses. Republican Senators are saying, we ought to have no witnesses. Perhaps they just want to pass it so quickly. But it is as well, I think, because they don't know of any witnesses who will absolve the President from the actions that have been testified to without effective opposition to those premises.  So, Mr. Speaker, we can debate this. We are going to debate it, I am sure, next week. It will be debated in the United States Senate, and we can continue to debate it here today. But the evidence, in the perception of many, is overwhelming and uncontradicted.
