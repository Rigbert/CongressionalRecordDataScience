President, I am pleased to join Senators Grassley and Schumer in sponsoring the ``Sunshine in the Courtroom Act.''  Our democracy works best when our citizens are fully informed. That is why I have supported efforts during my time in the Senate to promote the goal of opening the proceedings of all three branches of our government. We continue to make progress in this area. Except for rare closed sessions, the proceedings of Congress and its Committees are open to the public, and carried live on cable networks. In addition, more Members and Committees are using the Internet and Web sites to make their work available to broader audiences.  The work of Executive Branch agencies is also open for public scrutiny through the Freedom of Information Act, among other mechanisms. The FOIA has served the country well in maintaining the right of Americans to know what their government is doing--or not doing. As President Johnson said in 1966, when he signed the Freedom of Information Act into law:       This legislation springs from one of our most essential      principles: A democracy works best when the people have all      the information that the security of the Nation permits.  The work of the third, Judicial Branch, of government is also open to the public. Proceedings in federal courtrooms around this country are open to the public, and our distinguished jurists publish extensive opinions explaining the reasons for their judgments and decisions.  Forty-eight states, including Vermont, permit cameras in the courts. This legislation simply continues this tradition of openness on the federal level.  This bill permits presiding appellate and district court judges to allow cameras in the courtroom; they are not required to do so. At the same time, it protects non-party witnesses by giving them the right to have their voices and images obscured during their testimony. Finally, the bill authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to promulgate advisory guidelines for use by presiding judges in determining the management and administration of photographing, recording, broadcasting or televising the proceedings. The authority for cameras in federal district courts sunsets in three years.  In 1994, the Judicial Conference concluded that the time was not ripe to permit cameras in the federal courts, and rejected a recommendation of the Court Administration and Case Management Committee to authorize the photographing, recording, and broadcasting of civil proceedings in federal trial and appellate courts. A majority of the Conference were concerned about the intimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and jurors.  The New York Times opined at that time, on September 22, 1994, that ``the court system needs to reconsider its total ban on cameras, and Congress should consider making its own rules for cameras in the Federal courts.''  I am sensitive to the concerns of the Conference, but believe this legislation grants to the presiding judge the authority to evaluate the effect of a camera on particular proceedings and witnesses, and decide accordingly on whether to permit the camera into the courtroom. A blanket prohibition on cameras is an unnecessary limitation on the discretion of the presiding judge.  Allowing a wider public than just those who are able to make time to visit a courtroom to see and hear judicial proceedings will allow Americans to evaluate for themselves the quality of justice in this country, and deepen their understanding of the work that goes on in our courtrooms. This legislation is a step in making our courtrooms and the justice meted out there more widely available for public scrutiny. The time is long overdue for federal courts to allow cameras on their proceedings.                                 ______                                       By
