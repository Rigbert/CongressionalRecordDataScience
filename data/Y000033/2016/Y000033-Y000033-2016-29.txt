Mr. Chairman, may I suggest to the gentleman that this was an act of Congress that set aside the 1002 area by the Senator from Washington State. That is crucially important because it is an area that has great potential 74 miles away from the existing pipeline. It also is an area that has the Village of Kaktovik that supports the drilling and development in 1002.  I am just saying that no agency has a right to overcome a law of the Congress. I am not talking about the 19 million acres. I am talking about the small acreage, a parcel no bigger than the Dulles Airport, to allow that to be continued to be considered by the Congress of the United States, who set it aside at the insistence of Scoop Jackson from Washington State with the help of Senator Ted Stevens and myself, for potential drilling. It has to have an act of Congress, but you can't drill in a wilderness area.  So I am saying no money shall be spent. No regulatory agency can turnand make it an off-limits area to develop the oil if this Congress so decides.  I urge a ``yes'' on my amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).
