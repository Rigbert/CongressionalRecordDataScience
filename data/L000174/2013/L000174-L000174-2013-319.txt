It was extraordinarily helpful to have the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, there because I feel very knowledgeable about the northern border, living an hour's drive from it, and we needed the Senator's expertise on the southern border. But more importantly, he and I, Senator Kennedy, and President George W. Bush worked for hours and hours, days and days, weeks and weeks, months and months trying to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill through once before. We now have the possibility of one.  He said something every one of us can echo: It is not exactly the bill any one of us individually might have written. But by the time we get done, we can have legislation that will make America better and be true to our principles and be realistic.  I could use a lot of other adjectives, but I want to personally thank the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona.  The distinguished senior Senator from Louisiana is about to speak. Before she does, I would add that she is going to talk about an amendment I strongly support. I mention that support because we have a number of amendments that both Republicans and Democrats will support. I would hope that after the other party has their noon caucus, we can get to the point where we start voting on some of these.  There are a lot of amendments that Republicans and Democrats would vote for together. There are some that will be opposed on one side or the other. But either way, vote on them. Vote them up or vote them down.  Now, as manager of the bill, I can start calling up amendments and move to table. I do not want to do that. We have a lot of good amendments, a lot of good ideas from both Republicans and Democrats, but they cannot be in the bill until we vote on them. The distinguished Senator from Louisiana has one. I hope the other side will let her amendment come up soon.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin.) The Senator from Louisiana.
