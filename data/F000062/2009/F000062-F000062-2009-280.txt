 President, I rise today to introduce the Deafy Glade Land Exchange Act. This legislation would authorize a land exchange between the U.S. Forest Service and Solano County to help ensure the continued operation of the juvenile correctional facility and add nearly 80 acres of wilderness quality land to the Mendocino National Forest.  Nearly 10 years ago at the suggestion of the Forest Service, Solano County purchased more than 160 acres of wilderness quality land within the Mendocino National Forest--known as Deafy Glade--with the intention of exchanging the land for the Fouts Springs Ranch. This legislation would facilitate that exchange, so that the counties could own the land beneath the facility they operate, and in exchange, the Forest Service would acquire a wilderness quality inholding.  Solano County currently operates a youth correctional facility under a Special Use Permit issued by the Forest Service on the Fouts Springs Ranch, which covers approximately 82 acres within the boundaries of the Mendocino National Forest. Solano County owns the infrastructure but leases the land from the Forest Service.  Solano County has operated the Fouts Springs Youth Facility pursuant to a joint powers agreement with Yolo and Colusa counties since 1959. The program includes counseling and education, with the goal of giving juveniles the skills to successfully reenter their communities.  More than 20 California counties have placed juvenile offenders at Fouts Springs for 6 month, 9 month, or one year periods. The program is viewed as a last resort for youth before being referred to a State prison.  Specifically, the legislation I am offering today would authorize the transfer of Fouts Springs Ranch--approximately 82 acres--from the Forest Service to Solano County; and the transfer of more than 160 acres of the Deafy Glade area in Mendocino National Forest from Solano County to the Forest Service.  The Fouts Spring youth correctional facility is in need of substantial upgrades, including the replacement of the main water line, electrical system improvements, and renovation of one of the dormitories. However, the County has postponed investing in facility upgrades until the land exchange is finalized and ownership of the Fouts Springs Ranch is transferred to the County.  Given the substantial investment already made by Solano County and the importance of the youth rehabilitation services provided by Fouts Springs, I believe the time has come to finalize this land exchange.  This legislation would not only help ensure the continued operation of the Fouts Spring youth correctional facility but it would also add nearly 80 acres of wilderness quality land to the Mendocino National Forest.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1571       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
