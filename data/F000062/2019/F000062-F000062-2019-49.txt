 President, I rise today to introduce, along with my friend Senator Enzi, the ``Breast Cancer Research Stamp Reauthorization Act.''  Breast cancer remains one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women. One in eight women will receive a diagnosis during her lifetime--and more than 40,000 women will die from the disease this year.  The Breast Cancer Research Stamp was first issued in 1998 and has since raised almost $90 million for research into new, innovative treatments for breast cancer.  A 2018 study that was partially funded by revenue from stamp sales found that most women diagnosed with a common early-stage breast cancer do not actually need chemotherapy as a part of their cancer treatment. Results from this study are expected to spare up to 70,000 U.S. patients a year from the cost and side effects associated with chemotherapy without it hurting their chances of beating the disease.  Think about it. Simply purchasing a stamp could help spare thousands of women the pain they may experience when undergoing chemotherapy and side effects that range from hair loss to long-term organ damage. Not to mention the expense, with one basic round of chemo costing anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000. The stamp's ability to fund critical research like this study helps us take big steps forward in treating breast cancer for only a few more cents over the standard price of sending a letter.  As we come back to work after Mother's Day, I invite the Senate to pause and remember all the women who have faced a diagnosis of breast cancer, not knowing what the outcome would be. I applaud as well the family and friends who have tirelessly supported them.  The Breast Cancer Stamp currently costs 65 cents, 10 cents more than a traditional Forever stamp. The additional 10 cents helps support breast cancer research at the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense's Medical Research Program. Our bill would reauthorize the stamp for 8 more years through 2027.  For these women and their families, this stamp is as meaningful to them as it is impactful to how we combat the disease now and in the future.  I am honored to be joined by Senators Baldwin, Barrasso, Capito, Casey, Cramer, Collins, Daines, Duckworth, Durbin, Grassley, Hassan, Hirono, Hyde-Smith, Klobuchar, Rosen, Schatz, Shaheen, Stabenow, and Tester.  I am very grateful for supporters of this bill, including the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American College of Surgeons, Susan G. Komen, the American Association for Cancer Research, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and Are You Dense, Inc.  As we celebrate the mothers in our lives this week, I urge my colleagues to join us in taking meaningful action to improve women's health.  Thank you Mr. President and I yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By
