 If we can continue to act in a bipartisan way, as I know Mr. Shuster and Mr. Rahall will do, we can send a message that Congress is ready to move forward and help more of our people make it in America.  I hope we can tap into the spirit of cooperation by scheduling consideration of a comprehensive immigration reform legislation which, like this bill, has support from both sides of the aisle, from business, from labor, from religions groups, and from leading non-profits. That is a challenge I think that we can meet this year.  Again, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), who has worked hard in a focused and bipartisan way to bring this day to fruition, and I congratulate him.  I thank Mr. Rahall, my good friend, who has worked so diligently over so many years to make sure that people can make it in America, and that America invests in itself.
