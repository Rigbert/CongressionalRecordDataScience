 President, I rise in support of the nomination of Ronnie White to serve as a United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.  In the Senate, as in life, there rarely is a chance for a do-over--to get something right that went wrong a long time ago.  For me, Ronnie White's nomination is a chance to do that. This year should have been his fifteenth as a district court judge--he would be close to senior status today had his nomination by President Clinton been confirmed in 1999.  I was very pleased this year to see him appear once again before the Judiciary Committee, and I believe he will distinguish himself as a Federal district judge.  Let me simply quote from a letter from the Missouri State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, which wrote a letter on May 13, 2014 in support of Judge White's nomination:       As a former justice on the Missouri Court of Appeals and as      the Chief Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court, Ronnie White      has proven that he has the experience and requisite      attributes to be a quality addition to the U.S. District      Court. We can think of no finer or more worthy nominee.  Ronnie White's confirmation is long past due, and I really am pleased it is likely to come to pass. I just wanted to say that, and to urge my colleagues to support him.
