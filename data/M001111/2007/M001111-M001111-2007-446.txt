 President, today I recognize and congratulate three of Washington State's outstanding students, Leigh Douglas and Helen Lee from Redmond, Washington and Brian Maskal from Tacoma, WA, for their award-winning projects recognized by the National History Day program.  Each student's project reflects this year's National History Day theme, ``Triumph and Tragedy in History.'' I am proud to say that these students were selected from more than 2,000 finalists by the National History Day program to present their projects.  Leigh Douglas presented a performance titled, ``Traditional Irish Music and Dance: Triumphing over Tragedy'' at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Helen Lee's exhibit titled, ``The Triangle Factory Fire: Tragedy and Triumph for the American Worker,'' and Brian Maskal's exhibit, ``Atomic Bomb: A Race for Triumph or Tragedy'' were displayed at the National Archives and Records Administration.  These students created projects that add important perspectives to the way we think about American history. Lee's exhibit explored how a workplace tragedy reshaped the role of the American worker. Douglas's performance illustrated the ability of Irish dance and music to provide strength, unity and tradition within the community. Maskal articulately portrayed the role of the atom bomb in the 20th century and how it too has reshaped the way we view the world. I am proud of the dedication and hard work of these students from Washington State.  I would like to commend the National History Day Program for empowering students like Leigh Douglas, Helen Lee, and Brian Maskal to take a deeper look into history so we can better understand and address the problems our Nation faces today.                          ____________________
