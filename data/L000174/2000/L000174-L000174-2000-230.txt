President, I rise today to extend my congratulations to Franklin County, Vermont, one of five counties recently honored with the 2000 Community of Excellence Award from the organization Communities Can!  Franklin County is a small, sparsely populated area in northwestern Vermont. This county's close proximity to Lake Champlain and its rolling hills make it ideal for agriculture. In fact, the county has long been known as a state leader in dairy and maple syrup production. As with many rural areas, Franklin County has limited resources, but with the innovation and sense of community responsibility that has characterized Vermonters for centuries, leaders in the community have established a comprehensive network of educators, health care providers, and mental health workers to coordinate vital services for area children.  Communities Can! is a network of communities committed to ensuring that all children and families, including those with disabilities and special needs, have the services and support they need. Franklin County has been a part of this exemplary collaboration since its inception. Each year the organization recognizes five counties from across the country with the Community of Excellence Award. In order to be eligible for this prestigious award, a county must show that it identifies young children and families in need of services; provides affordable, convenient assistance; and includes family members in all levels of decision making. Receiving this award is a significant achievement.  It takes strong teamwork to bring all of these essential human services together to improve the lives of children and their families in a community. Thanks to the work of Mark Sustic, Coordinator of Early Childhood Programs; Peggy Durgin, Early Intervention/Team Coordinator; Paula Irish, Mental Health and Disabilities Coordinator for Head Start; Pam McCarthy, Director of the Family Center; and, Tracey Wagner, Chair of the Regional Interagency Coordinating Council, children and families in Franklin County receive the support and services they need to develop and flourish. I had the pleasure of meeting these remarkable community leaders this spring when they came to Washington to receive their award. These dedicated Vermonters make the most of the limited resources in their rural county by coordinating a comprehensive set of services including pre-kindergarten education, health care, parent education, special needs services, day care, and prenatal care.  I am proud of the people of Franklin County for their creativity and ingenuity in meeting the needs of families and children. They serve as an inspiring example to other communities in Vermont, and indeed, the entire country.                          ____________________
