Chairman, I yield myself such time as may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would encourage at the outset of my remarks all of the Members of the body to support the energy and water appropriation bill. I would also at the outset note that the long-standing Alabama and Indiana connection, as they call it, that was established many years ago by Mr. Bevill from Alabama and Mr. Myers from Indiana, has now been reestablished on that particular subcommittee.  I want to very sincerely thank the gentleman from Alabama (Chairman Callahan) for his leadership on the subcommittee. He has been a leader. He has been trusting of all of us on this subcommittee. He has been open, he has been fair, and he has been decisive. He has put together a very good work product in a bipartisan fashion, and I strongly support it.  I also do want to thank all of the members of the subcommittee, who have worked so hard also to put this legislation together.  Last, I want to especially thank those who have done the work, the staff: Bob Schmidt, Jeanne Wilson, Kevin Cook, Tracy LaTurner, Paul Tumminello; the personal staff of the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan), Mike Sharp and Nancy Tippins; and our side of the aisle, David Killian, Richard Kaelin, and Jennifer Watkins, a former staffer. I do appreciate the work that the staff has done.  The President asked for $1 billion worth of cuts for the programs represented by this legislation; and under the leadership of this subcommittee, those cuts have essentially been restored.                              {time}  1400  We are $187 million over the current year level, that is less than a 1 percent increase, but this bill does meet critical demands faced in the infrastructure and energy arena by our Nation. I am particularly happy that as far as water infrastructure, there is a $591 million plus-up in this bill, and some of the other attributes I would mention is the increase in environmental funding over the administration request. This funding increase is essential to achieving long-planned program milestones, assuring compliance with the law, and avoiding unnecessary stretch-outs that could simply lead to higher costs.  I am also very happy that in the nonproliferation accounts, we have increased the amount over the President's request by $71 million, and the current bill now has $774 million contained therein. I also think it is important for all of my colleagues to understand that the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan) indicated during markup that he plans to conduct a hearing in July relative to this issue and all of the needs as far as our concern over the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the materials thereto. I look forward to joining him to ensure that these critical programs get the scrutiny and the attention that they deserve, and I also wish to commend especially the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards) for his leadership on this issue.  The bill also provides $733 million for renewable energy resources, and that, again, is an increase of $100 million over the administration's request.  This is a very good bill, but at the conclusion of my remarks, I would just make a couple of points about our underinvestment in infrastructure in this Nation. I do regret, through no fault of anyone on the subcommittee, that I believe we are still $10 million short as far as the Army Corps of Engineers regulatory budget, as far as making sure that the Corps can efficiently and without delay proceed with their regulatory burden. I regret that we were not fully able to fund that account, but we have included it at the administration's request. Additionally, it should be understood that the Corps asked for $6 billion because they felt that was, in fact, the national need.  As far as water, we have $4.468 billion contained in the bill. At this rate, unfortunately, authorized projects by this Congress will increase, that have not been started, from $38 billion this year to $40 billion in the next fiscal year. We will see the Corps' backlog of critical maintenance increase from $450 million this year to $864 million next year. However, I would point out in the supplemental, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) did agree to plus up critical maintenance as far as dams under the Army Corps critical control by $23.7 million last week. They certainly recognized the need.  The Corps last year in testimony before the subcommittee also indicated that to proceed as efficiently as possible and in as economical fashion as possible, they really needed about another $700 million a year for those existing authorized projects that we are already providing funding for, and, clearly, there is a shortfall.  The last category I would touch on is water infrastructure, primarily sewers. This body, the other body and the administration combined over the last several years have authorized 202 sewer programs, only 44 of which are actually funded, 22 percent. The needs and requests are about $2.5 billion, and, again, I do think we have a shortfall in this country. The American Society of Civil Engineers and the U.S. EPA would indicate that to simply bring up existing infrastructure for clean drinking water, we would have to expend an additional $11 billion for wastewater, $12 billion. Clearly, the resources as far as the allocations do not exist.  Mr. Chairman, the chairman has done an exceptional job with the resources we were given. This is a very good bill. However, I do think the administration and the Congress someday, whether it is water or other economic infrastructure, has to face the fact that we need to invest more money.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
