 President, today I am pleased to support two construction initiatives to help our public schools reduce overcrowding. The first is included in Senator Roth's substitute bill that is before us and the second is an amendment by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.  The two proposals combined mean that California could issue tax exempt bonds totaling $2.8 billion. They differ in their approach and help two different types of districts. The Roth proposal will help suburban high-growth areas. The Moseley-Braun proposal will target disadvantaged, inner city districts, while also providing the state with authority to address the needs of other districts.                           the roth proposal  The school construction provisions of Senator Roth's education bill provide $2.4 billion per year for new tax-exempt bonds and allocate them according to a state's population, at $10 per person. It targets funding at the school districts with a 20 percent enrollment growth between 1990 and 1995. Under this proposal, California could issue tax-exempt bonds totaling $322 million and as many as 77 high-growth school districts in California could take advantage of these bonds. This means that using these bonds, we could build 40 elementary schools, 8 middle schools and 2 high schools in my state. We could build schools in high-growth school districts like Clovis, Capistrano, Tustin, Elk Grove, Modesto, Palo Alto, Lancaster, Culver City, and Fontana.  The Roth proposal creates a new category of tax exempt facility bonds to encourage innovative public-private partnerships for school construction, but the ownership of the school building would stay with the public school district. This approach could brings some innovative financing to school construction, in my view.  While in terms of California's enormous needs, the amount of bonding authority in this proposal is modest, it does offer a new financing tool for our schools.                      the moseley-braun amendment  I also will vote for the school construction amendment to be offered by Senator Moseley-Braun, which will provide $22.6 billion in authority for state and local governments to issue bonds to construct and rehabilitate schools. In addition, her amendment will make more qualified zone academy bonds available by increasing the national bond cap from $400 million to $1.4 billion and by allowing them to be used for school construction. Bondholders would get federal tax credits in lieu of interest.  Under this proposal, California could get $2.5 billion in bonds, the most of any state. Thirty-five percent of these bonds would be used by the 100 largest school districts based on their ESEA Title I funding, which assists disadvantaged children. Sixty-five percent would be distributed by states based on their own criteria. In addition, the Secretary of Education could designate 25 additional districts based on the state's share of ESEA Title I grants, excluding the 100 largest districts.  Under this amendment, the following school districts could receive the following allocations:  Bakersfield City Elementary, $19 million;  Compton Unified, $30 million;  Fresno Unified, $56 million;  Long Beach Unified, $48 million;  Los Angeles Unified, $481 million;  Montebello Unified, $22 million;  Oakland Unified, $35 million;  Pomona Unified, $18 million;  Sacramento City Unified, $31 million;  San Bernardino City Unified, $32 million;  San Diego City Unified, $68 million;  San Francisco Unified, $28 million;  Santa Ana Unified, $27 million; and  Stockton City Unified, $24 million.  In addition to these, the state would get $1.2 billion to allocate among needy school districts.  In my state, these two proposals provide two approaches to address the school construction needs in two different types of California school districts. The Roth-Coverdell proposal helps districts with enrollment growth exceeding 20% between 1990 and 1995, high-growth districts. The Moseley-Braun proposal helps the large, urban, poor districts, districts that also have pockets of escalating enrollments and dilapidated and crowded buildings.                      california's critical needs  My state faces severe challenges.                       soaring enrollment growth  California's public school enrollment between 1997 and 2007 will grow by 15.7 percent, triple the national rate of 4.1 percent. California's schools will see the largest enrollment increase of all states during the next ten years.  Each year between 160,000 and 190,000 new students enter California classrooms.  California's high school enrollment is projected to increase by 35.3 percent by 2007. Approximately 920,000 students are expected to be admitted to schools in the state during that period, boosting total enrollment from 5.6 million to 6.8 million.  California needs to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per class between 1997 and 2001 just to keep up with the growth in student population.                              overcrowding  California needs to add about 327 schools over the next three years just to keep pace with the projected growth. Yet these phenomenal construction rates would only maintain current use and would not even begin to relieve current overcrowding.  We have the largest class sizes in the nation. Students are crammed into every available space and in temporary buildings. Los Angeles Unified SchoolDistrict, for example, has 560,000 seats for 681,000 students.  Here are a few other examples:  At Horace Mann Year-Round School in Oakland, increasing enrollment and class size reductions require some teachers and students to pack up and move to a new classroom every month.  At John Muir Elementary School in San Bruno, one class spent much of the year on the stage of the school's multipurpose room as it waited for portables to arrive.  Anaheim City School District has a 6 percent enrollment growth rate, double the state average and recently approved the purchase of 10 portable buildings, at a cost of $235,000 to relieve overcrowding.  Los Angeles Unified School District has 195 schools on a nontraditional, year-round schedule and is bussing 11,000 students away from their neighborhoods because of overcrowding. Garfield High School in East Los Angeles was built for 2,500 students but now has almost 5,000. Many classes have 40 or more students per teacher.  In order to build it's way out of overcrowding, Oceanside School District in San Diego, would need to build four elementary schools, two middle schools and a high school at an estimated cost of $110 to $140 million.                              Old Schools  60 percent of our schools are over 30 years old.  Today's schools need a modern infrastructure, including updated wiring for computers.  In California, 87 percent of the public schools need to upgrade and repair buildings, according to the General Accounting Office,                               High Costs  The California Department of Education estimates that the state needs $22 billion during the next decade to modernize our public schools and an additional $8 billion to meet enrollment growth.  Here's what it costs to build a school in California:  An elementary school (K-6), $5.2 million;  A middle school (7-8), $12.0 million; and  A high school (9-12), $27.0 million.  Our schools must be built to withstand earthquakes, floods, El Nino and a myriad of other natural disasters. California's state earthquake building standards add 3 to 4 percent to construction costs.  The cost of building a high school in California is almost twice the national cost. The U.S. average is $15 million; in California, it is $27 million.                          Class Size Reduction  Our state, commendably, is reducing class sizes in grades K through 3 because smaller classes improve teaching and learning.  We have the largest pupil-teacher ratios in the country and fortunately, we are beginning to reduce class sizes. Small classes bring more individual attention to students, but smaller classes mean more classrooms.  In short, California's needs are immense and states and local communities need the federal partner.                               Conclusion  These new bond programs will provide important assistance for school districts across America. Some of the bonds can especially help small and low-income area school districts, because low-income communities with the highest school rehabilitation and construction needs may have to pay the highest interest rates in order to issue the bonds, if they can be issued at all.  These approaches are similar to the bill I introduced on March 12, the Expand and Rebuild America's Schools Act, S. 1753. My bill would provide a tax credit for bond holders of school construction bonds and includes criteria to address high growth areas and older schools in need of modernization.  School overcrowding places a heavy burden on teachers and students. Studies show that the test scores of students in schools in poor condition can fall as much as 11 percentage points behind scores of students in good buildings. Other studies show improvements of up to 20 percent in test scores when students move to a new facility.  The point is that improving facilities improves teaching and learning. School overcrowding undermines the health and morale of students and teachers, disrupting education. Overcrowded schools prevent both teachers and students from reaching their full potential.  Our nation's school districts face huge challenges as we move toward the 21st century, with a record 52.2 million children this year and a booming school population forecast well into the next century. The legislation proposes modest, targeted federal support for school bonds in growth areas, offering important assistance to school districts, teachers, parents and students.  In the end, it is improved student achievement is what this is all about and in the end, that is the goal of this Senator.
