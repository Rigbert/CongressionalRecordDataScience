We are all privileged and honored to serve in this House with John Lewis. There is probably no Member of this House who has been recognized for greater contributions to what America stands for than our colleague, John Lewis.  It was so appropriate for Secretary Mabus, who is the Secretary of the Navy from Mississippi and former Governor of Mississippi, to not only name this ship, as the gentleman observed, but because it is the first ship. And this ship is all about serving others, about supplying others with that which they need--not only fuel, but also food and supplies--and is so appropriate because John Lewis lived his life serving others and supplying.  This is not a warship, per se. It is a Naval ship that is going to be critically important to our Navy. The gentleman is absolutely correct that honoring John Lewis was an appropriate act to take. I think he and I both extend our thanks to Secretary Ray Mabus for taking this action.                                {time}  1315  Lastly, I have had a long association with Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico, of course, is an integral part of the United States of America. Its citizens are citizens of the United States of America. Like other jurisdictions--whether they be in California or in New York or in the Midwest or the South or the North--who have from time to time found themselves in deep fiscal trouble, Puerto Rico now finds itself in that position.  I had the opportunity to talk a little earlier today with Chairman Rob Bishop about the hearings that are going on in the Committee on Natural Resources this month with reference to Puerto Rico. I know that Speaker Ryan has indicated that we need to address this issue in an effective way by March 31. I very much appreciate his setting a goal and a timeframe for that.  Can the gentleman give me any additional information as to the status of consideration of Puerto Rico and extending it bankruptcy authority so that it might restructure its debt so that it doesn't undermine its school system, its public safety, its transportation, and other needs of its people?  I yield to my friend.
