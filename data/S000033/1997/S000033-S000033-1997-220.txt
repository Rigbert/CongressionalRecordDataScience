 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Gailer School in VT, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Leach: Congressman Sanders, the United States      government wants to regulate the information available on the      Internet via the U.S. Communications Decency Act and Exxon-     Garten Communications Decency legislation.       We as adult citizens in the United States believe that this      legislation is violating our First Amendment rights to the      freedom of expression.       The First Amendment was created by American's founders to      protect the individual's rights, two of these rights being      freedom of speech and freedom of expression. The CDA is going      to be limiting these rights and violating the First      Amendment. Is this right? No. The CDA calls for a $100,000      fine and up to two years in jail for transmitting indecent      material over the computer networks.       What is indecent? What is indecent to some may not be some      to others. To others it is self-expression which is protected      by the First Amendment. Expressing yourself is an American      right. It may come in the form of unconventional speech down      to pornography, but it is all self-expression.       Americans should be able to speak freely over the Internet      about controversial issues such as abortion or sex without      fear of prosecution. We are not a free people if we cannot      speak freely and share our opinions. As for children, they      are under their parents' responsibility for guidance on the      Internet. Adult expression should not be prohibited for the      protection of children. The government does not parent      children, parents parent children.       So I say to you, please protect our rights. The Internet is      a wonderful way to express and share our opinion with the      world. Don't make us have to be afraid of prosecution if we      have unconventional, maybe indecent opinions which we wish to      express. If the CDA is passed we will start losing our First      Amendment rights. Keep us a free people, free to express      ourselves.       Mr. Herr. There are also important technological concerns.      Forty percent of the websites on the Internet are located on      the hard drives of computers that are physically located      outside of any area in which the United States can be said to      have jurisdiction and this number is growing. How would the      Communications Decency Act prevent children within the United      States from accessing information and pictures contained      within these sites? In addition, it would be entirely      possible for United States citizens to rent space on one of      these foreign sites and post any information or pictures that      he or she wanted to.       The Communications Decency Act makes it illegal for an      Internet service provider such as America Online or      Togethernet to provide material that is patently offensive to      minors. It is possible for these organizations not directly      to provide such information to minors by not carrying it on      the Internet service which they control. However, there are      many public Internet servers that are available for use by      anyone attached to the Internet who state it could not be      regulated by the Communications Decency Act. Therefore, any      Internet service provider whose users could access any of      these servers would be open to prosecution under the      Communications Decency Act.       As you can see, Representative Sanders, it is clearly      unfair to any Internet service provider and could in fact act      to shut down the Internet within the United States whereby      denying U.S. citizens access to a valuable tool.       Lastly, because of the way Internet protocols are written      there is no way of confirming the age of persons accessing a      website or a new server. The fear of prosecution has caused      many Internet sites to provide material solely for adult      audiences because they have been technically unable to      prevent minors from accessing their sites. The Electronic ID      is the best quick fix for this problem as minors can get      these IDs and there     are so many competing standards that adults cannot access      some sites.       We do not object to your controlling what comes through the      Internet to your own computer and what your child sees. There      are softwares available for just for that purpose. It's low      cost and schools can obtain that as well.       Ms. Leach: Also monitoring what your children are seeing on      the Internet is very important. Relating to what the kids are      doing on the Internet is important so you know what they are      looking at. It is the parents' responsibility just as it is      with television to watch what your kid are looking at and      whether you want them to see or not to see. It is illegal to      do things like yell fire when it is inappropriate but that is      a totally different subject, that is a different kind of      expression.       Mr. Herr: I would argue that it is their right to yell      fire, but they have to face the consequences of their actions      which would be prosecution for manslaughter in that case. It      is a valid idea from that person's point of view and whoever      did the acts that were portrayed on that Internet site would      be liable to prosecution under the current laws.                               ____________________
