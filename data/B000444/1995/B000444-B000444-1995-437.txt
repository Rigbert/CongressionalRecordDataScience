  Senator Nunn has just come in the Chamber. Hopefully, he can work out with the Republicans their concerns, and if not I hope we would be prepared to move that.  So as I look down the Republican list, the only nonhabeas amendments left--because we have accepted most of them--are the Abraham amendment, which I believe we can accept, and the Brown amendment, which I hope Senator Brown will come and offer. There are no other nonhabeas amendments on that side.  On the Democratic side, the Kennedy immigration deportation proceeding, I hope we will be able to accept, and hopefully the Nunn provision will be accepted. And they are the only two nonhabeas amendments that we have left after we vote on Specter-Simon and Lieberman. I guess that is it. They are the only two we have--and Brown. If we can get Senator Brown to come and offer his amendment, it will be very helpful.
