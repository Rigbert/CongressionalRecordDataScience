Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act. The legislation is identical to the Dole-Simon bill, S. 230, which was introduced earlier this year in the Senate.  The Humanitarian Air Corridor Act would prohibit U.S. assistance to any country which prohibits or restricts the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance to other countries. The language may sound formal, but behind these abstract words are tired faces and gaunt bodies: the intended recipients of humanitarian aid are desperate people in need--men, women, and especially children, whose very existence hinges on the charity of outsiders. It is the moral obligation, and proud tradition, of the United States to be one of the world's main donors of food, clothing and medical supplies essential to keep them alive. Americans open their hearts to refugees and displaced persons in countries less fortunate than our own. That third countries should impede the delivery of such aid is unacceptable; it should be an obvious and unobjectionable principle of U.S. assistance that countries keeping U.S. humanitarian aid from reaching third countries should not receive U.S. aid.  There may be times, however, when considerations of U.S. national security dictate that the United States should continue to provide aid even to obstructionist countries. For those instances, the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act mandates that the President can make such a determination and inform Congress of his decision.  Mr. Speaker, though the language of the bill is not country specific, it is widely known that Armenia and Turkey would be affected by the legislation. According to official Armenian sources, there are over 300,000 refugees in the country, whom the United States Government has been providing with humanitarian aid. The most cost-effective and direct route for delivery of this assistance is through Turkey. Unfortunately, Turkey has refused to permit transshipment through its territory, which necessitates expensive, and not always reliable, rerouting through Georgia.  Ankara has justified its refusal to allow transshipment of United States aid by pointing to the occupation of Azerbaijani territory by Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. Turkey, however, is not a party to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. There is no reason for Turkey, whatever its ties to Azerbaijan, to block the delivery of United States humanitarian aid to Armenia. As a member of the OSCE, Turkey should implement the commitment in the 1991 Moscow document to ``cooperate fully to enable humanitarian relief operations to be undertaken speedily and effectively; to take all necessary steps to facilitate speedy and unhindered access for such relief operations; [and to] make the necessary arrangements for those relief operations to be carried out.'' Furthermore, Turkey is a member of the OSCE's Minsk group, which is charged with arbitrating the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The OSCE document adopted last December in Budapest requests the OSCE's Minsk group to further implement confidence-building measures, particularly in the humanitarian field, and to provide humanitarian aid to people in the region, especially refugees.  Mr. Speaker, I am not blind to the plight of refugees in Azerbaijan. I am well aware that fully one out of every seven people in that country is a refugee. Though section 907 of the 1992 Freedom Support Act prohibits United States Government aid to the Government of Azerbaijan, humanitarian aid is being given through non-governmental organizations. About $30 million in technical assistance, $30 million in food assistance, and $20 million in humanitarian aid has been obligated, and over $60 million has been expended as of December 31, 1994. The need, I know, is much greater, and I am open to considering enhanced aid to address this grave humanitarian situation.  I am also conscious of the significance of Turkey to NATO, and Turkey's longstanding ties to Washington. Those relations are highly valued, and with good reason. It is not the intention of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act to damage those relations or to exacerbate Turkey's already complicated domestic situation. The legislation has one purpose only: to expedite the delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid to people who need it, in the most economical and direct manner possible. I am convinced that the facilitated delivery of such aid will promote a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and will help bring peace to a region that has more than its share of war and refugees. I hope that Ankara, and other capitals that can, or would be, affected by the provisions of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act, view the legislation as it is intended--as a means of helping people in need.                          ____________________
