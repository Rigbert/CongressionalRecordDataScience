 President, I rise to express my strong support for Superior Court Judge Beverly Reid O'Connell's nomination to be a district judge for the Central District of California.  Born in Ventura, CA, Judge O'Connell graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1986 and earned her law degree from Pepperdine University School of Law magna cum laude in 1990. She was managing editor of the Pepperdine Law Review.  Following law school, she worked on complex civil litigation in private practice at the law firm Morrison & Foerster for 5 years. She then joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California, where she served for 10 years, from 1995 through 2005. She handled a number of high profile cases, such as the prosecution of a high ranking member of the Arellano Felix drug cartel.  She was appointed to the Superior Court by former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2005. She has been an outstanding judge, presiding over literally thousands of cases and approximately 150 jury trials. She also has been a proven administrator, serving with great skill as an assistant supervising judge for the North Valley District of the Superior Court.  Simply put, Judge O'Connell has outstanding credentials and an impeccable reputation, and she has received a rating of ``well qualified'' from the American Bar Association--the ABA's highest rating.  I will conclude by saying that I have met with Judge O'Connell, and I have no doubt she will be an excellent addition to the Central District.  I commend Senator Boxer for recommending such a fine candidate to President Obama, and I am pleased her nomination is on the floor today. I hope my colleagues will support her nomination.
