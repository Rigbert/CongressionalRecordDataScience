Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Let me note that I believe the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Greenwood) has injected what I really believe to be a straw man argument when he suggests the issue of insoulment is part of this debate. It is not relevant. We are not talking about insoulment. The real issue before us is the simple but highly profound issue of whether or not it will be legally permissible to create human life for research purposes.  Mr. Speaker, human cloning, if it is not already here, it is certainly on the fast track. It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. It seems to me we have to make sure that just because science possesses the capability to create cloned human beings that it not be permitted to carry out such plans, especially when the newly created humans would be used for the purpose of exploitation, abuse, and destructive experimentation.  Once created human life, Mr. Speaker, can survive a few seconds, a few minutes, a few days, a few weeks, a few months, a few years, perhaps many years to old age. We need to understand the profound truth that life is a continuum.  Earlier in the debate, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Greenwood) stated that research scientists would simply ``stop the process,'' so the newly created human life couldn't mature. Think about those words--stop the process. What does that mean, stop the process? It's a euphemistic way of saying stop the life process--kill it.  Mr. Speaker, finally I remember the debate we had in 1996 when some of our colleagues who routinely vote against the wellbeing of unborn children assured us that they would never support creating human embryos for experimentation. One colleague, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), said ``We should not be involved in the creation of embryos for research. I completely agree with my colleagues on that score.''  Well, not anymore. Now the ever expendable human embryo is to be cloned and abused for the benefit of mankind. And that vigorous opposition to embryo research by colleagues like Mrs. Pelosi exists no more, Such a pity.  In like manner, members who say they oppose human cloning and then vote for Greenwood are either kidding themselves--or us--or both.  Reject Greenwood.                              {time}  1700
