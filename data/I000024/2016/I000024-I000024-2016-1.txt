 So this can happen, and that is why it is in here. I have to say to both Senators from Michigan--and we on this side worked very closely together to make this happen. That wasn't really easy. But now there is an agreement, and I think that is a very important part of this.  Let me mention one of the things the Senator from Oregon made some comments about, about Senator Boxer and me, the things we have done together, and we have. It does show, though, that we can disagree, but that doesn't change my feelings about Senator Boxer.  I want to conclude just by saying something that I don't think people have heard. They talk about the drought provision as if something evil put that together. Well, the White House put it together. It was drafted by the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of Commerce.  The savings clause--we have spoken about that. According to the White House, the savings clause prohibits any Federal agency under any administration from taking any action that would violate any environmental law, including the Endangered Species Act and the biological opinions. Don't take my word for it; just ask Senator Feinstein. We talked about this on the floor.  This was put together by those Departments, and the savings clause that is there is strong. And according to them--not to me; I actually don't know that much about it, but they do because this is their area of specialty--they say this prevents any type of action.  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.
