 Of the 1,963 men and women who have ever served in the U.S. Senate, only six have the distinction of casting 15,000 votes. And of those august six, only Patrick Leahy continues to serve in this body today. The only other members of the 15,000-vote league are Senators Robert C. Byrd, Strom Thurmond, Daniel Inouye, Ted Kennedy, and Ted Stevens.  More important than the number of votes Senator Leahy has cast, however, is the wisdom and courage reflected in his votes.  He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974--part of an historic group of new Senators known as the ``Watergate Babies.''  He has voted time and again to uphold the values of our Constitution--even when it contained some political risk.  His very first vote in this Senate was to authorize the Church Committee--the precursor to today's Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The Church Committee was created to investigate possible illegalities by the CIA, the FBI, and the National Security Agency--and it resulted in major reforms.  As you may know, Senator Leahy is a major Batman fan. In fact, he has made several cameo appearances in Batman movies.  His affinity for the Caped Crusader makes sense. You see, Batman is one of the few superheroes with no superhuman powers. He is simply a man with unusual courage and determination to fight wrongdoing. That is Patrick Leahy, too.  I have served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for more than 18 years. During that time, Senator Leahy has been either our committee chairman or its ranking member.  I have the greatest respect for his fidelity to the rule of law and his determined efforts to safeguard the independence and integrity of America's Federal courts.  He is a champion of human rights at home and abroad.  According to the nonpartisan website GovTrack, Senator Leahy has sponsored more bipartisan bills than any other current member of this Senate. Sixty-one percent of his bills have had both Democratic and Republican cosponsors. In this time of increasingly sharp partisanship, that is a record that we would all do well to emulate.  I am particularly grateful to Senator Leahy for his strong support of a bipartisan bill that I am cosponsoring, along with a broad array of Senators, from Chairman Chuck Grassley to Senator Cory Booker. The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act would make Federal sentencing laws smarter, fairer, more effective, and more fiscally responsible. It passed the Judiciary Committee last week by a vote of 15-5. Senator Leahy's leadership has been critical in building this broad support, and I look forward to the day--in the near future, I hope--when we can celebrate passage of this important measure.  I learned recently that Senator Leahy dedicates all of his fees and royalties from his acting roles to charities. A favorite charity is the Kellogg-Hubbard library in Montpelier, VT, where he read comic books as a child. I hope that there are young boys and girls discovering in that library the same uncommon courage and love of justice that Patrick Leahy found there.  America needs more heroes like Pat Leahy.                    Amendment No. 2587, as Modified
