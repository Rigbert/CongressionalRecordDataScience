President, today marks the 210th anniversary of the Polish Third of May Constitution, which was the first democratic constitution in Europe and the second one in world's history after the American Constitution was ratified in 1788. On May 3, 1791 the Polish Parliament followed the example of the United States and adopted its own written and modern supreme law of the land.  The Constitution signed by the Polish King and the Lithuanian Grand Duke was originally known as the Billon Government and it extended equal protection of the law to every person, including peasants, as well as establishing separation of powers. Although the Constitution formally lasted only for few years until the Third Partition of Poland, today the legacy of this historic document is still alive. It tells us about the grand Polish tradition of democracy, which was crafted in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 18th century, evolved in the Polish Republic after regaining independence in 1917, and was reconfirmed in the early 1990's following the end of the cold war.  Poland's has been a success story in its smooth transition to a liberal democracy with a free market economy. I was proud to cast my vote in the Senate in favor of the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Poland was admitted to NATO on March 12, 1999, and has become a close ally and friend of the United States, which is a home to more than 9 million people of Polish descent. Furthermore, Poland is one of the frontrunners seeking membership in the European Union.  We must continue our support for Poland's successful integration in the Western structures of security and economic cooperation, which promote peace, stability and prosperity across all of Europe. I firmly believe that both America and Poland share the same goal of continuing to enlarge NATO by admitting the Baltic countries into NATO in order to enhance the overall tranquility in the region.  As a Senator of the State of Illinois, where the Polish community is the second largest in the country, I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in congratulating Poland on its remarkable celebration of anniversary of their democratic constitution. I also believe that they will join me in providing their support to Poland's continuing endeavor to contribute to the security and stability of the entire European continent.  The Third May Constitution two centuries ago signaled to the world that Poland entered the family of emerging Western democratic states. Our effort today should be to make sure that Poland's centuries-long commitment to democracy culminates in Poland fulfilling its promise as a full-fledged member of the Western democratic world and ceasing to be discounted as part of Europe's ``grey zone.''                          ____________________
