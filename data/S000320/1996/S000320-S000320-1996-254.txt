 President, I rise today to inform my colleagues in the Senate of another case where a foreign government is punishing an American company for no legitimate reason. The United States must stand up against such actions by foreign governments and end such unfair and unwarranted treatment of our citizens.  Some years ago, two of my constituents, Bill and Allan MacDonald, respected businessmen in Alabama and the United States, invested in Bermuda's struggling cable television system. The MacDonalds were encouraged to make their initial investment by the Bermudian Government because of the poor state of the cable television system. The MacDonalds devoted not only sizeable amounts of time and energy to this effort, but they also invested sizeable amounts of their own money to upgrade the cable television system.  Contrary to the expectations of some Bermudians, the MacDonalds turned the company around and the company began making money. As soon as the business began to do well, some Bermudians began to try to wrest the business away from the MacDonalds. These Bermudian citizens, with the help of their Government, are determined to take control of the company away from the MacDonalds now that the company is doing well. My question to the Senate today is: Will the U.S. Government let this happen?  Mr. President, the U.S. Government and the State Department in particular must do a better job of protecting U.S. businesses operating abroad. We must make sure that foreign countries know that we will not tolerate unfair trade practices against American companies or citizens.  Mr. President, I do not know if we can get the Bermudian Government to treat the MacDonalds fairly, but one thing we can do is make sure that Bermudian companies do not receive more favorable treatment in the United States than United States companies receive in Bermuda. It is my understanding that a Bermudian company, Telebermuda, has applied for a general landing license to the Federal Communications Commission [FCC]. Under U.S. law the FCC may not grant such a license without the approval of theSecretary of State. In addition, this same law states that ``the President [FCC] may withhold * * * such license when he shall be satisfied after notice and hearings that such action will assist . . . in maintaining the rights or interests of the United States or of its citizens in foreign countries * * * .'' I have requested the Secretary of State to withhold his approval of Telebermuda's license application, until the case involving my constituents is resolved.  Mr. President, this case is not only important to my constituents, it is important for all businesses who operate overseas. It is our duty to ensure that they are treated fairly. We cannot allow foreign governments to take advantage of U.S. businesses. If the Bermudian telephone monopoly or other Bermudian interests want to buy the MacDonalds interest in Bermuda Cable they should pay the fair market price for the MacDonalds interest in the company. Mr. President, I am not asking for special treatment for the MacDonalds, but I believe they are entitled to receive justice.  Mr. President, I hope that the Bermudian Government will reexamine this situation involving my constituents and determine that it is in their best interest to treat all businesses fairly and not punish people because they are from the United States or other foreign countries.                          ____________________
