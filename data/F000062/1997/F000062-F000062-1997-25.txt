 President, I thank the ranking member of the committee and I also thank the chairman of the committee.  I was very pleased to hear the chairman's statement that it is his belief that Mr. Kennard possesses an ``unblemished reputation'' for candor and integrity. I appreciate his comments and believe they have been well stated.  As California's Senator, I am particularly pleased to rise in support of the President's nomination.  Bill Kennard has very strong California roots. He was born in Los Angeles. He graduated with honors from my alma mater, Stanford University. He then attended Yale Law School.  Bill Kennard's family also has strong California roots. His father, Robert Kennard, now deceased, was a very well-regarded architect in the Los Angeles area. He formed the largest continuously operating African-American architectural practice in the western United States and also served as the founding member of the National Organization of Minority Architects.  His mother, I want this body to know, is also a distinguished person. She grew up in the great Central Valley of California. She received a master's degree in bilingual education and has worked in the field of bilingual education in Los Angeles.
