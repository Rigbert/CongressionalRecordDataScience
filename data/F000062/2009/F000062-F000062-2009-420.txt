 President, I am pleased to introduce, along with Senators Grassley and Bayh, the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act of 2009.  Over the last 2 years, Federal, State, and local law enforcement have increasingly seen drug dealers flavoring and marketing their illegal drugs to appeal to minors, using techniques like combing drugs with candy and other flavorings to entice younger users. This bill would increase the criminal penalties that apply when criminals do this. This bill will ensure these appalling tactics are criminalized and severely punished.  The problem of flavoring illegal drugs to entice minors is well documented. A 2007 USA Today Article entitled ``Flavored Meth Use on the Rise'' stated that ``reports of candy-flavored methamphetamine are emerging around the nation, stirring concern among police and abuse prevention experts that drug dealers are marketing the drug to younger people.''  The flavoring of meth to appeal to minors is widespread across the Nation. In California, police have made repeated seizures of strawberry-flavored meth and local drug counselors warn that it also comes in cola, cherry, and orange flavors.  Strawberry flavoring packets were found in a meth lab raid in Arkansas in May of 2007. Similar seizures of flavored meth have been made in Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, and Virginia. Two people were arrested for manufacturing cotton candy flavored meth in Colorado in March of 2008.  The candying and flavoring of controlled substances is not limited to methamphetamine. As recently as March of this year, the DEA seized 1\1/2\ pounds of strawberry flavored powdered cocaine in Modesto, CA.  DEA agents in California have also purchased cocaine with lemon, coconut, and cinnamon flavoring. It has also documented other controlled substances like marijuana and hash oil infused into candy bars and soda pop.  Drug dealers are even selling boxes of ``Pot Tarts'' that look exactly like commercial available Pop Tarts.  Federal, State and local law enforcement all agree that such flavoring is done to entice more minors to use these illegal drugs.  This bill would help address this growing problem by criminalizing the flavoring, coloring and marketing of such drugs and would impose enhanced penalties for these offenses.  Under current law, there is already an enhanced penalty if someone distributes drugs to a minor. The maximum sentence is doubled, and tripled for a repeat offense, and there is a minimum of at least a year in prison. But this enhancement only applies if there is an actual distribution of the drug to a minor. Even possession with intent to distribute flavored or candied drugs doesn't qualify.  This bill would fix this loophole. If someone manufactures, creates, distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute a schedule I or II controlled substance that is combined with a candy, marketed or packaged to appear similar to a candy product, or modified by flavoring or coloring with the intent to sell to a minor, they would face enhanced penalties.  The bill sends a strong and clear message to drug dealers--if you flavor or candy up your drugs to make them more appealing to our children, there will be a very heavy price to pay. It will make drug dealers think twice before flavoring up their drugs, and punish them appropriately if they don't.  The bill is supported by the National Narcotics Officers Association Coalition, which is comprised of 44 State narcotics officers' associations.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 258       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
