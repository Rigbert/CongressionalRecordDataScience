 Reclaiming my time, very interesting comments he makes. Of course, he leaves out some things. He talks about the jobs that were lost. Those jobs were lost of course as this administration took office. This administration has gained back 2 million of the 8 million jobs that were lost during the economic program that my friend from Virginia voted for, for the most part. Eight million jobs were lost. And the month that this administration took office in January, 780,000 jobs in one month were lost, the last month of the Bush administration. That's not very distant past.  But let me tell you, I heard the same rhetoric--you said you've changed, I heard the same rhetoric in 1993, same rhetoric when we adopted a program that we said would balance the budget, bring the economy back and create jobs. The same rhetoric, oh, no, you won't do it. The program that you're going to adopt--none of which you voted for, you weren't here, I understand that--but the same rhetoric applied. You thought we were going to tank the economy, kill jobs, explode the deficit and have high unemployment. In fact, as my friend well knows--he didn't read those statistics because he thinks they're ancient history because you opposed that policy. But that policy created 22 million jobs. That's a 30 million job difference between the Bush administration that was the follow-on administration and the Clinton administration. Thirty million job difference, I tell my friend, under the policies that you adopted and you supported in the 2000s.  So I would hope that my friend's comments are correct, that you have decided to change. In point of fact, we need change. And in point of fact, the American public--which is divided itself, but would like us to come together, and I'm hopeful that we'll do that. And my friend and I have had the opportunity to talk about this. We do have significant differences. But none of us can put something on the table and say if you don't agree, I'm going to tank the economy, I'm going to have America default for the first time in its 200-plus years of history if you don't agree and do it my way.  I have said, the leader has said on this side, everything is on the table.We understand that you have to pay for what you buy, and we also understand we have to buy less, and we are prepared to do both.                              {time}  1230  In fact, we have agreed to do both in the Biden talks.  Now, my friend talks about economists. The most successful investor in America, I think most people will agree, is Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett said we raised the debt ceiling seven times during the Bush administration. And now in this Congress, under the Republicans, they're using it as a hostage, and you really don't have any business playing Russian roulette to get your way in some matter. We should, he said, be more grown up on that. To that extent, he echoed the comments of our Speaker, who is trying, in my opinion, to get to a place where we can come together, compromise--as is critical in a democracy--pay our bills, and reduce our obligations and reduce spending. Buffett went on to say we should, as I said, be more grown up on that.  If we don't meet the August 2 deadline, he observed, you're playing with fire when you don't need to play with fire. And we don't need to tell the rest of the world that any time people in Congress start throwing a tantrum, that we're not going to pay our bills. That is not responsible behavior. It's not adult behavior. It's not good for anybody in the United States of America, and it's not good for the international community.  In fact, Senator Alan Simpson was referring to Tom Coburn, who has said, look, you've got to have everything on the table, including, yes, revenues; yes, taxes.  Some bard has said that taxes are the price we pay for democracy. They should not be any higher than they need to be, but we ought to pay for what we buy. And if we don't, if people don't want to pay for it, we ought not to buy it.  Unfortunately, the reason we racked up $6 trillion of deficits during the Reagan and both Bush administrations is because we bought things and didn't pay for them. As you heard me say at the White House, we, both parties--you weren't here--voted for some things and didn't pay for them. We've got to stop that. That's why we put in place statutory PAYGO.  But, very frankly, you say, Well, we've changed. You passed a budget that doesn't balance the budget for the next 27 years. You passed the budget. You voted for that. I didn't vote for that budget. It doesn't balance the budget for 27 years, almost three decades. Very frankly, I don't think that does it.  That's why we went down to the White House yesterday, and almost everybody in the room said we need to do a comprehensive, disciplined, courageous, honest, principled resolution of doing what you say you want to do, that your party wants to do, and what I'm telling you, my friend, we want to do because there is no option. We must bring this deficit down. We must. The debt we have confronting us is not sustainable.  So I would urge my friend, and I want to congratulate Speaker Boehner, who at the White House said, Look, we need to do this and we need to have a comprehensive agreement. That's what democracy demands.  I'm not going to agree with some of the things that are in that bill. You're not going to agree with some of the things that are in that bill, if, in fact, we pass a bill. But if we come together, if we act as adults, if we do what every responsible financial economist and adviser has told us we must do, then America will be pleased with us.  But I tell my friend from Virginia, if we don't do that, if we continue to buy things that we don't pay for and we continue to ask the people to get it for free, then frankly your children, and my grandchildren and children and great-grandchildren, will not be happy with us.  So I urge my friend--he and I will be going to the White House on Sunday. I urge him to come to the table, as I will come to the table. I tell him, with the understanding that compromise is essential, that the crisis that confronts us is real and that America expects us to act in their best interest and have the courage--not the politics, not the ego, not the view of the next election--but the view of the long term, as we come together and try to confront this issue for which all of us are responsible. No one party, no one member. All of us are responsible. But then again, if that is the case, we are all responsible for its resolution.  I yield to the gentleman.
