It was my impression that the managers' amendment would simply be tax amendments with respect to the Internal Revenue Code and the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.  I am a bit surprised, frankly, coming this evening and seeing something that is not within the traditional scope of the Finance Committee. Perhaps I might be wrong. This is something I didn't expect, but I must be very fair and accurate that this was not an issue we even discussed.  My presumption was that all the amendments would be strictly related to tax provisions and not to this Compassionate Capital Fund. I must say, I understand that the funds have been appropriated under the context of this Compassionate Capital Fund. This is an attempt to provide legislative language. I have not had a chance to look at the language. It is included within a managers' amendment without any opportunity to amend the managers' amendment. I am in an awkward position.
