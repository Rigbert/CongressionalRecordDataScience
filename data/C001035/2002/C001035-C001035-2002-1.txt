President, I oppose this adjournment resolution. While I am eager to return home to Maine, there is critical unfinished business here in Washington. We should not adjourn prior to passing a prescription drug benefit for our seniors as well as legislation to remedy inadequate Medicare reimbursements that are jeopardizing the viability of our home health agencies, rural hospitals, and nursing homes. Cuts in Medicare are also discouraging physicians from accepting Medicare patients.  These health care problems should be solved now, not delayed until next year. Medicare reimbursements must be adequate to cover the costs borne by health care providers in caring for our seniors and disabled citizens. And our elderly have already waited too long for prescription drug coverage.  Finally, we should have given final approval to legislation authored by Senators Nelson, Smith, Rockefeller, and myself to increate Medicaid rates to provide fiscal relief to the States and to prevent cuts in health care for low-income families.
