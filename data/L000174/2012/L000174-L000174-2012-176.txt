276, a bill reauthorizing the surveillance provisions of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which is set to expire at the end of this year. The Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General have both stated that reauthorization of these important national security authorities is the ``top legislative priority of the Intelligence Community.''  After the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported its reauthorization bill, I asked for a sequential referral. Senator Grassley joined me in that request. It was for a limited time and had we not completed our markup last Thursday, time might well have expired for this committee to act on it. I was surprised last week and since to be criticized for seeking to improve thebill within its four corners. I thought that was why we sought the sequential referral, in order to consider and improve the bill where we could.  I worked with Senator Feinstein, the chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence. We came to an understanding and she supported the substitute amendment I offered to shorten the sunset and add more accountability and oversight protections. I thank her for that. I am always willing to work with the Senator from California, who is so diligent in her efforts on the Intelligence Committee. We reached a good compromise and agreement.  I had circulated the core of my amendment, to shorten the sunset, back on July 11, before the bill was to be considered. At the request of Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, the bill was held over. I protected their right to do so under our rules. We finally proceeded to the bill last Thursday, July 19. Despite the delay, no Republicans spoke to me about any potential amendments to the bill.  Instead, the evening before the delayed markup, for the first time, Republican offices circulated scores of amendments. It is unfortunate that there have been mischaracterizations of our committee process. Contrary to the statements of some on the other side, no one was precluded from offering an amendment. In fact, a number were offered by Republican Senators. The committee proceeded to vote on Senator Kyl's amendment, for example, to create a new material support of terrorism offense in title 18, and rejected it after Senator Feinstein argued against including it on this important measure, despite her support for the substance of the amendment. We proceeded to vote on Senator Lee's amendment, which was about FISA surveillance, and it, too, was defeated. So despite the misstatements to the contrary, the committee proceeded to consider and reject amendments.  There came a point during our initial 2-hour markup when Senator Feinstein urged that amendments about matters not involving the FISA Amendments Act extension be considered on other vehicles at other times, and moved to table amendments. Those motions prevailed. We have had such motions before and sometimes they succeed.  After 2 hours, as Republican Senators left, we lost a quorum and had to reconvene to vote on reporting the bill as amended to the Senate. I thank those Senators from both sides of the aisle who reconvened. The committee voted to report the measure and was able to do so within the short timeframe of our sequential referral.  The FISA Amendments Act legislation is a top priority of the administration and our intelligence community. We have all acknowledged that. The ranking member acknowledged that it is ``a program vital to our national security.'' A number of Republicans proclaimed last week that they were ready to expedite consideration of the measure and would not offer amendments. Then, when the committee adopted the June 2015 sunset date instead of one of the 2017 dates in other versions of the bill, they changed position and sought to use it as a vehicle for extraneous matters and to offer a number of riders to it that were rejected. I do not understand that logic and why the change in the sunset date or the addition of oversight provisions should change the character of the bill or its importance to our national security. The bill is needed to continue the authority to conduct electronic surveillance of non-U.S. persons overseas under certain procedures approved by the FISA Court.  The Justice Department and DNI have told us:       [It] is vital in keeping the Nation safe. It provides      information about the plans and identities of terrorists,      allowing us to glimpse inside terrorist organizations and      obtain information about how those groups function and      receive support. In addition, it lets us collect information      about the intentions and capabilities of weapons      proliferators and other foreign adversaries who threaten the      United States. Failure to reauthorize Section 702 would      result in a loss of significant intelligence and impede the      ability of the intelligence community to respond quickly to      new threats and intelligence opportunities.  The committee agreed with Senator Feinstein when she asked us not to open the bill up to ``extraneous amendments.'' As it was, the committee considered half a dozen amendments offered by Republican Senators. I appreciated Senator Kyl volunteering to have his staff convene a meeting to consider amendments to our terrorist statutes that he does not think will be controversial.  Notably, the vast majority of the amendments filed and offered by the Republicans would not have changed or added a single word to either the underlying bill or the underlying statute. Senator Lee's amendment was the only Republican amendment that dealt in any way with the relevant FISA authorities. That amendment received an up-or-down vote by the committee, and most Republican members voted against it.  Once it became clear that the Republican Senators intended to offer a series of extraneous amendments, Senator Feinstein moved to table amendments that were not germane to her bill. She has that right. I protect the rights of all members of the committee, Republicans and Democrats. Four such amendments were tabled, but notably they were tabled by a vote of the full committee, not simply through a ruling by the chairman or my making up rules, as Republican chairmen have done in the past. Indeed, although a motion to table is typically not subject to debate, I asked the committee's indulgence to permit such discussion. No Senator was cut off from offering amendments or engaging in debate.  It is telling that the two amendments that Senator Grassley offered during the committee's consideration of the FISA Amendments Act had absolutely no connection whatsoever with the provisions of title VII of FISA. The first amendment that Senator Grassley offered would have added the death penalty as a punishment to certain crimes involving weapons of mass destruction. The second amendment that he offered would have required a Department of Justice Inspector General audit of criminal wiretap applications from 2009 to 2010. This amendment may be important to Senator Grassley in the context of the Fast and Furious controversy, but it certainly is not relevant to the FISA Amendments Act. Senator Feinstein moved to table both amendments and the motion carried each time.  Let us be accurate, Republican members of the committee were afforded the opportunity to offer amendments, even ones outside the scope of the legislation. The committee has a process, and we followed that process.  I understand that Republican Senators are disappointed that they were not able to use the FISA Amendments Act legislation as a vehicle to carry other legislation. I am disappointed that, as with so many good bills the committee has reported, there was so little Republican support for a measure that everyone concedes is vital to our national security. Like the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which received no Republican vote on this committee; and the Second Chance Act, which received no Republican votes on this committee after a number of Republican amendments were considered and even though it had been a program strongly supported by Republicans historically; the FISA Amendments Act Sunsets Extension Act was not supported by a single Republican Senator on this committee.  Let me remind Senators, again, that the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General have emphasized that the reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act is the intelligence community's ``top legislative priority.'' I encourage any Senator who has not yet done so to review the classified information that the administration has provided to Congress about the implementation of the FISA Amendments Act. This is a measure that requires serious debate and swift action not partisan bickering or baseless accusations. I sincerely hope that we can set aside the election year posturing and press ahead with consideration of this important national security measure. The American people deserve no less.                          ____________________
