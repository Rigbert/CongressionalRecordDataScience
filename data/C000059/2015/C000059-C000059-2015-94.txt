Chairman, I just rise in support of the amendment. I know the State of North Carolina opposed the rule and passed the legislation a few months ago to block these EPA regulations. I suspect it is not the only State that may have these concerns. Let's let the market drive manufacturers toward producing lower emission wood heaters.  I support the gentleman's amendment and urge an ``aye'' vote. I hope that everybody who supports this amendment would also vote for the bill for final passage.
