 President. This is the only solution to the problem. What is tragic, we know as a result of a letter from the so-called blue dog Democrats, the more conservative Democrats in the House, to Speaker Pelosi for sure that there is a bipartisan majority in the House for passing the bill the Senate passed. This is what the blue dog Democrats had to say to the Speaker.       Following the Senate's passage of a FISA bill, it will be      necessary for the House to quickly consider FISA legislation      to get a bill to the President before the Protect America Act      expires.  That, of course, will be Saturday.       We--  Referring to the blue dog Democrats----     fully support the Rockefeller-Bond FISA legislation, should      it reach the House floor without substantial change. We      believe these components will ensure a strong national      security apparatus that can thwart terrorism across the globe      and save American lives in our country.  The blue dog Democrats, coupled with House Republicans, make it absolutely certain there is a bipartisan majority for our bill in the House.       Further, the consequences of not passing such a measure      could place our national security at undue risk.  This is 21 blue dog Democrats in the House requesting the Speaker to take up the bill that passed the Senate with 69 votes, obviously an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, pass it and send it to the President for signature. This refusal to act is stunning, almost incomprehensible.
