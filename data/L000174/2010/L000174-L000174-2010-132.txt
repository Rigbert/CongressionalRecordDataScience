President, on July 1 of this year, the Judiciary Committee received a letter from LT Zachary W. Prager. He serves in the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps. He writes:       I was a student at Harvard Law School under Ms. Kagan and      commissioned into the Navy. . . . I am grateful to Dean Kagan      for her leadership on military recruiting, as well as the      myriad of other positive impacts that she had on my law      school experience. I would not be serving today--  Referring to the military--     without it. She has earned my most heartfelt support for her      nomination.  This is a member of the military who felt Dean Kagan helped greatly with him joining the military.  As the dean of Harvard Law School, Elena Kagan worked hard to find ways to both enforce the school's nondiscrimination policy and allow the military to recruit Harvard students.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lieutenant Prager's letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: I write in support of Solicitor      General Elena Kagan's nomination to the United States Supreme      Court. I am a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate      General's Corps. I was a student at Harvard Law School under      Ms. Kagan and commissioned into the Navy upon graduation in      2007. Without Ms. Kagan's leadership and evenhandedness as      Dean, I would not have joined the military,       Dean Kagan set a standard at Harvard of respect for      military servicemembers, while still expressing her      opposition to the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. She made it      clear that Harvard Law School would fight the policy, but      never impugn the soldiers, sailors and airmen who came to      Harvard to recruit. Her guidance on this issue permeated      throughout her administration, from the Dean of Student's      Office to the Office of Career Services. Like many students,      I was reticent to join an institution that practices overt      discrimination. The environment they established opened the      door for me to consider the military as a career path. Their      example helped clear my reservations.       My decision to join the Navy was welcomed by Dean Kagan's      administration. Military service was valued the same as any      other public interest job. At a dinner to honor those of us      entering public service, I dined next to public defenders,      federal prosecutors and human rights activists. Notably, I      now serve in the Navy alongside another classmate, and alumni      from my class serve in the Marine Corps and Army Judge      Advocate General's Corps.       I am proud to serve in the Navy and I love my job. I      completed a deployment to Iraq and leave soon for my next      tour overseas in Japan. I am grateful to Dean Kagan for her      leadership on military recruiting, as well as the myriad of      other positive impacts that she had on my law school      experience. I would not be serving today without it. She has      earned my most heartfelt support for her nomination.           Very Respectfully,                                                   Zachary Prager.
