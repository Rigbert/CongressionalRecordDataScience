 Mr. President, I rise to ask for a unanimous consent agreement so we can set in order the speakers that we have left on our side. I see you have several on your side as well, so perhaps we can work together to do this. But we have remaining Senator Conrad, who would like 7 minutes; Senator Levin who would like 2 minutes; Senator Schumer would like 5 minutes, and I would like 1 minute to offer an amendment on behalf of Senator Harkin. If we could set in order a time on those, we would be happy to go back and forth with the Members on your side who would like to speak.
