  The United States is the leader in the biotechnology industry, and I am proud to say that California has the nation's largest concentration of health care technology companies. California, alone, is home to over 2,500 biomedical companies and employs over 241,000 people in health care technology and biomedical and clinical research fields. California's health care technology companies are producing leading edge products, for example, the first new therapy for cystic fibrosis in 30 years, Genetech; technology that enables doctors to do heart surgery without opening the chest cavity, Heartport; a cancer drug that is genetically engineered and stimulates the bone marrow to produce important white blood cells, Amgen; linear accelerators for treating cancer, Varian; and intraocular eye lenses, Allergan.  Biotechnology has enabled us to reduce hospital stays, to detect cancer and other life-threatening illnesses earlier in order to begin treatments earlier; to attack diseases cell by cell to eliminate unnecessary side effects, and to use vaccines to prevent abnormal cell growth. This is a critical time in biotechnology, as scientists continue to make strides in cellular and genetic research, and I am hopeful that this work will improve our health and well-being. I am confident that as this industry continues to grow, we will see treatments to greatly improve the lives of millions of Americans, and we will see cures to illnesses that we did not think were possible.  I commend the more than 150,000 employees of the biotech industry nationwide and join them in observing January as National Biotechnology Month.
