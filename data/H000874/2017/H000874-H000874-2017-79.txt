 I simply say to my friend, had I instructed or the leader instructed, that outcome may have been different. However, there are some really substantive issues that we had, we had for a longtime, we negotiated for a long time, and we didn't reach agreement.  My question to you was: Are they offset? I think your answer was, yes, they were offset, and then you proceeded to tell me what the offsets were.  Now, let me ask you a follow-up question to that.  Does the gentleman know whether the repeal of IPAB is offset? That is a $17 billion deficit creation item. Is it offset?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. If the gentleman's question is if IPAB is offset, it doesn't need to be.
