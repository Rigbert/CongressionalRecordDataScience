President, I wish we were not in the situation we are in. I would like to see a farm bill done in the normal course. In 1990, when we did the Leahy-Lugar farm bill, it was a comprehensive package that blended the needs and interests of urban and rural America with the need to maintain and reclaim our environmental heritage as well as to provide the food and fiber needed in this country.  We seem to be operating under a different situation. I hope that the final package we have here will have a bipartisan nature to it. The other body determined that they cannot do that. I believe we are different in this body, and I believe that we can. We have always approached farm legislation that way, and this is no different.  As I approached the farm bill year, I asked myself the following question, and it is a question that I believe every Member in this body needs to ask him or herself.  What is a farm bill?  In 1996, a farm bill is no longer just about farm programs. It is not just about growing crops or amber waves of grain.  The farm bill is about feeding the American people. It is about the elimination of hunger in one of the wealthiest nations in the world.  The farm bill ensures that children do not go to bed hungry--at home and abroad.  Congress created the world's most cost-efficient and effective nutrition programs.  These programs are the lifeline for millions of Americans--especially children in need of Government assistance.  Except for the 26 million Americans on food stamps, most Americans do not realize that food stamps are America's best and largest child nutrition program.  Most Americans are not aware that the authority for the food stamp and other nutrition programs expired last year.  Today, we have the opportunity to reauthorize these nutrition programs and maintain this safety net for millions of at-risk Americans.  Quite simply, this is a moral question.  The farm bill is about safety--knowing that the food supply of our children and our children's children is safe.  When our children drink a glass of water, we know it is free of pesticides. When our children buy a school lunch or grab a snack after school, their parents and teachers know it is safe to eat.  The farm bill is about the environment. It is about responsibility to conservation and the legacy we leave to future generations.  I have said twice this year on the Senate floor that the historical basis for the present commodity programs has disappeared.  And, I know that they are important to the 2 to 3 percent of the population that they directly serve. But, these programs, as presently structured make less and less sense to the majority of the population.  There is a real reason that taxpayers should make payments to farmers and ranchers. It is simple and clear justification for commodity programs and Americans understand it.  Farmers and ranchers manage half of the land in the United States. Yes, half of the land in the United States.  Farmers and ranchers, however, need the help of taxpayers to implement innovative, valued environmental solutions to maintain this land.  It is impossible to solve our clean water problems, wetland and wildlife problems except through a positive incentive program that should form the basis of the agricultural program of the next century.  We have accomplished that in this legislation. For the first time there will be incentives to help all farmers and ranchers be the good neighbors that they have always worked to be by allowing them ways to control the agricultural-related pollution that affects our rural and urban communities.  Bottom line, this package will provide a future farm program that will fund conservation-based farm programs that benefit every American and it will help all farmers and ranchers who control pollution and steward sensitive lands--not just those who produce major crops.  It is a good package. Can we do better? Sure, we could, by going through the normal course. The last time we had a 5-year farm bill, it took 7 days--an all-time record. These things sometime take a long time. I wish we could have come to agreement with the proposal the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, and I, along with Senator Daschle and Senator Dole, made to our respective caucuses last Thursday. In my mind that was the best of all possible worlds.  That has not been found acceptable. I think that is unfortunate. I think we could have had more enthusiasm and voted for it had that happened. Now we have what we have.  A farm bill should also be responsive to the needs of a region with special circumstances. This farm bill does that by consenting to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The compact is State law in the each of the six New England States and is strongly supported by New England's governors.  The compact is a grassroots effort designed to set fair and stable milk prices that will benefit farmers and consumers. The New England States are not asking for anything but to go forward with this effort. All year we have heard about the need to give more power back to the States. This is an opportunity for Congress to do just that.  Later during this debate there will be an amendment to deal with national dairy policy. It is not perfect but it is a good start, and certain issues will need to be resolved in the House-Senate conference. It eliminates the assessment farmers have to pay for the dairy program, and phases down price supports. It saves $80 million over 7 years, not bad for a program that cost only $4 million last year.  This amendment will also protect and reform the Federal milk marketing orders and allow our dairy producers to compete internationally by fully funding the Dairy Export Incentive Program.                 restoration of the florida everglades
