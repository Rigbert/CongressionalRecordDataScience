 This is the wrong place to consider this. As the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, the committee is going to be taking up this question about the whole scope of Legal Services. I know that my friend from Texas has a problem with the entire entity of Legal Services. He would like to wipe it all out, period, under any circumstances, for any reason. This is not the place to do this.  I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote against it, or if it is a tabling motion, vote to table it. Let us fight this out on the whole of the future of Legal Services, not on a welfare bill.
