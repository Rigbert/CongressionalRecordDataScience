President, I am pleased to rise today with Senator Jeffords to introduce legislation that will allow the National Guard to participate fully in international sports competitions. Currently, members of the National Guard are involved in a myriad of athletic and small arms competitions, but their authority for such activities is unclear. This legislation will make it easier for the Guard to support the competitions and allow them to use their funds and facilities for such events. This is basic but necessary legislation.  The National Guard is already participating in these events. The Vermont National Guard hosted the 2001 Conseil International du Sport Militaire, CISM, World Military Ski Championships at the Stowe ski area this month. This military ski event united military personnel from more than 30 countries, promoting friendship and mutual understanding through sports. More than 350 international athletes competed in such events as the biathlon, giant slalom, cross country, and military patrol race. They tested their skill and mettle in the beautiful Green Mountains, where the recent nor'easter added to the already bountiful snow cover there.  But it takes a lot more than a 3-foot base of powder to carry off these competitions. It takes clear authorities, regulations, and resources. This legislation will allows these important events to continue with full participation of the National Guard. I urge the Senate to join Senator Jeffords and me in sponsoring this legislation and moving it quickly through the legislative process.  I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 658       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CONDUCT OF SMALL ARMS COMPETITIONS AND ATHLETIC                    COMPETITIONS BY THE NATIONAL GUARD.       (a) Preparation and Participation Generally.--Section 504      of title 32, United States Code, is amended--       (1) in subsection (a)--       (A) by striking ``or'' at the end of paragraph (2);       (B) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting:       ``(3) prepare for and participate in small arms      competition; or''; and       (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:       ``(4) prepare for and participate in qualifying athletic      competitions.''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:       ``(c)(1) Units of the National Guard may conduct a small      arms competition or qualifying athletic competition in      conjunction with training required under this chapter if such      activity (treating the activity as of it were a provision of      services) meets the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1),      (3), and (4) of section 508(a) of this title.       ``(2) Facilities and equipment of the National Guard,      including military property and vehicles described in section      508(c) of this title, may be used in connection with      activities carried out under paragraph (1).       ``(3) Except as otherwise provided in an applicable      provision of an appropriations Act, amounts appropriated for      the National Guard may be used to pay the costs of activities      carried out under this subsection and expenses incurred by      members of the National Guard in engaging in activities under      paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (a), including      participation fees, costs of attendance, costs of travel, per      diem, costs of clothing, costs of equipment, and related      expenses.       ``(d) In this section, the term `qualifying athletic      competition' means a competition in an athletic event that      necessarily involves demonstrations by the competitors of--       ``(1) skills relevant to the performance of military      duties; or       ``(2) physical fitness consistent with the standards that      are applicable to members of the National Guard in      evaluations of the physical readiness of members for military      duty in the members' armed force.''.       (b) Clerical Amendments.--(1) The heading of such section      is amended to read as follows:     ``Sec. 504. National Guard schools; small arms competitions;        athletic competitions''.       (2) The item relating to such section in the table of      sections at the beginning of chapter 5 of title 32, United      States Code, is amended to read as follows:``504. National Guard schools; small arms competitions; athletic               competitions.''.                                  ____                           Sectional Analysis       Section XXX amends 32 U.S.C. Sec. 504 to allow the National      Guard to use appropriated funds to support certain costs of      members of the National Guard involved with small arms and      other athletic training and competitions to promote morale      and military readiness. Although the Department of Defense      (DOD), Air Force (USAF), and Army (DA) regulations allow use      of appropriated funds to support sports programs, there are      some things under general fiscal law principles for which      appropriated funds can not be used, unless specifically      authorized by law. The Active Components cover these costs      with non-appropriated funds. Unlike the Air Force and the      Army, the National Guard receives no non-appropriated funds      for Morale, Welfare, Recreation (MWR) sports activities and,      therefore, can not cover costs associated with sports      programs with such funds. Section XXX addresses this      inconsistency and provides authority for NGB to spend      appropriated funds on items the Active Components generally      cover with non-appropriated funds.       Departmental, national, and international sports      competition programs are run by the Army and the Air Force.      AR 215-1 and AFI 34-107 outline the requirements for soldier/     airmen athletes to apply to compete at this higher level as      individuals or as part of departmental teams. 10 U.S.C.      Sec. 717 provides specific statutory authority to use      appropriated funds to purchase personal furnishings for      soldier/airmen competitors at this level. This authority,      however, can not be used to support the NG sports program      because implementing regulations require control and approval      at the departmental level. DODD 1330.4, AR 215-1, chap. 8,      AFI 34-107. The NG competitive sports program, as with other      MACOM level and below sports programs within the Active      Components, maintains intramural level sports programs to      support athletes who will train to compete for positions on      the departmental teams authorized by 10 U.S.C. Sec. 717.      Section XXX authorizes the NG to use appropriated funds to      support a MACOM level sports program on par with Active      Component MACOMs.       Section XXX places two limits on NGB sports activities to      ensure any training, participation, or holding of sports      events enhances military readiness. First, the amendment      allows preparation for and participation in sports events      that ``require skills relevant to military duties or involve      aspects of physical fitness that are evaluated by the     armed forces in determining whether a member of the National      Guard is fit for military duty.'' Second, the amendment      requires the National Guard hold only sports events that      ``meet the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1), (3), and      (4) of section 508(a)'' of title 32, United States Code. This      limitation allows the National Guard Bureau to hold sporting      events only if: (1) such event ``does not adversely affect      the quality of training or otherwise interfere with the      ability of a member or unit of the National Guard to perform      the military functions of the member or unit; (2) ``National      Guard personnel will enhance their military skills as a      result of'' participation in the sports event; and (3) the      event ``will not result in a significant increase in the cost      of the training.'' 32 U.S.C. 508(a)(1), (3), (4). These      limitations safeguard one of the purposes of competitive      sporting events within DOD, namely to enhance military      readiness.
