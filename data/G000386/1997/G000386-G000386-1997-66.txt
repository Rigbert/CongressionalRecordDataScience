 President, I rise today to introduce the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1997. This bill, which I am introducing with Senator Durbin, will tighten bankruptcy laws and do much to stem the tide of casual bankruptcies. With bankruptcy filings at all time record highs, it's imperative that Congress enact serious and tough reforms of the consumer bankruptcy chapters.  By far, the most pressing bankruptcy policy question facing America today relates to the explosion of consumer bankruptcies. Last April, I chaired a hearing on the crisis in consumer bankruptcies. While there's not much agreement about the root causes of therise in consumer bankruptcies, it's obvious that Congress needs to do something now--before the economy takes a downturn--to reverse this trend. At the present time, the economy is doing well and unemployment is low. Inflation is under control.  But we know there are always potholes on the road to economic prosperity. And we know that when the economy declines, bankruptcies increase. With so many bankruptcies now, when times are good, I shudder to think of the strains we will face if we hit a recession. Clearly, Congress needs to act while the economy is still in good shape.  The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act will discourage casual bankruptcies by sending a clear signal that you can't file for bankruptcy and walk away from your debts if you have the ability to re-pay some portion of those debts. This is a simple and straightforward idea whose time has come. According to my research, Congress considered reserving bankruptcy relief for only those Americans who can't re-pay their debts as far back as 1932. So, what we're proposing is not based on some unprecedented concept, but instead has a long and distinguished history.  The bill I'm introducing today amends section 707(b) of the bankruptcy code to permit bankruptcy judges to transfer debtors to chapter 13, or dismiss a case outright, if the debtor could re-pay 20 percent or more of their nonpriority unsecured debts. And the bill changes current law to let creditors bring motions to bankruptcy judges to have debtors moved to chapter 13 or have their cases dismissed. This means that creditors can be the masters of their own destiny. The bankruptcy code should not prevent creditors from even presenting evidence that debtors who could repay their debts are abusing the bankruptcy code and walking away scott-free.  The bill also allows private chapter 7 trustees to bring motions under the new section 707(b). And if they win on their motion, and the debtor is either dismissed or transferred to chapter 13, the private trustee will be reimbursed for attorney's fees. As an added incentive for the private trustees, if they win on a section 707(b) motion, the court can order the debtor's attorney fined and make that fine payable to the trustee. Thus, there will be a army of trustees looking for debtors who shouldn't be in bankruptcy. This will cause people to think twice before rushing to declare bankruptcy. And that's a very positive reform.  However, in order to forge a bipartisan compromise, the bill doesn't make ability to repay the only factor in determining whether to transfer or dismiss a case. Instead, each debtor's individual circumstances will be examined. In this way, our bill avoids the injustice which can accompany a crude formula with practically no exceptions.  I'm also very aware that there have been abuses by creditors using harsh and abusive tactics to collect debts from people who have declared bankruptcy. So, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act contains an entire title--title II--dedicated to enhancing consumer protections by requiring judges to impose stiff penalties for abusive conduct and frivolous court filings. As a strong supporter of rule 11 reform, I believe that Congress should crack down on groundless court filings which some creditors have used to harass and intimidate debtors.  I also believe that the Grassley-Durbin bill will encourage alternative dispute resolution and out-of-court settlements under the new section 707(b), if a creditor refuses to attempt ADR, then a debtor who could otherwise be transferred from chapter 7 to chapter 13 can raise this noncooperation as a defense. This will encourage creditors to negotiate out-of-court settlements. And that will save court time and resources--a goal which I am strongly committed to. I think that bringing Bureau of Labor statistics numbers into the bankruptcy code for the first time, as the House bill does, is unprecedented and will breed new and costly litigation. The Grassley-Durbin bill avoids this problem by relying on time-tested bankruptcy provisions to identify chapter 7 filers who really need to be in chapter 13 or out of the bankruptcy system altogether.  This bill is fair and balanced and will implement needed changes efficiently and without the uncertainty and new litigation associated with statistical formulas which are completely foreign to the bankruptcy code. It will crack down on bankruptcy abuses on both sides of the equation. And it will tell those who don't want to take personal responsibility for their debts that the free-ride is over.  Finally, the bill also strikes the cap on single asset real estate, a goal which I have long supported. I'm very grateful to Senator Durbin for working with me on this matter, since it really is so important to the health of the commercial banking industry.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1301       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
