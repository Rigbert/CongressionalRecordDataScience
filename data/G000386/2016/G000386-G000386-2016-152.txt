 President, I am proud to serve as a co-chair of the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth. Through this caucus and from my time in the Senate, I have learned about the experiences that many young people have faced when entering the foster care system. I have worked to help improve the system by ensuring that children are cared for and that we do all we can to find them safe, loving, and permanent homes. Children should grow up in families, not foster care.  Today, I want to pay tribute to Casey Family Programs. It is the Nation's largest operating foundation focused exclusively on child welfare. Casey is operating in Iowa and all the States to provide strategic consultation, technical assistance, data analysis, and independent research and evaluation. It enjoys a unique partnership with the States by asking what jurisdictions hope to achieve that matches the foundation's mission and working with the State in partnership. Casey Family Programs also provides direct service to children and families in some States, and it is committed to the goal that no child will age out of their care without a caring adult by 2017.  As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, I value the research, data, and policy information that Casey Family program shares. They have done so much for States, children, and families since their inception.  This month, Casey Family Programs is celebrating its 50th Anniversary. I want to say congratulations to its board of trustees and leadership for working so hard to reduce the number of youth in foster care. With their help, we are working every day to make sure foster care is a layover, not a destination.                          ____________________
