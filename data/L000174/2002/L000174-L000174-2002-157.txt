 Four conservative, Republican women have already been reported and three have been confirmed by the Senate: Sharon Prost to the Federal Circuit; Edith Brown Clement to the 5th Circuit, who was the first nominee to the 5th Circuit to get a hearing in seven years, since 1994; Julia Smith Gibbons to the 6th Circuit, who was the first nominee to the 6th Circuit to get a hearing in almost 5 years; and today the Committee voted unanimously to report Judge Reena Raggi, who is nominated to a vacancy on the 2d Circuit.  In addition, approximately a dozen more conservative, Republican women have already been confirmed to the Federal District Courts, including: Karen Caldwell, E.D. KY; Laurie Smith Camp, D.C. NE; Karon Bowdre, N.D. AL; Julie Robinson, D.C. KS; Marcia Krieger, D.C. CO; Callie Granade, S.D. AL; Cindy Jorgenson, D.C. AZ; Joan Lancaster, D.C. MN; Cynthia Rufe, E.D. PA; Joy Flowers Conti, W.D. PA; and Amy St. Eve, N.D. IL.  I appreciate that the Administration and Republicans are disappointed with the outcome of the vote on the nomination of Priscilla Owen. I want to accord other Senators respect and, in these circumstances, some leeway in their comments--even as those comments are directed personally at me and other Senators on the Judiciary Committee.  In response to their protestations, as if there were anything improper in the Judiciary Committee's consideration of the nomination of Priscilla Owen, I note that the salient difference between the vote on Justice Owen and the six and one-half years that preceded the change in majority is that Justice Owen was given a thorough and fair hearing, the Committee had a public, open and extensive debate and the nomination was then voted upon in public session. That was not true for more than a dozen nominees to vacancies on our Courts of Appeals over the last several years--several of which were left pending without a hearing or a vote for months and years. Here are just a few of those circuit court nominees with ``Well Qualified'' peer review ratings from the ABA that the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee never accorded a vote:  James Duffy, nominated to the Ninth Circuit; Kathleen McCree-Lewis, nominated to the Sixth Circuit; Enrique Moreno, nominated to the Fifth Circuit; James Lyons, nominated to the Tenth Circuit; and Robert Cindrich, nominated to the Third Circuit. Others, like Allen Snyder, nominated to the DC Circuit, were given a hearing but was never given a Committee vote, up or down. These and scores of other nominees of the past President were defeated by the Republican decision to deny them Committee votes.  Republicans' preferred method for ``defeating'' more than 50 circuit and district court nominees rated ``highly qualified'' and ``qualified'' by the ABA and those with significant professional credentials was to deny them hearings and, for some who had hearings, to deny them Committee consideration.  To those Senators who are now contending that the ideology and possible activism of judicial nominees should have no place in Senators' consideration, I ask them to start by reviewing their own records of opposition to President Clinton's nominees, including their own votes against nominees professionally qualified. Those who voted against Margaret McKeown, Marsha Berzon, Sonia Sotomayor, Rosemary Barkett and Merrick Garland, Ray Fisher, Richard Paez, William Fletcher and Timothy Dyk to the Courts of Appeals, as well as those who held up any vote on Allen Snyder, Bonnie Campbell and the others, could ask themselves what standards they applied in so doing. The same question can be asked with respect to those who opposed and voted against Margaret Morrow, Gerry Lynch, Mary McLaughlin, Ronnie White, Ann Aiken and those who held up any consideration of Clarence Sundram or Fred Woocher and the scores of nominees never allowed a hearing.  I do not wish to embarrass other Senators, but I am struck by how the statements I have heard today are wholly inconsistent with votes and actions in the years in which they were delaying, opposing and voting against the moderate judicial nominations of a President on another political party.  I raise this consideration not as a matter of tit for tat, for we have assiduously avoided payback, but because it is Republicans who are trying to change their history and pretend that they did not oppose nominees based on what they perceived to be the ideological outlook of the nominees.  I am reluctant to quote my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are saying something very different now than they said in the prior six years when they were blocking judicial nominees, but in light of the attacks on the Committee, some context is necessary to understand the hollowness of the charge that Committee members acted unfairly, inappropriately or in some unprecedented fashion in their consideration of the nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen.  For example, in 1996, one Republican said that he ``led the fight to oppose the confirmation of [two judges] because their judicial records indicatedthat they would be activists who would legislate from the bench.'' While we may differ on whether a judge's record evidences judicial activism, Republicans can hardly now be saying that such inquiry is inappropriate.  Another Republican Senator argued in 2000 in defense of his record of stalling Senate consideration of judicial nominees voted out of the Judiciary Committee that having ``strong qualifications and personal attributes,'' being ``fine lawyers [who] are technically competent'' was not the test. He said then: ``My concern is with their judicial philosophies and their likely activism on the court. . . . Judicial activism is a fundamental challenge to our system of government, and it represents a danger that requires constant vigilance.'' He went on to say that the Senate should not defer to the President ``if there is a problem with a series of decisions or positions [judicial nominees] have taken.''  Another Republican Senator said in 1998 that the Republicans were ``not abusing our advise and consent power. As a matter of fact, I don't think we have been aggressive enough in utilizing it to ensure that the nominees to the Federal Bench are mainstream nominees.''  Yet another Republican said in 1994: ``My decision on a judicial nominee's fitness is based on my evaluation of three criteria: character, competence and judicial philosophy--that is, how the nominee views the duty of the court and its scope of authority.''  There are numerous other examples, of course, but these suffice to make the point.  I ask that my full statement in opposition to the nomination of Justice Owen from the Judiciary Committee consideration be included in the Record at the end of these remarks. It focuses on the merits of the nomination, as did Senator Feinstein, Senator Kennedy, Senator Schumer, Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine. A few of the statements in the two-hour debate before the Committee were not helpful to a reasoned debate, but by and large the Committee debate was on the merits. That followed an extensive hearing, that lasted six hours, which Senator Feinstein chaired fairly and patiently. A thorough hearing and a fair vote is what Justice Owen's nomination received from the Committee.  The name-calling, threats, tactics of intimidation and retaliation are not helpful to the process. Holding up important legislative initiatives is harmful. Holding up ``the comma bill'' and threatening Democrats that they will be barred from Air Force One are silly.  Today the Senator Judiciary Committee reported a conservative Republican nominee to the Senate for a vacancy on a Court of Appeals. This nominee, Judge Reena Raggi, was first appointed by President Reagan and she came before the Committee with strong bipartisan support and without the divisive controversy that accompanies so many of President Bush's circuit court nominees. Judge Raggi was reported out unanimously today. Indeed, since the change in majority less than 15 months ago, the Committee has worked hard to report 80 judicial nominees to the Senate. They include a number of very conservative judges.  I have made suggestions to the White House for improving the nominations and confirmations processes but those suggestions continue to be rebuffed. I wish the White House would work with us rather than stridently insist on seeking to skew the federal courts ideologically.                          ____________________
