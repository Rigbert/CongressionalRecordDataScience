 President, an article in last week's New York Times highlighting the continued problem of wildlife poaching in Cambodia. A conservation expert predicted that within the next 3 to 5 years several species will cease to be biologically viable. Without a doubt, this is a legitimate concern and I applaud efforts to protect these endangered species.  But there are other species which may be endangered that the New York Times did not cite--these species are called ``Cambodian democrats''.  The killing of democracy activists in Cambodia deserve increase attention from the press and the international community. A total of 11 political activists and candidates from the royalist FUNCINPEC party and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party have been killed in the runup to local election scheduled for February, 2002.  Officials from the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) have blamed these murders on witchcraft and business deals gone sour. This is poppycock. Diplomats in Phnom Penh must show some spine in demanding the CPP to cease the killings and to hold credible and competitive elections--something they did not do prior to the 1998 parliamentary elections. I hope that the importance of free and fair commune elections in 2002 and parliamentary elections in 2003 is not lost on this crowd, who seem more willing to embrace ``stability'' at the expense of democracy and the rule of law. Long term development in Cambodia is possible only under new and dynamic leadership.  There will come a day when the CPP is held accountable for its extrajudicial and corrupt activities. This Senator has not forgotten those killed and injured in the horrific grenade attack against the democratic opposition in March 1997--nor American Ron Abney, injured by shrapnel and who continues to bear physical reminders of that awful day. I have not forgotten the 100 FUNCINPEC supporters killed during the July 1997 coup d'etat organized and executed by CPP Prime Minister Hun Sen. Nor have I forgotten those killed and injured during the July 1998 elections. I ask Hun Sen: what kind of government kills Buddhist monks?  The international community can be part of the problem or part of the solution. It is past time they held the CPP and Prime Minister Hun Sen accountable for their repressive actions. Failure to do so will ensure that ``Cambodian democrats'' will join the list of species facing extinction in this Southeast Asian nation.                          ____________________
