Nurse practitioners in Maine are credentialed as participating providers and serve as primary care providers in managed care organizations in my State.  Similar to my colleagues from New Mexico, Iowa and Alaska, a large percentage of Mainers live in rural areas. As such, residents are often a considerable distance from health care facilities and may be hindered from getting care because of transportation and other obstacles. Nurse practitioners fill the void for high quality primary health care in our underserved areas.  We need to encourage medical home demonstrations that allow nurse practitioners to fully participate in these models.
