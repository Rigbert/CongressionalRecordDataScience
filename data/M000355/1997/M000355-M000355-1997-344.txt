 President, my good friend from Connecticut acknowledged that there were no groups agitating for a constitutional amendment but the unorganized mass of people were.  Well, America is a seething cauldron of special interests. We all belong to one group or another, many of which have legitimate issues before the Government. And, of course, we do not think the group we belong to is a special interest. That is the other guy's group that is trying to do something I do not like. But the fact is, the Founders of this country envisioned that we would be a seething cauldron of interest groups all banding together to petition the Government, which is another part of the first amendment. These people do not want to be pushed off the playing field. They do not want to be pushed off the playing field. They think that their involvement in issues is important. They think it helps create a better America. They do not view themselves as pursuing some evil goal. After all, who is it that is going to have the wisdom to sort of sanitize America of all these special interests and who are we to be so arrogant as to preach to these groups that their interests are somehow evil. Who is not suspect? Whose interests are above reproach?  This amendment says we get to determine that right in here; we, the Government, get to decide what is reasonable speech. And you know what we will do, Mr. President. We will shut up all the people who are criticizing us. We will pull them off the playing field altogether. We will set a spending limit so low that all of us are guaranteed to be reelected. We will control the game all right.  This is a preposterous suggestion, with all due respect to those who will vote for it. It guts the first amendment. It takes citizens off the playing field and out of the process. This is exactly the wrong thing to do.  George Will, in a column in the Washington Post February 13, referred to this as a ``Government Gag''--a ``Government Gag.'' I ask unanimous consent that George Will's column be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 13, 1997]                             Government Gag                          (By George F. Will)       To promote the fair and effective functioning of the      democratic process, Congress, with respect to elections for      federal office, and States, for all other elections,      including initiatives and referenda, may adopt reasonable      regulations of funds expended, including contributions, to      influence the outcome of elections, provided that such      regulations do not impair the right of the public to a full      and free discussion of all issues and do not prevent any      candidate for elected office from amassing the resources      necessary for effective advocacy.       Such governments may reasonably define which expenditures      are deemed to be for the purpose of influencing elections, so      long as such definition does not interfere with the right of      the people fully to debate issues.       No regulation adopted under this authority may regulate the      content of any expression of opinion or communication.--     Proposed amendment to the Constitution       Like the imperturbable Sir Francis Drake, who did not allow      the Spanish Armada's arrival off England to interrupt a game      of bowling, supposed friends of the First Amendment are      showing notable sang-froid in the face of ominous      developments. Freedom of speech is today under more serious      attack than at any time in at least the last 199 years--since      enactment of the Alien and Sedition Acts. Actually, today's      threat, launched in the name of political hygiene, is graver      than that posed by those acts, for three reasons.       First, the 1798 acts, by which Federalists attempted to      suppress criticism of the government they then controlled,      were bound to perish with fluctuations in the balance of      partisan forces. Today's attack on free speech advances under      a bland bipartisan banner of cleanliness.       Second, the 1798 acts restricted certain categories of      political speech and activities, defined, albeit quite      broadly, by content and objectives. Today's enemies of the      First Amendment aim to abridge the right of free political      speech generally. It is not any particular content but the      quantity of political speech they find objectionable.       Third, the 1798 acts had expiration dates and were allowed      to expire. However, if today's speech-restrictors put in      place their structure of restriction (see above), its anti-     constitutional premise and program probably will be      permanent.       Its premise is that Americans engage in too much      communication of political advocacy, and that government--     that is, incumbents in elective offices--should be trusted to      decide and enforce the correct amount. This attempt to put      the exercise of the most elemental civil right under      government regulation is the most frontal assault ever      mounted on the most fundamental principle of the nation's      Founders.       The principle is that limited government must be limited      especially severely concerning regulation of the rights most      essential to an open society. Thus the First Amendment says      ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of      speech,'' not ``Congress may abridge the freedom of speech      with such laws as Congress considers reasonable.''       The text of the proposed amendment comes from Rep. Richard      Gephardt, House minority leader, who has the courage of his      alarming convictions when he says: ``What we have is two      important values in conflict: freedom of speech and our      desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You      can't have both.''       However, he also says: ``I know this is a serious step to      amend the First Amendment. . . . But . . . this is not an      effort to diminish free speech.'' Nonsense. Otherwise      Gephardt would not acknowledge that the First Amendment is      an impediment.       The reformers' problem is the Supreme Court, which has      affirmed the obvious: Restrictions on the means of making      speech heard, including spending for the discrimination of      political advocacy, are restrictions on speech. It would be      absurd to say, for example: ``Congress shall make no law      abridging the right to place one's views before the public in      advertisements or on billboards but Congress can abridge--     reasonably, of course--the right to spend for such things.''       Insincerity oozes from the text of the proposed amendment.      When Congress, emancipated from the First Amendment's      restrictions, weaves its web of restraints on political      communication, it will do so to promote its understanding of      what is the ``fair'' and ``effective'' functioning of      democracy, and ``effective'' advocacy. Yet all this      regulation will be consistent with ``the right of the people      fully to debate issues,'' and with ``full and free discussion      of all issues''--as the political class chooses to define      ``full'' and ``free'' and the ``issues.''       In 1588 England was saved not just by Drake but by luck--     the ``Protestant wind'' that dispersed the Armada. Perhaps      today the strangely silent friends of freedom--why are not      editorial pages erupting against the proposed vandalism      against the Bill of Rights?--are counting on some similar      intervention to forestall today's ``reformers'' who aim not      just to water the wine of freedom but to regulate the      consumption of free speech.  Mr. McCONNELL. In addition to that, Mr. President, the American Civil Liberties Union in a letter to me dated March 6, 1997, also expressed their opposition to this constitutional amendment to amend the first amendment for the first time in 200 years. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1997.       Dear Senator: The American Civil Liberties Union strongly      opposes S.J. Res. 18, the proposed constitutional amendment      that permits Congress and the states to enact laws regulating      federal campaign expenditures and contributions.       Whatever one's position may be on campaign finance reform      and how best to achieve it, a constitutional amendment of the      kind here proposed is not the solution. Amending the First      Amendment for the first time in our history in the way that      S.J. Res. 18 proposes would challenge all pre-existing First      Amendment jurisprudence and would give to Congress and the      states unprecedented, sweeping and undefined authority to      restrict speech protected by the First Amendment since 1791.       Because it is vague and over-broad, S.J. Res. 18 would give      Congress a virtual ``blank check'' to enact any legislation      that may abridge a vast array of free speech and free      association rights that we now enjoy. In addition, this      measure should be opposed because it provides no guarantee      that congress or the states will have the political will,      after the amendment's adoption, to enact legislation that      will correct the problems in our current electoral system.      This amendment misleads the American people because it tells      them that only if they sacrifice their First Amendment      rights, will Congress correct the problems in our system. Not      only is this too high a price to demand in the name of      reform, it is unwise to promise the American people such an      unlikely outcome.       Rather than assuring that the electoral processes will be      improved, a constitutional amendment merely places new state      and federal campaign finance law beyond the reach of First      Amendment jurisprudence. All Congress and the states would      have to demonstrate is that its laws were ``reasonable.''      ``Reasonable'' laws do not necessarily solve the problems of      those who are harmed by or locked out of the electoral      process on the basis of their third party status, lack of      wealth or non-incumbency. The First Amendment properly      prevents the government from being arbitrary when making      these distinctions, but S.J. Res. 18 would enable the      Congress to set limitations on expenditures and contributions      notwithstanding current constitutional understandings.       Once S.J. Res. 18 is adopted, Congress and local      governments could easily further distort the political      process in numerous ways. Congress and state governments      could pass new laws that operate to the detriment of dark-     horse and third party candidates. For example, with the      intention of creating a ``level playing field'' Congress      could establish equal contribution and expenditure limits      that would ultimately operate to the benefit of incumbents      who generally have a higher name recognition than their      opponents, and who are often able to do more with less      funding. Thus, rather than assure fair and free elections,      the proposal would enable those in power to perpetuate their      own power and incumbency advantage to the disadvantage of      those who would challenge the status quo.       S.J. Res. 18 would also give Congress and every state      legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First      Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the      press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and      magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable      operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of      editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered      editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at      the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in      support of or in opposition to particular political      candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would      authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the      expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly      reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a      society that cherishes the free press.       Even if Congress exempted the press from the amendment,      what rational basis would it use to distinguish between      certain kinds of speech? For example, why would it be      justified for Congress to allow a newspaper publisher to run      unlimited editorials on behalf of a candidate, but to make it      unlawful for a wealthy individual to purchase an unlimited      number of billboards for the same candidate? Likewise, why      would it be permissible for a major weekly news magazine to      run an unlimited number of editorials opposing a candidate,      but impermissible for the candidate or his supporters to      raise or spend enough money to purchase advertisements in the      same publication? At what point is a journal or magazine that      is published by an advocacy group different from a major      daily newspaper, when it comes to the endorsement of      candidates for federal office? Should one type of media      outlet be given broader free expression privileges than the      other? Should national media outlets have to abide by fifty      different state and local standards for expenditures? These      are questions that Congress has not adequately addressed or      answered.       Moreover, the proposed amendment appears to reach not only      expenditures by candidates or their agents but also the truly      independent expenditures by individual citizens and groups--     the very kind of speech that the First Amendment was designed      to protect.       If Congress or the states want to change our campaign      finance system, then it need not throw out the First      Amendment in order to do so. Congress can adopt meaningful      federal campaign finance reform measures without abrogating      the First Amendment and without contravening the Supreme      Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo.                           *   *   *   *   *       Rather than argue for these proposals, many members of      Congress continue to propose unconstitutional measures, such      as the McCain/Feingold bill that are limit-driven methods of      campaign finance reform that place campaign regulation on a      collision course with the First Amendment. . . .       The ACLU urges Senators to oppose S.J. Res. 18.           Sincerely,                                                  Laura W. Murphy.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just today the Washington Times editorialized, saying ``Save the First Amendment,'' very strongly in opposition to the Hollings amendment. I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 18, 1997]                        Save the First Amendment       ``The First Amendment denies government the power to      determine that spending to promote one's political views is      wasteful, excessive or unwise.'' So said the U.S. Supreme      Court in what some now refer to as its ``infamous'' 1976      ruling in the landmark case Buckly vs. Valeo. The high      court's decision struck down as unconstitutional post-     Watergate reforms restricting campaign expenditures, and      critics have been trying to get around the decision ever      since.       Today, the U.S. Senate is scheduled to take up a proposed      constitutional amendment to override the ruling and, in      effect, reform the reforms. South Carolina Sen. Ernest      Hollings, the amendment's chief backer along with      Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, calls it the only ``rational      alternative'' to a system that awarded public office to the      highest bidder.'' Among other things it states Congress can      set ``reasonable'' limits on contributions to and      expenditures by candidates for federal office. It gives      states similar powers to control state campaign spending.       The proposed amendment is but the first shot in a battle      over campaign finance reform that gets hotter with each new      story about the golden handshakes Mr. Clinton got from      contributors during the last presidential campaign. Still to      come is the McCain-Feingold bill to put ``voluntary'' limits      on campaign contributions and an effort to provide for      taxpayer financing of campaigns or, as critics refer to the      idea, food stamps for politicians.       Arrayed against the Hollings amendment is a formidable      coalition of interest groups ranging from the American Civil      Liberties to the National Rifle Association, who have little      in common other than the principle that limiting      contributions and expenditures will restrict the right of      their members to free speech. These days, some speech costs a      lot, whether in the form of commercials, mailings or bumper      stickers. Cutting off funds in this case inevitably means      cutting off your ability to disseminate your message--free      speech, in other words.       At the head of the coalition is Kentucky Sen. Mitch      McConnell, whom Ellen Miller of Public Campaign calls the      Darth Vader of campaign-finance reform, so successful has      he been in blocking the proposed changes. Mr. McConnell is      an unapologetic defender of the political debate that      comes of campaign spending. Indeed, he considers such      spending to be evidence of the robust debate indispensible      to the well-being of the country.       If such a position makes him the Darth Vader of campaign      reform, then here's hoping the force, so to speak, is with      him. Campaign spending is one measure of the power government      has to manipulate political and economic ends to the benefit      of one group or another. If you want to limit spending, limit      the power and watch how quickly the fund-raisers dissipate.       Short of that, there is a danger that tightened regulations      may tilt campaign laws to benefit one group or other. If you      limit soft-money contributions to political parties, for      example, you may end up giving an edge to organized labor,      which favors candidates with in-kind and off-the-books      contributions in the form of get-out-the-vote drives and      phone banks.       There are also free-speech concerns with government      campaign financing. Why should taxpayers have to see their      hard-earned dollars go to support candidates with whom they      disagree?       Does the current system really favor those candidates with      deep pockets? Ask Oliver North, Michael Huffington and Steve      Forbes, all of whom raised and spent huge sums of money, in      some cases their own, without winning office.       The best kind of reform, long advocated here, would drop      spending limits and increase disclosure. As University of      Virginia professor Larry Sabato has put it, ``Let a well-     informed marketplace, rather than a committee of federal      bureaucrats, be the judge of whether someone has accepted too      much money from a particular interest group or spent too much      to win an election. Reformers who object to money in politics      would lose little under such a scheme, since the current      system--itself a product of reform--has already utterly      failed to inhibit special-interest influence.''       Congress shouldn't aggravate the problem by gutting the      First Amendment.  Mr. McCONNELL. I referred earlier to a press conference that I happened to have had Friday with various groups opposed to this amendment and also opposed to McCain-Feingold. The press conference was really about both. Among the groups organized in opposition: the National Taxpayers Union, the National Right to Life Committee, the National Rifle Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Christian Coalition, the Direct Marketing Association, the National Association of Broadcasters, the National Assocation of Business PAC's, the National Education Association, the National Association of Realtors.  All of these groups, which represent over 15 million American citizens, are saying in effect to the Congress, do not amend the first amendment for the first time in 200 years. Do not pass a measure like McCain-Feingold. Do not shut us up. We are not part of the problem. We are busily at work expressing our point of view, arguing for the causes that we think are important. This is totally American. This is the essence of America.  And so those groups came together last Friday in an effort to express themselves about this proposal to amend the first amendment and also McCain-Feingold. I think one of the most interesting speakers was from an organization with which I am seldom aligned, the National Education Association. Don Morabito, who is from the NEA, was at the press conference, and he said, ``The fact is,'' referring to the groups in the room, ``We don't represent the same people, don't contribute to the same candidates and don't believe in the same things,'' with one exception. We agree on the first amendment. We agree on the first amendment.  The ACLU, in referring to the proposal before us, said the constitutional amendment is ``truly an abhorrent proposal,'' with ``breathtaking implications, and McCain-Feingold is draconian regulation.'' ``And if you want to talk `unseemly,' added ACLU Washington director Laura Murphy, what about the current reform proposal's efforts to `demonize' special interests and political action committees that follow the law?''  So I think it is important to remember what the current feeding frenzy is all about. We all thought it was about illegal, illegal activity, and there seems to have been a good deal of that particularly at the White House and in the Democratic campaign for President last year, but now the effort is to switch, change the subject and to pass either a constitutional amendment or some legislation to take American citizens out of the game.
