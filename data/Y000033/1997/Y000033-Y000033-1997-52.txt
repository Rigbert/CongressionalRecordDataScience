Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to again stress it is not the Government. We are asking the Congress to accept their role. All these projects were unauthorized. They never were authorized. We did not do our job. We blindly set aside because a certain party was in control of the House that believed in this type of thing and we did not do our duty.  So we are not doing anything in this bill. We are giving them the 3 years. If they are as good as they say they are, they can come back.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California [Mr. Pombo].
