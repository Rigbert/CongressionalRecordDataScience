 President, a lot of work has been accomplished in the last 3 days. I particularly thank Senator Gregg, chairman of the committee, who has done a good job of balancing a very difficult budget in a very difficult year but has been great to work with. The numerous amendments came from both sides of the aisle, and I thank all of his staff for their work.  I thank the ranking member on our committee, Senator Byrd, for his work on this committee and all of the effort he has put into making sure we have a balanced bill that has come before the Senate to appropriate funds for Homeland Security.  I especially thank the staff that has been out here on our side working for the last numerous days, night and day, to get us to the point where we will shortly vote on this bill: Chuck Kieffer, Chip Walgren, Scott Nance, Drenan Dudley, Adam Morrison, and all of our staff who have been out here.  I end by thanking Senator Gregg for his tremendous work on this bill in a very difficult year.
