(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the United States is relying increasingly on old,      needlessly inefficient, and highly polluting powerplants to      provide electricity;       (2) the pollution from those powerplants causes a wide      range of health and environmental damage, including--       (A) fine particulate matter that is associated with the      deaths of approximately 50,000 Americans annually;       (B) urban ozone, commonly known as ``smog'', that impairs      normal respiratory functions and is of special concern to      individuals afflicted with asthma, emphysema, and other      respiratory ailments;       (C) rural ozone that obscures visibility and damages      forests and wildlife;       (D) acid deposition that damages estuaries, lakes, rivers,      and streams (and the plants and animals that depend on them      for survival) and leaches heavy metals from the soil;       (E) mercury and heavy metal contamination that renders fish      unsafe to eat, with especially serious consequences for      pregnant women and their fetuses;       (F) eutrophication of estuaries, lakes, rivers, and      streams; and       (G) global climate change that may fundamentally and      irreversibly alter human, animal, and plant life;       (3) tax laws and environmental laws--       (A) provide a very strong incentive for electric utilities      to keep old, dirty, and inefficient generating units in      operation; and       (B) provide a strong disincentive to investing in new,      clean, and efficient generating technologies;       (4) fossil fuel-fired power plants, consisting of plants      fueled by coal, fuel oil, and natural gas, produce nearly      two-thirds of the electricity generated in the United States;       (5) since, according to the Department of Energy, the      average combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil fuel-fired      power plants in     the United States is 33 percent, 67 percent of the heat      generated by burning the fuel is wasted;       (6) technology exists to increase the combustion heat rate      efficiency of coal combustion from 35 percent to 50 percent      above current levels, and technological advances are possible      that would boost the net combustion heat rate efficiency even      more;       (7) coal-fired power plants are the leading source of      mercury emissions in the United States, releasing an      estimated 52 tons of this potent neurotoxin each year;       (8) in 1996, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United      States produced over 2,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide,      the primary greenhouse gas;       (9) on average--       (A) fossil fuel-fired power plants emit 1,999 pounds of      carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity      produced;       (B) coal-fired power plants emit 2,110 pounds of carbon      dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity produced; and       (C) coal-fired power plants emit 205 pounds of carbon      dioxide for every million British thermal units of fuel      consumed;       (10) the average fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the      United States commenced operation in 1964, 6 years before the      Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) was amended to      establish requirements for stationary sources;       (11)(A) according to the Department of Energy, only 23      percent of the 1,000 largest emitting units are subject to      stringent new source performance standards under section 111      of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411); and       (B) the remaining 77 percent, commonly referred to as      ``grandfathered'' power plants, are subject to much less      stringent requirements;       (12) on the basis of scientific and medical evidence,      exposure to mercury and mercury compounds is of concern to      human health and the environment;       (13) pregnant women and their developing fetuses, women of      childbearing age, and children are most at risk for mercury-     related health impacts such as neurotoxicity;       (14) although exposure to mercury and mercury compounds      occurs most frequently through consumption of mercury-     contaminated fish, such exposure can also occur through--       (A) ingestion of breast milk;       (B) ingestion of drinking water, and foods other than fish,      that are contaminated with methyl mercury; and       (C) dermal uptake through contact with soil and water;       (15) the report entitled ``Mercury Study Report to      Congress'' and submitted by the Environmental Protection      Agency under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42      U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)), in conjunction with other scientific      knowledge, supports a plausible link between mercury      emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil fuels and      mercury concentrations in air, soil, water, and sediments;       (16)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report      described in paragraph (15) supports a plausible link between      mercury emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil      fuels and methyl mercury concentrations in freshwater fish;       (B) in 1997, 39 States issued health advisories that warned      the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared      to 27 States that issued such advisories in 1993; and       (C) the number of mercury advisories nationwide increased      from 899 in 1993 to 1,675 in 1996, an increase of 86 percent;       (17) pollution from powerplants can be reduced through      adoption of modern technologies and practices, including--       (A) methods of combusting coal that are intrinsically more      efficient and less polluting, such as pressurized fluidized      bed combustion and an integrated gasification combined cycle      system;       (B) methods of combusting cleaner fuels, such as gases from      fossil and biological resources and combined cycle turbines;       (C) treating flue gases through application of pollution      controls;       (D) methods of extracting energy from natural, renewable      resources of energy, such as solar and wind sources;       (E) methods of producing electricity and thermal energy      from fuels without conventional combustion, such as fuel      cells; and       (F) combined heat and power methods of extracting and using      heat that would otherwise be wasted, for the purpose of      heating or cooling office buildings, providing steam to      processing facilities, or otherwise increasing total      efficiency; and       (18) adopting the technologies and practices described in      paragraph (17) would increase competitiveness and      productivity, secure employment, save lives, and preserve the      future.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to protect and preserve the environment while      safeguarding health by ensuring that each fossil fuel-fired      generating unit minimizes air pollution to levels that are      technologically feasible through modernization and      application of pollution controls;       (2) to greatly reduce the quantities of mercury, carbon      dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides entering the      environment from combustion of fossil fuels;       (3) to permanently reduce emissions of those pollutants by      increasing the combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil      fuel-fired generating units to levels achievable through--       (A) use of commercially available combustion technology,      including clean coal technologies such as pressurized      fluidized bed combustion and an integrated gasification      combined cycle system;       (B) installation of pollution controls;       (C) expanded use of renewable and clean energy sources such      as biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cells; and       (D) promotion of application of combined heat and power      technologies;       (4)(A) to create financial and regulatory incentives to      retire thermally inefficient generating units and replace      them with new units that employ high-thermal-efficiency      combustion technology; and       (B) to increase use of renewable and clean energy sources      such as biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cells;       (5) to establish the Clean Air Trust Fund to fund the      training, economic development, carbon sequestration, and      research, development, and demonstration programs established      under this Act;       (6) to eliminate the ``grandfather'' loophole in the Clean      Air Act relating to sources in operation before the      promulgation of standards under section 111 of that Act (42      U.S.C. 7411);       (7) to express the sense of Congress that permanent      reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases that are      accomplished through the retirement of old units and      replacement by new units that meet the combustion heat rate      efficiency and emission standards specified in this Act      should be credited to the utility sector and the owner or      operator in any climate change implementation program;       (8) to promote permanent and safe disposal of mercury      recovered through coal cleaning, flue gas control systems,      and other methods of mercury pollution control;       (9) to increase public knowledge of the sources of mercury      exposure and the threat to public health from mercury,      particularly the threat to the health of pregnant women and      their fetuses, women of childbearing age, and children;       (10) to decrease significantly the threat to human health      and the environment posed by mercury;       (11) to provide worker retraining for workers adversely      affected by reduced consumption of coal; and       (12) to provide economic development incentives for      communities adversely affected by reduced consumption of      coal.
