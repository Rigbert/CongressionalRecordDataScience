 President, I rise today with Senators Gordon Smith, Durbin, Murray, Landrieu, and Corzine to submit a resolution voicing the Senate's commitment to improving the health of mothers and children around the world.  This resolution illustrates that an increased commitment to improving the health of the world's mothers and children will have a long-term impact on the political, economic, and social stability of developing countries. The stability of our own nation depends significantly on the economic and political stability of developing nations. And their economic and political stability cannot be realized unless the health of their people is improved.  The resolution we are introducing today calls for increased funding for basic child survival and maternal health programs of at least $500 million dollars. This figure is a small investment when the dividends could be political stability, international security, and a renewed hope for the future of mothers and children around the world.  A few weeks ago, representatives from over 179 countries met at the United Nations Special Session on Children. During this meeting, they reviewed the progress made since the 1990 World Summit for Children and renewed their pledge to improve the lives of the world's children over the next decade. Overall, the funding for global health, which includes HIV/AIDS programs, has increased significantly. Child survival and maternal health programs was funded at $345 million in fiscal year 2001. Funding was cut by $26 million in fiscal year 2002. The Bush administration also acknowledges that investing in health care increases a country's ability to prosper.  President Bush made a wise decision when he proposed increased funding for global HIV/AIDS programs at USAID for fiscal year 2003. However, his budget also recommends a $25 million decrease in support for maternal and child health programs. The funding situation is getting worse rather than better for child survival and maternal health programs. Difficult choices must be made, understandably, but funds should not be shifted from one essential health program to pay for another. Especially when funding for maternal and child health programs have been decreased in previous years.  At this precarious time in our world, we cannot lose sight of the health of women, the primary caregivers who instill values and provide hope for their children; the future of every society. Women in developing countries put their lives at risk when they become pregnant, over 500,000 women die every year during pregnancy and childbirth. The health of a child and his or her mother are closely intertwined, and good maternal health is essential for the survival of both mother and child. In developing countries, a mother's death in childbirth due to malnutrition, or inadequate prenatal and delivery care, means almost certain death for her newly born child. We must also invest substantially more in programs that improve the health of young children.  Every day around the world, over 30,000 children die preventable deaths from diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, measles, and malnutrition.  Additionally, every year, nearly 11 million children die needlessly before their fifth birthday--almost all from diseases easily prevented or readily treated. Pennies worth of antibiotics, for example, could save three million children who will die this year of pneumonia. The true tragedy is that we know how to prevent these 11.5 million deaths that occur each year. Low-tech, low-cost interventions exist, and with additional resources to fund these interventions, could save lives. Children must be nourished so that they can thrive and disparities between developed and developing countries can be reduced.  As studies continue to show that high maternal and child mortality are directly correlated with social and political instability, we must take action to ensure the growth and development of the countries who need it most and their people who are dying needlessly.  The World Health Organization has reported that $27 billion will be needed in 2007 to provide necessary health interventions to those living in low-income countries. I believe we must do all we can to provide funds to improve the health of the world's mothers and children. The resolution being introduced proposes an increase in funding by at least $500 million for child survival and maternal health programs. We need to renew our commitment to mothers and children all over the world. The programs supported by USAID have and will make a difference in the lives of mothers and children in the developing world.  I strongly believe that an increase in funding is necessary and will have a positive long-term impact on the political, economic, and social stability of those countries.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.                          ____________________
