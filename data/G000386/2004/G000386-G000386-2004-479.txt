 President, I would like to say a word about tax provisions being included in non-tax titles. The Finance Committee has sole jurisdiction over tax matters. The reasons for this are rooted in the U.S. Constitution. As a committee, it is imperative that we weigh in on all tax matters. This is particularly true with the provision included in the EPW Committee Substitute. We have heard from the Justice Department that this provision, as drafted, could jeopardize law enforcement efforts against organized crime and money laundering. The provision did not have the benefit of committee review or process. I appreciate the sponsor's interest in this issue. But I would remind Members that the chairman and ranking member take the responsibilities of the Finance Committee seriously. When we go to conference, I also want to ensure that regardless of the fact that the provision is included in the EPW title, the tax-writers are given responsibility to oversee the provision.
