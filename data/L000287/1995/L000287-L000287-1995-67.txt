Mr. Speaker, we are all in agreement, Democrats and Republicans; we must put the financial affairs of our country back in order. Our huge national debt, the legacy of the Reagan and Bush administrations, must be eliminated.  The question, Mr. Speaker, is how to cut and what to cut. The Republicans in Congress want to cut school lunches for our children, cut our student's college loans and cut Medicare for our senior citizens. This is how the Republicans propose to balance the budget.  Students will have to pay thousands more to attend college and our parents and grandparents will have to spend an extra $1,000 per year for their health care.  At the same time the Republicans propose giving a tax break to the wealthiest people in America, the super rich, the top 1 percent. This approach, is wrong, just plain wrong.  Mr. Speaker, when are the Republicans in this House going to realize   that the American people want to get the financial affairs of this country in order, but not on the backs of our children and senior citizens and not while giving tax breaks to the richest people in America.                          ____________________
