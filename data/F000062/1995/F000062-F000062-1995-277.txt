 President, the safe harbor provisions of the bill have been criticized by some of my colleagues. I would like to address those criticisms by pointing out that S. 240 puts more responsibilities on companies seeking to use the safe harbor and puts more conditions on their use of the safe harbor than the SEC does in its current rules. It also goes further than a number of courts of appeals that have examined the issue of liability for forward-looking statements.  I wonder if the bill's manager would engage in a colloquy with me on this point?  Mr. D'AMATO. I would be delighted to.
