The mission objective was to search for signs that water may have been present for long periods of time--signs that could tell us whether the Red Planet had been hospitable to life in the past. Within the first several months of the Mars mission, the NASA Web site experienced over a billion site visits. The Mars Exploration Rovers have been a wildly successful mission, with more than 13 miles of harsh Martian terrain traversed and over a quarter million awe-inspiring images from the Martian surface captured, in addition to many thousands of scientific spectra that lends to our study of Mars.  Spirit and Opportunity have made many important discoveries over the last 5 years. One of the most significant discoveries was evidence of water and geological information that supports an understanding that ancient Martian environments included periods of wet, possibly habitable conditions.  I wholeheartedly support H. Res. 67, the resolution offered by my friends and colleagues from southern California, Mr. Schiff and Mr. Dreier to honor NASA, their team from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Cornell University on 5 years of great engineering and scientific discovery.                          ____________________
