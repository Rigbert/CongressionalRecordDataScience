President, I rise today to express my support for S. 229, a resolution designating September 2005 as National Preparedness Month.  As the horrific attacks in London again demonstrate, the threat of a terrorist attack is very real. Although we have made significant strides in preventing and deterring another attack from occurring in the United States, it is imperative that steps be taken to mitigate the effects of the attack. In addition, natural disasters can strike at any given moment and we must know how to respond.  During the month of September, the Department of Homeland Security and the American Red Cross will co-sponsor National Preparedness Month 2005. This nationwide effort will involve more than 130 private sector organizations that will host and sponsor activities across the Nation to increase public awareness of preparedness. Activities such as CPR and first aid classes, blood drives, and other events is a simple and effective way for communities to become involved in preparedness efforts. Families, schools, and businesses can prepare for emergencies by taking steps such as making emergency supply kits, becoming informed about emergencies, and creating a family communications plan.  I join Senator Lieberman in cosponsoring this resolution to promote citizen emergency preparedness. I hope that my colleagues will join us by supporting this important initiative.                          ____________________
