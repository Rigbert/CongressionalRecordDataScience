. 6612, which will redesignate NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center as the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center and the Western Aeronautical Test Range as the Hugh L. Dryden Aeronautical Test Range.  One of the greatest benefits of public service in U.S. House of Representatives is the people that you meet from all walks of life.  I had the very high honor and privilege of meeting Mr. Armstrong on several occasions before he passed away on August 25, 2012.  Given his place as a revered global icon, Neil never sought the limelight and never lost his unassuming nature or the Midwestern values that his Ohio roots instilled in him.  Those of us who were old enough to witness first hand when he took his first step on the surface of the moon will never forget the great sense of pride in our country and inspiration in the ability of mankind.  There are few events in history that have had such a profound and positive impact, transcending generations across the globe.  H.R. 6612 is just one way we can pay tribute to this great American hero.  The bill will accomplish three important goals: (1) to honor Neil A. Armstrong, who served as an experimental research test pilot at the center from 1955 to 1962; (2) to emphasize the contributions of that center to NASA's current space exploration mission; and (3) to memorialize the extraordinary career of Dr. Hugh L. Dryden by naming the aeronauticaltest range, approximately 12,000 square miles of special use airspace in his honor.  I urge my House colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 6612.
