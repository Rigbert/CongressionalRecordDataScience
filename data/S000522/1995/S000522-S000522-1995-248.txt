Mr. Speaker, since the demise of the Soviet Union, and the dissolution of its repressive police state, Russian society now faces the challenge of balancing law and order with protection of individual liberties. We are all aware that Russia is experiencing a dramatic rise in crime and a high rate of violence. Unfortunately, the cure envisioned by the Russian Government for this dilemma may be worse than the disease.  According to recent reports, the lower house of the Russian Parliament--the Duma--has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill proposed by President Yeltsin that would dramatically expand the powers of the domestic intelligence agency of the Russian Federation, known as the Federal Counterintelligence Service, or FSK. FSK agents would be able to enter homes, government offices and businesses without a search warrant from a court or the prosecutors office, as had been the case previously. The FSK would manage its own jails, and could employ undercover personnel working in other government agencies.  Bear in mind where the FSK stands philosophically these days. I would call attention to a FSK report published on January 10 of this year in the Moscow newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. In this report, the FSK accuses various foreign policy research centers, nongovernmental organizations, and foundations such as the Soros Foundation and Ford Foundation, of being used by United States secret services to conduct intelligence-gathering and subversive activities on the Russian territory. For instance, the FSK alleges that American specialists have set up a ``network of contacts for information on legal sources'' in Russia that would become a foundation for clandestine sources should United States-Russian relations worsen. Of course, this analysis came from the folks who reportedly did the planning for the Chechnya operation.  The Russian population is plagued by crime and corruption and, therefore, I can understand how this bill could be widely popular. The bill was approved in the Duma through the democratic process. But, Mr. Speaker, we all know that even democratically passed laws, especially those passed in the heat of the moment, can be seriously flawed. The key principle is protection of the civil liberties of minorities while carrying out the will of the majority. A Russian journalist quoted in the February 28, 1995, Washington Post said, ``In this country, people don't understand [about civil liberties] until the moment the FSK people come to their flats and knock on their door.''  Mr. Speaker, as I noted, crime and corruption are an overwhelming problem in Russia today, and our colleagues in the Russian parliament are faced with the serious task of developing the proper legislation to combat it. But, as chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, an organization vitally concerned with the principle of rule of law in the OSCE signatory states, I would urge the Federal Assembly and President Yeltsin to deliberate very carefully before giving the domestic security service such expansive powers. In legal terms, these proposed powers may even violate the Russian Constitution. In operational terms, there may soon be little to distinguish the FSK from the KGB of the cold-war era.                          ____________________
