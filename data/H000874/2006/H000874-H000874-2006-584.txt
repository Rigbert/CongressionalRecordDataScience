Speaker, today I rise to express my strong support for H. Res. 680 and to pay tribute to the long and distinguished career of Dr. I. King Jordan, the first deaf President of Gallaudet University. Dr. Jordan's compelling life story, keen intellect, and unbridled passion have combined to make him an extraordinary educational leader, one of our nation's foremost advocates for people with disabilities, and an international leader and role model for the deaf and hard of hearing.  Over the 18 years that he has served as University President, as well as his years asDean of the College of Arts and Sciences and Chair of the Psychology Department, Gallaudet University has thrived under Dr. Jordan's leadership. Gallaudet is the world's only university in which all programs and services are specifically designed for deaf and hard of hearing students. As President, Dr. Jordan dramatically expanded the University's endowment, improved and expanded academic programs, added new facilities, and recruited world-class faculty and administrators.  I got to know Dr. Jordan during the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was signed into law in 1990. Dr. Jordan was a lead witness during a joint session of Congress and delivered key testimony, which was instrumental to the passage of this landmark civil rights legislation.  Dr. Jordan has never relented in his commitment to improving the lives of people with disabilities. Last year, I was privileged to join Dr. Jordan in receiving the George Bush Medal for the Empowerment of People with Disabilities. That distinguished award is just one of the many that Dr. Jordan has received for his work. His numerous accomplishments and awards include no fewer than eleven honorary degrees, the Washingtonian of the Year, the James L. Fisher Award from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), the Larry Stewart Award from the American Psychological Association, the Distinguished Leadership Award from the National Association for Community Leadership, and the U.S. Presidential Citizens Medal.  In 1990, President George Bush appointed Dr. Jordan Vice-Chair of the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities (PCEPD), and in 1993 he was later reappointed as Vice-Chair by President Clinton of this influential body that made national recommendations on issues of employment.  Dr. Jordan recently announced that he will retire as Gallaudet's first deaf President on December 31, 2006. While the University will be losing a remarkable leader, I know that Dr. Jordan will continue to be a driving force in our community.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my deep gratitude to Dr. Jordan on behalf of the millions of individuals he has helped and inspired throughout his career. His tireless efforts have improved not only Gallaudet University, but also our nation and our world. I wish Dr. Jordan the best of luck in his retirement. His leadership and legacy will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
