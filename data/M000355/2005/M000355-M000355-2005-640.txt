 Chairman Warner is here, and Senator Levin just walked into the Chamber. He is here as well. They will be here to manage the bill this morning. Senators are expected to come over and offer several amendments. Although no rollcalls will occur today, the managers will be able to accept amendments which have been cleared on both sides of the aisle.  We will file a cloture motion today, which will be ready for a vote on Tuesday. This will allow us to finish the bill next week. If we invoke cloture, Senators will still be able to offer their amendments, and we would still be ensured we could proceed to passage sometime before the August recess.  As the majority leader has repeated, we have a number of items to consider over these last days prior to our departure for the month of August. I will say more on next week's schedule at closing, but Senators should be ready for a long week next week. I do not believe anyone should be preparing for any early departures, and that includes next Friday.  I remind our colleagues we will be voting Monday evening. We have not yet set any votes at that time. However, we do expect a vote or votes to occur on Monday.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Page S8715]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
