Competing against a class from every state in the country, one team from Munster High School accomplished the extraordinary feat of finishing in eighth place in the national competition of the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program held in Washington, DC, from April 24-26, 2010. For their remarkable knowledge and understanding of American government, these exceptional young people are to be commended.  The We the People program, administered by the Center for Civic Education, is a program that reaches over 30 million elementary, middle, and high school students. The goal of the program is to provide students with an understanding of the fundamentals of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The national finals competition imitates a Congressional hearing in which high school students testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges.  The people of Munster, as well as the community of Northwest Indiana, can be proud of this truly noteworthy class of students. The team consists of: Stacey Avtgis, Chandani Bhatt, John Bochnowski, Cristina Bonini, Thomas Burgwald, Sumanth Chintamani, Georgenna Chioros, Nicholas Estes, Michael Jerge, Kamryn Klawitter, Neil Kondamuri, Christina Lee, Melissa Lee, Aesha Maniar, Brianna Meyer, Tara Mojtahed, Santhosh Narayan, Spencer Newell, Katherine Palmer, Alexander Parobek, Aaditya Shah, Niral Shah, Matthew Skiba, Adam Stepanovic, Shawn Tuttle, Ines Tzolov, and Elizabeth Wadas.  Madam Speaker, I would like to once again extend my most heartfelt congratulations to the members of Munster High School's We the People program, as well as their coach, Mr. Michael Gordon, and all of the community and faculty members who have instilled in these students the desire to succeed. The values exhibited by these young people and their interest in the history and fundamentals of our great nation serve to inspire us all. I am proud to represent these fine individuals in Congress, and I am proud to have been given this opportunity to recognize these future leaders. I look forward to watching their achievements as they continue to rise to the top.                          ____________________
