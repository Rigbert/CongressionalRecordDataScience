President, today I would like to stand in honor of a great Oklahoman. CWO2 Stephen Shephard gave his life in the battle for freedom in Iraq. Steven is a true American hero who joined the war against terrorism after he witnessed the September 11 attacks on our own country. He was truly an admirable soldier and a great man.  Chief Warrant Officer Shephard was born in Stillwater, OK, in 1974. His family then moved to Purcell, OK, where Stephen attended Purcell schools until he graduated in 1993. Stephen played baseball and the saxophone in high school. His baseball coach remembers him as ``hardworking and dedicated.'' His friends remember him as having a great sense of humor. In high school, Stephen was voted ``most witty.''  Ever since he was a child, Chief Warrant Officer Two Shephard had a love for aviation. He got his pilot's license before he even graduated from high school. His sister says that ``being a pilot was his lifelong dream.'' After graduating from high school, Stephen earned a bachelor's degree in aviation from Oklahoma State University and then served as a flight instructor at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs and at Kansas State University. Stephen was a wonderful teacher with patience and a sense of humor in the classroom. His students loved him and looked up to him.  In 1998, Stephen married Meleah, who is also from Purcell. Like many other Americans, Stephen felt a call to duty following the September 11 attacks, and he joined the Army in 2002 in response to that call. Stephen and Meleah were expecting their first child in September of this year.  Stephen was assigned to B Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort Bragg, NC. He was killed on June 27, 2005, in Tija, Iraq, when enemy forces shot down the Apache helicopter he was flying. Stephen died doing what he loved--flying--and fighting for our freedom.  For this soldier from Purcell, OK, there is no deeper honor than the memory he leaves behind. He gave of himself in life as well as in death, and stands out as an example to all of us. Today I honor a true hero, CWO2 Stephen Shephard.                  marine sergeant james r. graham, iii  Mr. President, it is a great but solemn honor to rise today in memory of a courageous young man who recently gave his life in defense of his Nation and his fellow soldiers, Marine Sgt James R. Graham, III.  Sergeant Graham, 25, leaves behind a wife and two small children. He was known for his kindness and willingness to help others, often playing soccer with neighborhood children.  Sergeant Graham was assigned to 4th Tank Battalion, 4th Marine Division, Marine Forces Reserve, an antitank unit based in Broken Arrow, OK. He was deployed to Iraq with the 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force to provide support in the ongoing reconstruction and security efforts. While serving there he was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal and the Selective Marine Corps Reserve medal. On Monday, August 1, he was killed as a result of a suicide bombing while conducting combat operations near Hit, a city about 85 miles northwest of Baghdad.  The soldiers, friends, and family who are left behind remember a true example of professionalism and patriotism. Sergeant Graham died a true hero, worthy of the respect and gratitude of every American. None among us can dispute the tragedy of plans unrealized and ambitions unfulfilled, and our thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Graham's wife and family. Though we are all grieved by the loss of this soldier, we will never cease to be proud of him. His sacrifice echoes across the world and in our hearts. He was a true Oklahoman, and a true American--Sgt James Graham, III.                          ____________________
