Senator Stabenow, for example, and many others felt very strongly about the amendment Senator Warren sought to offer. We were able, working together, to in effect get an equal number for each side.  My understanding is that we continue to be interested--and you just, I think, made another gracious offer. We are going to stay here tonight. You are still interested in putting together a list that gives all sides a fair chance at their major amendments. Is that a fair recitation of where we are now, Mr. Chairman?
