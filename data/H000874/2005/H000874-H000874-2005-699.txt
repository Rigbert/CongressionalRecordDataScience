Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal). That is our pledge. The Democrats are going to work. We are going to work hard, and we will work with the President if the President wants to work, and we will work with the other side of the aisle to make this a fair, simpler, more efficient tax system. We owe that to the American public. We want to be the party of reforming our tax system so that Americans will say, I understand it, nobody likes to pay taxes but I am paying a fair share.  I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal). It is now my honor to yield to my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from Cleveland, Ohio (Mrs. Jones), who has done such an extraordinary job during her tenure here and is now a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.
