President, it saddens and concerns me that another line has been crossed, moving us further toward partisan excess and incivility. I refer to the calculated, political campaign-style attacks on the loyalty and patriotism of honorable Department of Justice attorneys over the past few weeks.  Self-restraint is a crucial but often neglected value in our democracy. Just because a political attack that can put ``points'' on the board is possible, does not make it right. Misleading appeals to fear, like this one, are corrosive to our system and to the rule of law.  Just as President Lincoln said of leadership generally, we must appeal to our better angels, not to fear and suspicion. Those who have megaphonesmade possible by millions of dollars, and who use them to shape public opinion, must lead responsibly and constructively.  Walter Dellinger, a distinguished attorney with a long record of public service, tells from personal experience the story of one attorney who is being smeared in these attacks. The glimpse he offers into this issue is so clear and compelling that I will have printed in the Record the full text of his piece, which appeared in the Washington Post on March 5.  This attack is not about transparency, nor about some purported conflict of interest. The Department of Justice set that canard to rest with its February 18 letter. This is about a partisan and personal attack. Many of the forces that have been defending John Yoo and other Bush-Cheney administration lawyers are the very ones seeking to smear these Justice Department attorneys. It is shameful. These American lawyers did what they are supposed to do, and what American lawyers have always done--provide legal counsel no matter what the charge or how unpopular the person. That is what John Adams did when he defended the British. This dedication deserves thanks, not reproach. The military and civilian lawyers who have previously accepted the difficult task of providing representation to individuals who have been detained by the United States in terrorism cases did no wrong and do not deserve this. Ted Olsen and Ken Starr, lawyers from the Reagan and Bush administrations, know that and agree. It is saddening and wrong that shallow partisan operatives would sink so low.  I ask unanimous consent that copies of the Justice Department letter and articles and editorials be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 9, 2010]      `Al-Qaeda 7' Smear Campaign Is an Assault on American Values                          (By Eugene Robinson)       The word ``McCarthyism'' is overused, but in this case it's      mild. Liz Cheney, the former vice president's ambitious      daughter, has in her hand a list of Justice Department      lawyers whose ``values'' she has the gall to question. She      ought to spend the time examining her own principles, if she      can find them.       A group that Liz Cheney co-chairs, called Keep America      Safe, has spent the past two weeks scurrilously attacking the      Justice Department officials because they ``represented or      advocated for terrorist detainees'' before joining the      administration. In other words, they did what lawyers are      supposed to do in this country: ensure that even the most      unpopular defendants have adequate legal representation and      that the government obeys the law.       Liz Cheney is not ignorant, and neither are the other co-     chairs of her group, advocate Debra Burlingame and pundit      William Kristol, who writes a monthly column for The Post.      Presumably they know that ``the American tradition of zealous      representation of unpopular clients is at least as old as      John Adams' representation of the British soldiers charged in      the Boston Massacre''--in other words, older than the nation      itself.       That quote is from a letter by a group of conservative      lawyers--including several former high-ranking officials of      the Bush-Cheney administration, legal scholars who have      supported draconian detention and interrogation policies, and      even Kenneth W. Starr--that blasts the ``shameful series of      attacks'' in which Liz Cheney has been the principal      mouthpiece. Among the signers are Larry Thompson, who was      deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft; Peter Keisler,      who was acting attorney general for a time during George W.      Bush's second term; and Bradford Berenson, who was an      associate White House counsel during Bush's first term.       ``To suggest that the Justice Department should not employ      talented lawyers who have advocated on behalf of detainees      maligns the patriotism of people who have taken honorable      positions on contested questions,'' the letter states.       But maligning is apparently the whole point of the      exercise. The smear campaign by Cheney, et al., has nothing      to do with keeping America safe. It can only be an attempt to      inflict political damage on the Obama administration by      portraying the Justice Department as somehow ``soft'' on      terrorism. Even by Washington's low standards, this is      unbelievably dishonest and dishonorable.       ``Whose values do they share?'' a video on the group's Web      site ominously asks. The answer is obvious: the values      enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.       The most prominent of the nine Justice officials, Principal      Deputy Solicitor General Neal Katyal, represented Osama bin      Laden's driver, Salim Hamdan, in a case that went to the      Supreme Court. In a 5-to-3 decision, the court sided with      Hamdan and ruled that the Bush administration's military      tribunals were unconstitutional. Are Liz Cheney and her pals      angry that Katyal was right? Or do they also question the      ``values'' and patriotism of the five justices who voted with      the majority?       The letter from the conservative lawyers points out that      ``in terrorism detentions and trials alike, defense lawyers      are playing, and will continue to play, a key role.'' It      notes that whether terrorism suspects are tried in civilian      or military courts, they will have access to counsel--and      that Guantanamo inmates, even if they do not face formal      charges, have a right to habeas corpus review of their      detention. It is the federal courts--not defense lawyers--     that have made all of this crystal clear. If Cheney and her      group object, they should prepare a blanket denunciation of      the federal judiciary. Or maybe what they really don't like      is that pesky old Constitution, with all its checks, balances      and guarantees of due process. How inconvenient to live in a      country that respects the rule of law.       But there I go again, taking the whole thing seriously.      This is really part of a death-by-a-thousand-cuts strategy to      wound President Obama politically. The charge of softness on      terrorism--or terrorist suspects--is absurd; Obama has      brought far more resources and focus to the war against al-     Qaeda in Afghanistan than the Bush-Cheney administration      cared to summon. Since Obama's opponents can't attack him on      substance, they resort to atmospherics. They distort. They      insinuate. They sully. They blow smoke.       This time, obviously, they went too far. But the next Big      Lie is probably already in the works. Scorched-earth groups      like Keep America Safe may just be pretending not to      understand our most firmly established and cherished legal      principles, but there is one thing they genuinely don't      grasp: the concept of shame.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Mar. 7, 2010]                Are You or Have You Ever Been a Lawyer?       In the McCarthy era, demagogues on the right smeared loyal      Americans as disloyal and charged that the government was      being undermined from within.       In this era, demagogues on the right are smearing loyal      Americans as disloyal and charging that the government is      being undermined from within.       These voices--often heard on Fox News--are going after      Justice Department lawyers who represented Guantanamo      detainees when they were in private practice. It is not      nearly enough to say that these lawyers did nothing wrong. In      fact, they upheld the highest standards of their profession      and advanced the cause of democratic justice. The Justice      Department is right to stand up to this ugly bullying.       Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has been      pressing Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. since November to      reveal the names of lawyers on his staff who have done legal      work for Guantanamo detainees. The Justice Department said      last month that there were nine political appointees who had      represented the detainees in challenges to their confinement.      The department said that they were following all of the      relevant conflict-of-interest rules. It later confirmed their      names when Fox News figured out who they were.       It did not take long for the lawyers to become a      conservative target, branded the ``Gitmo 9'' by a group      called Keep America Safe, run by Liz Cheney, daughter of      former Vice President Dick Cheney, and William Kristol, a      conservative activist (who wrote a Times Op-Ed column in      2008). The group released a video that asks, in sinister      tones, ``Whose values do they share?''       On Fox News, Ms. Cheney lashed out at lawyers who      ``voluntarily represented terrorists.'' She said it was      important to look at who these terrorists are, including      Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who had served as Osama bin Laden's      driver. Let's do that.       Mr. Hamdan was the subject of a legal battle that went all      the way to the Supreme Court. Ms. Cheney conveniently omitted      that the court ruled in favor of his claim that the military      commissions system being used to try detainees like him was      illegal. Republican senators then sponsored legislation to      fix the tribunals. They did not do the job well, but the      issue might never have arisen without the lawyers who argued      on behalf of Mr. Hamdan, some of whom wore military uniforms.       In order to attack the government lawyers, Ms. Cheney and      other critics have to twist the role of lawyers in the      justice system. In representing Guantanamo detainees, they      were in no way advocating for terrorism. They were ensuring      that deeply disliked individuals were able to make their case      in court, even ones charged with heinous acts--and that the      Constitution was defended.       It is not the first time that the right has tried to      distract Americans from the real issues surrounding detention      policy by attacking lawyers. Charles Stimson, the deputy      assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs under      George W. Bush, urged corporations not to do business with      leading law firms that were defending Guantanamo detainees.      He resigned soon after that.       If lawyers who take on controversial causes are demonized      with impunity, it will be difficult for unpopular people to      get legal representation--and constitutional rights that      protect all Americans will be weakened. That is a high price      to pay for scoring cheap political points.                                       ____                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5, 2010]               A Shameful Attack on the U.S. Legal System                         (By Walter Dellinger)       It never occurred to me on the day that Defense Department      lawyer Rebecca Snyder and Lt. Cmdr. William Kuebler of the      Navy appeared in my law firm's offices to ask for our      assistance in carrying out their duties as military defense      lawyers that the young lawyer who worked with me on that      matter would be publicly attacked for having done so. And yet      this week that lawyer and eight other Justice Department      attorneys have been attacked in a video released by a group      called Keep America Safe (whose board members include William      Kristol and Elizabeth Cheney) for having provided legal      assistance to detainees before joining the department. The      video questions their loyalty to the United States, asking:      ``DOJ: Department of Jihad?'' and ``Who are these government      officials? . . . Whose values do they share?''       Here, in brief, is the story of one of those lawyers.       In June 2007, I was at a federal judicial conference when I      received an urgent message to call the Defense Department.      The caller was Lt. Cmdr. Kuebler, a uniformed Navy officer      who had been detailed to the Office of Military Commissions.      As part of his military duties, Kuebler had been assigned to      represent Omar Khadr, a Guantanamo detainee who was to be      tried before a military commission. Kuebler told me that the      U.S. Supreme Court had agreed that day to review the case of      another detainee who had been a part of the same lower court      proceeding as Khadr. Because Kuebler's client had not sought      review at the Supreme Court, this situation raised some      complex questions of court practice with which Kuebler was      unfamiliar. Kuebler's military superior suggested he call me      and ask whether I could assist him in analyzing the      applicable Supreme Court rule.       It was a Friday night. I called Karl Thompson, a lawyer at      my firm who had previously been a Supreme Court law clerk,      and asked whether he could look into the question over the      weekend. I told Thompson that the military lawyers assigned      to these cases had a very burdensome workload and that it      seemed that Kuebler could really use our help. Even though      Thompson was extremely busy with other work at the firm, he      said he would somehow find time for this as well.       Over the next several months, Thompson (in addition to his      other firm work) provided assistance to Kuebler and his      Defense Department colleague in their briefing before the      Supreme Court and, in Khadr's case, the lower courts. Khadr's      case raises important questions, including the legal status      of juvenile detainees (he was 15 years old at the time of      capture). In 2009, Thompson left our firm to join the Office      of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department.       Thompson's assistance to the military officers who had been      assigned to Khadr's case seemed to me to be not only part of      a lawyer's professional obligation but a small act of      patriotism as well. The other Justice Department lawyers      named in this week's attack came to provide assistance to      detainees in a number of ways, but they all deserve our      respect and gratitude for fulfilling the professional      obligations of lawyers. This sentiment is widely shared      across party and ideological lines by leaders of the bar. As      former Solicitor General Ted Olson wrote in response to      previous attacks on detainee lawyers, ``The ethos of the bar      is built on the idea that lawyers will represent both the      popular and the unpopular, so that everyone has access to      justice. Despite the horrible Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, this      is still proudly held as a basic tenet of our profession.''       That those in question would have their patriotism, loyalty      and values attacked by reputable public figures such as      Elizabeth Cheney and journalists such as Kristol is as      depressing a public episode as I have witnessed in many      years. What has become of our civic life in America? The only      word that can do justice to the personal attacks on these      fine lawyers--and on the integrity of our legal system--is      shameful. Shameful.                          ____________________
