President, today I am pleased to introduce the Trade Options for Farmers and Ranchers Act (TOFRA). This legislation will provide farmers and ranchers across the United States with new, improved and affordable risk management products to help producers succeed in the 21st century.  This bill fulfills a promise we made to America's farmers and ranchers during the 1996 farm bill debate. The far-reaching, market-oriented reforms contained in the Freedom to Farm Act have provided substantial financial benefits to agriculture producers throughout the country. At the same time, this policy must be buttressed by proper risk management tools, regulatory relief, tax changes and a consistent, strong export policy. As a result, while leading the fight to get the federal government out of producers' daily lives and pocket-books, I promised to fight for better tools to help manage the tremendous financial risk that is inherent in life on the farm today.  The TOFRA would repeal the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's prohibition on the sale of over-the-counter agriculture trade options. The CFTC ban dates to the Great Depression. It was put in place during a time when financial and commodity markets were viewed with both suspicion and fear. Today, we live in a time of mutual funds, computerized financial transactions and round-the-clock, global commodity trading. While we should never forget the important lessons of the Great Depression, we must not let the troubling memories of the past hold back our nation's farmers and ranchers when there is so much promise in the future.  The CFTC's agriculture option ban created a monopoly. Today, if a farmer or rancher wants to hedge his price risk with an agriculture option, he must purchase the option from a commodity exchange. Over the years, the exchanges have performed a valuable service to farmers and ranchers by giving them the opportunity to manage their price risk in a regulated environment. Despite their best efforts, organized exchanges--primarily as a result of excessive regulation--have not been able to keep up with the tremendous demand in Farm Country for newer, better alternatives to existing risk management tools.  I will continue to support legislative efforts to allow all interested parties--commodities exchanges included--to sell a wider variety of financial products. In fact, I continue to be frustrated with the CFTC's unwillingness to provide organized exchanges with the same basic business opportunities available to over-the-counter brokers. This bias is unfortunate and counterproductive to both buyers and sellers of commodities.  At the same time, overly restrictive regulations are preventing America's farmers and ranchers from receiving the new, innovative products they need. The CFTC ban on over-the-counter agriculture options has been maintained in order to ``save farmers from themselves.'' The argument here is that farmers, grain elevators and others in rural America don't understand how options work. Therefore, the federal government has seen fit to limit severely the development of, and competition in, financial instruments that would provide substantial benefits to producers who understand commodity marketing in order to protect the few remaining producers who have no interest in managing price risk. Basically, current federal policy in this area is targeted towards the 1930s instead of the 2030s.  Agriculture options are complex, expensive financial instruments. In order to use them properly, producers must have specialized knowledge of commodity marketing and the risks associated with participating in them. As a result, many producers may choose not to use the additional financial products made possible through this legislation. However, agriculture options should be readily available to those producers with the skill, knowledge and desire to use them.  It is important that agriculture options--whether sold on an organized commodity exchange or through an over-the-counter broker--be sufficiently regulated. This legislation will simply make agriculture options just like all other options. If you purchase an option on wheat, natural gas or common stock, the bookkeeping, registration and disclosure requirements should be the same. Similarly, strong protections against fraud and manipulation are included to help prevent and punish fly-by-night operations and bucket-shops. In short, this bill establishes a simple formula: provide business opportunity with limited, but vigorously enforced rules. With proper oversight, this bill will be good for producers, brokers, businesses and consumers alike.  I do want to thank the CFTC for recently submitting a proposed rule that would begin to lift its long-held ban on over-the-counter agriculture trade options. They have taken the initial step toward removing the ban on off-exchange agriculture options trading. Unfortunately, the CFTC's proposal is so limited, so burdened with red-tape and reporting requirements, that significant benefit is doubtful. No newproducts, no improved products and no more competition to drive down the price of risk management for America's farmers and ranchers.  I am hopeful this legislation will renew CFTC interest in a workable regulation to govern agriculture option trading. I also urge the CFTC to act quickly to make these important tools available to America's farmers and ranchers. In conclusion, let me simply say this: if we give our producers a helping hand and appropriate safeguards, they will do the rest.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1884       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for a medical innovation tax credit for clinical testing research expenses attributable to academic medical centers and other qualified hospital research organizations; to the Committee on Finance.             the medical innovation tax credit act of 1998  Mr. D'AMATO.  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my colleagues, Senators Rockefeller, Hutchison, Feinstein and Boxer, to create a new tax credit that will make it easier for medical schools, teaching hospitals, and non-for-profit research hospitals to invest in potentially life saving medical research. Our bill will add Section 41A to the Internal Revenue Code to establish a Medical Innovation Tax Credit. This new credit would apply to qualified medical innovation expenses for biopharmaceutical research activities, including clinical trials, at qualified academic institutions. The credit rate would be 20% of qualified expenses on research conducted in the United States. This tax incentive is necessary in order to assure that the United States maintains its position as the leading country for biomedical research.  The Medical Innovation Tax Credit will supplement the current law Research and Experimental Tax Credit (R) which has allowed biopharmaceutical companies to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in research for new drug therapies. Clinical trials are conducted by these drug companies in order to obtain FDA approval. However, these initial studies are only a fraction of the applied research needed to follow patients and to discover possible combinations of drugs which provide the most effective therapy. These post-approval studies are performed by clinical investigators and major academic medical centers.  Until recently, medical schools, teaching hospitals, and not-for-profit hospitals were able to fund research from their operating profits. Many physicians chose to practice at these hospitals at a reduced salary based on the opportunity to engage in teaching and clinical research. With the profound changes in the health care industry over the last few years, this profit no longer exists. In the era of managed care, many insurance companies are reimbursing physicians and hospitals at the cost of services. Combined with cuts in Medicare payments and reduced subsidies for graduate medical education, teaching hospitals can barely afford to pay their medical staff's salary, let alone fund its research.  These financing changes have had the largest impact on hospitals affiliated with academic medical centers. A recent study found a 22% decline in clinical research conducted at member hospitals of the Association of American Medical College's Council of Teaching Hospitals. This drop is alarming because it demonstrates that these hospitals no longer have the financial resources to contribute to the public's health. Traditionally, academic medical centers trained new doctors, supported applied biomedical research, and provided the bulk of uncompensated care for uninsured patients. Under this system medical residents had the opportunity to treat a wide spectrum of patients, regardless of their health insurance status. In addition, uninsured patients were able to receive the latest care within the scope of clinical trials performed at academic hospitals. With reductions in private and public funding these medical centers have been forced to reduce these social services to compete with for-profit-hospitals with no research agenda. This development promises only to stagnate the level of care and number of treatment options that the next generation of doctors can offer their patients.  Mr. President, my state of New York has 12 medical schools and 40 teaching hospitals, in addition to 8 designated cancer centers. Each of these institutions will be eligible for the Medical Innovation Tax Credit. Without continued funding of research at these institutions, many New Yorkers will recognize a profound effect upon the quality of their health care. Without the opportunity to conduct research many of the country's top doctors may leave topractice in locations where they can earn more money. Such a move will also reduce the need for research specialists and their staffs. Patients will have to choose between hospitals that only recognize the bottom line while their children will not enjoy the same medical advances as they did. Many uninsured patients will not be able to receive uncompensated care and will not be able to receive the most advanced medicine possible.  And these changes aren't just particular to my state. Almost every state has a medical school which serves as the epicenter for a network of teaching hospitals which employ thousands of physicians, nurses, research specialists, and support staff. A large percentage of each state's economy is based on these medical centers. Thus, we all stand to recognize two main benefits from the Medical Innovation Tax Credit, more jobs and better health. Only by encouraging private investment in medical research can our health care infrastructure develop new and innovative ways to deliver the most advanced care to all citizens of our country.  We urge all of our colleagues to support this legislation that will restore to medical schools and teaching hospitals the ability to perform applied biomedical research to help treat and cure many of our pressing health needs such as cancer and heart disease. This is a targeted measure which has widespread benefits for all citizens.
