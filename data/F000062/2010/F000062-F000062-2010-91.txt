 President, I rise today once again with Senator McConnell to introduce a joint resolution renewing the ban on all imports from Burma for another year.  We are proud to be joined by Senators McCain, Durbin, Gregg, and Lieberman and we look forward to swift action by the Senate, House, and the President on this important matter.  Now, more than ever, the people of Burma need to know that we stand by them and support their vision of a free and democratic Burma.  On May 6th, the National League for Democracy, NLD, led by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi, will cease to exist.  Let me be clear: the NLD is not shutting down out of its own free will.  It is being forced to disband by an unjust and undemocratic constitution and election law, both drafted in secret and behind closed doors by the ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, to solidify its grip on power.  Let me explain.  Under the terms of the new constitution, 25 percent of the seats must be set aside for the military.  Think about that: before any vote has been cast, the military is guaranteed a quarter of the seats in the new 440 member House of Representatives.  How will this new institution be any different from the current military regime?  If that is not enough to raise doubts about the military's commitment to a truly representative government, it should also be pointed out that last week the regime's Prime Minister, Thein Sein, and 22 cabinet ministers resigned from the army to form a new ``civilian'' political party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party.  Any seats won by this new ``party'' in the upcoming elections will be in addition to the 25 percent set aside for active military members.  Does anyone really believe the regime has embraced democracy and the concept of civilian rule? Unfortunately, it will be business as usual for the people of Burma and the democratic opposition.  What about Suu Kyi and her National League of Democracy, winners of the last free parliamentary elections in 1990?  First, last month, the regime, which never allowed the NLD to assume power, officially annulled its 1990 victory.  Second, under the new constitution, as a convicted ``criminal'' Suu Kyi is barred from running in the elections.  Finally, under the terms of the election law, in order to participate in the upcoming parliamentary elections and remain legally active, a political party has to cut ties with any members who are convicted criminals.  Thus, the NLD had to either kick Suu Kyi out of the party and participate in the elections or face extinction.  It should come as no surprise that the NLD refused to turn its back on Suu Kyi and give its stamp of approval to the regime's sham constitution and electoral law.  I applaud their courage and their devotion to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.  While I am saddened to see the regime close its doors, the spirit and the principles of the NLD will live on in the hearts and minds of the people.  I know they will one day be able to elect a truly representative government.  As Tin Oo, the NLD's deputy leader and former political prisoner said: ``We do not feel sad. We have honor. One day we will come back; we will be reincarnated by the will of the people.''  This is a clear message to the regime that an illegitimate constitution and election law cannot suppress the unyielding democratic aspirations of the people of Burma.  Now, we must send our own signal to the regime that its quest for legitimacy has failed.  We must send our own signal to the democratic opposition that we stand in solidarity with them and we will not abandon them.  Now is the time to renew the import ban on all products from Burma for another year.  Let me be clear--I am disappointed that the ban has not moved Burma any closer to national reconciliation and a democratic government.  Indeed, as I have noted, the regime has taken several steps in the wrong direction.  But we have the opportunity to review these sanctions every year.  Last year we passed legislation allowing the sanctions to be renewed, once a year, for up to three more years until 2012.  Simply put, if we fail to renew the import ban, we will reward the military regime for its decades' long record of oppression.  We will reward them for keeping the true leader of Burma, Suu Kyi, behind bars and under house arrest for the better part of 20 years.  We will reward them for forcing the National League for Democracy to close its doors.  We will reward them for 2,100 political prisoners, the use of child soldiers, the persecution of ethnic minorities, the use of rape as an instrument of war, the use of torture, the use of forced labor, and the displacement of civilians.  Indeed, the standards for lifting the sanctions are clear. The regime must make ``substantial and measureable progress'' towards ending violations of internationally recognized human rights; releasing all political prisoners; allowing freedom of speech and press; allowing freedom of association; permitting the peaceful exercise of religion; and bringing to a conclusion an agreement between the SPDC and the National League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic nationalities on the restoration of a democratic government.  By every measure, the regime has failed to even come close to meeting these conditions. So we must act to renew the import ban.  But we cannot act alone.  I urge the United Nations and the international community to follow our lead and put pressure on the regime to abandon this process, release political prisoners, and draft a truly democratic and representative constitution.  I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution.                          ____________________
