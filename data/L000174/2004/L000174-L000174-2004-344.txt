President, on May 12, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is planning to visit Washington for meetings with President Bush and other top administration officials. I mention this because welcoming President dos Santos to the United States is contrary to President Bush's January 12, 2004, proclamation barring corrupt foreign officials from entering the United States.  President Bush's proclamation suspends entry into the United States of public officials, and their spouses, children, and dependents, if their ``solicitation or acceptance of any article of monetary value, or other benefit, in exchange for any act or omission in the performance of their public functions has or had serious adverse effects on the national interests of the United States.'' It also bars officials ``whose misappropriation of public funds or interference with the judicial, electoral, or other public processes'' has harmed the national interest.  If this standard does not apply to President dos Santos, it is hard to imagine to whom it could apply. He presides over one of the world's most corrupt governments. The IMF has concluded that between 1997 and 2002, Angola could not account for the expenditure of $4.2 billion in public funds, attributing this loss--equivalent to 10 percent of Angola's GDP--in substantial part to high-level corruption.  In a corruption trial in France in 2003, the former head of the oil company Elf Aquitaine testified that President dos Santos had received large bribes from the company. According to the Intelligence Unit of ``The Economist'' magazine, President dos Santos tops the list of the richest men in Angola, one of Africa's poorest countries.  President Bush's proclamation states that corruption is a threat to U.S. national interests when it has serious adverse effects on, among other things, ``U.S. foreign assistance goals . . .  or the stability of democratic institutions and nations.'' I could not agree more. Massive corruption has clearly had these effects in Angola. To protect their ability to misappropriate public funds, Angolan leaders have limited press freedom, intimidated the judiciary, and resisted democratic and economic reforms. Moreover, they have refused to spend the country's oil revenues to lift their people from poverty. Half of Angola's children are malnourished even as government officials amass fortunes.  President Bush's proclamation states that persons to be barred entry for corruption, as well as those whose entry would not be contrary to the national interest, ``shall be identified by the Secretary of State or the Secretary's designee, in his or her sole discretion, pursuant to such standards and procedures as the Secretary may establish.'' If the Secretary has not yet acted to establish clear and consistent standards and procedures for making these determinations, he needs to act promptly. And whether he has or not, the policy behind President Bush's proclamation should be applied to the visit of President dos Santos and other Angolan officials.  I strongly agree with President Bush that the corruption of public institutions threatens United States ``efforts to promote security and to strengthen democratic institutions and free market systems.'' As I have said before, corruption is like a cancer. It is the biggest obstacle to development--from Indonesia to Guatemala, from Nigeria to Pakistan. It undermines virtually everything we are trying to do through the Foreign Operations budget.  Fortunately, some leaders are trying to stop it, such as President Bolanos of Nicaragua, and we should do everything possible to support him and people like him, by prosecuting corrupt officials for money laundering or other violations of U.S. law, and by denying them visas to the United States.  Again, I commend President Bush for his proclamation and urge the Secretary of State to implement it vigorously.                          ____________________
