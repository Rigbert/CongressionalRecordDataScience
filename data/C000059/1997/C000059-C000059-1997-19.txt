Speaker, I thank the chairman.  First, I would like to thank the distinguished subcommittee chair and his staff for their assistance in addressing the needs of my district. Their fine work is very much appreciated. I am grateful for the $300,000 listed in thecommittee report accompanying the bill to initiate a feasibility study for the Santa Margarita River project.  However, I believe the flooding issues surrounding Murietta Creek which are mentioned in the Santa Margarita project are serious enough to deserve a separate study. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleague for his assistance in conference to make this clarification, and indicate that a separate feasibility study should proceed for Murietta Creek. The community has suffered back-to-back flooding and deserves a resolution to their problems.  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Speaker, I want to indicate to my colleague my appreciation of his bringing this matter to my attention. I want say that I look forward to working on this issue as this bill moves through the process and into conference. We are going to try to do everything we can to help the gentleman from California.
