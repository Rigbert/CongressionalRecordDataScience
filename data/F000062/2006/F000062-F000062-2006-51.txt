 SPECTER. It does not deal with program authority at all. That was in the original legislation that I introduced as a way of getting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to review the program. But this does not deal with that, and it does not give the President any enhanced authority at all to conduct warrantless wiretaps. The bill doesn't deal with that.  Whatever authority the President has under article II, he has. What this bill does is submit for expedited review by the Supreme Court a determination as to whether the President has article II power to have a warrantless wiretap with a call that originates overseas and ends in the United States.
