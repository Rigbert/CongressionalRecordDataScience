 President, this amendment is presented on behalf of myself, Senators Nickles, Chafee, Lindsey Graham, Alexander, and McCain.  This amendment provides that Medicare beneficiaries with an annual adjusted gross income of over $200,000, or above, pay the full cost of the Medicare Part B premium. The amendment uses a sliding scale to ramp up the beneficiary's share of the Part B premium.  The amendment we are offering would hold Medicare beneficiaries with annual adjusted gross incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 a year responsible for 50 percent of the cost of the premium. In 2003, this amounts to $116.40 a month, or $1,396 annually, rather than $58.20 monthly, or $698 annually, which is what the beneficiary pays today for the benefit.  Medicare beneficiaries with incomes between $150,000 a year and $200,000 a year--that is $300,000 to $400,000 for a couple--would be responsible for 75 percent of the total cost of the Part B premium. In 2003, this amounts to $174 or $2,095 annually.  Medicare beneficiaries with annual incomes above $200,000--that is $400,000 for couples--would be responsible for 100 percent of the total cost of the premium. In 2003, this amounts to $232.80 a month, or $2,793 annually. Now, for a beneficiary with an annual income of $200,000, this amounts to less than 1.4 percent of their annual income. For the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries, some 37 million of the 38 million beneficiaries, Part B premiums would remain the same as they are today.  According to the Census Bureau, about 98 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries have annual incomes below $100,000. So the amendment we are proposing will affect about 2 percent of the most affluent and well off Medicare beneficiaries.  Let me be clear. This amendment does not deprive any Medicare beneficiary of any benefit. What this amendment says is that if you can afford to pay the price for the Medicare Part B premium, you should. Those Medicare beneficiaries who have annual incomes below $100,000 a year will still be able to receive a 75-percent Government subsidy for their premium.  Now, I strongly believe the time has come to begin to income-relate some of these benefits. The Federal Government should not be subsidizing the Part B premiums of those beneficiaries who can afford to pay for the cost of the premiums themselves.  Much has changed since the creation of Medicare in 1965. People are living longer, due in large part to improved diagnostic tools and treatment. There is no way Congress could have predicted the number of people who would come to rely on Medicare or the rate at which medical expenses would grow. When Medicare was established in 1965, the Part B premium was set at a level to cover about 50 percent of program costs. With medical inflation, the dollar amount of the premium has declined to cover only 25 percent of program costs.  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 established the Medicare Part B premium to equal 25 percent of the program cost from 1996 to 1998. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 permanently established the Part B premium at 25 percent. The bill to balance the budget in 1997 that passed out of the Senate Finance Committee included a provision to income relate the Medicare Part B premium. So this is nothing new.  The provision included in 1997 would have had beneficiaries with incomes over $50,000 for an individual and $75,000 for a couple paying a greater share of the premium. This provision was stripped out during conference.  Well, we were in a different financial situation when Congress made the decision to set the beneficiary's share of the Part B premium at 25 percent in 1997. At that time, we had only a $22 billion deficit. The next year the budget was in surplus to the tune of $69 billion.  With a Federal budget deficit of over $400 billion in the year 2003 and an increase in the Federal debt of $5.3 trillion, for a total of $12 trillion in debt expected by 2013, I believe that now is the time to rethink the premium structure of Medicare Part B.  As the baby boomers age, there will be an increasing reliance on and demand for the Medicare Program.  The number of people age 65 and older will more than double over the coming decades, rising from 37 million today to 70 million in 2030 and 82 million in 2050. Over the next 75 years, the Medicare program will cost 71 percent more than that provided under current law in order to meet its needs.  It is predicted the Medicare hospital trust fund will be insolvent by 2030. The CBO projects Medicare spending will nearly quadruple by 2075 in order to meet the growing need for the program, with budget outlays of $277 billion in 2003. This means spending for the program could reach $1.1 trillion by 2075.  With the legislation currently before the Senate, Congress is proposing some major changes to the Medicare Program. I am in full support of adding a drug benefit, but Congress should also rethink the financing mechanisms of the program, and this bill is short in that direction. High-income beneficiaries can afford to pay a larger share of Medicare's costs, at least ofthe premium. They can afford to pay for the benefits they receive.  In light of the fact the Federal Government has just provided tax cuts in the range of $1,841 for people with incomes between $77,000 and $154,000 and up to $30,000 for people with incomes above $374,000, it seems to me people with annual incomes above $200,000 can afford to pay $2,793, which is the annual premium for Medicare Part B this year.  We should focus funding so that 98 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who have an annual adjusted gross income of less than $100,000 can continue to access benefits. I think it is reasonable to ask those who can afford it to pay a greater share of the premium. We are still waiting for an official cost savings score from CBO, but I believe this amendment could save billions of dollars.  Once again, Mr. President, this amendment affects less than 2 percent and only those with incomes of more than $200,000 a year adjusted gross income would pay the full premium of about $2,900 a year. We think this is a reasonable proposal. It is scaled up. It impacts no one below $100,000 adjusted gross income a year, and at the maximum for people of over $200,000 a year in adjusted gross income, the premium would be just $2,900.  The income limits would be indexed to medical inflation and, according to current population survey data from 2002, only 2 percent, or about 1 million people of the 38 million Medicare beneficiaries, have incomes of over $100,000 a year. This would protect the tax subsidy for people who need it by encouraging those who have the dollars simply to pay either a greater share of the premium cost or the full premium cost.  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Rhode Island.
