President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act, S. 39, which was introduced by Senator Stevens, and its House counterpart, H.R. 802, which already passed the House of Representatives in March. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important piece of legislation.  I congratulate Senator Stevens for introducing the measure and thank him for his leadership. We had worked together on a number of law enforcement matters and the senior Senator from Alaska is a stalwart supporter of the men and women who put themselves at risk to protect us all. I looked forward to enactment of this measure and to seeing the extraordinary heroism of our police, firefighters and correctional officers recognized with the Medal of Valor.  On May 18, 1999, I was privileged to be on the floor of the Senate when we proceeded to consider S. 39 and passed it unanimously. I took that occasion to commend Senator Stevens and all who had worked so hard to move this measure in a timely way. That was almost two years ago, during National Police Week of 1999. The measure was sent to the House where it lay dormant for the rest of the last Congress. That delay was most unfortunate.  Again, in this Congress, I have worked with Senator Stevens, Senator Hatch, and others to prefect the final version of this bill and finally get it enacted into law. We have crafted bipartisan improvements to ensure that the Medal of Valor Board will work effectively and efficiently with the National Medal of Valor Office within the Department of Justice. Our legislation should establish both of these entities and it is essential that they work well together to design the Medal of Valor and to create the criteria and procedures for recommendations of nominees for the award. The men and women who will be honored by the Medal of Valor for their brave deeds deserve nothing less.  I look forward to the President signing the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act into law.
