It was a source of amusement to many of us in the Midwest that you had your own design in automobile engines, and we thought: What is going on with these crazy people in California? We learned our lesson because in the period of time that you led the Nation in thinking about these things, you proved something: that you could keep economic growth moving forward in California and conserve energy in the process.  That is a lesson the Nation needs to learn. We don't want to sacrifice jobs, business growth, or opportunity in America. Instead, we want to create opportunity in a reasonable, wise, environmentally sensitive way.  I thank the Senator from California for her leadership on this issue.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
