President, if I said there was an industry that generates millions of gallons of wastewater every day and that can dump that waste with virtually no oversight, you might think that I was recalling the days before the Clean Water Act. The truth is, though, that such an industry exists today. I am talking about cruise ships.  That is why I am introducing the Clean Cruise Ship Act of 2008. This bill will require cruise ships to upgrade their wastewater treatment systems to meet the standards of today's best available technology, which has been shown to significantly reduce the amount of pollutants discharged from ships. This technology is already beingused successfully on cruise ships in Alaska, thanks to that State's forward-thinking regulations.  The problem is real. The number of cruise ship passengers has been growing nearly twice as fast as any other mode of travel. In the U.S. alone the numbers are approaching ten million passengers a year. Some of these ships can carry 3,000 passengers. That is the size of a small city. As cities do, these ships produce massive amounts of waste--over 200,000 gallons of sewage each week; a million gallons of graywater from galleys, laundry, and showers; and over 35,000 gallons of oily bilge water that collects in ship bottoms.  Wastewater from cities, of course, is highly regulated. America wouldn't tolerate anything less. A city cannot simply dump waste into our waterways. We've seen, of course, what happens when municipal wastewater treatment systems are poorly operated or break down. People fall ill, beaches are closed, and ecosystems are harmed.  So what's the story for waste from cruise ships? Let us start with ``black water'' sewage--human body wastes and other toilet waste. Within three miles of shore, vessels can discharge this waste provided that a ``marine sanitation device'' is installed. The Environmental Protection Agency released a draft report in December, however, that concluded that these systems simply don't work. These sewage treatment devices leave discharges that consistently exceed national effluent standards for fecal coliform and other pathogens and pollutants. In fact, fecal coliform levels in effluent are typically 20 to 200 times greater than in untreated domestic wastewater.  Beyond three miles from shore there are no restrictions on sewage discharge. Cruise ships are free to dump their sewage and foul U.S. waters with impunity.  The situation for graywater may be even more serious. Except in Alaska, cruise ship graywater requires no treatment whatsoever before being discharged, and there are no restrictions on where that dumping can be done. Yet graywater from sinks, tubs, and kitchens contains large amounts of pathogens and pollutants--amounts that would never be tolerated from a land-based business. Fecal coliform concentrations, for example, are ten to a thousand times greater than those in untreated domestic wastewater. These pollutants sicken our marine ecosystems, wash up onto our beaches, and contaminate food and shellfish that end up on our dinner plates.  The Clean Cruise Ship Act seeks to solve this oversight in the current regulations, just as Alaska State law has done. No discharges whatsoever would be allowed within 12 miles of shore. Beyond twelve miles, discharges of sewage, graywater, and bilge water would be allowed, provided that they meet national effluent limits consistent with the best available technology. That technology works and is commercially available now. The recent Environmental Protection Agency study found that these ``advanced wastewater treatment'' systems effectively remove pathogens, suspended solids, metals, and oil and grease.  Under this legislation, the release of raw, untreated sewage would be banned everywhere. No dumping would be allowed of sewage sludge and incinerator ash in U.S. waters. All cruise ships calling on U.S. ports would have to dispose of hazardous waste in accordance to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The bill would establish inspection and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.  There is one thing at this point I'd like to make clear. Many of us here have been working hard to stop aquatic invasive species that slip into our lakes and coastal waters in discharged ballast water. Alien species that have escaped into U.S. waters are causing massive harm. We have to do everything in our power to prevent new invasive species from getting loose.  With this in mind, many of us have been closely watching court cases surrounding the Environmental Protection Agency's responsibility for regulating ballast water under the Clean Water Act. That litigation may have implications for cruise ship wastewater pollution.  I have no intention of interfering with this court case. Likewise, I want to emphasize that this bill in no way undermines the provisions of the Clean Water Act that deal with discharges of pollution into the nation's waters. I have always supported the Clean Water Act. It will continue to be an important tool that, in conjunction with the Clean Cruise Ship Act, can significantly reduce wastewater pollution from cruise ships.  The protection of U.S. waters is vital to our Nation's health and economy. There are 4.5 million square miles of ocean in the U.S. territorial seas--23 percent larger than our Nation's landmass. That's more than any other country has. Cruise ship wastewater threatens the very environments that family vacationers want to visit. Current regulations and voluntary guidelines for the cruise ship industry just aren't good enough. No other industry is allowed to pollute our waters at will. The cruise ship industry is growing at nearly 5 percent each year, which means that the problem is growing, as well.  Uncontrolled dumping of cruise ship pollution must stop. We can achieve that goal with the Clean Cruise Ship Act. I recognize, though, that there may be other valid approaches. I encourage my colleagues to work with me to pass legislation this year that will put a stop to the dumping of hazardous pollutants along our coasts. Together we can clean up this major source of pollution that is harming our waters.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2881       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Cruise vessels carry millions of people through North      American waters each year, showcase some of the most      beautiful ocean areas in the United States, and provide      opportunities for passengers to relax and enjoy the oceans      and marine ecosystems.       (2) A single cruise vessel generates a tremendous amount of      waste each week, including an estimated 140,000 to 210,000      gallons of blackwater (sewage) and 1,000,000 gallons of      graywater (including wastewater from dishwashers, showers,      laundry, baths, and washbasins). Onboard amenities such as      photo-processing, dry-cleaning, and hairdressing also      generate hazardous waste streams.       (3) In its final report, ``An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st      Century'', released in 2004, the United States Commission on      Ocean Policy found that these waste streams and the      cumulative impacts caused when cruise vessels repeatedly      visit the same environmentally sensitive areas, ``if not      properly disposed of and treated, can be a significant source      of pathogens and nutrients with the potential to threaten      human health and damage shellfish beds, coral reefs, and      other aquatic life,'' thus threatening the very environments      cruise vessel passengers seek to explore.       (4) The cruise industry has grown by more than 6 percent      annually since 2003 and is projected to continue growing.      Cruise vessel capacity is also expanding dramatically; today      cruise vessels can transport 5,000 passengers and crew      members, but the next generation of cruise vessels is      expected to carry 7,000 passengers and crew members. As the      total number of passengers increases and the number of      passengers per ship increases, the volume of waste entering      these ocean ecosystems and the impact of that waste on ocean      ecosystems will also increase.       (5) In a 2005 report requested by the International Council      of Cruise Lines, the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance      (OCTA) Science Panel recommended that ``[a]ll blackwater      should be treated'', that discharging treated blackwater      should be ``avoided in ports, close to bathing beaches or      water bodies with restricted circulation,     flushing or inflow'', and that blackwater should not be      discharged within 4 nautical miles of shellfish beds, coral      reefs, or other sensitive habitats.       (6) The OCTA Science Panel further recommended that      graywater be treated in the same manner as blackwater and      that sewage sludge be off-loaded to approved land-based      facilities.       (7) The United States lacks a comprehensive wastewater      management policy for large passenger vessels, and a new      statutory regime for managing wastewater discharges from      large passenger vessels that applies throughout the United      States is needed to protect coastal and ocean areas from      pollution generated by cruise vessels, to reduce and better      regulate discharges from cruise vessels, and to improve      monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of standards regarding      discharges.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect the      health and beauty of the marine and coastal ecosystems that      cruise passengers enjoy, by--       (1) prohibiting the discharge of any untreated sewage,      graywater, or bilge water from a cruise vessel calling on a      port of the United States into the waters of the United      States;       (2) prohibiting the discharge of any sewage sludge,      incinerator ash, or hazardous waste from a cruise vessel      calling on a port of the United States into the waters of the      United States;       (3) establishing new national effluent limits for the      discharge of treated sewage, treated graywater, and treated      bilge water from cruise vessels not less than 12 miles from      shore in any case in which the discharge is not within an      area in which discharges are prohibited; and       (4) ensuring that cruise vessels calling on ports of the      United States comply with all applicable environmental laws.
