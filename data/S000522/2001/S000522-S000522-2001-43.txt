Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Just let me close, Mr. Speaker, by again thanking the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) for his partnership in working on this legislation. I also appreciate the work of our colleagues in the Senate, Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Specter, who toiled in good faith with us on behalf of finding consensus on this legislation that satisfies the needs and really does address the problem to truly make a difference. I want to recognize the staffs who contributed so much to these efforts, including our chief of staff and general counsel Pat Ryan, Kingston Smith, Michael Durishin, Susan Edgerton, John Bradley, Peter Dirkenson, Bill Brew, Bill Tuerk, Alexandra Sardegna, Bill Cahill, Kimberly Cowins, Perry Lange, Debbie Smith, Summer Larson, Jeannie McNally, as well as counsels in both bodies, Bob Cover, Pierre Poisson and Charlie Armstrong, as well as several others who worked together to accomplish a truly remarkable bill that in the future will be seen as a tremendous contribution to solving a perplexing national problem for veterans. I commend all our Members on both sides of the aisle, and in both Houses, for their support in moving this legislation as well.  On behalf of homeless veterans, Mr. Speaker, who need these services, I want to particularly honor Stuart Collick, Walter McConnell, Angela Gipson and other formerly homeless veterans of my own State who serve as inspirations and role models, and for all of those who aid them in their ongoing efforts to solve this problem, one veteran at a time, trying to rescue one life at a time.                             General Leave
