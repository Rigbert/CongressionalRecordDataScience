 President, I have an important amendment that I would like the Senate to debate and vote on. The Reid motion to commit is currently blocking the consideration of those amendments.  In order for the Senate to start considering amendments, including the Coburn amendment No. 2606, I move to table the pending Reid motion to commit with instructions and I ask for the yeas and nays.
