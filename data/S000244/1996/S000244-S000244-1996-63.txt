Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Glen Browder, for his service in the U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of Alabama's Third District residents.  Mr. Browder first entered the public arena in 1982, winning a seat to the Alabama House of Representatives. Four years later, he was elected secretary of state, where he succeeded in persuading the legislature to adopt stricter campaign finance disclosures.  In 1989, Mr. Browder won a special election contest for Congress, where he has honorably represented Alabama's Third District ever since.  While in Congress, Mr. Browder has been a bipartisan leader in the push for campaign finance reform. He deserves thanks for his leadership in attacking this and other difficult issues. Furthermore, he has been active on the House Budget Committee in attempting to eliminate wasteful Federal Government spending.  On behalf of the citizens of Wisconsin's Ninth District, I thank Mr. Glen Browder for his outstanding service to the United States.                          ____________________
