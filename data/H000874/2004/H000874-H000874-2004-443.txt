Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California, Mr. Royce, as well as Chairman Hyde and Mr. Lantos from the International Relations Committee, for bringing this resolution before us today.  In recent weeks the world watched in shock and horror as terrorists brought down two Russian aircraft and detonated a deadly bomb at a Moscow train station. Russia is no stranger to the global war on terror; still the devastation and timing of these attacks were notable and shook the confidence of the Russian people.  But nothing prepared the world for the unspeakable act that was perpetrated in Beslan beginning the morning of September 1. On their way to the celebrate the first day of school, more than 1,100 schoolchildren, parents and teachers were taken hostage by approximately 30 armed terrorists. These innocent men, women and children were inhumanely held with no food or water for more than 52 hours, and their treatment at the hands of these terrorists was savage and cruel.  Tragically, the siege ended in a hail of bullets and series of explosions. In the end more than 355 innocent hostages were killed, including 156 children. Nearly 200 persons still remain unaccounted for amid the rubble of the school.  Let there be no mistake. These were not the actions of rebels or freedom fighters; these were the despicable and abhorrent acts of terrorists. As the Russian people attempt to come to terms with their loss and cope with the anguish inflicted by these loathsome individuals, may they find comfort in knowing they are in the thoughts and prayers of the American people.  Mr. Speaker, the heart-wrenching scenes of parents frantically searching for missing children, or mourning the loss of their children have steeled the resolve of the United States to stand with the people of Russia, and rededicate ourselves to rooting out these cowardly terrorists from every corner of the world.                          ____________________
