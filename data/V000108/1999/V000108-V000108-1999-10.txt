Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I want to rise in support of the legislation and commend the authors of it for taking a positive approach in enhancing our ability to export goods and jobs overseas. I am also here to lend my strong support to an amendment that will be offered a bit later in the debate by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant) to, I think, improve the legislation before us.  Unfortunately, U.S. companies simply cannot compete in foreign markets if they are denied market access and forced to brave horrible conditions. There are a number of examples that we are all familiar with. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant) earlier this year and I introduced legislation to try to improve these circumstances. An element of that bill is going to be offered as an amendment to ensure that we have the necessary information to open markets for companies and workers in the United States.  Priority will be given, as far as those investigations and studies to countries which have a trade deficit with the U.S., priority will be given to markets which will result in significant employment benefits for U.S. producers. Priority will be given to critical technology sectors.  Too often, I think, we do focus on ensuring that people play fairly in the U.S. market. It is time we ensure they play fairly in their own home markets so we can enhance and increase our exports in job opportunities. I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant) in his initiative and join strongly in supporting his amendment as well as this legislation.
