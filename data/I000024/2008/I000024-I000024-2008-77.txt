Now, the very people who are promoting this bill and want to stop us from drilling, from exploring for oil and for gas, are the same ones who are opposed to nuclear energy. So they sayin that period of time, by 2030, the most nuclear plants we could have would be 64. I think everyone agrees with that, so instead of 268 new plants, there will be 64. So you could say that--if you use the same percentages--it would raise the price of gas by $2, not just 53 cents.  Well, we defeated the largest tax increase ever this last Friday. As I saw the majority leader coming through, he was smiling, and I hope that means he is going to bring it up so we can debate it more. I just get very excited about the fact that there has been a wake-up call in America. After all of those lonely years over the last 7 years, now people realize this is something that is not good for America. It took $4-a-gallon gas to make that wake-up call become a reality. So I am very thankful it happened. I congratulate the Senate on its wisdom.  With that, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
