President, if I might be allowed to comment as well, as the Senator from Tennessee, the majority leader, describes the bill, it sounds as if it is one that I gladly and wholeheartedly would support. I know Senator Martinez has a special interest in this issue, having been born in Cuba and then coming to the United States and still with the great love for the land where he was born.  I have spoken to him for the last several days while there apparently is a transition of power in place there. And I know how important this is to him personally and to so many other people of Cuban dissent who live in the United States.  I am sorry that it cannot be cleared, but there are some on this side of the aisle who have expressed some reservation or objection at this point. But I personally hope that we can do this as quickly as possible so that the people of Cuba can appreciate and enjoy freedom as soon as we can give them a helping hand.                          ____________________[Pages S8776-S8777]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3769
