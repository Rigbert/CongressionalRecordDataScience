Chairman, I yield 1 minute to myself.  Mr. Chairman, the remarks of the gentleman from California should not go unanswered. The gentleman givesthe impression that the law that is proposed in this bill is a strait jacket that will prevent the shifting of cases around where there is a justification for it. I draw the attention of Members to title 28 of United States Code 1412 relative to change of venue. It says that a district court may transfer a case or proceeding under title 11, which is the bankrupt title, to a district court for another district in the interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties.  So if there is a need to transfer a case out of the court in Delaware, for example, to a court in Houston, the present bankruptcy code allows for that. There have been some courts that are very plugged up and are not able to process bankruptcies quickly. Business is steered away from those courts simply because they have been so plugged up. I believe there is enough flexibility, and there should not be a poison pill that will destroy the delicate balance; and hopefully we will get this bill passed.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture.
