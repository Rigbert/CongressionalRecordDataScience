President, today I wish to recognize a landmark moment in health care for our veterans. Today is the 25th anniversary of the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Nation's first Veterans' Community Based Outpatient Clinic, CBOC. On June 13, 1987, at the Cary Medical Center in Caribou, ME, Governor John McKernan was joined by Senators George Mitchell and William Cohen, and then-Congresswoman Olympia Snowe to cut the ribbon of the new clinic. As the first community based outpatient clinic of its kind in the United States, the Caribou clinic served as the proving ground upon which the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, has built a nationwide health care system that delivers much improved access to care for America's rural veterans. Today nearly 3.5 million veterans, approximately 41 percent of those enrolled in the VA health care system, live in rural areas, many of whom receive care at more than 800 community based outpatient clinics.  The history of the CBOC in Caribou, however, began long before the ribbon cutting, when seven Aroostook County veterans dedicated themselves to the mission of improving access to critical health care services to the veterans living in their communities. To accomplish this goal, they established the Aroostook County Veterans Medical Facility Research and Development, Inc. The initial members were Percy Thibeault, Meo Bosse, John Rowe, Ray Guerrette, Wesley Adams, Walter Corey, and Leonard Woods, Sr.  Over a span of 8 years, they committed themselves to convincing the VA to establish a veterans' health clinic in Caribou. They were joined along the way by other concerned veterans, community members, the Cary Medical Center, and a number of Maine veterans service organizations. Their initiative paid off 8 years later, and today, on the 25th anniversary of their historic accomplishment, they deserve to be recognized. Our veterans in rural areas throughout the United States benefit today from the dedication of this landmark work. CBOCs are a vital part of veteran health services today.  These exemplary seven men battled to ensure that health care services were available to every veteran living in rural areas. That battle, despite the VA's best efforts, goes on.  Rural areas are still underserved in the types of medical treatment available. In some cases CBOCs don't even have permanent physicians assigned. The Iraq and Afghan wars have created a new generation of combat veterans, many of whom have new medical needs including prosthetic medical treatments, mental health care, and extensive physical therapy needs.  I am encouraged by the VA's renewed commitment to rural health care, and the $250 million that VA is allocating for programs for rural communities. But I would urge the VA to do more, and expand one program in particular, the Access Received Closer to Home, ARCH, project. ARCH has been tremendously popular in all five of the communities where the pilot program was established. Given Caribou's history, it is especially fitting that Caribou CBOC was selected as one of the five locations.  Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country. We owe them all that we can to ensure they receive the best care possible. The seven men who fought for the Caribou CBOC knew that, and we honor their dedication to their fellow veterans by carrying on their work.                          ____________________
