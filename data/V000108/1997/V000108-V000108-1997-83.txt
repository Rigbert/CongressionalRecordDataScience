Speaker, it is truly my pleasure to congratulate the Gary Alumnae Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority as it hosts a statewide Founders Day Celebration on Saturday, April 26, 1997, at Marquette Park in Gary, IN.  The Gary Alumnae Chapter will host the Founders Day Celebration with the help of 14 Delta Sigma Theta Chapters throughout the State of Indiana. The statewide celebration will feature Delta Sigma Theta Sorority's National President, Marcia L. Fudge, Esq., as the keynote speaker at a private banquet. After the celebration, Ms. Fudge will be introduced to community leaders at a reception held at Marquette Park from 5 to 7 p.m. During the reception, Mayor Scott King of Gary, IN, will present her with a proclamation from the city of Gary. In addition, Ms. Fudge will receive a proclamation from Indiana Governor, Frank O'Bannon. The festivities will conclude with area Deltas worshiping with Ms. Fudge at St. Timothy Community Church in Gary, IN.  Founded in 1913 at Howard University, the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority is a public service sorority comprised of over 200,000 members, both nationally and internationally. The founders of Delta Sigma Theta defined the organization's purpose as ``establishing and maintaining a high standard of morality and scholarship among women.''  Since its inception in 1938, the Gary Alumnae Chapter has worked diligently to fulfill the Delta Sigma Theta mission in northwest Indiana through members' participation in a variety of public service initiatives. Some of the local activities include: sponsorship of food banks and clothing drives; aid to Marion Home; a local shelter for pregnant teens; sponsorship of Delteens, an organization which organizes activities for high school junior and senior girls; and the awarding of $4,000 in college scholarships annually. The chapter also participates in Project Read, Stop the Violence Campaign, Kids Vote USA, and voter registration efforts. In addition, the Gary Alumnae Chapter has devoted much of its energy and resources to national public service efforts. Members of the chapter aid the NAACP, NAACP Defense Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund, and Habitat for Humanity, through financial contributions, and participation in local events.  It is my distinct privilege to congratulate the members of the Gary Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta as it hosts the statewide Founders Day Celebration. The members of this organization are most deserving of the pride and honor exhibited on this very special occasion, as they have provided invaluable services to the citizens of northwest Indiana through their hard work and dedication. May this event prove to be most successful and rewarding.                          ____________________
