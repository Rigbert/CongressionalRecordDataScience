 President, I urge that the amendment be opposed. I particularly want to get the attention of the Republican Senators. I have been predicting for 2 weeks that at the end there would be an effort to water down offending language that big labor did not like that was inadvertently included, or maybe on purpose included, in the original McCain-Feingold. This is that effort. What it does is let big labor continue to coordinate its ground game with the Democratic Party.  This is a modification of the original language in McCain-Feingold which the AFL-CIO thought was offensive. It is now being modified in a way that makes it bite less. So this will complete the job.  You noticed, all the amendments during the course of the last 2 weeks that had any impact on labor at all were defeated. Now the provision that was in the bill that was offensive to labor is being watered down. I urge that this amendment be opposed.
