President, I rise today in honor of the late Lowell Krassner of Burlington, VT, who passed away unexpectedly on January 15, 1996. As a longtime activist with the Vermont chapter of the Sierra Club, Lowell dedicated much of his life and energy to the conservation and stewardship of our natural resources--both in Vermont and nationally.  Lowell, together with his wife and partner Diane Geerken, worked tirelessly to protect the Vermont they loved, making major contributions to the eventual passage of the Vermont Wilderness Act of 1983 and the Green Mountain National Forest Management Plan of 1986.  Lowell and Diane functioned as a two-person citizen oversight committee, making sure that the actions of State and Federal public lands and natural resource managers were carefully reviewed. Indeed, friends and colleagues have often remarked how their South Burlington home served as both a hub of environmental activism and a Vermont conservation archive for so many years.  Lowell stood as a staunch defender of the Long/Appalachian Trail. He could also be both a strong supporter and sharp critic of the U.S. Forest Service, depending on the issue at hand.  In his commitment to the environment, Lowell Krassner also looked well beyond the Green Mountains, Lake Champlain, and the Connecticut River. He was well read on the various national environmental debates of the day--clean water, clean air, endangered species, wetlands, ANWR, Forest Service timber policy--and readily shared his views with his congressional representatives.  Lowell was particularly concerned with the recent attacks on our Nation's environmental laws represented by such actions as the timber salvage rider on the fiscal 1995 rescission legislation.   Over the last few years, Lowell immersed himself in the work of the Northern Forest Lands Council and strongly supported legislation to implement the council's recommendations.  Lowell Krassner will be truly missed, not only by his family and the Vermont chapter of the Sierra Club, but also by those many of us who counted on his unswerving commitment and honesty in furthering the cause we share--the wise stewardship of our public lands and natural resources.                          ____________________
