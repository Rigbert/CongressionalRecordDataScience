President, the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2009 will provide the recording industry and webcasters the additional time they need to reach a mutually beneficial agreement on webcasting rates. I am pleased that Congress has acted swiftly on this legislation.  I have long championed the development of new business models for transmitting music to the public. Webcasters are able to offer a range of music to consumers in a form that can compete with traditional broadcast radio and satellite radio. As webcasting and webcasters flourish, the performers whose music is attracting listeners deserve compensation.  In March 2007, the Copyright Royalty Board determined the rates applicable to webcasters through 2010. Webcasters large and small expressed serious concerns that the new rates would threaten their viability. I encouraged all parties at that time to negotiate and reach an agreement on rates that would compensate recording artists while allowing webcasters to prosper. The Copyright Royalty Board process is intended as a backstop when parties cannot reach agreements. All parties, and the listening public, benefit when private sector agreements are reached.  Last year, Congress passed an extension similar to the one we pass today. It paved the way for agreements between SoundExchange, on behalf of the recording industry, and the National Association of Broadcasters, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and a group of small webcasters.  I am pleased that both webcasters and the recording industry are promoting this legislation. I have said before that I would not sanction a legislative readjustment of rates because one party is dissatisfied with the results. By passing this extension today, Congress is returning the authority to set rates to the creators and distributors of the music we all enjoy.
