President, I am joined by friends and colleagues, the senior Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, and the senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, in offering a bipartisan amendment that will moderately preserve the current conflict-of-interest standards for investment banks. We are doing this to safeguard the integrity of the bankruptcy process.  Section 414 of the underlying bill would severely weaken the disinterested persons rule. That was an important conflict-of-interest standard. It has actually been part of the Bankruptcy Code since 1938. It has been there before I was born. We believe that the standard embodied in current law is critical to protecting the interests of investors and the public.  So our bipartisan amendment is a modest compromise. It limits the conflict-of-interest prohibition, not a total exclusion but just 5 years prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. In other words, a prohibition which has been the bankruptcy law forever would now be cut back just to apply in the 5 years immediately preceding the bankruptcy. I think it is a reasonable compromise.  The current disinterested persons standards are intended to ensure that professionals who advise a company in bankruptcy have no conflicts of interest, are neutral, and when we consider how huge some of these bankruptcy have been, Enron and others, we want somebody without a conflict of interest; we want somebody who can be neutral.  Since bankruptcy proceedings involve reexamining prior transactions, an investment bank that underwrote those prior transactions could not be expected to act as a neutral, disinterested party. It is almost like saying, I wrote these transactions when you went into this multimillion or multibillion-dollar bankruptcy but do not worry, I will now be the disinterested party to advise you where we go now.  I think the reason we have the current standard, the reason it has worked well for nearly 7 decades, is because it has helped maintain public confidence in the bankruptcy system.  Section 414 of the bill before us eliminates the current conflict-of-interest standard. It is a standard that prohibits investment banks that have had a close financial relationship with the debtor from playing a major role in the bankruptcy process.  I have talked to a lot of people who are far more knowledgeable on this than I, and they tell me you cannot expect that an investment bank that served as an underwriter of a bankrupt company's securities would then provide an independent assessment of that underwriting as an adviser in the bankruptcy of the company. In other words, you want to find somebody who can give you an independent, neutral assessment in bankruptcy of the underwriting. You don't go to the person who did the underwriting. Of course, they are going to say: Great job. Man, that person did a great job, whoever it was--oh, that was me? Boy, I did a great job.  The investors, especially in these huge bankruptcies, the pensioners who have suffered financial damage through the bankruptcy, deserve neutrality. They don't deserve somebody where it looks as if it is such a cozy deal there is no way they are going to recover.  If the bill is passed in its current form, the investment banks that advised or underwrote securities for companies such as Enron or WorldCom prior to bankruptcy, having advised or underwritten those securities, could then be hired to represent the interests of the defrauded creditors during the bankruptcy proceeding. Just think of this. The people who were involved in putting the creditors and the investors and the people whose pension money was in there, the people who were involved putting all their money at risk, can now be hired to represent their interest.  There is a blatant conflict of interest and that is why it has been forbidden for seven decades. Firms that had a part in those companies could then end up staying on the payroll in bankruptcy and they could make huge profits, sometimes from their own fraud.  What kind of message are we sending to those everyday Americans who invested for their kids' college or their own pensions, who suffered as a result of corporate misdeeds, if we then say that is OK, now we are going to give a whole lot of money to the people who set this mistake up in the first place?  We talked to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. They strongly recommended that Congress keep the current conflict-of-interest standards in place. Actually, in their report they concluded:       Strict disinterestedness standards are necessary because of      the unique pressures inherent in the bankruptcy process.  These are the people who understand this better than anybody in this Chamber.  Supporters of the underlying bill have voiced their opposition to the inclusion of section 414. I wish they would listen to what a member of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said, Judge Edith Jones. She is a member of the commission. She asked us to remove section 414. She said:       If professionals who have previously been associated with      the debtor continue to work for the debtor during a      bankruptcy case, they will often be subject to conflicting      loyalties that undermine their foremost fiduciary duty to the      creditors. . . .       Section 414, in removing investment bankers from a rigorous      standard of disinterestedness, is out of character with the      rest of this important legislation and . . . it should be      eliminated.  Again, if you have a bankruptcy of a WorldCom, an Enron, something like that, and you have all these people with the pension money in it, the kids' college funds in there, their business in there, their own retirement in there, you cannot then turn around and say we are going to let the same people decide what happens to you in bankruptcy as the people who did the things that put us into bankruptcy in the first place.  William Donaldson is the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He wrote to us to express the opposition of the SEC to section 414 of the bill. He said:       [We] believe that it would be a mistake to eliminate the      exclusion in a similar one-size-fits-all manner at a time      when investor confidence is fragile.  Keep that in mind. It does something further. Not only do we end up hurting the people who have to rely on the bankruptcy court being honestly run, but he also wants to keep up investor confidence. He was joined in that position by his predecessor Arthur Levitt, and by a number of nationally renowned experts. National consumer organizations have written to us to warn of the danger of weakening conflict-of-interest controls, as this bill would allow:       If the participants in Enron's earlier financial dealings      had managed the investigation, it is quite legitimate to      wonder how many of these financial misdeeds would have come      to light in the first place. Without existing conflict-of-     interest prohibitions in place, it is possible that some of      the same firms that have come under investigation by the SEC      for illegal activities in the current corporate scandals      might very well have been allowed to serve as ``objective''      advisers in this and other bankruptcy proceedings.  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers Union, Consumer Action, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and the National Consumer Law Center be printed in the Record.       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be      printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    March 3, 2005.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes     Ranking Member, Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs          Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Sarbanes: The undersigned national      consumer organizations strongly support your amendment to      strike a little noticed provision of pending bankruptcy      legislation (S. 256) that would weaken current conflict-of-     interest standards in the bankruptcy code. This provision      would, for the first time, allow investment bankers to offer      advice in bankruptcy restructuring cases about companies with      which they have had a close financial relationship prior to      bankruptcy. As advocates for small investors, we applaud you      for moving to eliminate this significant threat to the      interests of investors, employees and pensioners.       Section 414 of pending bankruptcy legislation would loosen      the current standard for ``disinterested'' parties that are      allowed to advise bankruptcy management or trustees as they      attempt to restructure debtor companies in a manner that is      fair to investors and other creditors. Of the several parties      that are automatically banned from offering advice because of      obvious conflicts of interest, Section 414 removes only one:      investment banking firms. This means that the same firms that      underwrote and sold stocks and bonds for a bankrupt company--     firms that in some cases may have participated in structured      finance deals with the company or otherwise played a      significant role in financial decisions that helped to land      the company in bankruptcy--could now be allowed to offer      restructuring advice to the management or trustee responsible      for maintaining impartiality and representing the interests      of creditors.       Corporate bankruptcy experts tell us that reexamining the      financial transactions that led to bankruptcy is one of the      most significant responsibilities of the post-bankruptcy      management (often called debtor-in-possession, or DIP,      charged with the duties of a trustee to protect all creditors      and investors.) This review includes determining what role,      if any, that outside advisers and financial partners played      in bringing about a company's downfall. Another of DIP      management's most important responsibilities is determining      the best source of financing for any restructuring. An      investment banking firm has obvious conflicts in both roles      and is very unlikely to be an advocate for review of its own      previous work or the deals in which it participated. It is      quite possible, for example, that an investment banker would      discourage bankruptcy management or trustees from pursuing      legal claims against the banking firm for illegal activities      of that firm that contributed to the bankruptcy. The landmark      settlement with the leading investment banks over their stock      research practices shows just how poorly these firms have      handled comparable conflicts in the past.       Imagine how the public would have reacted if the investment      banks that were later found to have profited enormously from      structured finance deals with Enron had been hired to offer      advice in the Enron bankruptcy. Indeed, if the participants      in Enron's earlier financial dealings had managed the      investigation, it is quite legitimate to wonder how many of      these financial misdeeds would have come to light in the      first place. Without existing conflict-of-interest      prohibitions in place, it is possible that some of the same      firms that have come under investigation by the SEC for      illegal activities in the current corporate scandals might      very well have been allowed to serve as ``objective''      advisors in this and other bankruptcy proceedings. This      scenario is possible because, as you know, it often takes      months or longer to unravel the role of investment banking      firms in such cases, particularly cases that do not receive      the media and congressional scrutiny of an Enron or Worldcom      collapse.       In response to these conflict-of-interest concerns,      investment banking interests offer a familiar refrain. We can      offer better advice, they say, because we are intimately      aware of the distressed company's financial situation. This      response is eerily similar to that offered by the accounting      industry, as it loudly insisted that a conflict did not exist      when accountants served as both internal and external      auditors or received lucrative consulting contracts from the      same companies that they audited. But, if there is one lesson      we should have learned from the recent corporate crime wave,      it is that conflicts of interest matter. Investors paid      dearly to learn that lesson. And the markets have paid      through the loss of investor confidence.       Representatives of the securities industry have also      contended that this provision will merely provide bankruptcy      officials with the discretion to make a judgment about      whether a particular investment firm should be involved in a      bankruptcy case. But what if the details of an investment      firm's involvement with a bankrupt firm do not come to light      for months or longer, as was true in the Enron case? By that      time, a lot of damage could already have been done to      investor interests, and the credibility of the process would      have been hopelessly undermined.       For example, the Wall Street Journal reported on May 14,      2003 that investment firm UBS Warburg, ``was far more      involved in the inner workings of HealthSouth than previously      disclosed and maintained an unusually close relationship with      HealthSouth's embattled founder, Richard Scrushy.'' Yet, if      Section 414 of the bankruptcy bill had been law, it is      entirely possible that UBS Warburg could have been allowed to      serve as ``objective'' advisors in the HealthSouth bankruptcy      case.       Congress and the SEC have devoted considerable time and      energy over the past few years to eliminating just these kind      of conflicts in an effort to restore investor confidence. The      SEC has made important strides, for example, in implementing      the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate reform law and in cracking down      on Wall Street conflicts of interest. More recently, the      National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) has been      considering whether to place new limits on investment banking      firms' ability to write fairness opinions for deals in which      they are involved, since these firms could benefit      financially if a merger or acquisition is approved. By      allowing new financial conflicts, section 414 of S.256 runs      completely contrary to this trend.       Investment firms that have previously advised a bankrupt      company have a prima fascia conflict of interest and should      continue to be automatically prohibited from offering advice      in a bankruptcy restructuring case. We commend you for moving      to eliminate the conflicts-of-interest that this bill would      allow.           Sincerely,     Barbara Roper,       Director of Investor Protection, Consumer Federation of      America.     Travis B. Plunkett,       Legislative Director, Consumer Federation of America.
