Speaker, I thank the Majority Leader for that information. With respect, Mr. Leader, to the Homeland Security Authorization bill, can you presently tell us which day of the week will that be considered?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay).  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. While things could certainly change as we work through what will be a very busy week, we will likely have the two appropriations bills sort of bookending the week, with the Homeland Security authorization bill coming in the middle of those two bookends. So I would expect that the Homeland Security Appropriations bill would start as early as Tuesday morning. Then we would go to the Homeland Security authorization bill, and when it is finished, we would go to the Department of the Interior appropriations bill.
