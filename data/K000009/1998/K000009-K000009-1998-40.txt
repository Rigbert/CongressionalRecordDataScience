Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Act.  This has truly been a classic ``David-versus-Goliath'' confrontation between widely different interests. The ``Davids'' in this instance are the thousands of not-for-profit small credit unions throughout the nation, such as Little Flower Parish Federal Credit Union in Toledo. Little Flower has 1,700 members, with total assets of $5 million. I'm proud to be one of those members.  This is a confrontation that pits member-owned credit unions that are not-for-profit cooperatives against banks that often place the interests of shareholders and profits over and above the need of consumers and communities. With higher fees becoming more prevalent and banking options shrinking for many consumers, there can be little doubt that credit unions have helped to keep banks in check by being viable financial alternatives for millions of Americans. America's consumers will now be guaranteed more options and alternatives when it comes to conducting their financial business and transactions.  As was stated in an editorial in the Toledo Blade earlier this year, ``Credit unions are about local folks helping local folks.'' I'll continue to support the ``local folks'' who place community and family over profits only and will continue to fully support America's credit unions and the rights of all Americans to join and belong to their local credit union.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1151 is right for all Americans.
