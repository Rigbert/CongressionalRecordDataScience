Chairman, there are about 350,000 milk cows in my area of California. I probably have more milk cows in my district than my good friend, the gentleman from the State of New York.  I was in favor of deregulating the entire dairy program, as many people here would like to do. But my friend was opposed to that. That is where we are at today.  The Gunderson compromise is the best compromise that we have, so I hope my colleagues will join me and the California Farm Bureau, National Farm Bureau, and my local producers, and it is the largest producing area in the United States, in opposing Solomon-Dooley.
