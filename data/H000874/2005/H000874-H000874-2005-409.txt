I would hope if we cannot get to conference, which would be probably impossible by next Tuesday, we would have an extension so that would not cause anybody any problem in the contracting field.  Mr. Leader, it is my understanding that the CAFTA legislation, a very important piece of legislation, is not on the calendar for next week. Would it be the expectation of the leader that the CAFTA legislation would be on the last week we are in session?  Mr. DeLAY. As the gentleman knows, the Senate has passed CAFTA. The Committee on Ways and Means has marked it up. I expect that the House will vote on it before we adjourn for the August recess. I just do not know when that will be.
