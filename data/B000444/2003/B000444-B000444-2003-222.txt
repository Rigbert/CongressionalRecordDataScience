 President, today I am introducing a bill, along with Senators McCain, Feinstein, Dodd, and Kerry, to make women and children a priority of our assistance of programs, women and children who are suffering the ravages of war and natural disasters, suffering from food shortages and a lack of basic necessities, suffering from the degradation of complex humanitarian emergencies. War has been the major cause.  Over the past fifty years the nature of war has changed dramatically. Increasingly, sadly, women and children seem to bear the brunt of it. According to the United Nations Children's Fund, since 1990, more than 2 million children have been killed and 6 million maimed or injured as a result of war. Today, 90 percent of the casualities in any war are civilians. They are mostly women and children.  It is incomprehensible to me that rape has been used as a weapon of war all over the world from Burma to Bosnia to Sierra Leone. It is equally incomprehensible that forced displacement of civilians, rather than being one of the unfortunate results of war, has actually become a deliberate tactic.  Under these circumstances, what choice do people have but to leave their homes? They leave out of fear for their lives and their children's lives. Some find their way into camps where instead of safety, they suffer extraordinary violence and abuse. Allegations of sexual exploitation by camp residents and humanitarian workers in refugee camps in west Africa and Nepal are all-too-real examples of the sad fact that women and children remain vulnerable even in the very places they flee to find safety.  This bill seeks to do something about this. It seeks to enhance the U.S. Government's ability to ensure that women and children's protection needs are addressed before, during, and after a complex humanitarian emergency.  It does this in several ways. First, it directs the Secretary of State to designate a special coordinator for protection issues. That person will be changed with making sure that our embassies and consular posts are made aware of the earliest warning signs that a complex humanitarian emergency is imminent. The Coordinator is to compile a watch list of such countries and regions so that our aid missions can plan to meet potential need.  Second, the bill specifies basic measures that will improve our ability to help these women and children, help the refugees, help internally displaced people cope during an actual complex humanitarian crisis.  It requires that relief organizations funded by the United States Government review their procedures to ensure adequate measures have been taken to provide adequate physical security for refugees and internationally displaced people, especially the women and children.  The legislation prohibits U.S. funding for relief agencies that do not sign a code of conduct that prohibits improper relationships between humanitarian aid workers and aid recipients, and encourages the Secretary to pressure the U.N. refugee agency to implement a ``whistle-blower'' system under which aid workers, refugees and internally displaced persons can report instances of gender-based violence and exploitation.  Because women have unique health needs that are often unmet when they are forced to flee their homes, the bill includes a provision mandating health services for women within 30 days of the onset of a complex humanitarian emergency.  Additionally, the bill amends the Micro-Enterprise Development Act to expand the availability of micro-loans to refugees and internally displaced women. When women are given access to income generating activities, they are less vulnerable to coercion from those who would demand sexual favors in return for food or other basic necessities.  Finally, the bill deals with rehabilitation and recovery.  The bill requires the Secretary of State and the Administrator for the Agency for International Development to develop and implement economic development programs to assist female heads of households, to help women increase access to ownership of land and other productive assets, to ensure that education and training programs are integrated with economic development programs to encourage reintegration of women who were displaced during war, and programs to politically empower women.  It calls upon the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to work on ensuring that World Bank demobilization, disarmament and reintegration programs extend the same benefits that ex-combatants receive to women and children who were formally or informally associated with them.  As it now stands, women and children who were used as cooks, porters, and so called ``wives''--a euphemism for women who were kidnaped to serve as sexual slaves--are given nothing with which to rebuild their lives, despite the fact that they rarely served with armed groups by choice. And yet the very people who forced them into such conditions are assisted with no qualms or reservations.  Finally, the bill calls upon the Secretary of State to report to Congress all the programs that they are fundingthat are aimed at improving the awareness of foreign law enforcement officials of women's human rights and the ability of foreign law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute crimes of rape and sexual violence.  This bill is not a panacea. It does not cure all the ills that war and displacement create for women and children. It seeks to provide some relief for those who are entirely reliant--through no fault of their own--on the largess of the international community.  I believe this legislation will improve the way we respond to the needs facing women and children trying to survive in the most dire of circumstances, and I hope my colleagues will join me by supporting it.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1001       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

TITLE I--PROGRAM AND POLICY COORDINATION     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The nature of war has changed dramatically in recent      decades, putting women and children at greater risk of death,      disease, displacement, and exploitation.       (2) Civilians, particularly women and children, account for      the vast majority of those adversely affected by complex      humanitarian emergencies, including as refugees and      internally displaced persons, and increasingly are targeted      by combatants and armed elements for murder, abduction,      forced military conscription, involuntary servitude,      displacement, sexual abuse and slavery, mutilation, and loss      of freedom.       (3) Traditionally, humanitarian response has focused on      providing food, medical care, and shelter needs, while      placing less emphasis on the safety and security of those      affected by a complex humanitarian emergency.       (4) Few well-coordinated efforts exist to prevent and      respond to violence against women and children when they are      refugees or internally displaced persons.       (5) While the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees      and the Department of State are charged with protecting      refugees, there is no United States Government agency or      international body with a clear mandate to protect internally      displaced persons and those at risk of displacement as a      result of a complex humanitarian emergency.       (6) There is a substantial need for the protection of women      and children to be given a high priority during all complex      humanitarian emergencies.     SEC. 102. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to ensure that the United States Government has      adequate capabilities to support programs that provide for      the protection of women and children who are affected by a      complex humanitarian emergency;       (2) to build the capacities of United States Government      agencies, multilateral institutions, international      nongovernmental organizations, local nongovernmental      organizations, and local communities to prevent and respond      effectively to gender-based violence and exploitation of      children that occur during a complex humanitarian emergency;      and       (3) to provide increased funding for the protection of      women and children affected by a complex humanitarian      emergency.     SEC. 103. REQUIREMENT TO DEVELOP INTEGRATED STRATEGY.       (a) Requirement.--The Secretary shall, in consultation with      the Administrator of the United States Agency for      International Development, develop an integrated strategy for      the protection of women and children who are internally      displaced, made refugees, or otherwise affected by a complex      humanitarian emergency.       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the      appropriate congressional committees a report outlining the      strategy described in subsection (a).       (c) Content.--The report required by subsection (b) shall      include--       (1) an assessment of the specific needs of, and particular      threats to, women and children at the various stages of a      complex humanitarian emergency, especially at the onset of      such emergency;       (2) a description of which agencies and offices of the      United States Government are responsible for addressing each      aspect of such needs and threats;       (3) an evaluation of the needs and threats that are being      adequately addressed and funded, and those which require      additional attention or resources;       (4) a set of guidelines and recommendations for improving      United States and international systems for the protection of      women and children during a complex humanitarian emergency;      and       (5) a mechanism for coordinating and overseeing United      States efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based      violence and exploitation of children that occurs during a      complex humanitarian emergency.     SEC. 104. DESIGNATION OF COORDINATOR.       (a) In General.--Not later than 60 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall designate one or      more senior-level officials of the Department of State or the      United States Agency for International Development as a      coordinator or coordinators, as the case may be, to be      responsible for the oversight and coordination of United      States Government efforts to provide protection to women and      children who are affected by a complex humanitarian      emergency.       (b) Duties.--A coordinator designated under subsection (a)      shall--       (1) coordinate the actions taken to carry out the purposes      of this Act, as described in section 102;       (2) be responsible for the oversight and coordination of      United States Government efforts to protect women and      children who are affected by a complex humanitarian      emergency; and       (3) provide United States embassies and consular posts with      mechanisms to warn relief agencies of an impending complex      humanitarian emergency.       (c) Notification.--Not later than 5 days after designating      an official as a coordinator under subsection (a), the      Secretary shall submit the name of such official to the      appropriate congressional committees.                 TITLE II--PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The percentage of civilians killed and wounded as a      result of hostilities has risen from 5 percent of all      casualties at the turn of the 19th century to 65 percent      during World War II and to 90 percent in more recent      hostilities. Women and children comprise the majority of      civilian deaths and the majority of all refugees from      hostilities.       (2) In the last decade alone, more than 2,000,000 children      have been killed during wars, while more than 4,000,000 have      survived physical mutilation, and more than 1,000,000 have      been orphaned or separated from their families as a result of      war.       (3) In many armed conflicts, soldiers have destroyed food      supplies and productive capacities, stolen donated food      intended for women and children, and blocked the distribution      of humanitarian aid.       (4) During 2003, an estimated 300,000 children have been      compulsorily recruited into military operations around the      world, including a large number of girls who have been forced      to work as combatants, cooks, messengers, spies, or sexual      slaves for soldiers.       (5) The use of rape, particularly against women and girls,      is an increasingly common tactic in modern war.       (6) The international community has a responsibility      pursuant to the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees      done at New York October 4, 1967 (19 UST 6223), the      Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva      July 28, 1951, and the Convention Relative to the Protection      of Civilian Persons in Time of War done at Geneva August 12,      1949 (6 UST 3516), to take preventive action that would      improve preparedness and reduce the vulnerability of women      and children to violence and exploitation.     SEC. 202. EARLY WARNING AND EARLY ACTION SYSTEMS.       (a) Preventive Actions.--Each coordinator shall--       (1) maintain a data base of information related to      occurrences of gender-based violence or exploitation of      children during a complex humanitarian emergency;       (2) develop, based on the information contained in the      database required by paragraph (1) and other research--       (A) a list of early warning signs that indicate there is a      likelihood that gender-based violence or exploitation of      children will occur during a complex humanitarian emergency;      and       (B) a list, that is updated regularly, of countries or      regions where there is an increased risk of gender-based      violence or exploitation of children due to a complex      humanitarian emergency to enhance the preparedness of the      United States Government or organizations funded by the      United States Government to respond to such an emergency;       (3) disseminate to United States embassies and consular      posts the lists described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of      paragraph (2);       (4) assist embassies and consular posts in responding to an      increased risk of gender-based violence or exploitation of      children that may occur during a complex humanitarian      emergency;       (5) develop a procedure for nongovernmental organizations      to report evidence of gender-based violence and exploitation      of children, during a complex humanitarian emergency to      ensure appropriate response by United States officials; and       (6) establish a reporting and monitoring system for United      States diplomatic missions and consular posts and missions of      the United States Agency for International Development to      collect and submit to the coordinator standardized data on      evidence that women and children are being targeted for or      are at increased risk of violence or exploitation in complex      humanitarian emergencies.       (b) Reporting and Monitoring.--Not later than 30 days after      a country or region is placed on a list maintained under      subsection (a)(1), each United States diplomatic mission and      consular post located in such country or region shall submit      to the appropriate coordinator a description of the measures      undertaken by such mission or post for the protection of      women and children in the event of a complex humanitarian      emergency.       (c) Dissemination of Information.--A coordinator shall make      available to the public, including to nongovernmental      organizations located in areas where there is an increased      risk of gender-based violence or exploitation of children,      the information, procedures, systems, and measures described      in subsections (a) and (b).  TITLE III--SECURITY FOR REFUGEE AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED WOMEN AND                                 CHILDREN     SEC. 301. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Almost one-half of the world's estimated 37,500,000      refugees and internally displaced persons are children.       (2) Food rations in camps for refugees and internally      displaced persons are often limited and unpredictable, and      vulnerable women rarely have legitimate opportunities to      generate income or products to barter for additional food and      other supplies.       (3) Refugee women and girls face particular threats because      of power inequities, including being forced to exchange sex      for food and humanitarian supplies, and being at increased      risk of rape and gender-based violence due to poor security      in refugee camps.       (4) An investigation into sexual exploitation of refugees      by aid workers in West Africa, conducted by the United      Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services, found many      factors that contribute to the exploitation and abuse of      women and children in refugee situations, including--       (A) few women working in key positions in refugee relief      efforts;       (B) insufficient international staff presence in the camps;       (C) isolation and lack of separate and distinctly placed      sanitary facilities for men and women;       (D) incomplete rations and delayed delivery of supplies to      refugees; and       (E) lack of punishment for perpetrators, including adult      refugees, of sexual crimes against children in refugee      situations.       (5) Refugees and internally displaced persons living      outside of camps experience a range of serious problems      including vulnerability to harassment, abuse, and      exploitation by landlords and employers with little legal      recourse, and constant threat of detention, imprisonment, and      deportation.       (6) Existing nongovernmental organization and international      agency policies, procedures, training programs, monitoring,      and accountability mechanisms have not protected displaced      women and children from exploitation and abuse, provided      adequate assistance to survivors, or to disciplined offenders      and achieved justice.       (7) The limited presence of protection officers and other      trained managerial staff of the United Nations High      Commissioner for Refugees in camps, especially at night,      exacerbates the vulnerability of women and children to abuse      by, in particular, fellow camp residents and nearby local      residents.       (8) In some circumstances, humanitarian agencies have      failed to make women and children aware of their rights to      protection and assistance, to give them access to effective      channels of redress, and to make humanitarian workers aware      of their duty to respect these rights and provide adequate      assistance.       (9) The Inter-Agency Standing Committee has identified      standards of behavior applicable to all of its personnel and      is implementing a plan of action related to protection from      sexual exploitation and abuse to strengthen mechanisms for      protecting those who depend on international aid.     SEC. 302. CODES OF CONDUCT.       (a) Limitation on Assistance.--None of the funds made      available by the Department of State through the Migration      and Refugee Assistance account or the Emergency Refugee and      Migration Assistance account or by any provision of law for      the purposes of the provision of assistance to refugees or      internally displaced persons may be provided to an      organization that has failed to adopt a code of conduct      regarding the protection of beneficiaries of humanitarian      assistance that incorporates the 6 core principles      recommended by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, as      described in subsection (b).       (b) Core Principles.--The 6 core principles for the      protection of beneficiaries are as follows:       (1) Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers      constitute acts of gross     misconduct and are therefore grounds for termination of      employment.       (2) Sexual activity with persons under the age of 18 years      is prohibited regardless of the age of majority or age of      consent locally. Mistaken belief regarding the age of a child      is not a defense.       (3) Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for      sex, including sexual favors or other forms of humiliating,      degrading, or exploitative behavior, is prohibited. This      includes exchange of assistance that is due to beneficiaries.       (4) Sexual relationships between the providers and      beneficiaries of humanitarian assistance are strongly      discouraged since they are based on inherently unequal power      dynamics. Such relationships undermine the credibility and      integrity of humanitarian assistance work.       (5) Whenever a humanitarian assistance worker develops      concerns or suspicions regarding sexual abuse or exploitation      by a fellow worker, whether in the same agency or not, the      worker must report such concerns through established agency      reporting mechanisms.       (6) Humanitarian assistance agencies are obliged to create      and maintain an environment that prevents sexual exploitation      and abuse and promotes the implementation of their code of      conduct. Managers at all levels have particular      responsibilities to support and develop systems that maintain      this environment.     SEC. 303. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ADMINISTRATION                    PRACTICES IN CAMPS FOR REFUGEES AND DISPLACED                    PERSONS.       It is the sense of Congress that all agencies, including      multilateral and nongovernmental agencies, implementing      United States humanitarian assistance programs should conduct      a thorough review of their administrative, management, and      employment practices in refugee and displaced persons camps      for the purposes of--       (1) significantly increasing the number of women involved      in the distribution of food and humanitarian supplies;       (2) expanding opportunities for women to generate      legitimate income in the camps, including through employment      in the camps;       (3) educating providers and beneficiaries of humanitarian      assistance about the seriousness of gender-based violence and      exploitation of children;       (4) improving expatriate supervision and monitoring of      daily operations in the camps;       (5) improving the design and logistics of camps to create a      safer and more secure environment for women and children,      including through consultation with female camp residents;       (6) keeping formal and detailed records, including      photographs, of locally hired staff, and ensuring that they      are adequately paid and trained;       (7) providing training for humanitarian assistance workers      on their obligations and responsibilities under a code of      conduct;       (8) developing systems of accountability to deter and      punish gender-based violence, exploitation of children, and      other protection violations including through identification      of procedures for reporting and investigating allegations of      abuse that protect the safety and confidentiality of the      survivors; and       (9) ensuring that applicants for jobs in camps are screened      to prevent individuals who may have been involved in      protection violations from being hired by camp authorities.     SEC. 304. HEALTH SERVICES FOR REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Complex humanitarian emergencies result in particular      risks for women and girls.       (2) Refugee and displaced women face heightened risks of      developing complications during pregnancy, suffering a      miscarriage, dying, being injured during childbirth, becoming      infected with HIV or another sexually transmitted infection,      or suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.       (3) Despite the heightened risks for women during a complex      humanitarian emergency, women's needs for specialized health      services have often been overlooked by donors and relief      organizations, which are focused on providing food, water,      and shelter.       (4) Priority activities and emergency supplies designed to      address life-threatening women's health problems during a      complex humanitarian emergency are often not implemented or      made available in the early days and weeks of an emergency,      the period when such activities and supplies are most needed      and may be most effective.       (b) Provision of Health Services.--       (1) Requirements.--Each coordinator shall--       (A) ensure that organizations funded by the United States      that respond to a complex humanitarian emergency have the      resources necessary to address the specific health needs of      women affected by the emergency; and       (B) identify an organization or individual to facilitate      the coordination and implementation of the activities needed      to respond to the health needs of women as soon as      practicable and not later than 30 days after the development      of a complex humanitarian emergency.       (2) Activities defined.--The activities referred to in      paragraph (1)(B) include activities to--       (A) prevent and manage the consequences of sexual violence;       (B) reduce transmission of HIV;       (C) provide obstetric care; and       (D) draft a plan to integrate women's health services into      the primary health care services provided during a complex      humanitarian emergency, including--       (i) collection of background data on maternal, infant and      child mortality, and the rate of HIV infection;       (ii) identification of suitable sites for future delivery      of women's health services by addressing security problems,      accessibility for all potential users, privacy and      confidentiality during visits, easy access to water and      sanitation, appropriate space for users' waiting time, and      aseptic conditions;       (iii) an assessment of the staff capacity to provide      women's health services; and       (iv) a plan for staff training.       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized      to be appropriated $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, and      $14,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, to carry out subsection      (b). The amounts authorized to be appropriated in this      subsection are in addition to amounts appropriated for such      fiscal years to the Department of State for the Migration and      Refugee Assistance account, the Emergency Refugee and      Migration Assistance account, or the International Disaster      Assistance account.     SEC. 305. WHISTLEBLOWER SYSTEM.       (a) Design of Model System.--The Secretary should urge the      United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to work with      nongovernmental organizations to design and implement a model      ``whistleblower'' system under which humanitarian workers,      refugees, and internally displaced persons can report      instances of gender-based violence or exploitation of      children. Such a system should ensure that--       (1) reports of instances of gender-based violence or      exploitation of children may be made confidentially and      without risk of retribution;       (2) such reports are swiftly and thoroughly investigated      and adjudicated; and       (3) appropriate disciplinary action is taken against a      person found to have committed an act of gender-based      violence or exploited a child.       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to      the appropriate congressional committees on progress that has      been made toward designing and implementing the model      whistleblower system described in subsection (a).     SEC. 306. WOMEN'S ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) It is often difficult to determine when it is safe for      women and children to return to a community affected by a      complex humanitarian emergency, and in many instances the      affected women and children remain refugees or internally      displaced for considerable periods of time.       (2) To reduce vulnerability to exploitation and abuse,      women who are uprooted from their communities must be given      legitimate opportunities to generate income to support      themselves and their families.       (3) In situations of long-term displacement, humanitarian      and development agencies should provide legal assistance,      technical and vocational training, and access to credit for      women, so they can earn a safe and lawful livelihood.       (b) Work Permits.--The Department of State should work with      host governments, the United Nations High Commissioner for      Refugees, and other appropriate United Nations agencies to      ensure that, in situations of long-term displacement,      refugees and internally displaced persons are granted work      permits and other necessary documentation by the host      government and local authorities to enable them to generate      legitimate income.       (c) Amendments to Microenterprise Act of 2000.--Section 102      of the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 (22      U.S.C. 2151f note) is amended--       (1) in paragraph (4)--       (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) and      subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E), respectively; and       (B) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:       ``(B) Women displaced by armed conflict are particularly at      risk, lacking access to traditional livelihoods and means for      generating income.''; and       (2) in paragraph (13)--       (A) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C);      and       (B) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:       ``(B) Particular efforts should be made to expand the      availability of microcredit programs to internally displaced      persons, who historically have not had access to such      programs.''.       (d) Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act.--Chapter 1 of      part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151      et seq.) is amended--       (1) in section 108 (22 U.S.C. 2151f)--       (A) in subsection (b)(3), by inserting after      ``microentrepeneurs'' the following: ``, with an emphasis on      women microentrepeneurs,''; and       (B) by adding at the end the following new subsection:       ``(g) Reporting Requirement.--The Administrator of the      agency primarily responsible for administering this part, as      part of the annual congressional presentation documents of      the agency, shall submit to Congress a report that contains--       ``(1) an estimate of the number of women living below the      national poverty line that have secured loans or received      training through the programs described in this Act;       ``(2) the percentage of women borrowers in programs funded      by the agency under this Act;       ``(3) the percentage of the total loan funds disbursed by      the agency under this Act that were made available to women      borrowers; and       ``(4) a discussion of the impact that such loans have had      on the economic status of such women.''; and       (2) in section 131 (22 U.S.C. 2151a)--       (A) in subsection (b)(1)(D), by inserting before the period      at the end the following: ``, including programs to eliminate      legal and institutional barriers to women's ownership of      assets, access to credit, and engagement in business      activities within or outside of the home'';       (B) in subsection (b)(2)(C), by inserting before the period      at the end the following: ``, including women's      organizations''; and       (C) in subsection (c)--       (i) by redesignating paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) as      subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D), respectively, and      realigning such subparagraphs, as so redesignated, four ems      from the left margin;       (ii) by striking ``In order'' and inserting the following:       ``(1) Establishment.--In order'';       (iii) in subparagraph (D), as redesignated by clause (i),      by striking ``paragraph (3)'' and inserting ``subparagraph      (C)''; and       (iv) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:       ``(2) Disaggregation.--All goals, indicators, analyses, and      recommendations required by this section shall be      disaggregated by sex.''.

(2) Grant providers.--Assistance described in paragraph (1)      shall be provided through United States and indigenous      private and voluntary organizations, credit unions,      cooperatives, and other nongovernmental organizations with a      capacity to develop and implement microenterprise programs.     SEC. 307. INTERNATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING.       Section 541 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22      U.S.C. 2347) is amended--       (1) by striking ``or (iv)'' and inserting ``(iv)''; and       (2) by striking ``rights.'' and inserting ``rights, or (v)      improve the protection of civilians, especially women and      children who are affected by armed conflict, including those      who, as a result of an armed conflict, are refugees or      displaced persons.''.     SEC. 308. PROTECTION INITIATIVES.       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the Secretary and the Administrator of the United      States Agency for International Development should continue      to develop protection initiatives that support      nongovernmental organizations and multilateral institutions      in identifying protection problems associated with complex      humanitarian emergencies and strategies for prevention of      gender-based violence and exploitation of children and      accountability during a complex humanitarian emergency,      including--       (A) training of field workers on identifying and responding      to gender-based violence and the exploitation of children;       (B) support for the rapid deployment of personnel trained      to identify protection needs to areas affected by complex      humanitarian emergencies;       (C) support for registration initiatives which document      refugees and internally displaced persons for purposes      including the provision of assistance to such persons and of      family reunification; and       (D) support for programs that provide assistance to women      who were displaced due to a complex humanitarian emergency,      including--       (i) psycho-social counseling;       (ii) training related to income generation and employment      skills; and       (iii) emergency health care required to respond to gender-     based violence; and       (2) the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees      should review--       (A) its placement practices to ensure that--       (i) senior protection officials are assigned to the posts      where women and children are in the most danger of gender-     based violence or exploitation;       (ii) experienced protection officers are present at border      crossings; and       (iii) more female staff are present in camps for refugees      or displaced persons; and       (B) its personnel system to facilitate the hiring of      successful junior professional officers on a permanent basis      following their initial tours of duty.       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall report to the      appropriate congressional committees any steps taken to      develop the protection initiatives described in subsection      (a).     SEC. 309. ACCOUNTABILITY.       (a) Required Actions.--Each coordinator shall--       (1) report allegations of gender-based violence,      exploitation of children, and other protection violations to      the Inter-Agency Standing Committee for appropriate response;      and       (2) request an annual report from the United Nations High      Commissioner for Refugees on the actions taken by the High      Commissioner to prevent gender-based violence, exploitation      of children, and other protection violations.       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary      shall transmit to the appropriate congressional committees      the report described in paragraph (2) of subsection (a).        TITLE IV--POSTCONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION     SEC. 401. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings and statements of      policy:       (1) The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 of      October 31, 2000, called on all actors involved in the      negotiation and implementation of peace agreements to address      the specific needs of women and girls during and after armed      conflicts.       (2) Women and children can play an important role in the      prevention and resolution of armed conflicts and in peace-     building.       (3) Despite positive roles of women in fostering peace,      they are excluded from most peace negotiations at the      diplomatic and operational level.       (4) Effective institutional arrangements designed to ensure      the protection and full participation of women and youth in      the peace process, including peacekeeping as well as peace-     building, can significantly contribute to the maintenance and      promotion of international peace and security.       (5) Rape should receive special attention by war crimes      tribunals, truth and reconciliation panels, and other organs      of justice.       (6) Assistance that is linked to peace processes should      support and strengthen women's roles as economic leaders and      assist women in accessing the global marketplace.       (7) Women must be afforded an equal role in decisionmaking      to ensure that their interests are represented at all levels      of government.     SEC. 402. SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITIES AND FORMER COMBATANTS.       (a) Requirement for Programs.--The Secretary, in      conjunction with the Administrator for the United States      Agency for International Development, shall develop and      implement specific programs to provide assistance to      communities that have been affected by a complex humanitarian      emergency and to former combatants, including:       (1) Economic development.--Multi-year economic development      programs that are intended to provide gender-balanced      benefits and to assist female heads of households.       (2) Productive assets.--Programs to increase access to or      ownership of productive assets such as land, agricultural      equipment, and credit by women.       (3) Education and training.--Education and training      programs that are integrated with economic development      programs to encourage the reintegration of former combatants      into society and to promote post-conflict stability in      affected communities.       (4) Extension of education and training.--Programs to      extend education and training, including training in business      development, to women and girls.       (5) Political empowerment.--Programs to politically empower      women, including training to assist women and women's      organizations in understanding legal systems, electoral      processes, legislation advocacy, and the role of the media,      public affairs and information technology in politics, and in      obtaining leadership positions.       (b) Programs of the International Bank for Reconstruction      and Development.--The United States Executive Director of the      International Bank for Reconstruction and Development shall      work to ensure that disarmament, demobilization, and      reintegration programs developed and funded by the      International Bank for Reconstruction and Development provide      benefits to former combatants that are comparable to the      benefits provided by such programs to other individuals.     SEC. 403. POLICE REFORM AND ACCOUNTABILITY.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) In many developing and postconflict countries, police      and military forces continue to function as instruments of      repression, coercion, and centralized power, even after a      transition to democracy has begun.       (2) In order for a transitional, postconflict society to      become stable and democratic, it is necessary for the      government of such society to make a clear separation between      police and military functions, and clearly define the      military forces that are subject to civilian, democratic      control, and the point at which police forces become      accountable, representative service-providers to local      communities.       (3) Police officers in developing and postconflict      countries are often paid minimal salaries and receive little      or improper training, resulting in widespread police      corruption and citizens viewing the police as an obstacle to      justice rather than the enforcer of justice.       (4) Successful professionalization and democratic reform of      police forces requires not only adequate financial resources,      but also concurrent strengthening of the rule of law and      system of justice, transparency, and cooperation with local      community and human rights organizations, removal of corrupt      and abusive personnel, and political will for meaningful      reform at the highest levels of government.       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to      the appropriate congressional committees on all current      programs to assist nations to reconstitute civilian police      authority and capability following a complex humanitarian      emergency, including ensuring the enforcement of laws that      are designed to protect women and children and improve      accountability for gender-based violence.     SEC. 404. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPROVEMENT OF                    UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS.       It is the sense of Congress that the United Nations      Department of Peacekeeping Operations should--       (1) ensure that gender issues are mainstreamed into its      peacekeeping missions, including by establishing a senior      gender advisor post within the Department of Peacekeeping      Operations which reports directly to the Under Secretary      General for Peacekeeping Operations;       (2) provide military, police, and civilian personnel      deployed to areas where women and children are at risk of      gender-based violence or exploitation with training materials      that--       (A) assist such personnel with protecting and addressing      the particular needs of women and children; and       (B) were developed in consultation with women's      organizations; and       (3) ensure that the Special Representative of the Secretary      General of the peacekeeping mission has direct contact with      local women leaders or women's organizations in the area in      which the peacekeepers are deployed for the purpose of      obtaining information regarding gender-based violence or      exploitation of children.          TITLE V--WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S PROTECTION ASSISTANCE     SEC. 501. WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S PROTECTION ASSISTANCE.       Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961      (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the      following new section:     ``SEC. 135. WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S PROTECTION ASSISTANCE.       ``(a) Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, and subject to the limitations of subsection (b), the      President is authorized to provide assistance for programs,      projects, and activities to promote the security of, provide      equal access to basic services for, and safeguard the human      rights and dignity of civilian women and children who are      refugees, displaced persons, or living in areas affected by a      complex humanitarian emergency. Such assistance shall include      programs--       ``(1) to build the capacity of nongovernmental      organizations to protect women and children during a complex      humanitarian emergency, by training staff, incorporating      cross-sectored initiatives that promote child protection,      collecting and analyzing data, developing curricula,      designing field programs, and building local partnerships;       ``(2) to support local and international nongovernmental      initiatives to prevent, detect, and report exploitation of      children and gender-based violence, including through the      provision of training humanitarian protection monitors for      refugees and internally displaced persons;       ``(3) to conduct protection and security assessments for      refugees and internally displaced persons in camps or in      communities, with special emphasis on the security of women      and children for the purposes of improving the design and      security of camps for refugees and internally displaced      persons, including provision for lights, fences, radios, and      other logistics and durable goods;       ``(4) to provide, when practicable, education during a      complex humanitarian emergency, including primary, secondary,      remedial, and accelerated education, vocational and technical      training, health and safety awareness, and other structured      activities that create safe spaces for children and      adolescents, especially for girls;       ``(5) to reintegrate and rehabilitate former combatants and      survivors of gender-based violence, including through      remedial and accelerated education, technical, and vocational      training, psychosocial assistance and trauma counseling,      family and community reinsertion, medical assistance, and      strengthening community systems to support sustained      reintegration;       ``(6) to establish registries and clearinghouses to trace      relatives and begin family reunification, with a specific      focus on helping children find their families;       ``(7) to provide interim care and placement for separated      children and orphans, including monitoring and followup      services;       ``(8) to provide legal services for survivors of rape,      torture, and other forms of gender-based violence, including      the collection of evidence for war crimes tribunals and      advocacy for legal reform;

      ``(B) internally displaced persons; or       ``(C) other civilians requiring basic humanitarian      assistance on an urgent basis; and       ``(2) is caused by one or more situations including--       ``(A) armed conflict;

A bill to direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish a program to support research and training in methods of detecting the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am joined by my colleagues Senators Brownback, Edwards and Graham in introducing the Amateur Sports Integrity Act of 2003. This legislation would make it illegal to gamble on Olympic, college, or high school sports, and it would authorize appropriations for the National Institute of Standards and Technology to fund research into methods of detection and prevention of the use athletic performance-enhancing drugs. The bill is similar to legislation that has been reported twice in previous Congresses.  The legislation is designed to respond to a number of troubling issues plaguing amateur athletics, including a gambling epidemic among high school and college students, and a significant increase among our youth in the use of performance-enhancing drugs and supplements. This bill is essential to ensuring the integrity and legitimacy of amateur athletics--an important institution in the social fabric of this country.  This bill would codify a recommendation made by the congressionally-created National Gambling Impact Study Commission, NGISC, to ban betting on collegiate and amateur athletic events. In the summary of its comprehensive report to Congress dated June 1999, the NGISC noted growing concern regarding increasing levels of sports wagering by high school and college students. The NGISC cites a 1996 study sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which found that of the over200 student athletes surveyed in Division I basketball and football programs, more than one in four admitted to betting on college sports while in school.  More recently, a study conducted by the Psychology Department of Central Connecticut State University contends that the problem of gambling among college students has been relatively overlooked when studying student risk-taking behavior. The study links legal and illegal gambling by indicating that, ``it is reasonable to expect that the growth of legalized gambling over the past decade would result in an increase in student gambling and gambling problems, including students who gamble at a pathological level.'' It is important to understand that gambling is not a problem that occurs in a vacuum. The Connecticut study found that one out of nine students at four Connecticut universities suffered from a gambling problem that was ``significantly connected'' to substance and dietary problems, such as marijuana use, cigarette smoking, and binge eating and drinking.  Just as the use of performance-enhancing drugs threatens the integrity of amateur sports, so does gambling, as it invites public speculation as to their legitimacy and transforms student athletes into merely objects to be bet upon. Betting can also provide unnecessary temptation to amateur athletes to agree to point-shaving and other outcome-fixing schemes at the expense of their teammates, their fans, and their futures. Many of the same pressures that lead college players to cheat also push these young people to use performance-enhancing drugs. The combination of stresses placed on student athletes to perform athletically, handle newly-found notoriety, and pursue professional athletic careers drive many to seek an edge through the use of such substances.  Although the Amateur Sports Integrity Act would ban legal gambling on amateur athletics, it may also reduce a substantial amount of illegal gambling. The relationship between legal and illegal gambling was addressed by the NGISC, which observed that ``legal sports wagering--especially the publication in the media of Las Vegas and offshore-generated point spreads fuels a much larger amount of illegal sports wagering.''  In 1992, Congress recognized the Federal interest in protecting amateur sports from the harmful effects of gambling, and prohibited state-sanctioned sports betting in the overwhelming majority of states. Although Congress ``grandfathered'' Nevada, Oregon, Montana, and Delaware, only Nevada has chosen to permit legal gambling on amateur sports. Recently, however, the gaming industry has lobbied aggressively in an effort to convince the Delaware State legislature to exploit the loophole by legalizing gambling on amateur and professional sports.  Congress must act quickly to close the loophole that currently allows just a handful of States to serve as national clearinghouses for betting on our youth. By allowing betting in any state, we send a confusing message to our youth as to whether gambling on amateur athletics is, in fact, legal or illegal. While I do not pretend that this bill solves all problems associated with gambling and the use of performance-enhancing drugs, I do believe that it will send a clear message that gambling on amateur athletics and the use of these substances is dangerous and wrong.  I urge my colleagues to respond to the pleas of prominent college presidents and coaches, and join in supporting this important measure.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Amateur Sports Integrity      Act''.                  TITLE I--PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS     SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.
