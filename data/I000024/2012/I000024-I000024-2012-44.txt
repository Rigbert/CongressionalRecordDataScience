President, On January 22, 2011 SSG Charles Allen of Oklahoma lost his two legs and almost lost his life in an IED blast in Afghanistan in Arghandel Valley. But his will to live and the help of his wife and family have given this American Hero all the motivation he needed to win his battle for recovery. SSG Allen makes us all proud to be Americans. The following poem entitled PRAETORIANS was penned by Albert Caswell in his honor and his recovery. I ask unanimous consent that said poem be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              Praetorians     Watch over me! Stand Guard!     Stand Ready, Stand Long, Stand Hard!     For you are The Spear of Freedom, that's who you are!            Throughout . . .     Throughout history . . .     There has, and will always be! Those who go off to war!     Men of might, who so fight to be free! Who our freedoms do so            secure!     Like the Roman's, The Praetorian's! To watch over us            continually!     All the more!     Who will stand?     And who will fight?     And who will do what is right? What is right!     And who will lay down their own fine lives?     Who will give up their strong arms and legs, so very bright?            And make the angels cry!     All in what their fine hearts have made, all their most            magnificent lives!     Who will so march off to war?     And so leave all that they so love and adore! To watch over            us throughout the night! Bathed all in freedom's light!     All in that darkness of most evil war, as onward they so            fight! The Praetorian's, are of the ones who so insure!     Standing guard, the ones who so fight onward so ever more!            Airborne, all for our victory to insure!     Who but live to fight with their Band of Brothers, but just            one day more!     Magnificent Men,     who all for our nation their fine hearts are Airborne! Who            upon them all, the title of hero is now so worn! Who go            but where angels so fear to tread!     Even thought their fine blood runs red!     As up to new heights their fine hearts have soared!     For these are the men who are the Airborne, all in times of            war! To Fight the Fight,     as in their arms their brothers hearts beat no more! As it            was on one such faithful tour . . .     Charles, as when your fine heart went even higher, went            Airborne! While, lying there so very close to death . .            . with but not much left . . . When, something so deep            down inside your fine heart, would crest . . . With            your two legs gone and not much left . . .     As to new heights you so pledged . . .     For you had a family back home,     and you held on as you would not so leave them so all alone.     When, Oklahoman said his recovery would be Sooner not later!            As you were gone . . . AIRBORNE!     On the road to recover,     beyond all of that pain and heartache moving on! As we looked            back and you were gone!     As now You So Teach Us!     As now You So Reach Us!     As a Star was born!     And a great American family. . . .     Out of such tragedy somehow has somehow moved on! With your            lovely wife by your side . . .     And your beautiful children in your arms as you've cried! For            you had something to live for!     Touching all our hearts so deep inside!     As the word Hero Charles, in front of your name comes before!            And one day up in Heaven Charles you will be Airborne!     As a PRAETORIAN with wings, to watch over us once            more!                          ____________________
