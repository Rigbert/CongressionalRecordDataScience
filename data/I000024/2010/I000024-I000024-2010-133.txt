President, as the co-chairman of the U.S. Senate Taiwan Caucus, I ask for unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the speech of Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou, delivered, via video conference, before the faculty and students at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        The Quest for Modernity   (Speech by Ma Ying-jeou, President, Republic of China at Fairbank                Center, Harvard University, Apr. 6, 2010)       President Ma Ying-jeou took part this morning in a video      conference with the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at      Harvard University. The conference was moderated by Dr.      William Kirby, Director of the Fairbank Center. Harvard      University president Drew G. Faust opened the conference with      a videotaped talk in which she welcomed President Ma to the      video conference. After the moderator's opening remarks,      President Ma followed with a speech entitled ``The Quest for      Modernity.'' Thereafter, professors Steven M. Goldstein,      David Der-Wei Wang, William P. Alford each posed a few      questions to the president. This was followed by a Q&A      session in which the president fielded questions from members      of the audience. As the conference was drawing to a close,      President Ma gave a short closing statement.       Prof. Kirby, Prof. Goldstein, Prof. Alford, Prof. Wang,      Prof. Su Chi, Ambassador Yuan, Director General Hung, Dear      faculty members, students, distinguished guests, ladies and      gentlemen: Good Evening!                       I. Nostalgia about Harvard       It heartens me to be once again addressing the excellent      faculty and student body of Harvard University. This moment      brings back a rush of nostalgia because it was here I became      a proud father for the first time before I even got my      doctoral degree. It was also at Harvard when I was cloistered      for long hours in the Law School Library, or debating with      fellow classmates and professors, that I was able to broaden      my understanding of the world, and hone my skills as a      scholar, intellectual and eventually a leader. I also feel      nostalgic on a deeper level. When I think of a long litany of      historic events, figures, and institutions: John Hay's Open-     Door Policy, Boxer Rebellion, American Indemnity Scholarships      for China with all its recipients, like Hu Shih and Chien      Shih-Liang, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, May      Fourth Movement, Flying Tigers, Pearl Harbor, John Leighton      Stuart, 1949, Korean War, United States-Republic of China      Mutual Defense Treaty, Fairbank Center, the Quemoy and Matsu      Crisis, Cultural Revolution, Shanghai Communique, Taiwan      Relations Act, mainland China's Reform and Open Policy, U.S.      arms sales to Taiwan and so on, I cannot help but think of      the far-reaching impact that America has had on China's, and      later on Taiwan's, convoluted path to modernization. I cannot      help but think my time at Harvard was not only a personal      academic journey, but also a microcosm reflecting a people's      long search for a modern nation.                    II. Wealth, Power and Democracy       The late venerable Benjamin Schwartz, who as you know had      been a prominent member of the Fairbank Center, described in      the life of Yen Fu that the evolution of modern China has      been a journey in search of wealth and power. Given the rise      of mainland China's economic power and military strength over      the last thirty years, it seems that it has achieved those      goals to a considerable degree. However, I believe a society      that is truly modernizing should not be limited to wealth and      power but must also include the foundations for freedom and      democracy. For it is only through the active participation      and free choice of one's citizens that government truly      serves the welfare of the people; only then can a government      sustain, and a nation thrive. So I am proud to say that the      Republic of China on Taiwan has in fact achieved all these      three pillars. The ROC has since become a thriving nation      with a robust economy, viable military and a truly open and      vibrant democracy. With so much already achieved the roadmap      of my administration is quite straightforward: namely to      strengthen the foundation of these three pillars so as to      safeguard the future of Taiwan's posterity, and to share with      mainland China our values and way of life.                      III. Coming out of Recession       My administration came into office two years ago in the      midst of a global economic crisis, so it's not an      exaggeration that we definitely ``hit the ground running.''      Since then we have worked relentlessly to revitalize Taiwan's      economy. By taking measures such as guaranteeing 100% bank      deposits, substantially lowering interest rate in seven      instances, investing 16 billion US dollars in domestic      infrastructure in 5 years, distributing 2.7 billion US      dollars worth of shopping vouchers, and providing emergency      assistance for the underprivileged, my administration has      successfully brought the economy out of the downturn after a      year and a half. Now we expect to create about a quarter of a      million jobs to bring the unemployment rate below 5% and GDP      growth up to 4.72% this year. Job creation will remain our      top priority, especially those in the green energy sector.      With carbon reduction in mind, we are now ambitiously      promoting innovation across all of Taiwan's most competitive      sectors. These include the country's traditional strongholds      such as IT, agriculture, and healthcare as well as other      emerging industries like green energy, biotech, tourism and      the cultural creative industries. However, the growing trend      towards regional integration among economic powerhouses in      East Asia, like Japan, mainland China, South Korea and the      ASEAN countries, is threatening to marginalize Taiwan's      heavily export-driven economy. As such, my administration has      been seeking to institutionalize economic relations with      mainland China and diversify our export markets and products      so that Taiwan will not only avoid being cut off from the      global economy but also enhance its international      competitiveness. Therefore, we have been pushing hard for an      Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with the      mainland that will serve as a critical structural platform      for economic interaction between the two sides. On top of      intellectual property rights protection and investment      guarantee, the framework will include an early harvest      package of goods and services to enjoy zero custom tariffs.      The negotiations are already underway and expect to conclude      in the next few months. We have also established government      programs that will cushion potential shocks to industries and      workers, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises.      Although some assert that signing the ECFA with mainland      China will compromise our sovereignty, this is definitely not      the case. The top priority of my administration has always      been the principle of ``putting Taiwan first for the benefit      of the people.'' The truth of the matter, ECFA will spearhead      Taiwan's return to the accelerated track for economic      integration in Asia-Pacific and beyond. This without a doubt      will strengthen Taiwan's capabilities to enhance its      competitive edge in the global market and brighten its      outlook for negotiating similar arrangements with other      countries.         IV. Cross-Strait Rapprochement and Flexible Diplomacy       In the pursuit of power my administration is not merely      seeking military strength but more importantly to build up      our soft power. In fact, the heart of my foreign policy is to      reestablish mutual trust with all our major international      partners, especially the United States. In achieving this      goal, my administration has worked incessantly to transform      the Taiwan Straits from a major flashpoint into a conduit for      regional peace and prosperity. Therefore, in order to resume      constructive dialogue with the mainland after a hiatus of      over a decade, we first announced in 2008 the policy of ``No      Unification, No Independence, No Use of Force'' so as to      maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait under the      framework of the Republic of China's 1946 Constitution. This      breakthrough was further advanced under the framework of the      92 Consensus of ``one China, respective interpretations''      that was reached by the two sides in November 1992. That is      now deemed a feasible formula by government leaders across      the Taiwan Strait as well as many in the wider world      community. We have also adopted a policy of Flexible      Diplomacy and pursued a diplomatic truce with the mainland,      which has by and large ended the vicious cycle of diplomatic      warfare between the two sides. This will assuredly foster      responsible stakeholdership in both Taiwan as well as the      mainland. At the same time, we are working equally hard to      enhance Taiwan's meaningful participation in and contribution      to the international community. This will be achieved through      our strong initiative to develop Taiwan's green technology      and healthcare industries in conjunction with our foreign aid      policies. For example, under the Flagship Program for Green      Energy Industry, we will be building up Taiwan's industrial      base in green technology especially in Photo voltaic solar      cells and LED. This will not only benefit our people and      economy, but more importantly, Taiwan will be able to share      its resources and expertise with our allies and friends. On      my visit to our Pacific island allies last month, I was proud      to survey firsthand the work that Taiwan has done for some of      the countries in the area. For example, Taiwan     has installed and provided solar energy technology to the      Solomon Islands in hopes of improving the environment and      livelihoods of their people. Taiwan has also set up an      impressive medical mission in the Marshall Islands to      treat the high prevalence of cataracts sufferers. In fact,      our government will boost the overall effectiveness of our      medical aid by initiating many more medical and public      health missions that will target specific conditions and      diseases common among the people of the Pacific island      allies and friends. At the same time, after Taiwan      effectively controlled the spread of the H1N1 Flu within      our own borders, with a mortality rate of 2 deaths per      million, which is only \1/3\ of the average for OECD      countries, I am proud to report that Taiwan will also be      giving away locally manufactured vaccines worth 5 million      U.S. dollars to other countries in need. Taiwan's search      and rescue teams were also one of the first on the scenes      when Haiti was hit by a devastating earthquake earlier      this year. In addition to donating $16 million worth in      aid and funds, our government is also planning to set up      medical and vocational training centers to train for      hundreds of medical and skilled workers, and build 1,200      housing units. Also, as a sign of Taiwan's flourishing      civil society, World Vision Taiwan has collected countless      small donations from our people that will be sufficient to      feed and save more than 8,000 homeless Haitian children      and orphans. However, my administration realizes      humanitarian relief is only a small part of the long and      challenging road to full recovery. This is why we hope to      continue the work we have started in integrating the      advances we make in healthcare and green technology into      our foreign aid framework, so that Taiwan can truly make a      meaningful difference in the countries we help.            V. The Universal Value of Freedom and Democracy       However, coming back full circle, the search for a modern      nation cannot merely lie upon the pillars of wealth and      power. It is only under a true democracy that one's citizens      can live without fear according to the law, and share in the      burdens as well as benefits of good governance. Although      Taiwan has made impressive sociopolitical progress over the      last decades, it is still a young democracy. So, as firm      champions for democracy, my administration will work to      strengthen the democratic infrastructure of my country.      Already we are taking tangible steps to enhance Taiwan's rule      of law and protection of human rights in conformity with      international standards. In the past year, we have ratified      the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights      (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social      and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), both administered by the United      Nations. In converting these covenants into domestic law,      they will certainly strengthen the human rights of our      citizenry and further consolidate our rule of law.      Furthermore, I came to power on the promise of combating      corruption in elections and government, whereby we have      already made meaningful progress. Without a doubt this goal      will continue to be a cornerstone of my presidency, which I      am determined to carry through in my capacity as the      President of the country. I will assuredly not waver from the      path in laying the foundations of a true democracy. In fact,      next year in 2011 will be the Centennial Anniversary of the      Republic of China. Against the background of thousands of      years of Chinese history, the last century was in some ways      merely a comma. But from a larger perspective, it was nothing      short of an exclamation mark, as it has been 100 years of      struggle; 100 years of experimentation and 100 years of      education before a people learned that they too have the      unequivocal rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of      happiness. This nation-building process undoubtedly was      achieved through the collective efforts of countless      dedicated individuals who traversed between tradition and      modernity that helped bridge the East to the West so many      years ago. Inevitably, this made it possible for a people to      aspire to the same democratic values as you cherish. From the      chaos arising out of the turn of the 20th century, to the      founding of the first republic in Asia in 1912 and its      evolution forward in 1949 when the Republic of China      Government moved to Taiwan, in 1987 when Taiwan lifted      martial law, launched its democratic transformation, and      subsequently allowed Taiwan residents to visit their      relatives on the mainland, in 1996 when people on Taiwan      directly elected its President for the first time, and in      2000 and 2008 when the Presidential elections further      consolidated Taiwan's democracy through two rotations of      power between political parties, the passage of these 100      years has irrevocably transformed the foundations of a      political culture. Distinguished faculty members and      students, ladies and gentlemen, as the elected president of      the Republic of China, I will continue to strive toward      forging Taiwan into an exemplary democracy; one that will be      a source of inspiration and emulation for generations to      come.       Thank you.                     President Ma's closing remarks       Dear distinguished faculty, students and friends; it is my      great pleasure to hold this teleconference with you. Your      questions and comments are very good, and some are very tough      to answer, but in thinking and answering these questions you      force me to think deeper and strive harder on the challenges      that confront the road ahead.       Although today's conference is near an end, I am heartened      by the thought that our friendship will continue to grow as      there is still so much we need to do, together. The      international system that the US forged out of the      devastation of World War II 65 years ago has today become the      enduring foundation of our global village. Being rule-based      and sufficiently flexible, this system encourages positive-     sum international cooperation rather than zero-sum interstate      conflict. Hence, it changed the underlying dynamics of the      world order that made it possible for countries, big or      small, to prosper together. As a matter of fact, my idea to      seek rapprochement with the mainland find some similarities      with the ideas espoused by the American leaders in having      soft talks with the Soviet Union and to have detente. In      other words, to replace confrontation with negotiations; to      solve international disputes through peaceful means. It is      this very system that has interlocked the world into a      community of thriving interdependence, giving rise to the      possibility where foes can turn into friends, where every      country can be a winner and every contribution become part of      a greater picture.       This is also the system from which I draw my inspiration to      lead my country, particularly in dealing with the mainland.      In taking a responsible stake in the world, and in seeking      rapprochement with the Chinese mainland, my administration      has committed the Republic of China on Taiwan to becoming a      dependable and valuable contributor to this international      system. In my visit abroad last month, I kept saying to our      friends or to the overseas Taiwanese and to members of my      delegations, that what I tried to do as far as my country's      foreign relations is concerned is to make Taiwan a      respectable member of the international community. I want      every Taiwanese when they walk in the streets of New York, of      Paris, of Sydney, of Beijing that they are respected. People      will say they are from Taiwan, and that Taiwan is a      respectful country in the world. Some in my domestic audience      may disagree with me, but I firmly believe that this is the      right path for Taiwan to avoid being marginalized from the      forward march of the rest of the world. However, we will not      merely concentrate on our own interests but equally apply our      resources in hopes of having a positive impact on the world      community. In fact, under this system that the United States      started over half a century ago, we, as a whole, ought to be      able to right what has gone wrong; to unite as one humanity      against the global crises that threatens all that we hold      dear, whether climate change, the global economic downturn,      the risk of pandemics, or the wars that endanger the peace of      our world. In the end, we are the only ones that can overcome      the challenges we face. And in such an important partnership,      I am confident Taiwan will be there to live up to its      responsibilities.       Thank you.                          ____________________
