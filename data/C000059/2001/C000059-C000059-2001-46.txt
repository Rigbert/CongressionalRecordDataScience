Speaker, it is with great pleasure today to pay tribute to a wonderful, young city in my district as they prepare to celebrate their 10th Anniversary--Murrieta, California, a ``Gem of the Valley.'' Murrieta is an expansive valley covered with grasses and dotted with oak trees.  Incorporated as a city in July of 1991 after an overwhelming supportive vote, Murrieta has seen tremendous growth since its small beginnings as a sheep ranch. It was a young Don Juan Murrieta who first recognized the naturalbeauty and vitality of this California valley and bought 52,000 acres in 1873. As the years passed by, the city saw slow growth and finally a boom when the railroad came through. By 1890, almost 800 people lived in the valley. Unfortunately, by 1935 the city had gone bust like so many western towns whose livelihood depended upon the railroad.  It would not be until 1987, more than fifty years later, that Murrieta Valley would once again come into its own. That year saw explosive growth for this sleepy little town. Totaling only 542 residents in 1970 and little more than 2,250 a decade later it found its population increase by a multiple of eight by 1991, to 20,000 residents, when Murrieta became an incorporated city. This year, as they celebrate their 10th Anniversary it finds itself the home of some 50,000 residents.  As a city and community, Murrieta has thrived with the greater control of its destiny over the last 10 years. That includes providing services from within the community instead of outside, such as police, fire and library systems of its own rather than contracting for these services.  In 10 short years, the City of Murrieta has seen its population and communities grow because of dedication to affordable housing, protecting the natural beauty of the valley, good schools, low crime and clean air. The city adopted its first General Plan after more than 50 public meetings to draft a vision of what the new city would become over the next several decades. The police department was created in 1992, the fire department in 1993 and the library system in 1998. Public services like these are what bind a city together along with the building of parks and recreational facilities and more. In fact, for their incredible progress as a city Murrieta has won numerous awards for innovation and performance.  Mr. Speaker, looking back, the city of Murrieta and its residents can hold their heads high with pride at what their once small town has become in only 10 short years. I wish to extend to them my congratulations as families, community leaders and business leaders gather on this Saturday, June 30th, to celebrate their 10th Anniversary. Congratulations to the ``Gem of the Valley!''                          ____________________
