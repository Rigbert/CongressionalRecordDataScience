 President, unfortunately, the McCain amendment coordination provision lets big labor continue to coordinate its ground game with the Democrats. As you know, I have been predicting for 2 weeks that there would be an effort to water down provisions in the bill that were offensive to big labor.  With all due respect to the author of the amendment, the intent is quite clear: to mitigate the damage that has caused concern among those in organized labor about this bill. I note there is apparently not enough concern to get many Democratic votes against on final passage Monday, but they are very upset about the coordination provisions of this bill, thus the reason for the amendment that has been sent to the desk.  Let me make it clear, the coordination provision lets big labor continue to coordinate its ground game with the Democratic Party. It does this by changing the ``concept of coordinated activity'' that includes the union in-kind activity to ``coordinated expenditures or disbursements'' which are legal terms of art that do not encompass in-kind contributions. This new coordination provision is still unconstitutional and will result in Government witch hunts because it does not require actual collaboration or agreement to have a finding of coordination. This is in direct contravention to Colorado 1 and will result in a lengthy onerous investigation of citizens groups.  Mr. President, there will be a need to have a rollcall vote on the McCain amendment at 11 a.m. I do not know whether this is the appropriate time to request that rollcall vote or not.
