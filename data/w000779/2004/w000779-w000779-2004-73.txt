A lot of Senators have been at this issue for many of years. Senator Bingaman's contribution with respect to community services in the health care area is very important. I heard my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, talk about the health care needs of folks laid off in the high-tech and service areas. He has been supportive as well.  The Senator from Montana is absolutely right. There have been a lot of Senators who have been at it with respect to this issue. It is a bipartisan proposal, but right at the heart of that is dealing with the health care issue. Health care, as we all know, has been the toughest issue for the Senate to deal with for some time. This is an area where there has been a real breakthrough with respect to health care. It had to be bipartisan--the Senator from Montana is right--or a lot of Senators would not be involved.
