 Number one, it is nongermane to our bill. In fact, the amendment is actually unnecessary because there are no funds related to this purpose in our bill at all. Perhaps the gentleman could present the amendment to another bill, but literally, it is extraneous. It has no relationship to the bill before us here in the House, and I would ask my colleagues to oppose it.  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
