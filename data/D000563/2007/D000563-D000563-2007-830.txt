President, the suffering in Darfur and Sudan on the continent of Africa continues today as it has every day for too many years. I rise again to urge my colleagues that we must do more to end this crisis in Sudan. Two weeks ago, before the Memorial Day recess, I came to the floor to highlight some of the positive steps taken thus far by Congress, the Bush administration, the business community, and nonprofits to pressure the Sudanese regime to end this genocide. I said then and I will repeat today: We must do more.  In that speech I urged the President to follow through on what he promised to do in April at the Holocaust museum just down the street in Washington. To the President's credit, last week he took steps forward. He tightened United States economic sanctions on Sudan. He targeted sanctions against more individuals responsible for the violence, and he vowed to push for a strong new United Nations Security Council resolution that would further pressure the Sudanese regime. I applaud the President for his leadership. But I repeat, we must do more.  On March 28, as Treasury Secretary Paulson testified in front of the Appropriations subcommittee I chair, I asked the Secretary: What resources does the Treasury Department need to put more pressure on the Sudanese Government to end the genocide? His answer:       . . . We'd like the flexibility to charge a larger fine,      because $50,000 may not be enough.  He was talking about civil and criminal penalties that violators of American sanctions on Sudan should face and the fact that the current penalties are not much of a deterrent. It was a concrete suggestion from the administration, and I agreed to accept his challenge. Based on that testimony, more discussions with the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the State Department, and other agencies, we created the Sudan Disclosure and Enforcement Act which I introduce today. This act provides the administration and all Americans with more resources and tools and information so we can each do our part to end the genocide and bring peace to Darfur. It creates real consequences for those who support the Sudanese regime and, perhaps most importantly, it requires the administration and Congress to meet in 90 days to reassess the steps that need to be taken to help to end the crisis.  For my colleagues who are considering supporting this legislation, here is what the bill will do in specifics: first, express the sense of Congress that the international community should continue to bring pressure against the Government of Sudan to convince that regime that the world would not allow this crisis to continue; second, authorize greater resources for the Office ofForeign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury to strengthen its capabilities in tracking Sudanese economic activity and pursuing sanctions violators; third, require more detailed SEC disclosures by United States listed companies that operate in the Sudanese petroleum sector so investors can make informed decisions regarding divestment from these companies; fourth, dramatically increase civil and criminal penalties for violating American economic sanctions to create a true deterrent against transacting with barred Sudanese companies; fifth, require the administration to report on the effectiveness of the current sanctions regime and recommend other steps Congress could take to help end the crisis.  I am proud to introduce this legislation with bipartisan support. I particularly thank the ranking member of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, my friend and colleague Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, for all of his great work on this issue. I am pleased to be joined by all of the other original cosponsors as well: Senators Dodd, who also chairs the Banking Committee and is a great ally; Senators Klobuchar, Mikulski, Bill Nelson, Obama, and Wyden.  I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join this effort. As we move around our States and visit parts of the country, occasionally a person will come up after a meeting and say to me: Senator, what are you doing about Darfur? Didn't your country, America, declare a genocide? What are you doing?  Frankly, aside from speeches on the floor and an occasional resolution, bills of very little consequence, there hasn't been much to point to. I hope my colleagues who face that same question and worry that the response is so inadequate will take a good look at this legislation. I hope they will join me in cosponsoring this effort. We should pass this measure, work with our House colleagues and do the same, send this bill to the President. The President said in April:       You who have survived evil know that the only way to defeat      it is to look it in the face and not back down. It is evil      that we are now seeing in Sudan, and we're not going to back      down.  The President went on to say:       No one who sees these pictures can doubt that genocide is      the only word for what is happening in Darfur and that we      have a moral obligation to stop it.  I completely agree with the President. It has been more than 2\1/2\ years since the President called what is taking place in Darfur, Sudan by its rightful name--genocide. Yet even as an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 people have been killed, even as over 2 million men, women, and tiny children have been forced from their homes by violence and killing, even as the violence continues as we meet in the safety and comfort of this great Nation, America and the entire international community have not done enough to help. We must do more. This bill moves in the right direction. It gives our Government the tools and the encouragement to act and act quickly.  I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1563       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Sudan Disclosure and      Enforcement Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) On July 22, 2004, the Senate passed Senate Concurrent      Resolution 133, 108th Congress, and the House of      Representatives passed House Concurrent Resolution 467, 108th      Congress, both resolutions declaring that ``the atrocities      unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide''.       (2) On September 9, 2004, President Bush declared that ``we      have concluded that genocide has taken place in Darfur''.       (3) On June 30, 2005, President Bush affirmed that ``the      violence in Darfur region is clearly genocide [and t]he human      cost is beyond calculation''.       (4) On May 8, 2006, President Bush reaffirmed, ``We will      call genocide by its rightful name, and we will stand up for      the innocent until the peace of Darfur is secured.''.       (5) On November 20, 2006, the Presidential Special Envoy to      Sudan, Andrew S. Natsios, stated in a briefing to members of      the press, ``And there's a point--January 1st is either we      see a change or we go to Plan B.''.       (6) On February 20, 2007, Special Envoy Natsios stated in      an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations, ``We      needed to send a message to the Sudanese government that we      were no longer simply going to continue with the situation      the way it's been the last four years, that there was a      change. We are considering more aggressive measures should we      make no progress in the humanitarian area, in the political      negotiations, and in the implementation of Kofi Annan and Ban      Ki-moon's plan to introduce . . . additional forces.''.       (7) On April 18, 2007, President Bush stated, ``It is evil      we are now seeing in Sudan--and we're not going to back      down.''.       (8) The Government of Sudan, as of the date of the      introduction of this Act, has announced its willingness to      accept 3,000 United Nations peacekeepers and their equipment,      but has continued to obstruct the full-scale joint United      Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission authorized under      United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006) and to      prevent sufficient humanitarian access to meet the urgent      needs of the people of Darfur.       (9) Congress supports the objectives of a ``Plan B'' as      outlined in the press and elsewhere to increase pressure on      the Government of Sudan to accept a greatly expanded      peacekeeping mission with a mandate to protect the people of      Darfur.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that the President should--       (1) continue to work with other members of the      international community, including the Permanent Members of      the United Nations Security Council, the African Union, the      European Union, the Arab League, and the Government of Sudan      to facilitate the urgent deployment of a peacekeeping force      as called for by United Nations Security Council Resolution      1706 (2006); and       (2) bring before the United Nations Security Council, and      call for a vote on, a resolution requiring meaningful      multilateral sanctions against the Government of Sudan in      response to its acts of genocide against the people of Darfur      and its continued refusal to allow the implementation of a      peacekeeping force as called for by Resolution 1706.
