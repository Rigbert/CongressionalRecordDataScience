Speaker, sadly, the corruption of democracy continues in this House this day. Almost unanimously, we sent a bill back to conference committee for further consideration to protect the safety of the public.  During the course of that debate, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the chairman of the subcommittee, said nothing in response to an assertion made about public safety. Nothing, I say to my colleagues, can be further from the truth.  The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) went on to say, ``So we will take this bill back to conference.'' Nothing, my colleagues, could be further from the truth.  The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) went on to say, ``We will revisit this issue.'' Nothing, my friends, could be further from the truth.  He went on to say, ``Anyone who would like, we will make a copy of this report available.'' Nothing, my friends, could be further from the truth.  There was no conference, there was no discussion, there was no democracy. Shame on the processes undermining democracy in this House.                          ____________________
