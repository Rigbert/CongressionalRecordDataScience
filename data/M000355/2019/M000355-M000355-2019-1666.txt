 Schumer) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:                              S. Res. 172       Whereas, in the administrative appeal of Bryan K. Stanley,      Dkt. No. MC-18-160, pending before the Mississippi Division      of Medicaid, the beneficiary has requested testimony from Kim      Coalter, an employee of the office of Senator Cindy Hyde-     Smith;       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United      States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no      evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate      may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from      such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;      and       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or      in the possession of the Senate may promote the      administration of justice, the Senate will take such action      as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the      privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That Kim Coalter is authorized to testify in the      administrative hearing of Bryan K. Stanley before the      Mississippi Division of Medicaid, except concerning matters      for which a privilege should be asserted.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing the production of testimony, and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a state administrative hearing regarding Medicaid benefits. A constituent of SenatorHyde-Smith is seeking testimony at the hearing from an employee in the Senator's office who had assisted him. Senator Hyde-Smith would like to cooperate with this request by providing relevant testimony from the employee.  The enclosed resolution would authorize the employee to testify in this action.                          ____________________
