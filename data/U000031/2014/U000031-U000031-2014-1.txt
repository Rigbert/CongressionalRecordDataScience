Speaker, I would just say that Ralph Hall is an amazing man. I served with him on the Energy and Commerce Committee a lot of years. I had the luxury of sitting next to him. We have a lot of great stories, that is for sure.  I can remember when he came back to the Science Committee, and we said that we had yet another Texan. He said, ``When I'm done, you'll wish that you had another 10 or 12.''
