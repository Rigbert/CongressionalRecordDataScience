 As I am sure he knows, the SCAAP reimbursements provided in prior years did not nearly cover the costs states and localities incurred to incarcerate illegal aliens in their jurisdictions.  In Fiscal Year 2000, the last year for which such cost figures are available, the cost for states and localities amounted to more than $11 billion. Thus, last year's funding level covered only $565 million, or 5.1 percent, of the actual costs.  A cut along the magnitude of that which is included in the Committee bill would be absolutely devastating. The State of Wisconsin would lose more than $1.1 million in funding; Rhode Island would lose over $900,000; Pennsylvania would lose over $1 million. Thus, even states which have not traditionally had to confront the growth in illegal immigration are bearing the costs of this Federal responsibility.  When the Federal government fails in its responsibility to control our nation's borders, local taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens in State and local jails.  I will work closely with my colleagues in both bodies during the weeks to come to insure that this bill adequately funds SCAAP.
