Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to Lieutenant Colonel Donald P. Lauzon of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upon both the completion of his command as the District Engineer for the Detroit District and also upon his retirement from distinguished service with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Colonel Lauzon earned his Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and is a Distinguished Military Graduate from Rhode Island College, Providence, RI; a Masters of Military Operational Art and Science from the United States Air Force Air University on the historic Maxwell-Gunter AFB, AL, as well as a Masters Degree in Construction Management from Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO. He was commissioned in the U.S. Army in 1986.  Lauzon has served with distinction abroad in Bosnia, Iraq and Germany. His assignments include a tour in Bosnia serving on both 1st Infantry Division and 1st Armor Divisions' General Staff at Camp Eagle, Tuzla, and in Desert Shield/Storm as the Assistant Operations Officer and Battalion Battle Captain in support of the 20th Engineer Brigade. As a Lieutenant, he served as a platoon leader and Company Executive Officer of the 547th Combat Engineer Battalion, Germany.  He has also served in a wide array of assignments in the U.S., including the Chief of Operations Branch, Defense Mapping School, Fort Belvoir, VA; Battalion Executive Officer, 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power); Executive Officer, Deputy Chief of Engineers, Headquarters' USACE, Washington, DC; Resident Engineer for Fort Dix/McGuire AFB of the New York District; and as Company Commander of the 299th Engineer Battalion at both Fort Carson, Colorado and Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Immediately prior to arriving in Detroit, LTC Lauzon served as Chief of the Department of Military Training, National Geospatial and Intelligence Agency, Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  Colonel Lauzon is a recipient of the Bronze Star. His other numerous citations include: the Defense Meritorious Service Medal; the Meritorious Service Medal, 4th award; Army Commendation Medal, 4th award; Army Achievement Medal, 3rd award; National Defense Service Medal; Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal; South-West Asia Medal with 2 stars; Kuwaiti Liberation Medal; NATO Ribbon; Armed Forces Service Ribbon and the Meritorious Unit Citation. His badges include Basic parachute and Air Assault.  He served as the Commander, Detroit District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from 2004 to 2006. My district, which is southwest Michigan, was fortunate to finally have a Detroit District Commander who really paid attention to the needs of the small communities on Lake Michigan. During his tenure, there was significant progress made in the dredging of the St. Joseph, Michigan harbor for the first time in many years. The entire community appreciated the diligence of Colonel Lauzon in dealing with the issues that were most important to us.  I wish to personally thank Colonel Lauzon for not only his service to the country, but particularly for his assistance to the great State of Michigan over the last 2 years. I wish him much success in his future endeavors, particularly on the golf course.                          ____________________
