President, it is my pleasure to pay tribute to someone who has touched the lives of millions not just in this country but across the world. This week, tenor Placido Domingo sings the title role in the new Washington National Opera production of Handel's ``Tamerlano.'' It is his 130th role, an unprecedented feat. He has made each of these parts into something alive and multidimensional. Tragic figures like Otello or Cavaradossi have come to life and, through their actions, have laid out time-honored truths about human emotions and how we live. Mr. Domingo's singing, marked by a clarion tone and natural sense of the shape of a musical phrase, can move us to great heights and the deepest depths. He is a positive force in the world and someone that everyone can celebrate.  Next year marks the 40th anniversary of his debuts at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the country's premiere opera house, the Metropolitan Opera. He frequently sings across the globe, gracing stages of esteemed European opera houses like London's Royal Opera and Milan's La Scala. He might be most widely known as one of the ``3 Tenors.'' His recording of grand productions and solo recitals fill store racks in my home State of Vermont, as well as the whole country. These are unheralded achievements for any tenor, undertakings that have led to numerous awards like several Grammy awards and his recent election by a respected British magazine as the ``King of Singers.''  Thankfully, his ego is not nearly as long or wide as that list of laurels. He is a deeply respectful individual, and he takes interest in others. He came be extremely kind. He paid me one of the nicest favors last year, when, at a special function, my wife Marcelle asked him to sing ``Happy Birthday'' to me. Rarely has the simple tune been heard with such color and finesse. It was a moment that I will never forget.  Even in that straightforward, if always sweet, tune that amazing sense of the inner workings of music was there. There have been other great tenors but few who have shown such a strong musical sense. The word used most often to describe Mr. Domingo's approach to each score is ``scrupulous,'' a word that means meticulous, fastidious, conscientious. That quality extends into his work from the podium as a conductor and from the boardroom as a general manager, not only of the Washington National Opera but also the Los Angeles Opera. He gets inside whatever he is doing--singing, conducting, administration--and makes it come out fresh, natural, and seemingly right.  He has literally lived and breathed opera throughout his life. As a child, he sang the popular Spanish operas known as zarzuela. The two companies that he directs have commissioned new operas, and it is new operas that make all the difference between a ``has-been'' and a living, breathing art form. Just 2 years ago, the Washington National Opera put on Scott Wheeler's ``Democracy.'' Its themes of politics, love, and Washington still resonate today.  Mr. Domingo spends a great deal of time in the United States, which has received him like the hero he often sings on stage. He knows New York, Washington, and Los Angeles like a native. He undertakes tours to sing across the Nation, sometimes bringing music to communities that may not have a major opera house. He is not an American citizen, but he embraces some of the best qualities of what it means to be an American, energetic and open, alive to life's possibilities. He has forged a special bond with the country, and for that we are all grateful.  As Mr. Domingo takes on his role this week at the Washington National Opera, I know the entire Senate joins me in congratulating and thanking him for his relentless work and his spectacular ability to move us to tears, laughter, and sheer joy.                          ____________________
