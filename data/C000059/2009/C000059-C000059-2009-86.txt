University of Michigan Sophomore Tyler Clary is turning heads and breaking records in the swimming world; and he's ready for the next step--the Olympics. Tyler grew up in Riverside, California, where his parents still reside. Our entire community is very proud of this young man and his accomplishments.  Tyler graduated from Poly High School in 2007 where he was a CIF champion in swimming. Tyler is now flourishing at the University of Michigan. He recently captured his first NCAA title and his time of 3:35.98 broke the American Record of 14-time Olympian gold medalists Michael Phelps by 28 hundredths of a second. Tyler received a congratulatory text message from Michael Phelps, who Tyler trained with at Michigan. The next night Tyler captured the 200-yard backstroke title and broke another NCAA record of Olympian gold medalists Ryan Lochte.  Tyler's coaches are not only impressed by his pure athleticism but by his great attitude. A recruiting coach from Cal said that he knew Tyler ``was going to be one of the greats.'' Tyler intends to prove that correct as he sets his sights on the 2012 Olympics. He was just shy of making the cut for the 2008 Olympics and Tyler doesn't intend to let anything get in his way the next time around. He has begun preparation for this year's world championships, which will be held this summer in Rome.  Tyler is also a five-time All American Athlete, the 2009 Swimmer of the Year, the 2009 Big Ten (Conference) Swimmer of the Year, and holds the University of Michigan's records in the 200 Individual Medley (IM), 400 IM, 200 Backstroke and 800 Free Relay. Tyler was the 2006 Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) World Youth Top Male Performer. In 2007, Tyler was the Silver Medalist in the 200 Backstroke at the Pan American Games.  Madam Speaker, it is a rare honor to be able to speak about an athlete who is expected to break records and possibly become a future Olympic champion. Tyler Clary has everything it takes and I believe that three years from now I will be on the House floor congratulating Tyler on a successful return from the 2012 Summer Olympics being hosted in London. Tyler exemplifies the best of our future generations and I look forward to watching him in the years to come.                          ____________________
