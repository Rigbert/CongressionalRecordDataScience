As Senator Byrd carries theConstitution in his pocket, I carry with me a card which has a record of what is happening under the Clinton-Gore administration. Record budget deficits have been erased.  In 1992, the deficit was a record $292 billion. The Congressional Budget Office said it was going to grow to $455 billion by the year 2000, this year. Instead, we have a projected $167 billion surplus, the third one in a row. That is $622 billion in savings not drained by the Government in 1 year alone. And we have had the largest paydown of debt in the history of the United States--$297 billion.  All the deficit hawks on the other side of the aisle hate to hear these numbers, but they are the facts.  Under the Clinton-Gore administration, we have addressed the deficit situation. We are no longer talking about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget but are moving in the right direction. The American people want us to continue doing that.  We have people who visit this Capitol at this time of year, usually classrooms from across America. These young men and women who come to watch this Senate and visit our offices deserve an America with a reduced national debt. That is the goal of the President's proposal and his budget. It is one not shared by George W. Bush. He believes we should give a massive and risky tax cut across the board. We believe targeted tax cuts make more sense and deficit and debt reduction are absolute priorities.
