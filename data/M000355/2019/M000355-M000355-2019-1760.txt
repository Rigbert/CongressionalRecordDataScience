 President, today I would like to remember the life of Frank Treadway, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 96.  Born in Bell County in southeast Kentucky, Frank was one of 12 children, and much of his childhood was spent helping on the family farm in Noetown. During his teenage years, Frank worked at the Middlesboro Country Club as a golf caddy, developing a lifelong love for the game. Like so many members of the Greatest Generation, Frank proudly answered his Nation's call to service, and he enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Aboard the U.S.S. Kyne, Frank served throughout the Pacific. For their meritorious participation in combat, the crew received multiple commendations.  After Frank returned home from the war, Frank married the love of his life, Inez. They spent 70 years together and raised seven children. Farming remained an enduring passion, and one of Frank's proudest accomplishments was the founding and continued success of his local farm market, Treadway Gardens. Throughout his life, Frank remained loyal to his childhood home and always held the people of southeast Kentucky in high regard. Elaine and I commend this hero for his service, and we send our condolences to Inez, their children, family, and friends.                          ____________________
