Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 20'h Anniversary of the Links, Inc.--Southern Maryland Chain Chapter. The Links, Inc., is an organization of nearly 10,000 women with 270 chapters located in 40 States, the District of Columbia, Nassau, Bahamas and Frankfort, Germany. Members areindividual achievers who are making a difference in the communities and lives of African Americans and persons of African decent across the globe.  The Links, Inc.--Southern Maryland Chain Chapter began in 1980 as an interest group led by the visionary Albertine T. Lancaster. After two years of community projects within Calvert, Charles and St. Mary's counties, the 26 dynamic women were installed into the Links, Inc.  Today, President Sandra Billups and the Southern Maryland Chain Chapter have 30 members who continue to build links of service to those in need. The Chapter is strongly rooted in building friendships and volunteering their services to fill needs locally and globally. The work of these dedicated women has created financial opportunities and support to so many.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the dedicated, distinctive and diligent women of the Links, Inc.--Southern Maryland Chain Chapter for 20 years of outstanding service to Southern Maryland communities. The Links, Inc. continue to sponsor such projects as the Annual College Scholarship, African American Family Fun Fest, Annual Civic Luncheon, Project Lead: High Expectations and Tri-County shelters.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the Links, Inc.--Southern Maryland Chain Chapter and the virtuous women that serve daily for their commitment to excellence and am honored to recognize their many contributions to making Southern Maryland a stronger, more responsive community.                          ____________________
