President, if there is one thing that anyone who visits Norwich, Vermont does not forget, it is Dan & Whit's General Store. Dan & Whit's is a Vermont legend, as are its namesakes, Dan Fraser and Whit Hicks, who bought the store back in 1955. Since then it has become the unrivaled nerve center of business, socializing, and political debate for Norwich and the surrounding area. Whit died a while back, Dan has since retired and his wife Eliza, known to all as Bunny, who did the bookkeeping, died not long ago. But the store has not lost any of the Vermont character they gave to it. Fortunately it has stayed in the family. Today it is managed by Dan's sons George and Jack Fraser, with the help of George's wife Susan, Jack's daughter Cheri, George's sons Dan and Matt, and a throng of loyal employees, young and old.  When you first enter Dan & Whit's you think it is just another grocery store. Of course there is a lot more Vermont maple syrup and cheddar cheese. But then you notice winter boots and snowshoes hanging from the ceiling, and boxes of nuts and bolts and nails and screws and every type of hardware. There are pots and pans, outdoor clothing, pens and stationery, guns and ``No Hunting'' signs. Keep walking and you pass piles of the ``New York Times'' and the paint mixing machine, and then you realize you have barely scratched the surface. Through a door and around a corner there are aisles that stretch almost as far as you can see, stacked high with snow shovels, horse feed, half a dozen sizes of stove pipe, sheep fence, sewing pipe, sleds, saws and axes, rakes and wheelbarrows, mail boxes, window glass, there's no end to it. You can even bring in your fire extinguishers for recharging, Jack being the Captain of the Norwich Fire Department. Thus the Dan & Whit's motto, ``if we don't have it, you don't need it.'' Vermont author Noel Perrin once wrote, ``There may be a better general store in the United States. But I haven't heard of it.''  Mr. President, Dan & Whit's General Store is the unbelievable number and variety of things you can buy there, but it is also the extraordinary people who work there. In addition to the Fraser family members, it is people like Larry Smith, Linda Conrad, Al Langlois, Ron Swift, and Perry Wagner, who have been there for years and help make the store the one-of-a-kind place that it is. Dan & Whit's is people like Bill Fitzgerald, who finally retired after more than 30 years. Always in good spirits, always helpful, always finding what you need. And the one time in a million that they don't findit, they will convince you that you did not need it in the first place.  Recently, ``The Norwich Times'' printed an article about Dan & Whit's that says it better than I can. I ask that the article be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                 If We Don't Have It, You Don't Need It       What has 22,600 square feet of space (but you'd never know      it), and is filled with great stuff like aerators, Sorels,      and the Sunday Times?       The legendary Dan & Whit's has stretched out along Main      Street ever since the Merrill family opened their grain store      in this location in 1891. At that time, the wandering      building with the now-creaky wooden floors also housed      Norwich's post office, town hall, and several small shops.      Today, under the diligent management of owners George and      Jack Fraser, this nerve center of Norwich is open seven days      a week from seven o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock      at night, three hundred and sixty four days a year.                           all in the family       In 1955, Dan Fraser and his partner Whit Hicks bought it      from Leon Merrill for whom they had worked since 1933. Dan      and Whit plunged right in, expanding their merchandise to      include newspapers, guns, beer, and wine. As the line of      merchandise and inventory continually expanded, family      members helped out. First it was Dan Fraser and his wife      Bunny running it with Whit and Grace Hicks. Also at that      time, grandfather John pitched in and cemented the basement      of the store and stocked shelves, while the younger      generation filled in after school. In 1973 when Dan bought      out Whit and became sole proprietor, he was joined by his      sons, George and Jack. Today, there are eight Frasers working      at the store in various capacities.                              good people       ``What has kept me in the business is that I like the      people. I would have retired before, but I know it's hard to      find good people.''--Bill Fitzgerald, Dan & Whit's employee      off and on since 1934.       When two brothers work 60 and 70 hours each per week, one      wonders how they can keep the peace. Jack and George say      their partnership works very well. ``We seldom fight,'' says      Jack despite their grueling work schedules and the constant      decisions that have to be made.       If you're looking for the people person, you'll find George      up front managing staff, scheduling, hiring and training      people and overseeing the Produce Department. Jack, on the      other hand, is a product man. From his bench desk in the back      of the store, he manages the Hardware and Housewares      Departments.       No doubt the brothers are handy and resourceful people.      However, working as many hours as they do, they gladly      entrust some of the major responsibilities to guys like Larry      Smith, one of their longest term employees, who runs the      grocery department, and Al Langlois and Ron Swift who have      the resourcefulness of a handy-man. Supervisor Linda Conrad      oversees the check-out counters and trains many of the new      hires. Then there's 82-year-old Bill Fitzgerald, with a white      apron over his work attire, who cruises the aisles helping      customers. Bill says that he first worked at the store in      1934, then after a number of years in the old drug stores in      Hanover, came back in 1964. He's been at Dan & Whit's ever      since.                               the store       ``I use Dan & Whit's as part of my tour when showing      property in Norwich. I always tell my customers to look      around Dan & Whit's and be sure to go to the back. It's      awesome.''--Brian Gardner, Realtor at The Gardner Agency,      Main Street, Norwich       In the 22,600 square feet of space, 13,000 of that is      devoted to selling. The basement is as large as the main      store where vast amounts of goods are stored as is the huge      supply of wood for the store's main source of heat--a large      wood furnace. In former times, the store was heated by coal      and then by oil. Now the Frasers use 16 to 20 cords of wood a      year, most of it obtained by various arrangements Matt Fraser      makes with loggers and wood lot owners. A back-up supply of      split firewood is kept in the yard of Dan Fraser off Turnpike      Road. In times of extreme cold, an old railroad stove in the      basement is fired up.                       the customer is everything       ``We have a very serious responsibility to our customers,      and if we can't serve them and the community, we are in      trouble.''--George Fraser       The very lifeblood of Dan & Whit's is the customer.      ``Helping our customers is most important for our business--     more than any kind of media advertising,'' said George. ``We      train and orient our employees to be nice to them,'' adds      Jack.       With so many products, helping the customer adjust to new      products and changing technology is a good example of the Dan      & Whit's customer-friendly philosophy. Jack tells about the      lady who came in to complain that the batteries she bought      from Dan & Whit's weren't working. She overlooked the fact      that she had to buy a charger for the batteries. ``Customers      do get confused,'' he said.                            no cash required       ``You know you have gone through an important rite of      passage when you get to sign your name at Dan & Whit's--which      seems to happen in the 3rd or 4th grade.''--Norwich attorney,      Garfield Miller       Local, down-home trust has been a hallmark of Dan & Whit's      for years. How many places do you know (and it's practically      the year 2000) that still offer customer charge accounts.      About 30% of Dan & Whit's customers have charge privileges      which used to involve prepayments or deposits of up to $300,      but that minor inconvenience has since been dropped.       ``Personal trust helped the store develop customer      loyalty,'' said George. ``. . . and it was also very      convenient. If a customer forgot their checkbook or wallet,      the store would carry them until the next time they came      in.''                          ____________________
