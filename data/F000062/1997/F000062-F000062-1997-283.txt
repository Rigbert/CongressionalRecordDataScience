 President, that there is one, deep, soft underbelly in the majority balanced budget amendment. You cannot use Social Security trust funds and spend the money on operating expenditures, whether it be for a battleship or a satellite, and save those moneys for someone's retirement.  I rest my case. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.
