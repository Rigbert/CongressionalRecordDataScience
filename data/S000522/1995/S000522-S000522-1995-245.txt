Mr. Speaker, earlier this month members of a Parliamentary Human Rights Foundation delegation returned from a fact-finding mission to Turkey. The human rights situation in that country has significantly deteriorated in recent years despite assurances otherwise by Turkey's leaders.  At present, internal tensions have reached new heights, threatening to tear apart the multiethnic fabric of Turkish society while destabilizing the entire region. Turkey's campaign against the Kurdish Worker's Party [PKK] has been used to justify the recent invasion of Northern Iraq as well as sweeping restrictions on pro-Kurdish expression and peaceful political activity. And, while the PKK continues to operate and gather support, Turkey's democratic credentials are increasingly questioned.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that the report of the Parliamentary Human Rights Foundation delegation, which outlines many of the human rights problems in Turkey and offers constructive recommendations on how Turkey's Government might better address such problems be printed in the Record.       Report on Human Rights Conditions in Turkey, March 2, 1995                               i. summary       The Parliamentary Human Rights Foundation (formerly the      Congressional Human Rights Foundation) organized a human      rights fact-finding mission to Turkey (2/25-3/1/95). The      delegation was led by the Honorable J. Kenneth Blackwell, a      Member of the Board of Directors and former U.S. Ambassador      to the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). The      delegation also included David L. Phillips, President of the      Foundation. The purpose of the trip was to investigate      reported human rights violations committed by the Government      of Turkey, particularly the abuses against its citizens of      Kurdish origin. The delegation also investigated violations      by the PKK, a separatist organization committed to armed      struggle. Based on the delegation's findings, a report has      been submitted to officials in Geneva, Members of the U.S.      Congress, the European Parliament, and National Assemblies in      Europe.                              ii. program       The delegation visited Istanbul, Diyarbakir, and Ankara. In      order to consider a broad range of views, the delegation      spoke with Turkish officials from the Office of the Prime      Minister, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign      Affairs, the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the Governor      and Deputy Governor of the Emergency Region, and Turkish Army      personnel. The delegation also met with representatives of      the Turkish Human Rights Association, the Turkish Human      Rights Foundation, the Diyarbakir Bar Association, HADEP      officials, a DEP Parliamentarian, lawyers representing the      DEP MPs, former MPs of Kurdish origin, and Kurdish citizens.       Our official request for meetings with Layla Zana and Ahmet      Turk, imprisoned parliamentarians and members of the      Foundations Interparliamentary Human Rights Network (IPN),      was declined. Despite assurances from the Governor of the      Emergency Region, our travel to Kurdish villages outside of      Diyarbakir was blocked at military checkpoints. The office of      the Diayarbakir Human Rights Association was closed and four      members were arrested within 24 hours of the delegation's      meeting with representatives of the Association.                      iii. summary of observations       Turkish authorities are systematically violating the rights      of Turkish citizens, including those of Kurdish origin. The      Anti-Terror Act and the State of Emergency provide legal      sanction for gross human rights violations, particularly in      Southeast Turkey.       Turkish authorities state that their objection is to the      non-combatants terrorism. However, many civilian non-     combatants suffer human rights violations as a result of the      struggle between Turkish authorities and the PKK. The PKK is      an extremist, militant organization responsible for acts of      terrorism in which Turkish military and police personnel are      targeted, as are Kurdish civilians. It should be noted,      however, that the PKK has recently called for a ``civilian      solution'' to the Kurdish question and has recognized      Turkey's borders.       The Government of Turkey believes all persons who seek      political and cultural expression for the Kurds are      ``separatists'' and PKK sympathizers. Suspected by Turkish      authorities as bases for PKK operations, more than one      thousand Kurdish villages have been destroyed. Human rights      monitors report instances of arbitrary detention, torture,      extrajudicial killing, and restrictions on freedom of      expression. In addition, democratically elected      parliamentarians of Kurdish origin have been jailed and      convicted for disseminating ``separatist'' propaganda and      supporting an ``armed band'' while, in reality, they were      merely representing the interests of their constituents.      There are serious shortfalls in Turkey's administration of      justice.                        iv. summary of findings       The Interior Ministry indicates that 1,046 villages in the      emergency region have been evacuated; human rights monitors      say several thousand villages have been destroyed; homes and      their claimed inhabitants have been burned; use of chemical      agents and poison gas are reported. The Government      acknowledges that 940 combatants have been killed; however,      other reports claim that thousands have died. The population      of Diyarbakir has doubled to more than 1.2 million as      internally displaced persons have sought refuge in the city.       The DEP parliamentarians were convicted in proceedings many      observers labelled a ``show-trial.'' The Government of Turkey      indicates that 8,682 persons have been sentenced under its      Anti-Terror Act, which permits arbitrary arrest. Many of      those known to be arrested, as well as persons who have      disappeared, were just attempting to peacefully exercise      freedoms of speech, association, or other internationally      recognized human rights. The Turkish Human Rights Association      reports instances of extrajudicial killings and torture of      persons held in incommunicado for political crimes. There are      250 cases/appeals presently before the European Court of      Human Rights and the European Commission on Human Rights.       The Constitutional Court of Turkey has no right of review      for ``decrees with the force of law'' issued under the state      of emergency. The Anti-Terror Act, adopted in 1991, restricts      many civil liberties, including attorney access to, as well      as the rights of, persons in detention. The Anti-Terror Act      and state of emergency provisions also restrict freedom of      expression. Government agencies harass and imprison human      rights minors, journalists, lawyers, and professors. The      Act's broad and ambiguous definition of terrorism,      particularly Article 8, has led to widespread abuses of      innocent civilians.       In addition, the Constitutional Court has banned the DEP      party, a vehicle for the expression of Kurdish cultural      identity and full citizenship rights. In the past two years,      26 DEP and HADEP members have been killed. In the run-up to      recent elections, the DEP headquarters was bombed. The press      law permits banning of publications with a court order and      states that ``responsible editors'' bear responsibility for      the content of their publications; 19 journalists have been      tried under the Anti-Terror Act. On December 3, 1994, a      journal reputed to be pro-PKK, the ``Izgur Ulke'' was bombed.      There are no independent Kurdish language newspapers,      television, or radio. Regarding cultural expression, the      Constitution does not recognize Kurds as a national, racial,      or ethnic minority. Two hundred Kurds were arrested during      Newroz New Year celebrations in Diyarbakir.       It is important to note that the PKK, itself, is      responsible for gross human rights violations by targeting      village officials, guards, informants, teachers, and young      men who refuse to take up arms against the authorities. By      the admission of its own representatives, the PKK has      recently killed 179 village guards, 66 collaborators, and      police officials. The well-being of almost every Kurd is      adversely affected by the conflict.       As a result of the conflict, Turkey's citizens of Kurdish      origin have become bereft of many democratic rights and are      denied effective political and cultural expression. The      [[Page E706]] resulting radicalization of the Kurds is      contributing to a worsening security situation throughout the      country. An increasing number of Kurds are turning to the      pro-Muslim Welfare Party.                           v. recommendations       The international community should promote improvement in      human rights conditions in Turkey by encouraging a dialogue      between Turkish authorities and legitimate representatives of      Kurdish interests. To this end, amnesty should be provided to      convicted DEP parliaments so that they can participate in a      dialogue concerning the reduction of tensions and the      normalization of relations between Turkish authorities and      Turkey's citizens of Kurdish origin.       Within the competence of the UNHRC, the Working Group on      Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Rapporteurs on Torture      and Freedom of Expression should investigate human rights      conditions in Turkey. The Government of Turkey has      ``invited'' the Special Rapporteur on Summary Executions to      visit Turkey. A suitable itinerary and near term date should      be finalized.       Efforts should be made by the U.S. and the E.U. to      establish mutual reinforcing restrictions on the sale of      military equipment which might be used against civilian      populations. The US and EU should also coordinate the      extension and/or relaxation of tariff and trade privileges      based on Turkey's overall human rights performance.       Technical assistance programs in the rule of law should be      undertaken among Members of the Turkish Grand National      Assembly, European Parliament, and U.S. Congress in order to      strengthen democratic institutions and assist in      constitutional and legislative reform. The Anti-Terror Act      should be amended so that the rights of Turkish citizens are      safeguarded, as is the right of the state to protect its      territorial integrity. Electronic computer networks should be      established between the TGNA and parliamentary bodies in      other countries.       These recommendations are provided so that the      international community can become fully seized by the      worsening human rights conditions in Turkey. The authors of      this report hope for reconciliation through dialogue so that      peace, prosperity, and democracy may flourish for all      citizens of the Turkish Republic.                               ____________________
