Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson), for yielding this time to me, and I thank the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) for bringing this measure to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I was a sophomore at Coral Gables High School in the fall of 1954, and there was a gentleman running for Congress. I was 15 years of age, and the gentleman's name was Dante Fascell. I did not know him, but that was the first congressional race I ever focused on because we had a Problems of Democracy class, and we studied the congressional election.  Mr. Speaker, Dante Fascell was elected to the Congress that year, and 27 years later, in 1981, I was elected to the Congress. Dante Fascell had already served from 1955 to 1981, and was one of the senior Members. I had met Dante Fascell on numerous times before my election to Congress, and we had become good friends.  In 1976 Speaker O'Neill appointed Dante Fascell chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. That is now known as the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and it is a vital factor in European peacekeeping, in a focus on human rights and conflict resolution. It is playing a major role in Bosnia and a major role in Kosovo. The OSC, a very vibrant organization, was formed in August of 1975 when 35 signatory States, including the United States and Canada, joined with 33 European states in forming the Organization on Security, then called the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.  Dante Fascell was a vital founding member of that organization. As the Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe from 1976 to 1985, he forged U.S. policy in many ways regarding security and cooperation in Europe.  Upon his becoming Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in 1985, I was privileged to be recommended by him and then appointed by Speaker O'Neill to succeed him as chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.                              {time}  1445  Mr. Speaker, those who did not know Dante Fascell missed knowing a very decent, able, giving, caring, effective American and Member of this body.  Dante Fascell was the epitome of a bipartisan Member of the House. He worked without respect to party. He worked on behalf of the best interests of the United States of America and the best interests of the world community. He was, in many ways, an international citizen.  I had the opportunity to attend the North American Assembly on numerous occasions with Dante Fascell and others, and Dante Fascell was appropriately perceived as a leader in that organization, which is an adjunct of NATO.  Dante Fascell has been missed in this body since he left. When he left the Congress, he returned to practice law in his beloved Florida. I had the opportunity of talking to him on numerous occasions, and I lament his loss.  Dante Fascell was a good and decent man, who raised his hand and swore to defend the Constitution of the United States. No Member has done his duty better than Dante Fascell. We do ourselves proud by passing this legislation and honoring Dante Fascell.  Dante Fascell honored this institution and the people's House through his service. He served the people of Florida for over 30 years with such distinction that Floridians felt compelled every two years to return him to this body. I am honored to join with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson), my good friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), and all the Members of this body, to say to Dante Fascell, thank you and farewell. You were honored while you were here, and you are honored still.
