What I would ask for is the same support to help me overcome some of the problems that would come with sequestration.  To give an example, sequestration would cancel flying operations for four out of nine aircraft carriers, which would take about 9 to 12 months to restore at a cost of two to three times as much. What they could do with this bill, which I plan to introduce tomorrow, is have the latitude, while spending the same amount of money, to keep the flying hours where they are so they would not have to be restored in another vehicle. Little things such as that are significant.  It also would address the problems we hear of every day from the Secretaries in the military--the various departments and the Chiefs--having to do with the other problems on the CR. So this would address both of them and give latitude and make it better.  I would just say I hope the leader could assist me in getting this bill through in a timely fashion that I will be introducing tomorrow.
