 Ristau, a native of Cascade, IA. He was killed on July 13, 2012 in Qalat, Zabul Province, Afghanistan while serving his country as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. He leaves behind his wife, Elizabeth, two sons, Hyle and Bradley, his parents, Randy and Suzanne, and many other family and friends. My prayers go out to them as they grieve his loss.  By all accounts, he was a brave soldier who was proud of serving his country. He had a long list of awards and decorations, including the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, with Oak Leaf Cluster, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, with Bronze Service Star, Iraq Campaign Medal, with two Bronze Service Stars, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, NATO Medal, Non-Commissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon, Valorous Unit Award, Meritorious Unit Commendation, and Combat Infantryman Badge.  Our Nation is truly blessed to have patriots like Sergeant Ristau who volunteer to serve their country, prepared to endure the daily sacrifices of a deployment and the horrors of combat, and knowing that they could make the ultimate sacrifice. About his military service, his family said, ``Michael had a passion for the military and was going to re-enlist.'' They also said that ``Michael was always looking out for others and helping them in any way possible.'' There is certainly no more selfless act than to give one's life to ensure that others may live in freedom. We cannot hope to ever fully repay the debt we owe Michael Ristau, but as he joins the illustrious ranks of our fallen patriots from the birth of our Nation to the present day, we have an obligation to honor his life and his sacrifice. We must always remember heroes like Michael Ristau and never take for granted the gift of liberty they have won for us.                          ____________________
