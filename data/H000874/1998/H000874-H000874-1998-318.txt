Chairman, I rise in support of this bill and would like to commend the work of both the Chairman, Mr. Packard, and the Ranking Member, Mr. Hefner. Further, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the work and friendship of Mr. Hefner. He is truly one of our finest members and it has been my distinct honor to have served with him in this body. The Committee has done an outstanding job in crafting a bill which addresses both the military needs and quality of life concerns for the men and women in our armed services. Make no mistake, our military personnel deserve the best that we in Congress can offer, and this bill takes many of the necessary steps required to improve the quality of life for our military families. The focus this bill places on family housing, child development centers, medical facilities and treatment centers is critical if we are going to continually recruit and retain our best people. While this bill does not meet every deficiency in our military facilities, it continues the approach of budgeting for the highest priority needs of our armed services. Additionally, I believe it represents a firm commitment by this Congress to our men and women in uniform to continue our efforts to improve their living and working conditions.  Further, I would like to express my appreciation to the Committee for their quick response to fund the Continuous Processing Facility at Indian Head. As many of you know, an accidental explosion damaged a portion of this building in February. Although my funding request was unexpected, the Committee responded to this priority by providing funds for a facility which in the long run will be more efficient and flexible in meeting the Defense Department's energetics requirements. Lastly, I would like to thank the Committee for supporting the Administration's request for the replacement of the Annealing Ovens Facility at Indian Head. This new facility will function in a more efficient fashion and address important environmental concerns in my district. Again, I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                          ____________________
