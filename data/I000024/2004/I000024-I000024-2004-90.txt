I remain committed to guaranteeing that all States receive a minimum of 90.5 percent rate of return for their trust fund contributions in fiscal year 2004. As some funding remains in the fiscal year, I am committed to maintaining the Minimum Guarantee program for this year so that no State receives less than a 90.5 percent return on their trust fund contributions.
