President: I am delighted that the Senate has today passed important amendments to the Freedom of Information Act that will bring this statute into the electronic age. Passage of these amendments are a tremendous way to mark the 30th anniversary of the Freedom of Information Act.  The FOIA has served the country well in maintaining the right of Americans to know what their government is doing--or not doing. As President Johnson said in 1966, when he signed the Freedom of Information Act into law:       This legislation springs from one of our most essential      principles: A democracy works best when the people have all      the information that the security of the Nation permits.  Just over the past few months, records released under the FOIA have revealed FAA actions against Valuejet before the May 11 crash in the Everglades, the government's treatment of South Vietnamese commandos who fought in a CIA-sponsored army in the early 1960's, the high salaries paid to independent counsels, the unsafe lead content of D.C. tap water, and the types of tax cases that the IRS recommends for criminal prosecution.  In the 30 years since the Freedom of Information Act became law, technology has dramatically altered the way government handles and stores information. Gone are the days when agency records were solely on paper stuffed into file cabinets. Instead, agencies depend on personal computers, computer databases and electronic storage media, such as CD-ROM's, to carry out their mission.  The time is long overdue to update this law to address new issues related to the increased use of computers by federal agencies. Computers are just as ubiquitous in Federal agency offices as in the private sector. We need to make clear that the FOIA is not just a right to know what's on paper law, but that it applies equally to electronic records.  That is why Senator Brown, Senator Kerry, and I, with the strong support of many library, press, civil liberties, consumer and research groups, have pushed for passage of the Electronic FOIA bill. The Senate recognized the need to update the FOIA in the last Congress by passing an earlier version of this bill.  This legislation takes steps so that agencies use technology to make government more accessible and accountable to its citizens. Storing government information on computers should actually make it easier to provide public access to information in more meaningful formats. For example, people with sight or hearing impairments can use special computer programs to translate electronic information into braille or large print or synthetic speech output.  Electronic records also make it possible to provide dial-up access to any citizen who can use computer networks, such as the Internet. Those Americans living in the remotest rural area in Vermont, or in a distant State far from Federal agencies' public reading rooms here in Washington, DC, should be able to use computer networks to get direct access to the warehouse of unclassified information stored in government computer banks. The explosion of the Internet adds enormously to the need for clarification of the status of electronic government records under the FOIA and the significance of this legislation for citizen access. These amendments to the FOIA will encourage federal agencies to use the Internet to increase access to government records for all Americans.  Ensuring public access to electronic government records is not just important for broader citizen access. Information is a valuable commodity and the Federal Government is probably the largest single producer and repository of accurate information. This government information is a national resource that commercial companies pay for under the FOIA, add value to, and then sell--creating jobs and generating revenue in the process. It is important for our economy and for American competitiveness that fast, easy access to that resource in electronic form be available. The electronic FOIA bill would contribute to our information economy.  I would like to highlight some of what this bill would accomplish. First, it would require agencies to provide records in a requested format whenever possible.  Second, the bill would encourage agencies to increase on-line access to government records that agencies currently put in their public reading rooms. These records would include copies of records that are the subject of repeated FOIA requests.  Finally, the bill would address the biggest single complaint of people making FOIA requests: delays in getting a response. I understand that at the FBI, the delays can stretch to over four years. Because of these delays, writers, students and teachers and others working under time deadlines, have been frustrated in using FOIA to meet their research needs. Long delays in access can mean no access at all.  The current time limits in the FOIA are a joke. Few agencies actually respond to FOIA requests within the 10-day limit required in the law. Such routine failure to comply with the statutory time limits is bad for morale in the agencies and breeds contempt by citizens who expect government officials to abide by, not routinely break, the law.  I appreciate the budget and resource constraints under which agencies are operating. We have made every effort in this bill to make sure it works for both agencies and requestors. Some agencies, particularly those with huge backlogs of FOIA requests resulting in delays of up to four years for an agency response, are concerned that the bill removes backlogs as an automatic excuse to ignore the time limits. We should not give agencies an incentive to create backlogs. Agencies will have to show that they are taking steps to reduce their backlogs before they qualify for additional time to respond to a FOIA request.  While increased computer access to government records may necessitate an initial outlay of money and effort, as more information is made available on-line, the labor intensive task of physically searching and producing documents should be reduced. The net result should be increased efficiency insatisfying agency FOIA obligations, reduced paperwork burdens, reduced errors and better service to the public.  The Electronic FOIA bill should help agencies comply with the law's time limits by doubling the ten-day time limit to give agencies a more realistic time period for responding to FOIA requests, making more information available on-line, requiring the use of better record management techniques, such as multi-track processing, and providing expedited access to requestors who demonstrate a compelling need for a speedy response.  All these steps, and others in the bill, may not provide a total cure but should help reduce the endemic delay problems.  This has generally been a very partisan Congress. I commend members of the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology, and, in particular, Chairman Stephen Horn, ranking member Carolyn Maloney, and Representatives Randy Tate and Collin Peterson, for rising above the partisan fray and moving this legislation in the House. They saw this bill for what it is: a good government issue, not a partisan one. We have worked diligently to sort out any differences in the House and Senate bills, and we can all be proud of the final product reflected in both the Substitute amendment to S. 1090 and the final version of the bill passed by the House.  Even as we have worked on this legislation, new issues about the coverage of the FOIA have surfaced. I refer specifically to the D.C. Court of Appeals case, decided on August 2, 1996, that the National Security Council is not an ``agency'' subject to the FOIA, despite the fact that the NSC has complied with the FOIA for years under both Republican and Democratic Presidents. Litigation on this matter continues and the case may now go to the U.S. Supreme Court. Clarification of which offices within the White House are ``agencies'' subject to the FOIA may be a matter requiring congressional attention in the next Congress.  As the Federal Government increasingly maintains its records in electronic form, we need to make sure that this information is available to citizens on the same basis as information in paper files. Doing so will fulfill the promise first made thirty years ago in the FOIA that citizens have a right to know and a right to see the records the government collects with their tax dollars.  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of that amendment be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Summary of Substitute to Leahy-Brown-Kerry Electronic FOIA Improvement                              Act (S. 1090)       Section 1. Short Title. The Act may be cited as the      ``Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996.''       Section 2. Findings and Purposes. The findings make clear      that Congress enacted the FOIA to require Federal agencies to      make records available to the public through public      inspection and upon the request of any person for any public      or private use. The findings also acknowledge the increase in      the government's use of computers and exhorts agencies to use      new technology to enhance public access to government      information.       The purposes of the bill include improving public access to      government information and records, and reducing the delays      in agencies' responses to requests for records under the      Freedom of Information Act.       Section 3. Application of Requirements to Electronic Format      Information. The bill would add a definition of ``record'' to      the FOIA to address electronically stored information. There      is little disagreement that the FOIA covers all government      records, regardless of the form in which they are stored by      the agency. The Department of Justice agrees that computer      database records are agency records subject to the FOIA. See      ``Department of Justice Report on `Electronic Record' Issues      Under the Freedom of Information Act,'' S. Hrg. 102-1098,      102d Cong., 2d Sess. 33 (1992). The bill would define      ``record'' to ``include any information that would be an      agency record subject to the requirements of this section      when maintained by an agency in any format, including an      electronic format.''       Section 4. Information Made Available in Electronic Format      and Indexation of Records. The Office of Management and      Budget has directed agencies to use electronic media and      formats, including public networks, to make government      information more easily accessible and useful to the public.      This bill will help effectuate this goal.       This section of the bill would require that materials, such      as agency opinions and policy statements, which an agency      must ``make available for public inspection and copying,''      pursuant to Section 552(a)(2), and which are created on or      after November 1, 1996, be made available by computer      telecommunications, as well as in hard copy, within 1 year      after the date of enactment. If an agency does not have the      means established to make these materials available on-line,      then the information should be made available in some other      electronic form, e.g., CD-ROM or disc. The bill would thus      treat (a)(2) materials in the same manner as it treats (a)(1)      materials, which under the Government Printing Office      Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993 (``GPO      Access Act''), Pub. Law 103-40, are required, via the Federal      Register, to be made available on-line.       This section would also increase the information made      available under Section 552(a)(2). Specifically, agencies      would be required to make available for public inspection and      copying, in the same manner as other materials required to be      made available under Section 552(a)(2), copies of records      released in response to FOIA requests that the agency      determines have been or will likely be the subject of      additional requests. In addition, they would be required      to make available a general index of these prior-released      records. By December 31, 1999, this index should be made      available by computer telecommunications. Since not all      individuals have access to computer networks or are near      agency public reading rooms, however, requesters would      still be able to access previously-released FOIA records      through the normal FOIA process.       As a practical matter, this would mean that copies of      prior-released records on a popular topic, such as the      assassinations of public figures, would subsequently be      treated as (a)(2) materials, which are made available for      public inspection and copying. This would help to reduce the      number of multiple FOIA requests for the same records      requiring separate agency responses. Likewise, the general      index would assist requesters in determining which records      have been the subject of prior FOIA requests. Since requests      for prior-released records are more readily identified by the      agency without the need for new searches, this index would      assist agencies in complying with the FOIA time limits.       This section would make clear that to prevent a clearly      unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, an agency may      delete identifying details when it makes available or      publishes the index and copies of prior-released records.       Finally, this section would require, consistent with the      ``Computer Redaction'' requirement in Section 9 of the bill,      an agency to indicate the extent of any deletion from the      prior-released records and, where technically feasible, to      indicate the deletion at the place on the record where the      deletion was made. Such indication need not be included when      doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption in      subsection (b) under which the deletion was made.       Section 5. Honoring Form or Format Requests. Section 5      would require agencies to assist requesters by providing      information in the form requested, including requests for the      electronic form of records, if the agency is able to      reproduce it in that form. This section would overrule      Dismukes v. Department of the Interior, 603 F. Supp. 760, 763      (D.D.C. 1984), which held that an agency ``has no obligation      under the FOIA to accommodate plaintiff's preference [but]      need only provide responsive, nonexempt information in a      reasonably accessible form.''       This section would also require agencies to make reasonable      efforts to search for records that are maintained in      electronic form or format, unless such search efforts would      significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's      automated information systems.       The bill defines ``search'' as a ``review, manually or by      automated means,'' of ``agency records for the purpose of      locating those records responsive to a request.'' Under the      FOIA, an agency is not required to create documents that do      not exist. Computer records located in a database rather than      in a file cabinet may require the application of codes or      some form of programming to retrieve the information.      Under the definition of ``search'' in the bill, the search      of computerized records would not amount to the creation      of records. Otherwise, it would be virtually impossible to      get records that are maintained completely in an      electronic form, like computer database information,      because some manipulation of the information likely would      be necessary to search the records.       Section 6. Standard for Judicial Review. Section 6 would      require a court to accord substantial weight to an agency's      determination as to both the technical feasibility of      redacting nonreleasable material at the place on the record      where the deletion was made, under paragraphs (2)(C) and      subsection (b), as amended by this Act, and the      reproducibility of the requested form or format of records,      under paragraph (3)(B), as amended by this Act. Such      deference is warranted since an agency is familiar with the      availability of technical resources within the agency to      process, redact and reproduce records.       Section 7. Ensuring Timely Response to Requests. The bill      addresses the single most frequent complaint about the      operation of the FOIA, namely, agency delays in responding to      FOIA requests by encouraging agencies to employ better      records management systems.       Multitrack Processing.--An agency commitment to process      requests on a first-come, first-served basis has been held to      satisfy the requirement that an agency exercise due diligence      in dealing with backlogs of FOIA requests. Processing      requests solely on a FIFO basis, however, may result in      lengthy delays for simple requested due to the prior receipt      and processing of complex requests, and in increased agency      backlogs. The bill would permit agencies to promulgate      regulations implementing multitrack processing systems, and      make clear that agencies should exercise due diligence within      each track. Agencies would also be permitted to provide      requesters with the opportunity to limit the scope of their      requests in order to qualify for processing under a faster      track.       Unusual Circumstances.--The FOIA currently permits an      agency in ``unusual circumstances'' to extend for a maximum      of 10 working days the statutory time limit for responding to      a FOIA request, upon written notice to the requester setting      forth the reason for such extension. The FOIA enumerates      various reasons for such an extension, including the need to      search for and collect requested records from multiple      offices, the volume of records requested, and the need for      consultation among components of an agency.       For unusually burdensome FOIA requests, an extra ten days      still provides insufficient time for an agency to respond.      The bill would provide a mechanism to deal with such      requests, which an agency would not be able to process even      with an extra ten days. For such requests, the bill would      require an agency to inform the requester that the request      cannot be processed within statutory time limits and provide      an opportunity for the requester to limit the scope of the      request so that it may be processed within statutory time      limits, or arrange with the agency an agreed upon time frame      for processing the request. In the event that the requester      refuses to reasonably limit the request's scope or agree upon      a time frame and then seeks judicial review, that refusal      shall be considered as a factor in determining whether      ``exceptional circumstances'' exist under subparagraph      (6)(C).       Requesters should not be able to make multiple requests      merely to avoid the procedures otherwise applicable in      unusual circumstances. To avoid the potential problem of      multiple requests for purely circumvention purposes, the bill      would permit agencies to promulgate regulations to aggregate      requests made by the same requester, or group of requesters      acting in concert, if the agency reasonably believes that      such requests actually constitute a single request, which      would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified      in subparagraph (6)(B)(iii) of the bill. The aggregated      requests must involve clearly related matters. Agencies are      directed not to aggregate multiple requests involving      unrelated matters.       Exceptional Circumstances.--The FOIA provides that in      ``exceptional circumstances,'' a court may extend the      statutory time limits for an agency to respond to a FOIA      request, but does not specify what those circumstances are.      The bill would clarify that routine, predictable agency      backlogs for FOIA requests do not constitute exceptional      circumstances for purposes of the Act, unless the agency      demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of      pending requests. This is consistent with the holding in Open      America v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force, 547 F.2d 605      (D.C. Cir. 1976), where the court held that an unforeseen      3,000 percent increase in FOIA requests in one year, which      created a massive backlog in an agency with insufficient      resources to process those requests in a timely manner, can      constitute ``exceptional circumstances.'' Routine backlogs of      requests for records under the FOIA should not give agencies      an automatic excuse to ignore the time limits, since this      provides a disincentive for agencies to clear up those      backlogs. The bill also makes clear that those agencies with      backlogs must make efforts to reduce that backlog before      exceptional circumstances will be found to exist.       Section 8. Time Period for Agency Consideration of      Requests. The bill contains provisions designed to address      the needs of both agencies and requesters for more workable      time periods for the processing of FOIA requests.       Expedited Access.--The bill would require agencies to      promulgate regulations authorizing expedited access to      requesters who demonstrate a ``compelling need'' for a speedy      response. The agency would be required to make a      determination whether or not to grant the request for      expedited access within ten days and then notify the      requester of the decision. The requester would bear the      burden of showing that expedition is appropriate by      certifying in a statement that the demonstration of      compelling need is true and correct to the best of the      requester's knowledge and belief. The bill would permit only      limited judicial review based on the same record before the      agency of the determination whether to grant expedited      access. Moreover, federal courts will not have jurisdiction      to review an agency's denial of an expedited access request      if the agency has already provided a complete response to the      request for records.       A ``compelling need'' warranting expedited access would be      demonstrated by showing that failure to obtain the records      within an expedited time frame would: (I) pose an imminent      threat to an individual's life or physical safety; or,      (II) ``with respect to a request made by a person      primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to      inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal      government activity.'' Agencies are also permitted to      provide for expedited processing in other cases as they      may determine.       Expansion of Agency Response Time.--To assist federal      agencies in reducing their backlog of FOIA requests, the bill      would double the time limit for an agency to respond to FOIA      requests from ten days to twenty days. Attorney General Janet      Reno has acknowledged the inability of most federal agencies      to comply with the ten-day rule ``as a serious problem''      stemming principally from ``too few resources in the face of      too heavy a workload.''       Estimation of Matter Denied.--The bill would require      agencies when denying a FOIA request to make reasonable      efforts to estimate the volume of any denied material and      provide that estimate to the requester, unless doing so would      harm an interest protected by an exemption pursuant to which      the denial is made.       Section 9. Computer Redaction. The ease with which      information on the computer may be redacted makes the      determination of whether a few words or 30 pages have been      withheld by an agency at times impossible. The bill would      require agencies to indicate deletions of the released      portion of the record and, where technically feasible, to      indicate the deletion at the place on the record where the      deletion was made, unless including that indication would      harm an interest protected by an exemption pursuant to which      the deletion is made.       Section 10. Report to the Congress. This section would add      to the information an agency is already required to publish      as part of its annual report. Specifically, agencies would be      required to publish in its annual reports information      regarding denials of requested records, appeals, a complete      list of statutes upon which the agency relies to withhold      information under Section 552(b)(3), which exempts      information that is specifically exempted from disclosure by      other statutes, the number of backlogged FOIA requests, the      number of days taken to process requests, the amount of fees      collected, and staff devoted to processing FOIA requests. The      annual reports would be required to be made available to the      public, including by computer telecommunications means. If an      agency does not have the means established to make the report      available on-line, then the report should be made available      in some other electronic form. The Attorney General is      required to make each report available at a single electronic      access point, and advise certain Members of Congress that      such reports are available.       The Attorney General and the Director of the Office of      Management and Budget are required to develop reporting      guidelines for the annual reports by October 1, 1997.       Section 11. Reference Materials and Guides. The bill would      require agencies to make publicly available, upon request,      reference material or a grade for requesting records or      information from an agency. This guide would include an index      and description of all major information systems of an      agency, and a handbook for obtaining various types and      categories of public information from an agency.       Section 12. Effective Date. To provide agencies time to      implement new requirements under the Act, Sections 7 and 8 of      the bill concerning multitrack and expedited processing,      unusual and exceptional circumstances, the doubling of the      statutory time period for responding to FOIA requests, and      estimating the amount of material to which access is denied,      will take effect 180 days after the date of enactment, and      the remainder of the Act will become effective one year after      the date of enactment.                          ____________________
