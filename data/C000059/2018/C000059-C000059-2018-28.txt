Chairman, as you know, the House has spoken on this. In last year's conference report, we directed Fish and Wildlife Service to make this species among its highest priorities for consultation and permit processing. Obviously, the agency has not moved fast enough, and they need to get hopping.  So I am sure this amendment will squeak by with all of our support. I urge an ``aye'' vote.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to close.
