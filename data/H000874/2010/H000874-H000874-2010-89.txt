 I want to tell my friend that I don't seek contrition. I do seek reconsideration of policies that have not worked, of policies that were projected to grow the economy, bring the deficit down and make us a healthier, wealthier country. Frankly, the policies that we pursued in 2001 through 2006, and actually through 2009 because we couldn't change policy although we were in charge of the House and the Senate, we couldn't override a Presidential veto--again, not contrition, but recognition that the policies did not work.  Benjamin Franklin said, It's not a good thing to be penny wise and pound foolish. I tell my friend that he and his colleagues from 2001 and 2006--I think he voted for each one of these--voted for over $2 trillion in unfunded spending. That is the real problem.  The gentleman is probably prepared to support, as I am--he and I will probably vote together, I hope, on a supplemental that provides for funding our troops. That won't be paid for. We will expect our children and grandchildren to pay for that. Mr. Obey has suggested a tax to pay for this war. If it is worth fighting, if it's worth protecting this generation, it is worth paying for. I tend to agree with that.  As the gentleman knows, I'm a lot older than he is. I have three grandchildren, and I have a great-granddaughter. Tragically, history tells us that my grandchildren and my children are going to have their challenge from a security standpoint, from a health standpoint, from a natural disaster standpoint as we have today, and they're going to have to have resources to respond to that.  I don't criticize the gentleman and I applaud him for asking the American public what we all ought to ask the American public, what do you think we ought to cut. The fact of the matter is that your side, your ranking member, has prepared a budget. As I've told you before, I think it's a budget with a great deal of integrity, great deal of political courage, and the gentleman's indicated it's a 75-year budget. It's a budget that affects today, tomorrow, but yes, it has a vision. I applaud Mr. Ryan. As you know, I'm a big fan of Mr. Ryan's. I don't agree with Mr. Ryan, but I don't have to agree with somebody to have great respect for their intellect and their political courage and their willingness to be real, to put something on the table that really will make a difference.  My side, for the most part, doesn't agree with his treatment of Social Security, Medicare, and some other things. But I asked the gentleman last time if he wants me to put that budget on the floor with whatever we put on the floor on our side so that both of those can be considered. We're prepared to do that.  But my friend, I will tell you, I'm not looking, as I said before, for contrition. I am looking for recognition that we need to work together and be honest. Be honest with those American people that you're asking questions to. The items you put on your list are worthy of consideration, but they will not get us to where we need to get.  As Mr. Eakin, who was one of McCain's advisers, former Republican director for the OMB, as the CATO Institute indicates, the policies of the Bush administration dug a very deep hole. You have contrition about it but that doesn't solve it. What's got to solve it is us coming together and being honest with the American people. That's what the commission is hopefully going to do, and it's going to give us tough recommendations, and we will have to clasp hands together frankly if those recommendations are real, honest, and effective because they will be politically controversial because the medicine doesn't always go down very well. =========================== NOTE ===========================     June 10, 2010 on Page H4369 the following appeared: As Mr. Ekin, who was one of    The online version should be corrected to read: As Mr. Eakin, who was one of ========================= END NOTE =========================   But we have all dug a hole. I was not for most of the Bush policies that put us in those holes. I think giving up revenues--that's part of the $2 trillion of spending that you made, YouCut revenues--but you did not pay for them. The thing to do if you're going to cut taxes is to cut spending. The American public understand that, but pay for what you're still going to buy. Don't expect the credit card to be used by us and paid for by our children.  So I tell my friend that the individual items which you have just outlined are worthy of consideration, and asking the American public their recommendations is absolutely the right thing for us to do as a democratic body, but let us not kid the people that we can deal with the budget hole that has been dug over the last 8 years from surplus to deep deficit, surplus in 2001, deep, deep deficit in 2009, January of 2009, is going to be solved by simply nibbling around the edges, no matter how big those figures may sound, and they are big. But in the magnitude of the problem that confronts us, they will not get us to where we need to be.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
