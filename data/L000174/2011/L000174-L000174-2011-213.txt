 In a few moments the Senate is going to have the opportunity to make significant reforms to our Nation's patent system for the first time in more than half a century.  The America Invents Act is the product of extensive consideration. We have worked on this for four Congresses. We have had dozens of hearings, weeks of committee debate, and I have lost count of the hundreds of other meetings we have had. This bill is an opportunity to show the American people that Democrats and Republicans can come together to enact meaningful legislation for the American people. The time to do that is now.  The only remaining issues that stand in the way of this long overdue reform are three amendments. Each of them carries some merit. In the past, I might have supported them. But this is a compromise. No one Senator can have everything he or she may want.  The underlying issues have been debated. The bill as written represents a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that should be passed without changes. Any amendment to this bill risks killing it.  I would urge all Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, to join me and join Senator Grassley in opposing these amendments. They are the final hurdles standing in the way of comprehensive patent reform.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from businesses and workers representing the spectrum of American industry and labor urging the Senate to pass the America Invents Act without amendment.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    The Coalition for 21st Century                                                Patent Reform.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. ``Chuck'' Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We urge      you to work with the leadership of the Senate to bring H.R.      1249 to the Senate floor as soon the Senate's schedule might      permit and pass the bill as is.       Our Coalition believes that this legislation will fully      modernize our patent laws. Indeed, it will give the world the      first truly 21st century patent law--creating patentability      standards that are transparent, objective, predictable and      simple in their application. It will enhance the inventor-     friendly and collaboration-friendly features of our existing      patent law. At the same time, it will increase public      participation in the patenting process, while maintaining      strong protections for inventors in the provisions that do      so.       The agreement reached in the House on USPTO funding will      assure that the fees paid to the USPTO by inventors will not      be diverted and will be made available to the Office for      processing patent applications and other important functions      of the Office. While we would have preferred the Senate's      approach in S. 23 to prevent diversion of USPTO funds, we      believe that acceptance of the House bill provides an      effective and the most immediate path forward to address      problems of the patent office. H.R. 1249, like S. 23, is an      excellent bill. These bills are the product of many years of      skillful and difficult legislative work in both the House and      the Senate. We believe the time has now come for the Senate      to take the final legislative act required for enactment of      these historic reforms.           Sincerely,     Gary L. Griswold.                                  ____                                Coalition for Patent Fairness,                                                    June 27, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: After      years of effort, both houses of Congress have now      successfully passed patent reform by impressive margins. On      behalf of the high tech community, we congratulate you, as      well as your House colleagues, on this achievement.       The Coalition for Patent Fairness supports Senate      acceptance of H.R. 1249 as passed by the House. While neither      bill is as we would have written it, we believe that the      House passed bill represents the best opportunity to improve      the patent system at the present time. We are also quite      aware that House leaders worked very hard to take into      account the views of the Senate during their deliberations.       H.R. 1249, as passed, offers us a chance of consensus and      we believe it should be passed and signed into law. We are      looking forward to advancing other policy matters that boost      innovation and growth in this country.           Sincerely,     Coalition for Patent Fairness.                                  ____                                        Chamber of Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                Washington, DC, September 6, 2011.       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S.      Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation      representing the interests of more than three million      businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and      region, strongly supports H.R. 1249, the ``America Invents      Act,'' which would encourage innovation and bolster the U.S.      economy. The Chamber believes this legislation is crucial for      American economic growth, jobs, and the future of U.S.      competitiveness.       A key component of H.R. 1249 is section 22, which would      help ensure that fees collected by the U.S. Patent and      Trademark Office (PTO) fund the office and its administration      of the patent system. PTO faces significant challenges,      including a massive backlog of pending applications, and this      backlog is stifling domestic innovators. The fees that PTO      collects to review and approve patent applications should be      dedicated to PTO operation. However, fee diversion by      Congress has hampered PTO's efforts to hire and retain a      sufficient number of qualified examiners and implement      technological improvements necessary to ensure expeditious      issuance of high quality patents. Though the PTO funding      compromise embodied in the House-passed bill could be      strengthened to match the fee diversion provision originally      passed by the Senate, as crafted, Section 22 represents a      meaningful step toward ensuring that PTO has better access to      the user fees it collects, and would better allow the agency      to address the current backlog of 1.2 million applications      waiting for a final determination and pendency time of three      years, as well as to improve patent quality.       In addition, the legislation would help ensure that the      U.S. remains at the forefront of     innovation by enhancing the PTO process and ensuring that all      inventors secure the exclusive right to their inventions and      discoveries. The bill shifts the U.S. to a first-inventor-to-     file system that the Chamber believes is both constitutional      and wise, ending expensive interference proceedings. H.R.      1249 also contains important legal reforms that would help      reduce unnecessary litigation against American businesses and      innovators. Among the bill's provisions, Section 16 would put      an end to frivolous false patent marking cases, while still      preserving the right of those who suffered actual harm to      bring actions. Section 5 would create a prior user right for      those who first commercially use inventions, protecting the      rights of early inventors and giving manufacturers a powerful      incentive to build new factories in the United States, while      at the same time fully protecting universities. Section 19      also restricts joinder of defendants who have tenuous      connections to the underlying disputes in patent infringement      suits. Section 18 of H.R. 1249 provides for a tailored pilot      program which would allow patent office experts to help the      court review the validity of certain business method patents      using the best available prior art as an alternative to      costly litigation.       The Chamber strongly opposes any amendments to H.R. 1249      that would strike or weaken any of the important legal reform      measures in this legislation, including those found in      Sections 16, 5, 19 and 18.       The Chamber strongly supports H.R. 1249. The Chamber may      consider votes on, or in relation to, H.R. 1249--including      procedural votes, and any weakening Pamendments--in our      annual How They Voted scorecard.           Sincerely,                                              R. Bruce Josten,                                         Executive Vice President,     Government Affairs.                                  ____                                          United Steelworkers,                                    Pittsburgh, PA, July 15, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the United Steelworkers,      I am writing to urge you to consider support for the recently      passed House bill, H.R. 1249. Over the past several years the      USW has been deeply involved in discussions concerning      comprehensive patent reform. We were principally concerned      with issues dealing with how damages are calculated for      infringed patents, new post-grant review procedures, and      publication requirements for pending patents. H.R. 1249, as      did S. 23 which passed earlier this year, satisfactorily      addresses these issues and has our support. While we prefer      the provision in the Senate bill dealing with USPTO funding,      we nevertheless believe that the House bill moves in the      right direction and will help insure that the patent office      has the appropriate and necessary resources to do its      important work.       Certainly, no bill is perfect. But H.R. 1249 goes a long      way toward balancing different interests on a very difficult      and contentious issue. We believe it warrants your favorable      consideration and enactment by the Senate so that it can be      moved to the President's desk and signed into law without      undue delay.       We worked closely with your office, and others in the      Senate, in finding a consensus approach that would promote      innovation, investment, production and job creation in the      U.S. We believe that H.R. 1249, which builds on your work in      the Senate, strikes a proper balance.       The U. S. economy remains in a very fragile state with high      unemployment and stagnant wages. Patent reform can be an      important part of a comprehensive approach to getting the      economy moving again and I urge its enactment.           Sincerely,                                                    Leo W. Gerard,     International President.                                  ____                                                    June 27, 2011.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Ranking Member,     Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write      on behalf of six university, medical college, and higher      education associations to encourage you to work with the      leadership of the Senate to bring H.R. 1249 before the Senate      as soon as possible for a vote on passage of the bill as is.       The patent system plays a critical role in enabling      universities to transfer the discoveries arising from      university research into the commercial sector for      development into products and processes that benefit society.      H.R. 1249 closely resembles S. 23; both bills contain      provisions that will improve patent quality, reduce patent      litigation costs, and provide increased funding for the      USPTO. Although we preferred the USPTO revolving fund      established in S. 23, we believe that the funding provisions      adopted by the House in the course of passing H.R. 1249      provide an effective means of preventing fee diversion.      Together with the expanded fee-setting authority included in      both bills, H.R. 1249 will provide USPTO with the funding      necessary to carry out its critical functions.       We very much appreciate the leadership of the Senate      Judiciary Committee in crafting S. 23, which brought together      the key elements of effective patent reform and formed the      basis for H.R. 1249. These bills represent the successful      culmination of a thorough, balanced effort to update the U.S.      patent system, strengthening the nation's innovative capacity      and job creation in the increasingly competitive global      economic environment of the 21st century. Senate passage of      H.R. 1249 will assure that the nation secures these benefits.           Sincerely,     Hunter R. Rawlings III,       President, Association of American Universities.     Molly Corbett Broad,       President, American Council on Education.     Darrell G. Kirch,       President and CEO, Association of American Medical      Colleges.     Peter McPherson,       President, Association of Public and Land-grant      Universities.     Robin L. Rasor,       President, Association of University Technology Managers.     Anthony P. DeCrappeo,       President, Council on Governmental Relations.                                  ____                                                    June 25, 2011.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As an      independent inventor and someone who has personally      interacted with thousands of other independent inventors and      entrepreneurs, we urge you to work with the leadership of the      Senate to bring H.R. 1249 to the Senate floor as soon the      Senate's schedule might permit and pass the bill as is.       Over the past few months, my enthusiasm and belief in the      legislative process has grown as I have participated in the      debate over patent reform. I believe that this legislation      will fully modernize our patent laws. It will give      independent inventors and entrepreneurs the speed and      certainty necessary to go out and commercialize their      inventions, start companies, and create jobs.       There has been a great deal of compromise amongst      industries to balance the unique needs of all constituents.      The independent inventor has been well represented throughout      this process and we are in a unique situation where there is      overwhelming support for this legislation.       The fee diversion debate has been important, since it has      shed light on the fact that nearly a billion dollars has been      diverted from the USPTO. These are dollars that inventors      have paid to the USPTO expecting the funds to be used to      examine applications as expeditiously as possible. While I      would have preferred the Senate's approach in S. 23 to      prevent diversion of USPTO funds, I believe that acceptance      of the House bill provides the best way to ensure that the      funds paid to the patent office will be available to hire      examiners and modernize the tools necessary for it to operate      effectively.       H.R. 1249 is the catalyst necessary to incentivize      inventors and entrepreneurs to create the companies that will      get our country back on the right path and generate the jobs      we sorely need. I hope that you will take the needs of the      ``little guy'' into consideration and move this legislation      forward and enact these historic reforms.           Sincerely,                                                 Louis J. Foreman,                                                              CEO.
