 President, I rise today to recognize an innovative educator from my home State of Kentucky--Mr. William King--who, earlier this month, was awarded the prestigious Milken Education Award.  If you were to ask William King about his occupation, he may not respond that he is a ``teacher'' or ``educator.'' Instead, he is more inclined to give himself the label of ``educational entrepreneur.'' That's because in his 12 years in education, Mr. King has been relentless in his search to find new and better ways to educate our Nation's schoolchildren.  In his current capacity as freshman principal at Bowling Green High School--his alma mater--William is charged with shepherding his students through the all-important transition from middle to high school. King has spearheaded initiatives such as TeachMeet Kentucky and TeachMeet Nashville--which are informal meetings where teachers gather to share ideas and best practices--and No Office Day, where school administrators spend an entire day with students in the classroom. It is his Jump Start program, however, that has earned him one of, if not the most, prestigious awards in education--the Milken Education Award.  William created Jump Start to help better prepare students to excel in their first year of high school. Now, I face a lot of challenges here in the Senate, but few are more trying than those faced by a teenager who is about to enter high school. Mr. King not only recognized just how daunting this transition can be for students, but he also had the ability and the selfless inclination to do something about it.  With his innovative program, King works with students and parents and also coordinates between eighth- and ninth-grade teachers to ensure that his kids are prepared for the academic challenges they are about to face.  The Milken Education Award is a prestigious one; it is not given out just for good intentions. Wining an ``Oscar of Teaching,'' as it's known by teachers across the country, requires results--and William King unquestionably delivers results. Since implementing Jump Start, ninth-grade retentions have dropped by 68 percent. For this, he was recognized with the Milken Education Award, as well as $25,000 to spend as he chooses, at a surprise assembly at Bowling Green High School.  Lowell Milken, chairman and co-founder of the Milken Family Foundation, once said, ``A sound education provides the opportunity to realize one's potential.'' William King has shown that he is wholeheartedly dedicated to this proposition, and that he is deserving of praise from this body. I ask that my Senate colleges join me in recognizing this exemplary Kentucky citizen.  The Park City Daily News recently published an article highlighting William's work and his award. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Park City Daily News, Feb. 12, 2014]                    Educator Receives $25,000 Award                            (By Chuck Mason)       A Bowling Green High School administrator who graduated as      a BGHS Purple in 1996 got the surprise of his life Wednesday      morning.       Freshman Principal William King received a Milken Educator      Award and $25,000 he can spend any way he wants. His Jump      Start program working with freshman has reduced by 68 percent      the number of BGHS freshmen who do not pass.       ``I had no clue,'' said King after the ceremony. ``I had a      list of all these names (of BGHS teachers) in my head (who      could be receiving the award). ``It could have been anyone on      our staff.''       King also has been instrumental in holding TeachMeet      seminars, which are informal meetings for teachers to share      best practices of how they use technology in their      classrooms, at Western Kentucky University, in Nashville and      other locations in the United States.       The Milken Educator Award, called the ``Oscars of      Teaching'' by Teacher Magazine, was presented as the cheers      of 1,200 students bounced off walls of the high school's      arena. Many of the students cheering King have been under his      leadership since they first entered the school halls four      years ago. King was told the assembly was to honor the      academic accomplishments of BGHS students, and it started      that way before Kentucky Education Commissioner Terry      Holliday took the microphone to make remarks and then      introduced Jane Foley, senior vice president of the Milken      Family Foundation. Foley made the surprise announcement that      King is Kentucky's 2014 Milken Educator Award winner, after      telling the students first how much the award was worth and      that one educator in the arena was to receive it.       ``We welcome you to our family of excellence,'' said Foley,      who received her own Milken Educator Award in 1994.       Three south-central Kentucky educators previously received      a Milken Educator Award, which was created in 1987.       King was surprised during the morning assembly. Principal      Gary Fields said it was a challenge to keep the announcement      secret from King. The winner said he wasn't even sure he was      supposed to be in the arena that morning for the academic      assembly. Fields read a lengthy list of BGHS students who      excelled in academics, at one point, turning to Holliday and      remarking, ``commissioner, I'm only halfway through the      list.''       King, who monitors teacher and student success, founded the      Jump Start program, in which teachers and parents ensure      incoming freshmen are ready for high school. King spent a      dozen years as an educator, including as an instructional      assistant, social studies teacher, curriculum coordinator,      literacy coach and freshman principal. He's a 1996 BGHS      graduate and an Eagle Scout.       King ``always comes into our social studies class and talks      with us,'' said Savannah Hanson, a junior at BGHS. She said      the Milken Family Foundation made a good choice in honoring      King.       Since 1987, the foundation has awarded more than $64      million to nearly 2,600 kindergarten through 12th-grade      educators across the United States in awards. Total funding      for the program, which includes resources for the winning      educators, is more than $136 million. Fifty-two Kentucky      teachers have received the award since 1993.       ``A sound education provides the opportunities to realize      one's potential, which is why the future belongs to the      educated,'' Lowell Milken, chairman and co-founder, said in      grant program information. ``Effective education equips each      new generation with the knowledge and skills to make sound      and independent judgments, as well as proceed to the next      stage in learning and in life.''       The Milken awards were conceived to attract, retain and      motivate talented people in the teaching profession.       Foley said the Milken Educator Award is not one that      teachers or administrators can apply for. ``We don't accept      nominations. You don't find us, we find you,'' Foley said.       ``Not an accolade for lifetime achievement or the      proverbial gold watch at the exit door, the Milken Educator      Awards targets early- to mid-career education professionals      for their already impressive achievements and, more      significantly, for the promise of what they will accomplish      in the future,'' the website noted.       Accompanying Holliday and Foley was Madeline Abramson, wife      of Kentucky Lt. Governor Jerry Abramson.       After the award was announced, the students did a rousing      chant with a Bowling Green Purples theme, clapping their      hands in staccato fashion, then stamping their feet.       ``There's no way I can top that,'' said Holliday, taking      the microphone once again. Looking at King, the commissioner      added, ``What an honor for Bowling Green High School and      Kentucky.''       Milken award winners have exceptional educational talent as      evidenced by effective instructional practices and student-     learning results in the classroom and school; have exemplary      educational accomplishments beyond the classroom that provide      models of excellence for the profession; are individuals      whose contributions to education are largely unheralded yet      worthy of the spotlight; are early- to mid-career educators      who offer strong long-range potential for professional and      policy leadership; and have an engaging and inspiring      presence that motivates and impacts students, colleagues and      the community, the website noted.       The last south-central Kentucky educator to receive a      Milken Educator Award was Karen Branham in 2001. At the time,      Branham was a teacher at Glasgow High School. She is now      assistant superintendent for student learning for the      Elizabethtown Independent School District.
