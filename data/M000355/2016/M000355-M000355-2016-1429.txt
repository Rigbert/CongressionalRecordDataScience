 President, I wish to welcome colleagues back to a new year in a new Senate that is back to work for the American people. It is clear we had a successful 2015. Committees began functioning again. Senators began having more of a say again. We got important things accomplished for the American people. We are looking to build upon this progress in 2016. There is, of course, much to be done, but I am optimistic about what can be achieved with a bipartisan dedication to moving back to regular order, not just this year but in the years to come.  The scale of what any Congress will be able to accomplish in a given year often depends upon the willingness of the President to cooperate and engage in good faith. When President Obama comes to address Congress tomorrow, he will have an important opportunity to demonstrate that to the American people. The question is, Will he rise to the moment? Based on what the White House has been saying in the media, it is unlikely we will hear a unifying message for our country tomorrow. That is unfortunate. I think the American people can expect to hear a positive message from Governor Haley. Many are looking forward to hearing what she has to say. I will have much more to say on all of that tomorrow.                          ____________________
