Speaker, the initial observation I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, we on this side are very concerned that we stay in whatever negotiations are necessary to try to overcome this impasse and to accomplish the work that is before us. We are also very concerned, of course, that we give notice to the country and to its workers that they in fact will be working on Monday and that government will be operating on Monday.  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not at some point in time today his side intends to offer a CR which will ensure that happening?
