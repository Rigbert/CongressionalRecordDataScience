Chairman, I rise in support of the Knollenberg amendment. His characterization of the language is absolutely correct. It is the same as energy and water, it is the same as full committee has reported for foreign operations and essentially the same intent as Veterans Administration, HUD and Urban Development as well.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate his work in a bipartisan fashion and, again, I agree with the premise of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Knollenberg), Kyoto is not the law of the land, but we want to ensure that where we have authorized programs and where there is duplicate language that the law can also be followed. I do appreciate the initiative of the gentleman and would ask my colleagues to support his amendment.
