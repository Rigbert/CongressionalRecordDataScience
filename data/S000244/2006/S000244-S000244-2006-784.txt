 Madam Speaker, the statement we just heard is at variance with what has happened since the PATRIOT Act was enacted.  First, none of the 16 provisions that expanded law enforcement powers has been held unconstitutional by any Federal Court in the country in over 4 years of being tested. Second, the PATRIOT Act requires the Justice Department Inspector General to report to Congress twice a year on civil liberties violations that have been investigated. We have gotten those reports. There haven't been any. Third, there is a provision in the PATRIOT Act that said anybody who thinks their civil liberties are violated can sue the Justice Department and get $10,000 of statutory damages in addition to proven economic damages and attorneys fees. So far, not a dime has been paid out in judgments or settlements under this section.  This is an example of how the PATRIOT Act has been distorted by those who are opposed to it. Let us talk about the PATRIOT Act, because the PATRIOT Act has passed muster, and the facts and the court decisions show it.  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren).
