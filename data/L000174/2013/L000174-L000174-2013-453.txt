President, we are presently negotiating an arms trade treaty which will help to keep illicit firearms out of the hands of war criminals and terrorists. It is a humanitarian issue. We have people such as Joseph Kony who is out murdering children. He is able to do it because he is taking part in the international arms trade. We are trying to stop those things.  My earlier amendment makes it very clear, we cannot trump our own second-amendment rights, but we can stop these children from being killed because of this, and that is why I oppose the Inhofe amendment. Let our negotiators negotiate. Any treaty still has to come back here to get a two-thirds vote anyway.
