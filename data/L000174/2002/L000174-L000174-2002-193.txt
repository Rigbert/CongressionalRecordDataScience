President, ``Lavenski Smith is a young Arkansas political appointee, who has had a total of 7 years experience practicing law, has had minimal Federal experience, minimal appellate experience, and no experience at all arguing in front of the Federal Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to which he has been nominated. He is nominated to the judgeship held by Judge Richard Arnold, one of the most distinguished judges ever to serve on the 8th Circuit.  Mr. Smith served a brief term on the Arkansas Supreme Court, after being appointed by the Governor and before running for election to a lower State court judicial vacancy and losing. He also spent several years as the volunteer executive director of the Arkansas chapter of the Rutherford Institute, an organization devoted to, among other things, doing away with a woman's constitutional right to choose, and supporting efforts against Governor, and then President, Bill Clinton.''  The following is what the Arkansas Times had to say about Mr. Smith's qualifications:       Lavenski Smith of Little Rock is not the best-qualified      Arkansan President Bush could have chosen for the U.S. 8th      Circuit Court of Appeals, nor even close. Marginally      acceptable, if that, Smith was nominated by Bush, on the      recommendation of Senator Tim Hutchinson, because Smith is      racially, ideologically and politically correct--a black      conservative Republican, avidly anti-abortion and anti-     Clinton, whose nomination will, it is hoped, aid Hutchinson's      re-election effort. Not much there to suggest a distinguished      judicial career. Still, there are worse things than      mediocrity, and Bush has nominated them, too.  It is difficult to vote in favor of a nominee to a lifetime appointment on a Federal appellate court with this kind of record, but he is supported by both of his home-State Senators. Senator Blanche Lincoln worked hard to be sure that Mr. Smith was included in a hearing earlier this year and she supports his nomination. Based on Senator Lincoln's confidence in this nominee's ability to do the job and based on the nominee's assurances that he will not seek to impose his personal views in his legal decisions, I have reluctantly decided to vote in favor of this nomination.  Smith seems like an honorable person, and despite his political views and political activism, I am hopeful that he will be a person of his word: that he will follow the law and not seek out opportunities to overturn precedent or decide cases in accord with his private beliefs rather than his obligations as a judge.  This is one of 17 nominations that have been reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate but were stalled for the last 2 months. In addition, nearly two dozen Executive Branch nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee are also awaiting action.  The delay in final Senate action on these nominees has been due to the failure of the administration to fulfill its responsibility to work with the Senate in the naming of members of bipartisan boards and commissions. Last week I congratulated the majority leader for overcoming this impediment and for his patience and determination in achieving some movement on these matters.  I understand that he hopes to be able to resume voting on judicial nominations once cloture is achieved on the Smith nomination today.  Democrats are taking extraordinary efforts to overcome impediments to action on nominations. Had the administration not caused this delay, and had Republican Senators not placed ``holds'' over the last several months, I am confident that the Senate would have confirmed more than 70 judicial nominees by now.  We were able to overcome the other obstacles created by the administration and proceed to confirm 57 judicial nominees in our first 10 months in the majority, a record outpacing any Republican total in any 10-month period in which they held the majority.  We have also addressed long-standing vacancies on circuit courts caused by Republican obstruction of President Clinton's judicial nominees. We held the first hearing for a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 years, the first hearings for Sixth Circuit nominees in almost 5 years, the first hearing for a Tenth Circuit nominee in 6 years, and the first hearings for Fourth Circuit nominees in 3 years.  We have reformed the process for considering judicial nominees.  For example, we have ended the practice of anonymous holds that plagued the period of Republican control, when any Republican Senator could hold any nominee from his home State, his own circuit or any part of the country for any reason, or no reason, without any accountability. We have returned to the Democratic tradition of holding regular hearings, every few weeks, rather than going for months without a single hearing.  With a positive vote on the nomination of Lavenski Smith, the Senate will have confirmed its 10th Court of Appeals nominee of President Bush since the reorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee a year ago, on July 10, 2001. During their recent 6\1/2\ years of majority control, Republicans averaged seven Court of Appeals confirmations a year.  The Democratic-led Judiciary Committee has had a record-breaking first year fairly and promptly considering President Bush's nominees, which I detailed last Friday. For example, in 1 year, we have held hearings for 78 of the President's nominees.  That is more hearings for this President's district and circuit court nominees than in 20 of the past 22 years.  Under Democratic leadership, the Senate confirmed more circuit and district court judges, 57, than were confirmed during all 12 months in each of 2000, 1999, 1997, 1996, and 1995, 5 of the prior 6 years of Republican control of the Senate. The Judiciary Committee has since last July voted on 15 circuit court nominees. In our first year, we held more hearings for more of President Bush's circuit court nominees than in the first year of any of the past three Presidents.  More of President Bush's nominees have also been given committee votes than in the first year of any of the past three Presidents.  Unfortunately, one-sixth of President Clinton's judicial nominees--more than 50--never got a committee hearing and committee vote from the Republican majority, which perpetuated longstanding vacancies into this year. If the Republicans had not left more than 50 of President Clinton's nominees without a hearing or a vote, the current number of vacancies might be closer to 40 than 90.  In addition, large numbers of vacancies continue to exist on many Courtsof Appeals, in large measure because the recent Republican majority was not willing to hold hearings or vote on more than half--56 percent--of President Clinton's Courts of Appeals nominees in 1999 and 2000 and was not willing to confirm a single judge to the Courts of Appeals during the entire 1996 session.  From the time the Republicans took over majority control of the Senate in 1995 until the reorganization of the Committee last July, circuit vacancies increased from 16 to 33, more than doubling.  Democrats have broken with that recent history of inaction. During our first year in control of the Judiciary Committee, we held 16 hearings for circuit court nominees. That is almost the same number of circuit court nominees, 17, who were never given a Committee vote by Republicans in 2000.  Democrats are working hard to reduce judicial vacancies and we have moved quickly on these nominees, as well as many, many others. I have noted that we could have been even more productive with a little cooperation from the White House, but that has not been forthcoming.  Moreover, of the current vacancies, more than half do not have a nominee. We are almost out of district court nominees ready to be included at hearings, because the President has been so slow to nominate district court nominees and insists on delaying the ABA peer review process until after the nominations are made.  Today's vote on the nomination of Lavenski Smith to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is the third Eighth Circuit nominee the committee has considered in the past year. This is in sharp contrast to the treatment of Eighth Circuit nominee Bonnie Campbell by Republicans.  Ms. Campbell is now a partner at the distinguished Washington law firm of Arent Fox Kintner Plotkin & Kahn, where she acts as an adviser, negotiator, advocate, and litigator, representing employers in personnel, labor relations, employment discrimination, benefits, and other employment-related matters. A graduate of Drake University and Drake's law school, Ms. Campbell has an outstanding record of public service.  She was nominated by President Clinton early in 2000 to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  She was supported by both of her Senators, Democrat Tom Harkin and Republican Chuck Grassley, given a ``Qualified'' rating by the ABA, and afforded a hearing before the Judiciary Committee a few months later, in May of 2000. However, despite a noncontroversial hearing, Ms. Campbell was never scheduled for a committee vote. No explanation for this failure to give her a vote was ever given, and her nomination was eventually returned at the end of the 106th Congress. Other individuals nominated after Ms. Campbell were given committee hearings and votes and were confirmed later that year, while Ms. Campbell's nomination languished.  She seems to have been the victim of the Republican practice of anonymous, indefinite holds. In January of 2001, President Clinton re-nominated Ms. Campbell, but President Bush failed to seize the opportunity for bipartisanship, and withdrew her nomination shortly thereafter.  At the time of her nomination Ms. Campbell was nearing the end of a distinguished term at the U.S. Department of Justice, where she served as Director of the Violence Against Women Office, a position to which she was appointed by President Clinton in 1995.  In that capacity, she oversaw a $1.6 billion program to provide funding to States to strengthen their efforts in the areas of domestic violence and sexual abuse. She also directed the Federal Government's efforts to implement the new criminal statutes created by the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. Ms. Campbell oversaw the Justice Department's efforts to combine tough new Federal criminal laws with assistance to states and localities to fight against violence against women.  Bonnie Campbell had, before coming to Washington, served as the Attorney General of Iowa, the first woman ever elected to that position. During her tenure in office, she was instrumental in pushing the State legislature to strengthen Iowa's domestic abuse statute, and in 1992 she authored one of the Nation's first anti-stalking laws. In 1997 Bonnie Campbell was named by Time magazine as one of the 25 most influential people in America.  Ms. Campbell's record of distinguished public service and her experience in private practice combined to make an excellent nominee to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, a fact with which both of her Senators obviously agreed. Yet once afforded a hearing, Bonnie Campbell was left to linger in an indefensible limbo. She was not granted a committee vote, but neither was she confronted with any objections to her nomination to the Eighth Circuit proceeding.  Contrasting the treatment of the nominations of Bonnie Campbell and Lavenski Smith to the Eighth Circuit evidences the difference in how the Republican majority and the current Democratic majority have handled judicial nominations and highlights the fairness that has been restored to the confirmation process.                          ____________________
