Speaker, I am here today to acknowledge the outstanding career of Ron Molendyk. Mr. Molendyk, who has announced his retirement, serves as the city manager for the city of Lake Elsinore, CA. Having worked with Mr. Molendyk for many years, I am truly sorry to hear this pillar of the community say goodbye. However, I am extremely pleased to see a long life of hard work be rewarded with the celebration of retirement.  Mr. Molendyk has served in municipal government for 35 years and he has been dedicated to the city of Lake Elsinore for 13 years. He began his career as the recreation leader for the city of Buena Park. He then moved on to become area supervisor for the recreations and parks department for the city of Long Beach, director of recreation and parks for the city of Bell, director of community services for the city of Brea and the traffic commissioner for the city of Placentia. Drive, determination, and many years of experience paid off for Mr. Molendyk when he was hired as the city manager/city clerk for the city of Rolling Hills and then, later, as the city manager for the city of Lake Elsinore.  The position of city manager incorporates all of the requirements of a corporate administrator, as well as the responsibility of providing leadership and representation to the community on behalf of the city council and staff. As city manager, Mr. Molendyk has served as the negotiator to bring commercial and residential development to the city of Lake Elsinore. To emphasize the priceless asset of the city, the lake, Mr. Molendyk has been a leader in the development of recreation and tourism.  He has also been the key contact for relations between the city and other levels of government. On many occasions, Mr. Molendyk has been the liaison for my office when addressing city issues affected by the Federal Government, such as flood control, transportation, and the environment. His knowledge of and passion for the city of Lake Elsinore has been a vital asset to me during my first two terms as the congressional representative for the Elsinore Valley.  Mr. Molendyk received his bachelor of arts in recreation and master of science in administration from California State University, Long Beach. He is a member of the International City Managers' Association, Inland EmpireCity Managers' Association, California Parks and Recreation Society, Rotary International, Lambda Alpha and Community Redevelopment Association.  I would like to take the opportunity to say thank you to Mr. Molendyk for his dedication, influence and involvement in our community. He has served as a fine representative of municipal government. It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate Mr. Ron Molendyk on his outstanding career and offer my best wishes for continued success in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
