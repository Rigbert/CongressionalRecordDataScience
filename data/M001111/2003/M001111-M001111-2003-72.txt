  I can tell you that even though we covered a host of topics, including economic development, civil rights and healthcare, the No. 1 topic people talked about was education.  I was astounded to listen as leaders in the community, elected school board members, and city council members told me that when they were growing up, very few people, if any, looked at them and said: ``You know, you can be a success. You can pass first grade.'' Or that, ``You can go on to college, and you can become something in this country.''  If we adopt this amendment, we will tell a generation of young students: We need you. We need you to be the next generation of engineers. We need you to be the next generation of teachers. We need you to be the next generation of C.E.O.s.  Today we are missing out on an entire young population, and what they can give back to this country someday in leadership, in economics, in paying taxes, and in being successful members of the community.  This amendment will help knock down the barriers facing Hispanic students, and we must adopt it.  Perhaps the most disturbing thing is that the underlying Labor-HHS bill we are debating cuts funding for critical Hispanic programs.  That is why we need this amendment to stop those cuts and provide funding for critical services like extra help with preschool, English language acquisition, tutoring, mentoring, and financial aid.  I want to highlight how this amendment will help in areas like Headstart, migrant education, and language skills.  One program that I have seen bring help--and hope--to families for decades is Head Start. This amendment will expand access to Head Start programs for migrant and seasonal working families.  Migrant and seasonal farmworkers work hard every day so that you and I can put affordable food on our tables. It is a good deal for us, but most of those families earn less than $10,000 a year. Many of their children pay a price beyond poverty.  When families don't have access to child care, they are forced to take their children into the fields with them, exposing them to equipment and other hazards.  Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs meet the needs of these families, keeping their children safe while preparing them for school.  Nationwide, 60 percent of children are being served by Head Start, but for migrant children, it is just 19 percent and for children of seasonal workers, it is just 2 percent. That is unacceptable.  This amendment will boost the funding so we give more children of migrant and seasonal workers a place in Head Start so they can start school ready to learn.  This amendment does more than just increase funding to serve more children. It also makes sure that vulnerable children are not cut off from the help they are counting on.  The President's budget request slashed funding for the High School Equivalency Program, HEP, by 43 percent.  The appropriations bill before the Senate implements the President's cut, with a $10 million cut to HEP. It also cuts funding for the College Assistance Migrant Program, CAMP, by $400,000.  The funding cuts in the HEP program would eliminate the 23 oldest and best performing projects in the program, two of which are in Washington State.  I have met with the leaders of HEP and CAMP programs in Washington state. They are doing critical work at Heritage College and Washington State University HEP programs.  HEP provides education and counseling services to migrant students who have dropped out of high school so they can pass the GED examination.  Some of the 23 projects that could be closed down have been providing services for 30 years.  As a whole, 73 percent of their students received GEDs, an amazing success rate for a population of students who have already dropped out of school.  The CAMP program is also critical. It recruits talented migrant high school and GED graduates, who want to go on to college, but don't have the resources. These programs introduce parents and students to campus during the summer before their freshman year. It helps those students in their first year of college with personal and academic counseling, mentoring, and stipends.  Before we created CAMP programs, there was no record of a migrant child having completed college.  Since then, nearly three-quarters of all CAMP students have graduated with baccalaureate degrees. Without HEP and CAMP, access to college would be out of reach for the vast majority of migrant students.  The funding levels in this bill ignore the amazing successes we have had through HEP and CAMP.  Because migrant children move around, they don't have a local school, a school district, or even a State that is responsible for their education. We need to keep this safety net at the Federal level.  Currently, funding for the 102 HEP and CAMP projects can serve only 15,000 students, a small fraction of those who desperately need help. The Department of Education has estimated there are now over 750,000 school-aged migrant children.  Since migrant children have the highest dropout rate in the Nation, with nearly 60 percent failing to complete high school, that means that over the next 5 years, 170,000 of these children will drop out of school and be eligible for HEP services.  Over the next 5 years, 140,000 students will become eligible for CAMP services.  It makes no sense for this bill to take away funding when so many students need help.  Another area where our country cannot afford to make the cuts in this appropriations bill is in the English Language Acquisition program. This bill cuts the program by $20 million. That is unacceptable.  This amendment would restore that funding.  It will also increase support for limited English proficient, LEP, students to $750 million.  The number of LEP students has almost doubled over the past decade. It has increased at nearly eight times the rate of total student enrollment. The teachers who are serving those students could use more preparation to teach students with limited English proficiency.  This amendment will help provide title III dollars so that these teachers can receive ongoing professional development.  The Reid-Bingaman amendment will help students overcome barriers at almost every level of school.  Congress has a proud tradition of ensuring that our most disadvantaged kids get a shot at the American dream. It is what we did when we passed title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It is what we did when we created Head Start. And it is what we did when we started giving out Pell Grants.  We need to carry on that tradition today, not out of charity, but because we recognize that these children are our bridge to a successful future.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and give Hispanic students in Washington State and around the country a change at the American dream and a better life.                           amendment no. 1629  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Indiana to offer an amendment to the fiscal year 2004 Labor-HHS Appropriations Act. I would like to thank Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for their support for this amendment.  I usually come down to the Senate floor to criticize the amount of unrequested spending in appropriations bills. Not often do I propose an increase in spending for a specific program. However, today, I feel obligated to offer an amendment to increase the level of funding for the Special Volunteers for Homeland Security program with the Corporation for National and Community Service. I am requesting that we raise our level of funding by $5 million, to bring the total level of funding to $10 million, which is what the program was funded at last year. The administration requested a total of $15 million for this program this year. We are simply proposing to restore one half of the additional money the President requested. This issue is of enough importance to the administration as it was included in their Statement of Administrative Policy.  The amendment Senator Bayh and I propose restores important money to the Special Volunteers for Homeland Security program, a critical component on national service. This amendment increases the funding for this program by $5 million to be more in line with the amount requested in the President's 2004 Budget.  We live in a time of heightened security where terror alerts have become an unfortunate reality. It is sobering to realize that the chances are strong that we will face another terrorist attack in the future. In addition to devoting considerable resources to fighting terror at home and abroad, we need to devote significant resources to preparing our domestic response to any future attack. We would be failing in our responsibilities if we do not adequately prepare for the next attack. The realities of the world in which we live today, require us to educate and prepare the public about terrorism and disasters. These volunteers are an extremely effective way to achieve our mission. We need to be fully funding these programs.  For a number of years, Senator Bayh and I have been working together to increase opportunities for service in the United States. We have introduced legislation, the Call to Service Act, in the last two Congresses that would increase volunteer opportunities with AmeriCorps. We have also worked together successfully to create a short-term enlistment program for our military. One of the fundamental aspects to any expansion of service opportunities must be to increase the number of volunteers in homeland security projects. Our legislation specifically calls for more volunteers to perform homeland security function. Service programs such as the one in this amendment provide an important resources in preparing our Nation to respond to a range of emergencies by providing people who can serve in important capacities such as fighting forest fires, disaster relief, and working in hospital emergency rooms.  I would like to share some examples of the works these volunteers do in the various states and country. Currently, there are 17 programs that received money during the second year of this program. The grantees are a diverse group and are spread across the country from Alaska to Florida. Importantgroups such as Volunteer Florida, the American Red Cross of Greater New York and the Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee are all grantees under this program.  In the first year of the program, 350 volunteers with the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska were able to deliver training to help homebound seniors and help 4,500 disabled residents of Anchorage prepare to respond to a disaster.  In Oklahoma, volunteers with the city of Tulsa developed a citywide volunteer disaster mobilization plan. Volunteers helped to educate the general public by distributing a family preparedness guide provided with information how to prepare for disasters. The volunteers convened meetings that included information on bioterrorism response by local health departments and established safe and secure teams throughout the community to serve as trained resources.  I could go on at length about the good things these programs accomplish.  Increasing the Special Volunteers for Homeland Security program is consistent with our overall need to increase opportunities for Americans to serve their country. We need to increase spending for funding for all volunteer programs. Internationally, increasing programs such as the Peace Corps are important in spreading American ideals and values. Domestically, programs such as AmeriCorps need to be expanded to provide services and assistance to those in need. Any expansion of AmeriCorps and domestic volunteer opportunities would be an excellent opportunity to increase volunteer positions in the area of homeland security.  Once again, I thank my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Iowa for their work on this important piece of legislation. I look forward to continuing my work with Senator Bayh and the rest of my colleagues in the Senate to increase national service opportunities.                           amendment No. 1644
