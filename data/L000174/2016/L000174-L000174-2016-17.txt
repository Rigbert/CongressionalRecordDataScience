President, for nearly 16 years, Senator Mark Kirk has given voice to his Illinois constituents here in Washington. His long record of service includes work as a congressional staffer, a 24-year career as a naval intelligence officer, a U.S. Congressman, and a U.S. Senator.  Dedicated to several matters of national and international importance, Senator Kirk has supported a range of legislative efforts during his Senate tenure and has not shied from opposing his party's position. From supporting the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and efforts to repeal don't ask, don't tell, from his opposition to defunding Planned Parenthood and the blockade of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Senator Kirk has emerged as a conservative voice in support of some of the most critical civil rights protections debated today.  When Senator Kirk returned to the Senate following his traumatic stroke in 2012, he showed his commitment to Illinois' voters. As Senator Kirk begins this new chapter, I wish him the very best.                          ____________________
