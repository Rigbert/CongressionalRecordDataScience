Speaker, our country has a proud history of honoring our military heroes, and in doing so we place an emphasis on recognizing servicemembers whose actions placed them in harm's way for the benefit of our Nation and their fellow soldiers.  It's because of this proud history that I have serious concerns about the Department of Defense placement of a newly established Distinguished Warfare Medal in the order of precedence. Surely it is appropriate to recognize servicemembers who make contributions through technology-driven warfare; however, I agree with the VFW that we must continue to preserve the sanctity of our medals for those Americans who sacrifice their personal safety for the safety of the country and their brothers in arms.  That is why I strongly support the effort led by my friend, Congressman Duncan Hunter, who is a decorated veteran himself, to alter the rank of the Distinguished Warfare Medal such that it ranks below the Purple Heart in precedence.  I would encourage all of my colleagues to join me by cosponsoring his bill, H.R. 833, and urge its passage.                          ____________________
