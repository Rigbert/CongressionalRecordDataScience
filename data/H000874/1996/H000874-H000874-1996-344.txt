Chairman, I rise today in support of the Smith amendment to the Immigration in the National Interest Act. I want to commend him for his commitment to this issue and for offering this important amendment. It is crucial to the safety and security of those trying to escape terrible regimes and to this Nation's international leadership role on asylum.  America must continue to shoulder its international responsibility to afford asylum to its fair share of those who are repressed and are at risk in their countries. As a Nation of immigrants, we must leave our door open and continue to admit those persons fleeing from places which do not practice the values and beliefs we hold so dear. At the same time, it is clear that the United States cannot admit all those who would want to come here for solely economic reasons. However, we have a duty to those who seek admittance for humanitarian reasons. The United States has traditionally accepted refugees not for the economic and social reasons but because refugees are usually in grave danger.  H.R. 2202 would limit annual refugee admissions to 75,000 in fiscal year 1997 and 50,000 every year thereafter. This represents a significant decrease from the 98,000 refugees and no legitimate rationale has been given as to why this level was achieved. This would require drastic reductions in the number of former Soviet Jews, Evangelical Christians, Ukrainian Catholics, Vietnamese, Bosnians, and Cubans, Chinese, and Africans.  The current refugee resettlement system works by allowing the executive and legislative branch to consult on an annual basis on what the appropriate levels should be. This provides greater flexibility and the ability to respond to changes which occur throughout the world with refugees. On the other hand, the cap in the bill is inflexible and will not provide us with appropriate mechanisms to respond to refugee developments. Congress already has control over the number of refugees through the budget process. If we believe the administration's estimated levels are inappropriate, the Congress can choose not to fund them.  The best solution to the world's refugee crisis is to work with other nations so that they can assume an appropriate share of the international refugee burden. We need the cooperation of our international neighbors. If we decrease our own refugee by half, we send the wrong message to those nations.  I again want to thank Mr. Smith for offering this amendment and urge my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________
