President, it is my understanding Senator Akaka wants to speak for up to 10 minutes. So I am trying to figure out--we have 38 minutes remaining before the vote, so that would allow 19 minutes per side. If Senator Akaka needs 10 minutes, I would ask for 4 minutes and yield 5 minutes to Senator Klobuchar, if that meets with the Senator's approval.
