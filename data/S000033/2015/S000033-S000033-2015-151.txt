 It creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund so the VA can have the health care professionals--the doctors and nurses--it needs to make sure the VA is providing quality care to all of our veterans in a timely manner. That is about it.  From what I heard--I will speak with Senator Ayotte a little bit later--her amendment is simply making sure the VA implements the law we passed. I don't have any objection to that and I don't know that anyone should.  Our amendment simply says we want the VA to have the medical personnel--doctors, nurses, and staff--it needs to provide quality and timely health care to our veterans. I hope it will receive unanimous agreement.
