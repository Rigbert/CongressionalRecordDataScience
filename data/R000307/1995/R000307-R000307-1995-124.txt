Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the concern and the sense of frustration of the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Sam Johnson, who spoke here just a moment ago, and, as I tried to indicate, in regard to the policy options that we considered in the House Committee on Agriculture there were four. The first option that was suggested by the gentleman from Indiana was obviously supported by the gentleman from Texas in terms of his remarks, and we offered the Governors a block grant, and we said, ``What do you want? Here are the coupons. Here is the Food Stamp Program.''  They said, ``Thank you, but no thank you. We don't want to administer the Food Stamp Program. We want the tax, 27 billion dollars' worth.''  Well, with all due respect, Richard Nixon is no longer President, and we do not have any revenue to share.  So then we said, ``OK, you can't have the cash. That really wouldn't be responsible. But you can have the coupons.''  They said, ``We don't want the coupons.''  That may give my colleagues a little indication as   to what they would do with the cash.  So then we considered a 40-60 split, and if you give them the 40 percent, and that amounts to the people on food stamps that are also on welfare, and we wanted to have one-stop service, streamline it, bring the cost down.                              {time}  1500  But the 60 percent on the other side would have grown. That is about a $6 billion expenditure, and we could not afford that. So we decided to do what we tried to do for decades, years, and that is establish food stamp reform. And we have done that, and we have a good bill.  I remind everyone on this floor that not one farm lobbyist came to this chairman and this committee and indicated that we should cave in in regards to food stamp reform. I am tired of hearing it, and it is not accurate. And the Committee on Agriculture measured up to its responsibility, and we have a fine food stamp reform package. If the package were considered a year ago, it would have been incredible in this House of Representatives.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Thurman].
