 If I could make two points in the nature of a question to the Senator from Arizona.  First, Senator Reid offered this amendment on behalf of Senator Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who is now presiding over the Sotomayor hearings. I know he supports it, and I support it as well, the hate crimes legislation, but I want to make that a matter of record.  Mr. McCAIN. Could I respond to that?
