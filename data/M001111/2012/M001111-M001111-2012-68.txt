 President, today I wish to recognize Major General Timothy J. Lowenberg for his exemplary record of service to the Washington National Guard, Washington State, and the United States of America.  MG Timothy J. Lowenberg will retire on July 31, 2012 after a distinguished career with the Washington National Guard and 44 years of military service to this country. General Lowenberg has been the Adjutant General for Washington State since September 1999 and in this role he has served as the commander of all Washington National Guard forces, Director of Washington State's Emergency Management programs, and Homeland Security Advisor to the Governor of Washington. Beyond these already extensive responsibilities, General Lowenberg is recognized nationally for his work on Homeland Security policy. In a defining mark of General Lowenberg's forward-leaning leadership, he established the Washington State Domestic Security Infrastructure in 1999, prior to the events of 9/11. This collaborative effort to establish a Statewide system capable of responding to major disaster events preceded the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security by several years.  While his list of titles would be a strong credit to any individual, an equally impressive aspect of General Lowenberg's career has been his ability to provide this leadership during one of the most dynamic periods of Washington State's history. During his tenure, General Lowenberg has led Washington State in the response to 53 Governor Emergency Proclamations, 10 Presidential Major Disaster Declarations, and one Presidential Emergency Declaration. Beyond the sheer volume of emergencies General Lowenberg has addressed during his time as Adjutant General, he has displayed great flexibility and a talent for adapting to the needs of any given situation. One of his signature accomplishments was working with me and others toward the establishment of the 2010 Olympics Security Committee and the construction of the 2010 Olympic Coordination Center. In the years that led up to the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, General Lowenberg recognized the need for local, State, Federal, and international cooperation to ensure an effective and smooth response to the games. He managed to operate this committee without the benefit of a National Security Special Event designation, achieving the desired outcome without the benefit of additional funding.  Had General Lowenberg spent his time as Adjutant General only responding to emergencies and planning for disasters, he would still have been able to retire as one of the most accomplished Adjutant Generals in the country, but he also commanded the Washington National Guard during a time of war. Though it is easy to forget, our world looked quite different in 2001. The servicemembers who initially deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq didn't have Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, up-armored Humvees, or even the kind of extensive body armor we see today. Some National Guard members deployed to war zones without body armor, necessary equipment, or even vehicles. In the face of these hardships, General Lowenberg and the Washington National Guard stood fast and persevered. Over the last decade Washington Guard members have deployed and sacrificed alongside the Active-Duty military again and again, and in the words of former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the Washington National Guard and all State Guard members have changed from, ``a strategic reserve to an integral part of the operational force.''  While these brave servicemembers were deployed, General Lowenberg worked with me to modernize Cold War-era benefits that no longer sufficiently supported the post-9/11 Guard members and their families. Guard members deploying in the early half of the last decade were doing so without the promise of adequate veterans' benefits, without appropriate TRICAREbenefits for their families, and without the skilled behavioral health resources to keep pace with the toll that repeated deployments would eventually take. General Lowenberg pushed for improved Guard member access to TRICARE and VA benefits, and to make sure that Guard members and members of the Reserve component have improved access to the behavioral health specialists they need while they are on inactive duty or on annual training.  When these Guard members came back from deployment, they came home to a country that was well intentioned but not well prepared to receive them. When Washington Guard members began returning from their first deployments to Iraq, unemployment for some units was extremely high. I have never accepted the premise that it is acceptable for servicemembers who have sacrificed so much to return home from deployment and struggle to find work to support their families, and neither has General Lowenberg. General Lowenberg fought for funding for the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration program and to expand efforts such as the Washington State Joint Services Support Directorate, J9, program to help more Guard members find employment. The positive impact from these programs helped the men and women of the Washington Guard find stable work and these efforts became such a success that the lessons from these programs have spread throughout the country. Members of the Washington Guard now boast an unemployment rate below the national average and the work that General Lowenberg put into reducing Guard unemployment laid the foundation for my VOW to Hire Heroes Act and other efforts to help veterans access secure employment, including overhauling the Transition Assistance program for the first time in 20 years and making it mandatory.  These changes to National Guard since 1999 have been historic, but General Lowenberg has always maintained the ability to understand what is important. Out of all the memories I have of General Lowenberg, the ones that will stay with me the longest are from the catastrophic flooding that hit Washington in January 2009. The Washington State flood of 2009 caused the biggest urban evacuation in the history of the State, and I cannot begin to describe the scene that I witnessed out of the back of a Chinook as General Lowenberg and I surveyed the damage. That flood broke levees, shut down Interstate 5, and compromised the integrity of Howard Hanson Dam. Through all of that chaos and the lengthy effort to move Federal funding to repair the Howard Hanson Dam, General Lowenberg directed relief, recovery operations, and preparedness efforts with an unparalleled understanding of emergency management that didn't ignore the effects that flood and damaged dam had on small communities and individuals. Under General Lowenberg, Washington State had the best possible leadership for these and other demanding situations.  I join the people of Washington State in congratulating General Lowenberg on an impressive career, and I look forward to seeing what he will accomplish in what I know will be an active retirement.  General Lowenberg, thank you for your service. You will be missed.                           ____________________
