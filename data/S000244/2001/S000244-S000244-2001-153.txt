Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order at any time, without intervention of any point of order, to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2882) to provide for the expedited payment of certain benefits for a public safety officer who was killed or suffered a catastrophic injury as a direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty in connection with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; that the bill be considered as read for amendment; that the previous question be considered as ordered on the bill to final passage without intervening motion except; 1, one hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their designees; and, 2, one motion to recommit; and that the chair may, notwithstanding the order of the previous question, postpone further consideration of the bill to a time designated by the Speaker.
