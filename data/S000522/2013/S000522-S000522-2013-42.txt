Just to underscore for my colleagues the broad support that this has, the American Jewish Committee has also supported it, the Family Research Council. As I said earlier, the Becket Fund and so many others have written very extensive remarks in favor of it.  I do hope there will be very strong support for this important legislation. It's a matter of inclusion to stop current-day, present-day exclusion.                               Memorandum     To: Interested Parties     From: Nathan J. Diament, Exec. Director of Public Policy     Date: February 6, 2013     Re Legal Analysis Supporting Including Houses of Worship,          Among Private Nonprofit Facilities, Eligible for Federal          Disaster Relief Funds Administered by FEMA Under the          Stafford Act.Conclusion: The Establishment Clause does not bar the award of federal  grants to houses of worship for the repair of facilities damaged in a    natural disaster, in the context of the Stafford Act's ``private                    nonprofit facility'' aid program.                                   I.                             A. Background       The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency      Assistance Act provides that the Federal Emergency Management      Agency (FEMA) may provide funding, through its Public      Assistance program, to restore facilities of certain private      nonprofit organizations which were damaged in a natural      disaster. 42 U.S.C. 5122, 5172.       The private nonprofit organizations eligible for such aid      include those which provide ``critical services'' (ie:      utilities, hospitals and schools) and those which provide      ``essential services'' (ie: museums, community centers,      libraries, day care centers and more). The Stafford Act does      not explicitly include or exclude houses of worship from      eligibility for public assistance. In its regulations and      policies, FEMA has imposed restrictions on eligibility for      aid to houses of worship. FEMA excludes facilities whose      ``primary use'' is religious from eligibility.       It is worth noting an illustrative example of FEMA's      unequal policy. One eligible category of nonprofit providing      ``essential services'' is community centers. FEMA policy      defines these entities as ``a gathering place for a variety      of social, educational . . . and community service      activities.'' FEMA policy describes a broad array of      activities that fit this definition--but excludes a facility      that hosts the very same activities if that facility and      those activities are in a house or worship in a religious      context.       FEMA's exclusion of houses of worship from eligibility      cannot be exclusively on constitutional grounds because, as      noted, FEMA awards aid to religious entities that operate      what it deems to be eligible nonprofits. FEMA's exclusion is      also not on statutory grounds as the statute does not      explicitly exclude houses of worship.       FEMA's policy is unfair, discriminatory and not required by      constitutional jurisprudence.                  B. Possible Constitutional Concerns       Those who would contend that providing government funds for      the repair of houses of worship is barred by the Constitution      would argue that a two-part rule governs direct financial      support of religious institutions. First, that direct aid may      be given to ``non-pervasively sectarian'' religious      institutions, provided the aid is not used to fund      specifically religious activity and is channeled exclusively      to secular functions. Second, that there are institutions--     ``pervasively sectarian'' institutions--in which ``religion      is so pervasive that a substantial portion of [their]      functions are subsumed in the religious mission.'' (Hunt v.      McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743 (1973)). The opponents would      further contend that, because houses of worship would qualify      as ``pervasively sectarian'' institutions, in which the      ``secular and religious functions'' are ``inextricably      intertwined,'' the government may not provide direct aid to      them ``with or without restrictions,'' because the aid will      inevitably end up advancing religion. (Tilton v. Richardson,      403 U.S. 672 (1971), and Committee for Public Educ. v.      Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756 (1973)).       In addition, the opponents of fair inclusion of houses of      worship would contend that to the extent that it is possible      to distinguish between the religious and secular, any      governmental effort to separate out the facilities and      functions that engage in exclusively religious activities      could well involve the kind of monitoring of a religious      entity otherwise prohibited by the Establishment Clause.      Opponents would again cite Tilton and Nyquist, which imposed      certain restrictions on the government's provision of      construction, maintenance, and repair aid to properties used      by religious educational institutions.       As the following discussion will demonstrate however, in      the context of disaster response and relief, these      contentions are inconsistent with current constitutional      jurisprudence.                                   II                 A. General Constitutional Perspective       A proper reading of Supreme Court decisions and      jurisprudence developed in the decades since Tilton and      Nyquist clearly lead to the conclusion that providing federal      grants to houses of worship, among many types of nonprofits,      as part of a broad disaster relief program, is      constitutionally acceptable. Most notably, the Supreme      Court's ruling in Mitchell v. Helms, 550 U.S. 793 (2000),      explicitly undermined the continued application of Tilton and      Nyquist.       First, Congress may legitimately conclude that the federal      government has a secular interest in aiding a community's      recovery from a natural disaster, that repairing damaged      private nonprofit facilities is an essential component of      that recovery and that houses of worship are among those      nonprofit facilities which should be aided.       Second, the public assistance grants are not an isolated      initiative designed to aid religion--it is but one part of a      much larger legislative effort to assist a disaster stricken      region with its recovery. In this critical way, it is quite      distinguishable from the targeted aid programs considered in      the Tilton and Nyquist cases.       Third, the aid to houses of worship is within the context      of the Stafford Act's broader provision of aid to nonprofit      entities. In this respect, inclusion of houses of worship is      consistent with many existing and past examples of inclusion      of religious institutions in broader infrastructure      improvement and federal aid programs. Notable examples of      such programs include:       i) the Interior Department's ``Save America's Treasures''      program provides grants for the repair and maintenance of      historically significant properties, which have included the      Boston's Old North Church and Newport's Touro Synagogue;       ii) FEMA awards disaster relief grants to repair facilities      under the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5206, damaged in      natural disasters to religious institutions including, for      example, a Seattle parochial school;       iii) following the Oklahoma City bombing, Congress      authorized FEMA and other federal agencies to provide      disaster relief funds to houses of worship on the same basis      as all other nonprofit facilities;       iv) the California Missions Preservation Act, P.L. 108-420      (Nov. 30, 2004), authorizes federal grants for restoring      colonial era missions in California, many of which are still      used for religious worship;       v) Congress has overwhelmingly authorized grants for      security upgrades for nonprofits, including houses of      worship, under the Department of Homeland Security's UASI      program;       and many other examples abound.       Therefore, a federal disaster relief program which includes      houses of worship among its eligible grantees cannot be      materially distinguished from other aid programs that      are constitutional under longstanding precedents      establishing that religious institutions are fully      entitled to receive widely available government benefits      and services.  B. Disaster Relief and Repair Grants Are ``General Gov't Services''       It is highly significant that eligibility for FEMA's public      assistance grants extends to a broad class of beneficiaries,      defined without reference to religion and including both      public and private institutions. Ever since 1947, the year of      its decision in Everson, the Supreme Court has indicated that      religious institutions are entitled to receive ``general      government services'' made available on the basis of neutral      criteria. 330 U.S. at 17. Everson held that the Establishment      Clause does not bar students attending religious schools from      receiving generally available school busing services provided      by the government. In reaching its decision, the Court      explained that even if the evenhanded provision of busing      services increased the likelihood that some parents would      send their children to religious schools, the same could be      said of other ``general state law benefits'' that were even      more clearly constitutional because they were equally      available to all citizens and far removed from the religious      function of the school. Id. at 16. As examples, the Court      cited ``such general government services as ordinary police      and fire protection, connections for sewage disposal, public      highways and sidewalks,'' concluding:       ``cutting off church schools from these services, so      separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious      function, would make it far more difficult for the schools to      operate. But such is obviously not the purpose of the First      Amendment. That Amendment requires the state to be a neutral      in its relations with groups of religious believers and non-     believers; it does not require the state to be their      adversary. State power is no more to be used so as to      handicap religions, than it is to favor them.''     Id. at 17-18. See also id. at 16 (``[The state] cannot      exclude individual Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans,      Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers, Presbyterians, or      the members of any other faith, because of their faith, or      lack of it, from receiving the benefits of public welfare      legislation. . . . [W]e must be careful, in protecting the      citizens of New Jersey against state-established churches, to      be sure that we do not inadvertently prohibit New Jersey from      extending its general state law benefits to all its citizens      without regard to their religious belief.'').       Federal disaster aid is analogous to aid that qualifies as      ``general government services'' approved by the Court in      Everson.       As the Supreme Court explained in Widmar v. Vincent, 454      U.S. 263, 274 (1981), ``[t]he provision of benefits to so      broad a spectrum of groups is an important index of secular      effect.'' Accord Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist.,      509 U.S. 1, 8 (1993) (``we have consistently held that      government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a      broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion      are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause      challenge''); Board of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Village Sch.      Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687, 704 (1994) (``we have      frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of      any benefit provided religious groups or individuals in      turning aside Establishment Clause challenges''). Thus, the      aid here is closely analogous to the provision of ``general''      government aid like that sanctioned by the Court in Everson.      See also Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, Pub. L. No.      104-155, 110 Stat. 1392     (creating a program that provides low-income reconstruction      loans to nonprofit organizations, including churches,      destroyed by arson motivated by racial or religious animus).      As Justice Brennan expressed the point in Texas Monthly:      ``Insofar as [a] subsidy is conferred upon a wide array of      nonsectarian groups as well as religious organizations in      pursuit of some legitimate secular end, the fact that      religious groups benefit incidentally does not deprive the      subsidy of the secular purpose and primary effect mandated by      the Establishment Clause.'' 489 U.S. at 14-15 (plurality      opinion) (footnote omitted).       When viewed in the context of disaster response, Walz v.      Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664 (1970), strongly supports this      conclusion. There the Court rejected an Establishment Clause      challenge to a property tax exemption made available not only      to churches, but to several other classes of nonprofit      institutions, such as ``hospitals, libraries, playgrounds,      scientific, professional, historical, and patriotic groups.''      Id. at 673; see also id. at 667 n.1. In upholding the tax      exemption, the Court relied in part upon its breadth: the      exemption did ``not single[] out one particular church or      religious group or even churches as such,'' but rather was      available to ``a broad class of property owned by nonprofit,      quasi-public corporations.'' Id. at 673. As the Court stated      in reference to Everson, if ``buses can be provided to carry      and policemen to protect church school pupils, we fail to see      how a broader range of police and fire protection given      equally to all churches, along with nonprofit hospitals, art      galleries, and libraries receiving the same tax exemption, is      different for purposes of the Religion Clauses.'' Id. at 671.      Thus, just as a broad category of beneficiary institutions      was sufficient to sustain the inclusion of religious      institutions in the tax benefit in Walz--which, after all,      substantially benefitted churches' property--the breadth of      programs funded in the Stafford Act weighs heavily in favor      of the constitutionality of including houses of worship.            C. No Risk of Perceived Endorsement of Religion       No reasonable observer would perceive an endorsement of      religion in the government's evenhanded provision of funds to      repair a house of worship damaged in a natural disaster such      as Hurricane Sandy. See Mitchell, 530 U.S. at 842-44      (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). While it is true that      in a narrower direct aid program one could argue that if a      school ``uses the aid to inculcate religion in its students,      it is reasonable to say that the government has communicated      a message of endorsement,'' Id. at 843, that is not the case      in the context of this broader disaster relief effort. A      presumption of governmental endorsement is not present where      the aid is provided to a wide array of public and private      entities for the sake of recovery from a disaster and where      the government is indifferent to the religious or secular      orientation of the facility's function. Moreover, we think a      reasonable observer--one informed about the purpose, history,      and breadth of the program, see Zelman, 536 U.S. at 655--     would understand that the federal government is not paying      for religious activity; it is paying to help devastated      communities recover. That is not an endorsement of religion.                  D. Distinct from Tilton and Nyquist       Opponents will contend that the Supreme Court's decisions      in Tilton and Nyquist, which involved construction and      maintenance aid to religious schools, should be read to      support the conclusion that FEMA aid to houses of worship      violates the Establishment Clause. We disagree.       In Tilton, the Court sustained the provision of federal      construction grants to religious colleges insofar as the      program at issue barred aid to facilities ``used for      sectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship,''      but invalidated such grants insofar as the program permitted      funding the construction of buildings that might someday be      used for such activities. See 403 U.S. at 675, 683 (plurality      opinion) (citations omitted). The Court concluded that a 20-     year limitation on the statutory prohibition on the use of      buildings for religious activities was insufficient because      ``[i]f, at the end of 20 years, the building is, for example,      converted into a chapel or otherwise used to promote      religious interests, the original federal grant will in part      have the effect of advancing religion.'' Id. The Court      therefore held that the religious use restriction had to run      indefinitely. Id.       Similarly, Nyquist involved a program that provided      maintenance and repair grants to religious elementary and      secondary schools. The grants at issue were limited to 50      percent of the amount spent for comparable expenses in the      public schools, but the Court invalidated the program. ``No      attempt [was] made to restrict payments to those expenditures      related to the upkeep of facilities used exclusively for      secular purposes,'' the Court stated, and the 50 percent      restriction would not necessarily prevent rehabilitation of      entire religious schools. 413 U.S. at 774. The Court thus      concluded that such aid would have the effect of advancing      religion, in violation of Lemon's second prong. Id.       These holdings have been severely undermined and limited.      See Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, 856-57 (2000) (O'Connor,      J., concurring in judgment).       A broad reading and application of Tilton and Nyquist does      not apply here for several reasons. First, Tilton and Nyquist      are in considerable tension with a more recent line of cases      holding that the Free Speech Clause does not permit the      government to deny religious groups equal access to the      government's own property, even where such groups seek to use      the property ``for purposes of religious worship or religious      teaching.'' Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 265 (1981). See      Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Sch. Dist., 508 U.S. 384,      394 (1993); Capital Square Rev. & Advisory Bd. v. Pinette,      515 U.S. 753 (1995); Good News Club v. Milford Central Sch.,      533 U.S. 98 (2001); see also Westside Community Bd. of Educ.      v. Metgens, 496 U.S. 226 (1990). Providing religious groups      with access to property is a form of direct aid, and allowing      such groups to conduct worship services plainly ``advances''      their religious mission. The Court, however, has consistently      refused to permit (let alone require) state officials to deny      churches equal access to public school property on the      basis of these officials' argument ``that to permit its      property to be used for religious purposes would be an      establishment of religion.'' Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S. at      394.       The Supreme Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence has      greatly evolved since the Court's decisions in Tilton and      Nyquist were rendered, and many of the legal principles that      supported those decisions have been discarded. In 1985, for      example, the Court struck down programs under which the      government provided religious and other schools with teachers      who offered remedial instruction to disadvantaged children.      See Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U.S. 402 (1985); School Dist. of      Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373 (1985). The Court reasoned      that teachers in the program might ``become involved in      intentionally or inadvertently inculcating particular      religious tenets or beliefs.'' Ball, 473 U.S. at 385. In      Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 223 (1997), however, the      Court overruled Aguilar and substantial portions of Ball,      explaining that the Court had abandoned the presumption that      placing public employees in religious schools ``inevitably      results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored      indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between      government and religion.'' Similarly, in the 1970s the Court      held that the state could not provide any ``substantial aid      to the educational function of [religious] schools''      reasoning that such aid ``necessarily results in aid to the      sectarian school enterprise as a whole.'' Meek v. Pittenger,      421 U.S. 349, 366 (1975); accord Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S.      229, 250 (1977). In Agostini and Mitchell, however, the Court      expressly abandoned that view, overruling Meek and Wolman.      See Agostini, 521 U.S. at 225; Mitchell, 530 U.S. at 808,      835-36 (plurality opinion); id. at 837, 851 (O'Connor, J.,      concurring in judgment). In addition, other portions of      Nyquist have been substantially narrowed or overruled. As the      Court stated in Zelman, ``[t]o the extent the scope of      Nyquist has remained an open question in light of these later      decisions, we now hold that Nyquist does not govern neutral      educational assistance programs that, like the program here,      offer aid directly to a broad class of individual recipients      defined without regard to religion.'' 536 U.S. at 662.       Perhaps more important, recent Supreme Court decisions have      brought the demise of the ``pervasively sectarian'' doctrine      that comprised the basis for numerous decisions from the      1970s, such as Tilton and Nyquist. As noted above, that      doctrine held that there are certain religious institutions      in which religion is so pervasive that no government aid may      be provided to them, because their performance of even      ``secular'' tasks will be infused with religious purpose.      That doctrine, however, no longer enjoys the support of a      majority of the Court. Four Justices expressly abandoned it      in Mitchell, see 530 U.S. at 825-29 (plurality opinion), and      Justice O'Connor's opinion in that case set forth reasoning      that is inconsistent with its underlying premises, see id. at      857-58 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment, joined by      Breyer, J.) (requiring proof of actual diversion of public      support to religious uses to invalidate direct aid to schools      and explaining that ``presumptions of religious      indoctrination are normally inappropriate when evaluating      neutral school-aid programs under the Establishment      Clause''). See also Columbia Union College v. Oliver, 254      F.3d 496, 502-04 (4th Cir. 2001) (explaining that the      pervasively sectarian test is no longer valid in light of the      holdings of six Justices in Mitchell). Justice O'Connor      rejected the view that aid provided to religious primary and      secondary schools will invariably advance the schools'      religious purposes, and that view is the foundation of the      pervasively sectarian doctrine.       Such was the reasoning and conclusion reached by a federal      district court in a current case highly analogous to the FEMA      aid program--American Atheists Inc. v. City of Detroit DDA,      503 F.Supp.2d 845 (2007). There, plaintiffs challenged      Detroit's ``Facade Improvement Plan'' under which the city      provided funds to buildings in a particular section of      downtown in order to improve their appearance for the      Superbowl which was to be held in the city. Three churches      received such grants and this was challenged in the lawsuit.      The federal court concluded that the program was available to      a broad array of buildings and its grant criteria were      religion neutral and the FIP was thus constitutional.       For all of these reasons, Tilton and Nyquist do not control      the question at issue in the case of FEMA's public assistance      aid to private nonprofit facilities, including houses of      worship.E. Singling Out Faith-Related Entities for Exclusion Runs Counter to a              Proper Application of the Establishment Clause       In recent years, Justice Breyer has insightfully invoked      the balanced and practical approach to the Establishment      Clause previously championed by Justices Goldberg and Harlan.      In Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005), Justice Breyer      wrote that ``the Court has found no single mechanical formula      that can accurately draw the constitutional line in every      case. See School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374      U.S., at 306 (1963) (concurring opinion). Where the      Establishment Clause is at issue, tests designed to measure      ``neutrality'' alone are insufficient, both because it is      sometimes difficult to determine when a legal rule is      ``neutral,'' and because ``untutored devotion to the concept      of neutrality can lead to invocation or approval of results      which partake not simply of that noninterference and      noninvolvement with the religious which the Constitution      commands, but of a brooding and pervasive devotion to the      secular and a passive, or even active, hostility to the      religious.'' Ibid. In proceeding to rule that a display of      the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the State of Texas'      capitol was acceptable, Justice Breyer argued that, in so      many of these cases, context matters. Thus, ``to reach a      contrary conclusion here [and declare the display to violate      the Establishment Clause], based primarily upon on the      religious nature of the tablets' text would, I fear, lead the      law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place      in our Establishment Clause traditions.''       If we apply Justice Breyer's principled pragmatism to the      issue at hand, if Congress and the President decide to      appropriate billions of dollars to help private nonprofits      rebuild after a natural disaster, but also determine to      deliberately exclude houses of worship when they otherwise      meet the relevant criteria, such a decision would be the very      exhibition of hostility toward religion that the Justices      have inveighed against pursuing in the name of the      Establishment Clause.       In the wake of Hurricane Sandy and every major disaster      within recent memory--churches, synagogues and other houses      of worship have been essential in a community's recovery and      response effort. Even while the church may have its HVAC      system destroyed it will welcome the homeless. Even while the      synagogue may have been flooded, it will feed the hungry.       Basic fairness and principles of nondiscrimination, let      alone compassion, should compel Congress and the Executive      Branch to change policy and declare houses of worship      eligible for disaster relief assistance administered by FEMA.                                  ____         United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Ad Hoc            Committee for Religious Liberty,                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2013.

Dear Representative Smith: As the House of Representatives      prepares to consider H.R. 592, the Federal Disaster      Assistance Act, we write in support of the legislation, which      would ensure the fair and equal treatment for houses of      worship damaged in a natural disaster.       Your legislation is consistent with Supreme Court      jurisprudence, which recognizes the right of religious      institutions to receive public financial aid in the context      of a broad program administered on the basis of religion-     neutral criteria. The bill is not asking for special      treatment, just equal treatment that conforms to      constitutional protections.       It should be noted that in the aftermath of a natural      disaster houses of worship often play an irreplaceable role      in the recovery of a community. Discrimination that treats      houses of worship as ineligible for federal assistance in the      wake of a natural disaster, beyond being a legal violation,      hurts the very communities most affected by the      indiscriminate force of nature.       The best approach to address questions of eligibility for      houses of worship is a permanent clarification of federal      law. For this reason we support your bill and ask that it be      adopted by Congress.           Sincerely,     Most Reverend William E. Lori,       Archibishop of Baltimore, Chairman, USCCB Ad Hoc Committee      for Religious Liberty.     Most Reverend Denis J. Madden,       Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore, Chairman, USCCB Committee      for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.                                  ____         Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America,            Institute for Public Affairs,       Dear Representatives Smith and Meng: We write to express      our strong support for the Federal Disaster Assistance      Nonprofit Fairness Act of 2013. Your legislation will ensure      the fair and equal treatment for houses of worship damaged in      Hurricane Sandy and future natural disasters.       The Stafford Act provides that private nonprofit entities--     such as schools, hospitals, museums and community centers--     damaged in a natural disaster may receive financial grants      from FEMA to repair their buildings. The Act does not list      houses of worship among its list of examples of nonprofits so      eligible; neither does the Act exclude houses of worship in      any way.       In the aftermath of Sandy, as with so many other natural      disasters, churches, synagogues and other houses of worship      have been places offering essential response services to      people in need--even while the church or synagogue itself is      damaged.       It is, therefore, entirely appropriate for FEMA's aid      program for private nonprofits to assist houses of worship      with their rebuilding needs. Moreover, if houses of warship      are excluded from this otherwise religion neutral program--     that unfair treatment would be improper anti-religious      discrimination.       Current Supreme Court jurisprudence makes clear that      religious institutions may receive government financial aid      in the context of a broad program administered on the basis      of religion neutral criteria. This is why houses of worship      and other religious nonprofits can, for example, currently      receive grants from DHS to improve their security and the      Interior Department for historic preservation.       Your legislation clarifying the Stafford Act is consistent      with these precedents and policies and we urge the House of      Representatives to pass this measure as soon as possible.           Thank you,     Yehuda Neuberger.

Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Smith: The N.J. State Association of      Jewish Federations and its eleven constituent federations and      their network of affiliated and beneficiary agencies are      pleased to acknowledge your leadership in introducing H.R.      592, the Federal Disaster Assistance Nonprofit Fairness Act.      We support the legislation which would authorize those houses      of worship impacted and devastated by Hurricane Sandy to      receive assistance through the recently enacted Sandy relief      funding.       Our houses of worship, as with other faith based      institutions, play a crucial role every day providing      stability, comfort and serving as a community resource. With      the hurricane's impact still very much in evidence for our      state, we have needed houses of worship more than ever to      ease the path of recovery for community and each of their      individual members. Even though the church, mosque, temple or      synagogue may have been physically damaged, houses of worship      continue to provide essential response services to people in      need.       Jewish Federations in those areas that suffered most from      Sandy's might assisted their synagogues and congregants to      overcome the immediate crisis through financial aid, respite      and relief while securing dozens of volunteers to help      rebuild damaged buildings in the greater local community. The      Jewish Federation of Monmouth County, as one of the      communities hardest hit by the hurricane, the relief funding      provided by it and its partner Federations in the state have      enabled Monmouth to meet a wide array of human service needs      in the county. Their approach has been strategic, identifying      both short-term and long-term needs and dislocations      following the storm, empowering our partners in their efforts      to respond, and connecting those who could most benefit to      these resources. Most importantly, the Federation has been      proactive in spreading word throughout Monmouth County that      the Jewish community is here to help in storm recovery      efforts.       Jewish Family and Children Service organizations replaced      lost clothing, provided gift cards for food, counseled Sandy      victims easing their anxiety and emotional pain and made      available flexible repayment loans to help families and      businesses recover. The Jewish Federation of Greater Metro      West has provided $50,000 to JFS agencies to assist with the      medium and long term needs. Chabad of Hoboken received $5,000      for counseling assistance, while federation is also      developing a partnership with Union Beach, a community      outside their catchment area and will provide $10,000 toward      relief efforts there.       Many of our synagogues suffered severe damage and lack the      resources to rebuild. Jewish Federations, while helping      houses of worship serve individuals in need, do not have the      resources to support capital needs. Assistance from the      Jewish Federation of Monmouth County helped ``Chabad of the      Shore'' roof and carpet repaid, as well as providing plywood      to cover vulnerable windows. Temple Shalom in Aberdeen had      roof damage which was repaired through Federation assistance.      There were a number of other similar actions of relief      provided by the Monmouth federation.       This is not only the Jewish community experience, but one      shared with houses of worship of all religions. It is      entirely appropriate for FEMA's aid program for private      nonprofits to assist houses of worship with     their rebuilding and community outreach needs.       For all the reasons stated, herein, the passage of H.R. 592      will bring equity in a time of crisis and will recognize the      unselfish sacrifices made by our houses of worship in      response to an event that left devastation in its wake and      tragic consequences for its victims. Accordingly, the NJ      State Association of Jewish Federations is pleased to support      the enactment of the Federal Disaster Assistance Nonprofit      Fairness Act.           Sincerely,     Ruth Cole,       President.     Jacob Toporek,       Executive Director.                                  ____                                           Diocese of Trenton,                                   Trenton, NJ, February 11, 2013.     Hon. Chris Smith,     Rayburn House Office Building, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Smith: I understand that you will soon be      presenting a bill to Congress which would provide federal      funding in the form of grants to houses of worship which were      devastated by the hurricane last October.       I applaud your efforts and offer my full support for this      bill. Volunteers from the Catholic churches as well as other      denominations were on the front line with food, clothing,      shelter and other basic necessities as soon as the storm      passed. They were surely the first responders and just as      surely will be there as long as they are needed. To exclude      houses of worship from which these volunteers have come is a      grave injustice.       On behalf of the clergy, religious and lay people who live      and work within the Diocese of Trenton, I thank you for being      our advocate and for taking the initiative to introduce this      bill on behalf of all faith communities.           Sincerely,                                        Most Reverend David M.

Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     Rayburn House Office Building, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Smith: As the House of Representatives      prepares to consider H.R. 592, the Federal Disaster      Assistance Nonprofit Fairness Act, we write in support of the      important legislation that you have introduced. Thank you for      your effort to ensure the fair and equal treatment for houses      of worship in the aftermath of this devastating natural      disaster.       It is universally acknowledged that houses of worship play      a central role in the recovery of a community in the      aftermath of any natural disaster. Faith-based volunteers are      the first responders providing aid and comfort to those who      have lost so much, and they persevere with their efforts as      long as help is needed. To exclude the houses of worship from      where these volunteers have come from government assistance      would be a grave injustice.       Discrimination that treats houses of worship as ineligible      for federal assistance in the wake of a natural disaster,      beyond being a legal violation, hurts the very communities      most affected by the devastating storm.       We strongly feel that you have identified the best approach      to address recurring questions of eligibility for houses of      worship by proposing a permanent clarification of federal      law. We therefore strongly support your bill and ask that it      be adopted by Congress.       With much appreciation for your efforts,                                             Rabbi Samuel Tendler,     Congregation Sons of Israel.                                  ____                                              National Association                                              of Evangelicals,                                                February 12, 2013.     Hon. Chris Smith,     Hon. Grace Meng,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representatives Smith and Meng: Thank you for your      efforts to correct a misguided policy of the Federal      Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that currently bars houses      of worship from receiving federal disaster assistance for      rebuilding damaged structures. Your work to insure that      government assists private nonprofit entities, including      houses of worship, in an evenhanded way is very much      appreciated.       In any major natural disaster, churches, synagogues and      other houses of worship play indispensable roles in providing      comfort and relief to those who have experienced loss. They      bring food, water, clothing and other essential supplies to      those who are stranded or displaced. They care for the      wounded and comfort the bereaved. Our communities are      stronger because they are there.       When the houses of worship themselves have been damaged,      the effects are often felt far beyond the membership. When an      important part of the community infrastructure is damaged,      the entire community suffers. Many times, churches continue      serving their communities even after their own buildings have      been destroyed.       FEMA does not violate the establishment clause when it      administers a religion-neutral program of support for the      rebuilding of community infrastructure. In fact, if religious      organizations are specifically excluded when comparable      secular organizations are included, the government's practice      would be discriminatory. This is the clear conclusion of      Supreme Court jurisprudence, and is consistent with current      federal practice in the Department of Homeland Security and      the Interior Department.       Thank you for your leadership in working to restore      fairness to FEMA disaster assistance.           Sincerely,                                                      Galen Carey,     Vice President, Government Relations.                                  ____                                      Bais Kaila Torah Preparatory                                        High School for Girls,                                  Lakewood, NJ, February 12, 2013.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     Rayburn House Office Building, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Smith: I hope that all is well with you      and your family. With your introduction of H.R. 592, the      Federal Disaster Assistance Nonprofit Fairness Act, we see      that you are again taking the initiative to do what is right,      especially considering that houses of worship are always at      the forefront of the recovery process when communities are      hit with natural disasters. It is therefore very appropriate      that they be able to participate on an equal footing with      other nonprofits in receiving federal aid, as a means of      helping damaged communities get back on their feet.       As I understand it, the Federal Emergency Management Agency      is charged with ensuring that communities are prepared for      natural disasters, and then responding to facilitate recovery      in the wake of such disasters. FEMA has historically provided      disaster-related aide to parochial schools damaged by      earthquakes. Other examples of federal aid to houses of      worship, includes grants for security improvements from the      U.S. Department of Homeland Security and historic      preservation grants from the U.S. Department of the Interior.      Your legislation, H.R. 592, would simply ensure that the      Stafford Act is consistent with these policies.       In conclusion, once again we thank you for your leadership      and advocacy and we look forward to seeing the passage of      H.R. 592.           Sincerely yours,                                      Rabbi Yisroel Schenkolewski,     Dean.                                  ____                                            The Jewish Federations                                             of North America,                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2013.     Hon. John A. Boehner,     Speaker of the House of Representatives, Capitol Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     House Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Capitol          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi: The Jewish      Federations of North America (JFNA) is writing to express our      support for H.R. 592, the Federal Disaster Assistance      Nonprofit Fairness Act. This bill, scheduled to be on the      suspension calendar this coming Wednesday, February 13, 2013      and co-sponsored by Representatives Chris Smith (R-NJ) and      Grace Meng (D-NY), will ensure the fair and equal treatment      for houses of worship damaged in Hurricane Sandy.       JFNA is the national organization that represents and      serves 154 Jewish Federations and 300 independent Jewish      communities across North America. In their communities,      Jewish Federations and volunteers in the central address for      fundraising and an extensive network of Jewish health,      education and social services. In response to Hurricane Sandy      Jewish Federations have raised almost $7 million in direct      Sandy-related relief and allocated almost $11 million to      Sandy victims in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.       The Stafford Act provides that private nonprofit entities--     such as schools, hospitals and community centers--damaged in      a natural disaster may receive financial grants from FEMA to      repair their buildings. The Act does not list houses of      worship among its list of examples of nonprofits so eligible;      neither does the Act exclude houses of worship. To the extent      that FEMA has provided aid to eligible programs run by houses      of worship, the aid has not been provided on the same terms      as the aid provided to other eligible nonprofits.       In the aftermath of Sandy, as with so many other natural      disasters, churches, synagogues and other houses of worship      are locations where essential response services have been      provided to people in need--even while the church or      synagogue itself has suffered extensive damage. It is,      therefore, entirely appropriate for FEMA's aid program for      private nonprofits to assist houses of worship with their      rebuilding needs. Moreover, if houses of worship are excluded      from this otherwise religion neutral program--that unfair      treatment would be improper anti-religious discrimination.      Additionally, for almost 30 years, it has been FEMA's mission      to lead America to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and      recover from domestic disasters. This has led to FEMA's      provision of disaster-related aide to parochial schools      damaged by earthquakes.       Current Supreme Court jurisprudence makes clear that      religious in receive government financial aid in the context      of a broad program administered on the basis of religion      neutral criteria. This is why houses of worship and other      religious nonprofits can, and do, currently receive grants      from DHS to improve their security and the Interior      Department for historic preservation.       H.R. 592, the Federal Disaster Assistance Nonprofit      Fairness Act, would ensure that the Stafford Act is      consistent with these     policies, and we ask that you vote in favor of this      legislation.           Sincerely yours,                                            William C. Daroff,                                Vice President for Public Policy &     Director of the Washington office.                                  ____                                                   The Becket Fund                                        For Religious Liberty.     Hon. Christopher Smith,     House of Representatives, 2373 Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Re FEMA's discriminatory treatment of houses of worship.       Dear Congressman Smith: You and others have asked us to      examine the application of the Establishment Clause of the      United States Constitution to the disbursement of federal      disaster relief funds to houses of worship damaged in severe      weather events such as Superstorm Sandy. In particular, you      would like us to examine (1) whether the Federal Emergency      Management Agency's practice of not funding repairs to houses      of worship is justified by the Establishment Clause grounds,      and (2) whether your proposed act preventing FEMA's practice      would give rise to Establishment Clause problems.       The answer to both questions is no. First, not only does      the Establishment Clause provide no support for FEMA's      practice of discriminating against houses of worship; that      practice itself runs afoul of the First Amendment by      discriminating against religious institutions. Second, the      bill you have proposed will not lead to Establishment Clause      violations because no Act of Congress can purport to repeal      the First Amendment. Arguments to the contrary are      constitutional scaremongering.                               Background       Superstorm Sandy devastated many of the Northeast's coastal      cities. The federal government is expected to spend about $60      billion to help restore these hard-hit communities. Yet FEMA      has categorically denied foundational elements of those      communities--synagogues, churches, mosques, and other houses      of worship--access to this otherwise generally-available      relief funding. A broad range of nonprofit organizations,      including zoos and museums, qualify for disaster-relief      grants administered by FEMA. But when religious organizations      asked FEMA for the same assistance it provides many other      nonprofits, FEMA told them that it considered them ineligible      for the grants. This leaves houses of worship like All Saints      Church of Bay Head, New Jersey, which was built by      shipbuilders in 1889 and now has a sinkhole for a sanctuary,      without access to the help that is available to the      neighborhood zoo.       Despite acknowledging that religious facilities can meet      the threshold aid requirement that the facility be ``used for      a variety of community activities,'' FEMA considers      ``churches, synagogues, temples, mosques, and other centers      of religious worship'' categorically ineligible simply      because of their religious use. Nor is this a recent problem:      the George W. Bush Administration took the same stance after      Hurricane Katrina, based on a federal regulation promulgated      in 1990 by the George H.W. Bush Administration. (As noted      below, though, the federal government has often departed from      this stance to assist houses of worship through neutral and      generally available funding programs.)                                Analysis       FEMA's discriminatory policy. To justify its discrimination      against houses of worship, FEMA has cited arguments asserting      that the Establishment Clause of the United States      Constitution prevents houses of worship from having equal      access to FEMA disaster assistance grants. Others make the      same claim. For instance, Barry Lynn of Americans United for      Separation of Church and State has stated that, ``even after      the devastation of [Superstorm] Sandy,'' the federal      government cannot provide relief to destroyed synagogues,      churches, and mosques.       But this argument is simply not true. When Lynn recently      made a similar argument in an amicus brief to the U.S. Court      of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the court--in an opinion      authored by Judge Sutton--flatly and unanimously rejected the      argument. The court noted that long-standing Supreme Court      precedent allowed ``churches, synagogues, and mosques'' to      receive ``generally available benefits'' like ``police and      fire-protection services'' and access to ``sewers and      sidewalks.'' The court reasoned that ``[i]f a city may save      the exterior of a church from a fire,'' it could certainly      provide equal access to government funds that ``help that      same church with peeling paint.''       That conclusion is all the more true here, where the      problem the government seeks to remedy is not peeling paint      but complete devastation. Notably, the Sixth Circuit      supported its conclusion by explicitly noting the widespread      legal acceptance ``of government programs designed to provide      one-time emergency assistance through FEMA . . . to churches      devastated by natural disasters.''       Indeed, the federal government--including FEMA--has      repeatedly given disaster relief to religious groups in the      past. For instance, after Seattle Hebrew Academy was damaged      by a major earthquake in 2002, FEMA awarded a disaster relief      grant for repair. Before it did so, FEMA asked the Department      of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel whether that was      constitutionally permissible. OLC's detailed response      concluded that ``a FEMA disaster grant is analogous to the      sort of aid that qualifies as `general government services'      approved by the [Supreme] Court'' for provision to houses of      worship. The OLC letter pointed out that, far from banning      equal access to government funding, the First Amendment bans      the government from ``deny[ing] religious groups equal access      to the government's own property,'' and ``require[s] equal      funding'' of religious expression. The letter ended by noting      that an argument could be made that ``excluding religious      organizations from disaster assistance made available to      similarly situated secular institutions would violate the      Free Exercise Clause and the Free Speech Clause.''       OLC has likewise approved, and the federal government has      permitted, the participation of houses of worship in the Save      America's Treasures program, which authorizes matching grants      for preservation of properties with historical significance.      For instance, the OLC approved a National Park Service      grant to restore Boston's Old North Church--a church which      is currently used by an active Episcopal congregation and      was once used to warn Paul Revere of British military      plans. Similar grants have been provided for Atlanta's      Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King, Jr.,      preached, the historic Franciscan missions in California,      and Touro Synagogue in Rhode Island. All of those houses      of worship needed repairs for damage caused by the ravages      of time--why would damage caused by the ravages of Sandy      be any different?       Several other federal statutes permit federal funding or      support for houses of worship that have been damaged or      destroyed. Indeed, after the Oklahoma City bombing, Congress      specifically authorized FEMA and other agencies to provide      disaster relief to damaged churches on the same basis that      any other private nonprofit facilities may receive such aid.       Finally, FEMA's policy of discriminating against houses of      worship is itself problematic under the Establishment Clause      because it denies religious institutions access to a      generally available benefit, solely because they are      religious. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that ``[t]he      First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between      religion and nonreligion.'' Singling out religious      institutions for special disfavor is not neutral. Similarly,      FEMA's approach also creates a potential conflict with      federal civil rights law, specifically the Religious Freedom      Restoration Act, which forbids government imposition of      substantial burdens on religious exercise. As courts have      frequently held, denial of a generally available benefit to      religious persons because they are religious constitutes a      substantial burden on the exercise of religion.       In short, FEMA is wrong to claim that the Establishment      Clause--which combats discrimination--justifies its decision      to discriminate. It is instead FEMA's discrimination policy      that is more likely to trigger scrutiny under the First      Amendment and related civil rights laws.       The proposed bill. For the same reasons, it is our opinion      that your proposed bill will not raise Establishment Clause      problems. Instead, it will alleviate them by offering a way      to stop discrimination against houses of worship in federal      disaster relief funding.       On the night before your bill was set for a vote, FEMA      issued a statement in opposition to the bill. As an initial      matter, much of FEMA's three-page statement does nothing more      than lay out existing law and reiterate what we've      established above: Congress has made similar regulatory fixes      before and the OLC has provided legal opinions supporting      religious organizations' equal access to generally available      government funds.       FEMA really makes only two complaints against the proposed      bill. First, it warns that entities like the ACLU have      threatened to sue unless it keeps discriminating against      religious organizations. But, as explained above, such      threats are meritless and will be met in court by the Becket      Fund and other organizations that are happy to defend equal      access for houses of worship that have been devastated by      natural disasters. Further, it is imprudent to allow such      threats to take federal legislation hostage, as giving in to      them will only encourage future threats. Finally, concerns      about litigation might make some sense if FEMA were run by a      tiny village government with a small budget that might be      intimidated by the prospect of litigating against the ACLU.      But given the resources of the Department of Justice, this      argument from fear of litigation makes no sense.       FEMA's second complaint is that the bill could require them      to choose whether to fund ``arks of the covenant [and] prayer      books.'' But, as a factual matter, it appears FEMA is trying      to manufacture this particular controversy in order to scare      legislators. As Rabbi David Bauman of Temple Israel in Long      Beach--which was flooded by up to 14 feet of storm-surge      saltwater--explained, no one is asking the government to      restore prayer books; they need help with basic structural      repairs, just like other buildings in the neighborhood. More      importantly, the bill cannot repeal the Establishment Clause:      FEMA will remain bound by the Constitution. Thus to the      extent a religious organization requests funds that would      result in a constitutional violation, FEMA will still be      bound to turn them down. What the bill actually does is get      rid of the artificial and discriminatory standard created by      FEMA and replace it with the standard of neutrality required      under the First Amendment.       In addition, to the extent that there is any problem it is      one of FEMA's own making. As     it admits in its statement of opposition, it is FEMA's own      regulatory interpretations that would require it to pay for      prayer books or other similar items. But neither of the      regulations that FEMA cites as forcing it to make the      apparently unpalatable choice appear to require any such      decision. And FEMA can always exercise its interpretive power      to avoid a constitutional violation.       Again, no one is asking the government to buy prayer books      or Torahs. Instead, synagogues, churches, and mosques are      simply asking that they receive the same disaster relief as      many other private nonprofits. Doing anything less would not      live up to the neutrality required by the Establishment      Clause--it would express a blatant hostility to religion that      the Establishment Clause rejects.       In conclusion, it is our opinion that FEMA cannot rely on      the Establishment Clause to categorically ban houses of      worship from competing for disaster relief funds on the same      terms as other eligible nonprofits. Your proposed bill will      not violate the Constitution but will instead protect it.           Very truly yours,                                                 Eric C. Rassbach,                                                  Daniel Blomberg,                            The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.
