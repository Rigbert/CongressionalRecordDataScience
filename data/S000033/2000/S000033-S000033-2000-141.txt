 Speaker, today I would like to salute the citizens of Vermont who are celebrating the 30th anniversary of Green Up Day.  In the 1960s and 70s, Vermont was on the cutting edge in environmental sensitivity. As U.S. Senator George Aiken's remarks revealed in the May 5, 1971 Congressional Record:  ``Mr. President, several times recently, I have advised the Senate of things going on in Vermont which have lent and can lend encouragement and inspiration to the other States. I now have to report another event which could have far-reaching results. Last Saturday, May 1, a successful demonstration occurred in my State. This demonstration--called Green Up Day--was put on largely by our young people and extended into every community throughout the length and breadth of Vermont. About 75,000 people collected virtually every glass bottle, every metal can, every scrap of paper which had been cast onto the roadsides by careless and unthinking people. The result was that by Saturday evening, Vermont was undoubtedly the cleanest State in the Nation.''  Mr. Speaker, this May Day ritual continues to be an expression in the finest American tradition. People--young, old and in between--businessmen, farmers, workers, students, families, all working together to clean up the state. Vermont's clean up, the Vermont way, continues to inspire others, and it should serve as a model for dealing with litter nationwide.  Though all other states address litter with ``Adopt-A-Highway,'' and 21 states now designate a day for statewide cleaning, none matches Vermont's long-standing Green Up Day community tradition. I salute the citizens of Vermont for their commitment to the environment, to our state and to the tradition. Happy 30th anniversary Green Up Vermont.                          ____________________
