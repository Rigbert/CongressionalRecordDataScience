Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments.  If we get additional resources in the future, I would love to make sure that Fish and Wildlife has the resources to make sure they meet their mandates, and they should meet them now.  One of the mandates they have is review the status of every listed species every 5 years and a corresponding change in the status if it is called for by those reviews. Instead of doing those reviews, in many cases, the Service chooses to spend the money to list more species.  If the government isn't willing to shoulder the responsibilities that come with listing species under the ESA, perhaps it shouldn't be listing those species in the first place. So I think they need to meet their obligations under the law.  I certainly support this amendment, and I encourage Members to support the amendment and vote for it.
