All four nominees Edgardo Ramos and Andrew Carter, nominated to the Southern District of New York, James Rodney Gilstrap, nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Eastern District of Texas, and Dana Christensen, nominated to the District of Montana are superbly qualified nominees with the strong support of their home state Senators. It should not have taken three months or more for the Senate to vote on their nominations.  I thank the Majority Leader for securing a vote on these nominations, but I am disappointed that the Senate Republican leadership would not agree to a vote on the nomination of Jesse Furman to fill a third vacancy on the Southern District of New York. Like Edgardo Ramos, Andrew Carter and James Gilstrap, his nomination was reported by the Judiciary Committee on September 15 without opposition from a single member of the Committee, Democratic or Republican. Mr. Furman, an experienced Federal prosecutor who served as Counselor to Attorney General Michael Mukasey for two years during the Bush Administration, is a nominee with an impressive background and bipartisan support. There is no reason or explanation for why the Senate could not also consider his nomination today.  There is also no reason or explanation why Republican leadership will not consent to consider the other 20 judicial nominations waiting for final Senate action, all but four of which were reported by the Committee without any opposition, all but two of them with significant bipartisan support. Senator Grassley and I have worked together to ensure that each of the 25 nominations now on the Senate Calendar was fully considered by the Judiciary Committee after a thorough, fair process, including completing our extensive questionnaire and questioning at a hearing. Before each of these nominees was selected by the President, the White House worked with the nominees' home state Senators who support them, the FBI completed an extensive background review, and each nominee was peer reviewed by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. When the nominations have been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee after this extensive and thorough process, there is no reason for months and months of further delay before they can start serving the American people.  It is now December 5, with only weeks left in the Senate's 2011 session. I am concerned that we are not able to move more quickly at a time when we continue to hear from chief judges around the country about the overburdened courts in their districts and circuits. We need to consider at least eight judges every week in order to begin to catch up and erase the backlog that has developed from the delays in the consideration of consensus nominees caused by the Senate Republican leadership.  We should not repeat the mistakes of last year, when the Senate Republican leadership refused to consent to consider 19 judicial nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee, an exercise in unnecessary delay I believe to be without precedent with respect to such consensus nominees. It took us until June of this year, halfway into 2011, to consider and confirm 17 of these nominations that could and should have been considered before the end of 2010. Before we adjourn this year, there is certainly no reason the Senate cannot at least consider the 17 judicial nominations reported unanimously by the Committee this session, who are by any measure consensus nominees.  I hope that we do not see a repeat of the damaging decision by Senate Republican leadership at the end of last year to refuse to agree to votes on those nominations. That decision stood in stark contrast to the practice followed by the Democratic majority in the Senate during President Bush's first two years. Last year, Senate Republicans refused to use the same standards for considering President Obama's judicial nominees as we did when the Senate gave up or down votes to all 100 of President Bush's judicial nominations reported by the Committee in his first two years. All 100 were confirmed before the end of the 107th Congress, including two controversial circuit court nominations reported and then confirmed during the lame duck session in 2002. The Senate last year should not have been forced to adjourn with 19 judicial nominations still on the Senate calendar.  With vacancies continuing at harmfully high levels, we cannot afford to repeat these unnecessary and damaging delays. There is no reason we cannot make significant progress this month and consider all of the consensus nominations now pending on the Senate calendar. That is what we did at the end of President Reagan's third year in office and President George H.W. Bush's third year in office, when no judicial nominations were left pending on the Senate Calendar. That is what we did at the end of the 1995 session, President Clinton's third year in office, when only a single nomination was left pending on the Senate calendar. That is also what we did at the end of President George W. Bush's third year, when seven of the nine judicial nominations left on the calendar by the Senate's Republican majority were among President Bush's most extreme ideological picks and had previously been debated extensively by the Senate. The standard has been that noncontroversial judicial nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee get Senate action before the end of the year. That is the standard we should follow this year.  We remain well behind the pace set by the Senate during President Bush's first term. By the end of his first term, the Senate had confirmed 205 district and circuit nominees, and had already confirmed 167 by this point in his third year. So far, the Senate has confirmed only 119 of President Obama's district and circuit nominees. Senate action before adjournment on all 25 judicial nominations that are before the Senate today would go a long way to help resolve the longstanding judicial vacancies that are delaying justice for so many Americans in our Federal courts across the country.  The 100 circuit and district court nominations we confirmed in President Bush's first two years leading to a vacancy total of 60 at the beginning of his third year is almost a complete reverse of the 60 the Senate was allowed to confirm in President Obama's first two years, leading to nearly 100 vacancies at the start of 2011. Yet, even following those years of real progress, in 2003 weproceeded to confirm more judicial nominations than there were vacancies at the start of that year, and reduced vacancies even further, down to 5 percent, half of where they stand today.  Chief Justice Roberts, the Attorney General and the White House counsel have all spoken about the serious problems created by persistent judicial vacancies. More than half of all Americans over 167 million live in districts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled today if Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on the nominations now pending on the Senate calendar. As many as 23 states are served by Federal courts with vacancies that would be filled by these nominations. Millions of Americans across the country are harmed by delays in overburdened courts. The Republican leadership should consent to vote on the qualified, consensus candidates nominated to fill these extended judicial vacancies before we adjourn for the year and not unnecessarily delay their consideration until next spring.  The four nominees we consider today will all be confirmed, I expect, with significant bipartisan support. Edgardo Ramos is nominated to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Since 2002, Mr. Ramos has been in private practice after serving for ten years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York, where he was promoted to Deputy Chief of the Narcotics Section. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him ``well qualified'' to serve, its highest possible rating. The nomination of Mr. Ramos has the strong support of both his home state Senators, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand, and was reported by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote with no dissent on September 15.  The nomination of Judge Andrew Carter to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the Southern District of New York also has the strong support of the New York Senators and was also reported unanimously by voice vote on September 15. Since 2009, Judge Carter has been a Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of New York. Prior to joining the bench, Judge Carter served for 13 years as a public defender in New York state and Federal and spent two years at the Ford Foundation as a Program Assistant in its Rights and Social Justice Program.  James Rodney Gilstrap is nominated to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas determined by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to be a judicial emergency vacancy. His nomination has the support of both his Republican home state Senators, Senator Cornyn and Senator Hutchison. For 27 years Mr. Gilstrap has been a partner at the law firm of Smith & Gilstrap in Marshall, Texas. He has also served as a part-time County Judge for Harrison County, Texas. His nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote on September 15.  Dana Christensen is nominated to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the District of Montana. Mr. Christensen has spent his 34-year legal career in private practice and is currently the president of the law firm of Christensen, Moore, Cockrell, Cummings & Axelberg, P.C. in Kalispell, Montana. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. Christensen ``well qualified'' to serve, its highest possible rating. His nomination has the support of both his home state Senators, Senator Baucus and Senator Tester, and was reported by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote with no dissent on October 6.  I hope the Senate can build on today's progress to fulfill its constitutional duty and ensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around the country.                     Nomination of Caitlin Halligan  Tomorrow the Senate should be holding an up-or-down vote on the long-delayed nomination of Caitlin Halligan to fill one of three vacancies on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Instead, for the seventh time since President Obama took office 34 months ago, we are required to overcome a Republican filibuster for the Senate to consider one of President Obama's superbly qualified judicial nominees.  Ms. Halligan, President Obama's first nominee to the important D.C. Circuit, is the former Solicitor General for the State of New York. With an impressive record in private practice and public service, she is widely respected for the quality of her work as an advocate. Indeed, Ms. Halligan's nomination was greeted with bipartisan support and has since garnered endorsements from law enforcement officials and organizations, women's organizations, law school deans and professors, judges and preeminent lawyers from across the political spectrum. The Judiciary Committee favorably reported Ms. Halligan's nomination nearly nine months ago.  By any traditional standard, she is the kind of superbly qualified nominee who should easily have been confirmed by the Senate months ago with the support of both Republicans and Democrats. I am disappointed that yet again instead of seeing bipartisan cooperation we are required to seek cloture.  From the beginning of the Obama administration, we have seen some Senate Republicans shift significantly away from the standards they used to apply to the judicial nominations of a Republican President. During the administration of the last President, a Republican, Republican Senators insisted that filibusters of judicial nominees were unconstitutional. They threatened the ``nuclear option'' in 2005 to guarantee up-or-down votes for each of President Bush's judicial nominations. Senator McConnell, then the Republican whip, said: ``Any President's judicial nominees should receive careful consideration. But after that debate, they deserve a simple up-or-down vote. . . . It's time to move away from advise and obstruct and get back to advise and consent. The stakes are high. . . . The Constitution of the United States is at stake.''  Many Republican Senators declared that they would never support the filibuster of a judicial nomination--never. Yet, only a few years later, Senate Republicans reversed course and filibustered President Obama's very first judicial nomination, that of Judge David Hamilton of Indiana.  David Hamilton was a widely respected 15-year veteran of the Federal bench. President Obama nominated Judge Hamilton in March 2009, after consultation with the most senior and longest-serving Republican in the Senate, Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana, who strongly supported the nomination. Rather than welcome the nomination as an attempt by President Obama to step away from the ideological battles of the past, some Senate Republicans ignored Senator Lugar's support, caricatured Judge Hamilton's record and filibustered his nomination. After the Senate rejected that filibuster, Judge Hamilton was confirmed.  The partisan delays and opposition to President Obama's judicial nominations have continued since. Senate Republicans have required cloture motions to be filed on judicial nominations that ultimately won unanimous support from the Senate. Earlier this year they filibustered the nomination of Professor Goodwin Liu of California, who was supported by both his home state Senators to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Ninth Circuit. That successful filibuster of a brilliant lawyer and a good man prevented the Senate from having an up-or-down vote on his nomination and prevented an outstanding nominee from serving the American people on the Federal bench. They attempted to justify that filibuster on ideological grounds. There is no such justification here, in connection with the nomination of Caitlin Halligan who is a mainstream lawyer and public servant from New York. Senate Republican leadership took the virtually unprecedented step this year of requiring cloture to be filed on a district court nomination. That effort to ratchet up the judge wars was rejected when 11 Republican Senators joined to ensure an up-or-down vote on the nomination of Jack McConnell to the District of Rhode Island.  With their latest filibuster, the Senate Republican leadership seeks to set yet another new standard, one that threatens to make confirmation of any nominee to the D.C. Circuit virtually impossible for the future. Caitlin Halligan is well-qualified nominee with a mainstream record as a brilliant advocate on behalf of the State of New York and in private practice. I have reviewed her record carefully in the course the Judiciary Committee's thorough process, including her response to our extensive questionnaire and her answers to questions at her hearing andin writing following the hearing. In my view, there is no legitimate reason or justification for filibustering her nomination.  Caitlin Halligan is the kind of nominee who has demonstrated not only legal talent but also a dedication to the rule of law throughout her career. We should encourage nominees with the qualities of Ms. Halligan to engage in public service and we should welcome them on the Federal bench, not denigrate them. Concocted controversies and a blatant misreading of Ms. Halligan's record as an advocate are no reason to obstruct this outstanding nomination.  We must reject these misguided arguments. This filibuster against this qualified woman will set a standard that could not be met by judicial nominees of Presidents of either party. I trust that, as with the nomination of Jack McConnell, sensible Republican Senators will, again, join in preventing such an outcome. It is time to edge away from this dangerous precipice.  When Democratic Senators cooperated to confirm John Roberts to the D.C. Circuit in 2003, it broke the stalemate created by the Republicans refusal for years to even consider President Clinton's nominees to that Court. Like John Roberts, Caitlin Halligan is a highly regarded appellate advocate with the kind of impeccable credentials in both public service and private practice that make her unquestionably qualified to serve on the D.C. Circuit. She should be confirmed, not unjustifiably filibustered.  Ms. Halligan served for nearly six years as Solicitor General of New York and has been a leading appellate lawyer in private practice. She is currently General Counsel at the New York County District Attorney's Office, an office that investigates and prosecutes 100,000 criminal cases annually in Manhattan. Ms. Halligan has served as counsel of record in nearly 50 matters before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing five cases before that court and many cases before Federal and state appellate courts. Just as John Roberts had served in government and clerked for the Supreme Court, she clerked for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. She also clerked for Judge Patricia Wald on the D.C. Circuit, the court to which she has been nominated. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which Republican Senators often cite, unanimously rated Ms. Halligan ``Well-Qualified'' to serve on the D.C. Circuit. That is the highest rating that can be received from its non-partisan peer review.  The letters of support we have received for Ms. Halligan's nomination from a broad range of people and organizations is a testament both to her exceptional qualifications to serve and to the fact that this should be a consensus nomination, not a source of controversy and contention.  Twenty-one prominent appellate advocates from across the political spectrum who have worked with Caitlin Halligan, including Miguel Estrada and Carter Phillips, endorsed her nomination, writing:       ``We believe that Caitlin is an outstanding selection for      the D.C. Circuit. She is a first-rate lawyer and advocate.      She is well respected and highly regarded as a leader of the      profession. Caitlin has an ideal judicial temperament. She      brings reason, insight and judgment to all matters. Even      those of us who have been on the opposite sides of Caitlin in      litigation have been greatly impressed with her ability and      character. We have no doubt she would serve with distinction      and fairness.''  When Ms. Halligan was nominated, Carter Philips, a preeminent Supreme Court advocate who served as Assistant to the Solicitor General during the Reagan administration, described her as ``one of those extremely smart, thoughtful, measured and effective advocates'' and concluded that she ``will be a first-rate judge.'' Judge Albert Rosenblatt, who was appointed to serve on New York's highest court by former Republican Governor George Pataki, wrote in praise of Ms. Halligan's work as New York's Solicitor General, concluding that ``her sense of fairness and balance is among the best--if not the best--that I have ever seen in my 34 years as a judge and a prosecutor.'' This is not a nomination that should be filibustered. To do so will set a destructive standard that no one will be able to meet. If someone of Caitlin Halligan's outstanding credentials, character and experience cannot be confirmed, no one can be.  The nomination of Ms. Halligan has likewise received significant support from law enforcement officials and organizations. The National District Attorneys Association has called Caitlin Halligan's background ``impressive,'' stating that she ``would be an outstanding addition'' to the D.C. Circuit. District Attorneys from the State of New York, including Republicans Derek Champagne, Daniel Donovan, Jr., William Fitzpatrick, James Reams and Scott Burns, support her nomination, as do the New York Association of Chiefs of Police and the New York State Sheriff's Association. New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has said that Ms. Halligan has the ``three qualities important for a nominee: intelligence, a judicial temperament, and personal integrity.'' Legendary New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, endorsing her nomination in the ``strongest of terms,'' described Ms. Halligan as ``qualified in terms of intellect, ability and temperament.'' This is not someone to be filibustered and blocked from serving as a Federal judge.  More than 20 former United States Supreme Court clerks, including clerks who worked for conservative Justices such as former Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, wrote that they ``retain a distinct appreciation of Caitlin's sharp intelligence and her ability to cooperate with others in resolving difficult legal problems.'' They concluded their letter of support by praising her ``reasonableness and collegiality,'' and calling her a ``fair-minded colleague who was a pleasure to work with in a sophisticated and demanding legal setting.'' This is not a closed minded ideologue. Caitlin Halligan is an outstanding lawyer who will be an outstanding judge.  Ms. Halligan's nomination has received support from numerous women's law enforcement, business, and legal organizations, including the New York Women in Law Enforcement, the National Center for Women and Policing, the National Conference of Women's Bar Associations, and the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia. The U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce asked the Senate to confirm Ms. Halligan, describing her as ``exceptionally well-qualified'' with ``outstanding legal credentials and legal experience that is both broad and deep.'' The National Conference of Women's Bar Associations, which supports Ms. Halligan because her ``broad experience, public service and intellect make her well suited to the federal appellate bench,'' also notes that ``her appointment would add much needed diversity to the federal court, where only three women are among the active judges on the DC Circuit.'' More than 100 women who are deans and professors at top law schools throughout the country strongly support the nomination because ``Ms. Halligan has won accolades for her judgment, legal acumen, and expertise in appellate litigation,'' and because her ``legal credentials, experience and accomplishments make her exceptionally well-qualified to serve'' on the D.C. Circuit. They also echo the need for bringing gender diversity to this critical court, noting that, ``women have been historically underrepresented on this court, as only five of the fifty-seven judges to serve there have been women.'' This outstanding nominee is a leader and role model whose career should not be short-circuited by petty partisanship.  I ask unanimous consent that some of these letters of support be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.

We are lawyers who have worked      with Caitlin in various capacities. We believe that Caitlin      is an outstanding selection for the D.C. Circuit. She is a      first-rate lawyer and advocate. She is well respected and      highly regarded as a leader of the profession. Caitlin also      has an ideal judicial temperament. She brings reason, insight      and judgment to all matters. Even those of us who have been      on opposite     sides of Caitlin in litigation have been greatly impressed      with her ability and character. We have no doubt that she      would serve with distinction and fairness.           Sincerely yours,         Clifford M.

Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley: I am a retired      member of New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, a      position to which I was appointed by Governor George Pataki.      Caitlin Halligan appeared frequently before me on behalf of      the State of New York in her capacity as Solicitor General.      The quality of her work was exemplary and serves as a model      of how to deal with important issues. Her sense of fairness      and balance is among the best--if not the best--that I have      ever seen in my 34 years as a judge and as a prosecutor      before that. In her appearances before our court, there is no      one who commanded more respect and who had greater      credibility. If I had to choose a candidate to serve on a      federal appeals court I can think of no one better. I      emphasize: No one. I urge the Senate to act expeditiously to      confirm her to this position.       Most respectfully I hope the Senate sees fit to act      expeditiously to confirm her for service on the U.S. Court of      Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.       Please feel free to contact me, if you wish, by phone or      email. I recall fondly, Senator Leahy, that we met many years      ago at a convention when I was an assistant DA in New York      and you were a prosecutor in Vermont.           Very truly yours,     Albert M. Rosenblatt.                                  ____                                                 National District                                        Attorneys Association,                                     Alexandria, VA, June 2, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen          Senate Office Building Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: On behalf      of the National District Attorneys Association, the oldest      and largest organization representing over 39,000 of      America's state and local prosecutors, we would like to offer      our full support for the nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan      for the position of United States Circuit Judge for the      District of Columbia.       Ms. Halligan has an impressive background which developed      her into an extremely impressive and qualified candidate to      serve as an U.S. Circuit Judge. Ms. Halligan currently serves      as General Counsel of the New York County District Attorney's      Office, where she helps to supervise more than 500 lawyers      handling a wide range of criminal investigations and      prosecutions. Prior to joining the District Attorney's Office      in 2010, Ms. Halligan was a partner and head of the appellate      practice at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, LLP, a leading New York      law firm. From October 2001 until January 2007, Ms. Halligan      served as the Solicitor General of New York State, where she      represented the State in the federal and state appellate      courts and headed an office of 45 appellate attorneys.       The National District Attorneys Association believes that      Ms. Halligan would be an outstanding addition to the United      States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. We are      happy to offer our full support for Ms. Halligan's nomination      and encourage her swift confirmation by the Senate.           Sincerely,     James Reams,       President.     Scott Burns,       Executive Director.                                  ____                                      The Police Commissioner,                                       New York, NY, May 26, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley: I am writing in      support of the nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan to the      United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.      I am familiar with the work of Ms. Halligan in her capacity      as Counsel to the New York County District Attorney.       Ms. Halligan possesses the three qualities most important      for a nominee: intelligence, a judicial temperament, and      personal integrity. Ms. Halligan is without question an      attorney with a keen legal intellect. Indeed, the rapid      successes of her career since graduating from law school in      1995 provide ample evidence of her intelligence and      abilities. With regard to her temperament, the interactions      between Ms. Halligan and my staff consistently demonstrate an      even-handed disposition in navigating potential conflicts      between police and prosecutors in New York City. Lastly, Ms.      Halligan's personal integrity is simply without question.       In sum, Ms. Halligan possesses all the qualities required      for a successful federal appellate judge, and I highly      recommend her for such a position.           Sincerely,                                                 Raymond W. Kelly,     Police Commissioner.                                  ____                               Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz,                                     New York, NY, March 23, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley: I write this      letter in support of the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to      the United States Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia Circuit. I have known Caitlin personally a short      time, but her reputation for even-handedness and excellence      as an attorney are well-known in New York's legal community.       I will not belabor her exemplary record as an attorney:      Georgeton Law Review, clerk to Justice Patricia Wald of the      D.C: Circuit, to Justice Stephen Breyer of the United States      :Supreme Court, adjunct faculty member of Columbia University      Law School and Georgetown University Law Center, Solicitor      General of the State of New York, Partner and Head of      Appellate Practice Group at the firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges      LLP, and most recently, General Counsel to the District      Attorney of New York County. Certainly this is a resume and      career that is grounded solidly in the law, and I submit that      her legal qualifications are beyond question.       More recently, I have worked with Caitlin in her capacity      as General Counsel to my former office. Ske is well-known and      well-regarded as a lawyer's lawyer. She follows the law and      holds herself to the highest ethical standards. She is as      intellectually honest as she is tough--she does not take      short cuts and she does not pull her punches; both necessary      attributes for her to be effective in her current position.       At the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, she handles      some of the toughest issues that a lawyer has to address;      issues that go to the core of law enforcement authority;      issues that involve claims of wrongful conviction and the use      of prosecutorial discretion. I can speak from experience to      tell you that these are weighty issues that can keep any      lawyer awake at night. A District Attorney needs counsel who      is tough but fair, and counsel who can advise the district      attorney on these weighty issues not from a gut feeling or      personal agenda, but based solely on the law and the facts.      She meets these high standards. I cannot stress enough the      difficulties of the issues that Ms. Halligan has to address      every day. And, based on both my personal observation and      accounts I hear from my former colleagues at the D.A.'s      Office--Caitlin handles these pressures with grace and poise,      and is a tough proponent of the core mission of the Manhattan      D.A.'s Office--to keep the citizenry safe, to enforce the law      without fear or favor, and to hold accountable those who      break the law. She brings solid law enforcement perspective      to her work, and upholds the highest standards of my former      office.       In sum, Caitlin Halligan is qualified in terms of      intellect, ability and temperament, and I endorse her in the      strongest of terms.           Sincerely,                                             Robert M. Morgenthau.                                       ____                                                February 28, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write      as former clerkship colleagues of Caitlin Halligan in support      of her nomination for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for      the District of Columbia Circuit. All of us worked alongside      Caitlin as law clerks at the U.S. Supreme Court during the      1997-98 Term. Our shared experience left us with an indelible      impression of Caitlin's brilliant legal mind, her      collegiality and fair-mindedness, and her abiding respect for      the rule of law. Even now, almost a decade and a half later,      as we have moved on to disparate careers in the government,      private sector, and the legal academy, we retain a distinct      appreciation of Caitlin's sharp intelligence and her ability      to cooperate with others in resolving difficult legal      problems.       As you well know, the work of the Supreme Court is intense      and eclectic, encompassing a vast array of intricate legal      matters, a host of overlapping deadlines, and a variety of      formal and informal procedures for internal deliberation and      discussion among the Justices and their clerks. Our work on      the difficult cases the Court decided during the 1997-98 Term      generated among our group an unending discussion of legal      issues, both in connection with our specific law clerk tasks      and in more freewheeling conversations in the clerks' dining      room and related settings. In this milieu Caitlin stood out      for her ability to meaningfully discuss and explicate tough      legal questions with an open mind and a willingness to      consider multiple perspectives on the law. Throughout the      year, Caitlin displayed a keen ability to listen to and      accommodate the views of others, all the while simultaneously      expressing and justifying her own view of the law. Although      the Court during the 1997 Term issued an unusually high      proportion of unanimous decisions, Caitlin's demeanor as a      law clerk exuded reasonableness and collegiality even in      those areas where we law clerks-- and the Justices for whom      we worked--disagreed.       In sum, we hold Caitlin Halligan in high regard as a      talented and fair-minded colleague who was a pleasure to work      with in a sophisticated and demanding legal setting. We have      no doubt that if she is confirmed by the Senate, her      colleagues on the federal bench will soon arrive at a similar      conclusion, and we appreciate your attention to her      nomination.

Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: On behalf      of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, I write in      enthusiastic support of the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to      be a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit. Ms. Halligan is exceptionally      well-qualified, and would be an excellent addition to that      court. She would not only bring extraordinary legal talents      but also increase the gender diversity of that court,      increasing the representation of women on what has been      called the second-highest court in the land.       Her resume speaks for itself. Ms. Halligan has outstanding      legal credentials and legal experience that is both broad and      deep. Over the course of her career, she has developed      significant expertise in appellate litigation, including      before the U.S. Supreme Court. She has also generously      contributed of her own time to pro bono service.       We ask that the Senate vote to confirm Caitlin Halligan to      the United States Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia Circuit.           Sincerely,                                                   Margot Dorfman,     CEO.                                  ____                                            National Conference of                                     Women's Bar Associations,                                      Portland, OR, June 23, 2011.     Re Nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan to the United States          Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chair,     Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley, Ranking Member,     Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: On behalf      of the National Conference of Women's Bar Associations, we      write to express our enthusiastic support for the nomination      of Caitlin J. Halligan to the United States Court of Appeals      for the District of Columbia Circuit.       Ms. Halligan's broad experience, public service and      intellect make her well suited to the federal appellate      bench, and her appointment would add much needed diversity to      the federal court, where currently only three women are among      the active judges on the DC Circuit.       We join with many other organizations such as the National      District Attorneys Association, the New York Women in Law      Enforcement and the Women's Bar Association of the District      of Columbia in urging the speedy confirmation of this      outstanding nominee.           Very truly yours,                                                    Mary E. Sharp,     President.                                  ____                                                November 15, 2011.     Re Nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan to United States Court          of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell:      We, the undersigned law school deans and professors, write in      strong support of the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to the      United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia      Circuit. Ms. Halligan's legal credentials, experience, and      accomplishments make her exceptionally well-qualified to      serve on this court. We also note that women have been      historically underrepresented on this court, as only five of      the fifty-seven judges to serve there have been women, and      only three of the court's eight active judges are women.       Ms. Halligan graduated from Georgetown University Law      Center with honors, including Order of the Coif. She clerked      for Judge Patricia M. Wald on the D.C. Circuit Court, and for      Justice Stephen G. Breyer on the U.S. Supreme Court. Ms.      Halligan's career includes public service, private practice,      and legal education. She worked for the Attorney General of      the State of New York, including as Solicitor General of the      State of New York, and currently serves as General Counsel to      the New York County District Attorney's office. She was a      partner and head of the appellate practice at Weil, Gotshal      and Manges, LLP. In addition, she has taught as an adjunct      professor at Georgetown University Law Center and Columbia      Law School. In all of these capacities, Ms. Halligan has won      accolades for her judgment, legal acumen, and expertise in      appellate litigation, which includes five arguments before      the Supreme Court. Throughout her career, she has also      contributed significant pro bono services.       Ms. Halligan received a unanimous ``Well-Qualified'' rating      from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. She     has been endorsed by numerous organizations, including the      District Attorneys Association of the State of New York, the      National District Attorneys Association, the New York State      Association of Chiefs of Police, the New York State Sheriffs      Association, the New York Women in Law Enforcement, the      Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia, the      National Conference of Women's Bar Associations, the U.S.      Women's Chamber of Commerce, and the National Center for      Women & Policing.       We likewise offer our strong support of Ms. Halligan, and      urge you to support her nomination to the United States Court      of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. If you have      questions or if we can be of assistance, please contact      Columbia Law School Professor Gillian Metzger at (212) 854-     2667 or at [email protected]           Sincerely,       (Signed by 107 women law professors).
