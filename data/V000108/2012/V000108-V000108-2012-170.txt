Speaker, it is with great respect and sincere admiration that I rise to celebrate Black History Month and its 2012 theme--Black Women in American Culture and History. This year's theme offers us the opportunity to reflect on the outstanding accomplishments of African American women who often faced not only racial discrimination, but gender discrimination as well.  The innumerable contributions made by African American women throughout history have played a major role in shaping our great nation. From historical heroes, such as the leader of the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman, and the courageous civil rights activist, Rosa Parks, to modern leaders, including First Lady Michelle Obama, and locally, the Honorable Karen Freeman-Wilson, Mayor of the City of Gary, Indiana, the American people have been blessed and inspired by extraordinary African American women who have at many times, against all odds, strengthened our union.  As the Representative of the First Congressional District of Indiana, I have had the opportunity and pleasure to know and work with Mayor Freeman-Wilson. Mayor Freeman-Wilson's first term began this year, and her victory is an extraordinary example of how far our nation has come. With her recent election, Mayor Freeman-Wilson became the first female mayor of the city of Gary and the first African American female mayor in the State of Indiana.  Standing on the shoulders of the brave African American women who fought so hard for their rights, Mayor Freeman-Wilson continues to inspire and is a role model for women of all races. Mayor Freeman-Wilson grew up in Gary and was taught by her parents the importance of hard work and public service at an early age. She eventually graduated from Harvard Law School but quickly realized her calling was to be a public servant. She has held many prestigious positions throughout her career including: presiding judge for the Gary City Court, Attorney General for the State of Indiana, Executive Director of the National Drug Court Institute, and Director of the Indiana Civil Rights Commission. She is also active in numerous organizations and charitable groups aimed at protecting human rights, promoting the quality of life, and combating substance abuse. In particular, Mayor Freeman-Wilson's work with the Second Chance Foundation, an organization she helped found to fight substance abuse, is truly admirable.  It is leaders like Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson who become an inspiration for future generations. We honor her, along with all of the courageous African American women, past and present and across the nation, for their courage and tenacity to help create better communities and a better nation.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in remembering the many strong African American women who have left their mark in history and have fought for equality for all races and genders. They are worthy of the highest praise. Through the efforts of these honorable individuals, we are reminded of how far we have come as a nation, while recognizing that there is still much progress to be made.                          ____________________
