Chairman, I am opposed to this amendment.  The way you balance budgets is to have a robust economy, where everybody is helping to pull the ship forward. That isn't the case right now.  What we have dug out since 2008 was the largest recession since the Great Depression. America's chief strategic vulnerability throughout this period of time--for actually over a quarter century now--and our largest area of economic loss is energy.                              {time}  0110  It rests in energy. Since 2003, just since 2003, our country has spent $2.3 trillion importing foreign petroleum. That is just petroleum. That is not a country that is self-reliant. That is a country that deeply needs energy security here at home.  The result of this amendment will be less investment in the sector most critical to helping us right this hole that we have dug for ourselves.  Can you imagine if that $2.3 trillion had been spent in this country, the number of jobs we would have, the greater amount of income and revenue we would have flowing into people's pockets and also into the public sector where we have to pay the bills?  In addition to moving us backwards on the energy front, this amendment will be less investment in water resources, and we have $62 billion worth of Army Corps projects alone that have sat on the shelf. We have no new starts in this bill. That is not a country on the grow. That is a country in retrenchment.  So this amendment, it isn't a 50 percent cut. It is meant to send a signal. I say to the gentlelady, as I said to the chair of the Ways and Means Committee today who turned away from me and walked to the back of the Chamber, you know, it is pretty hard to balance a budget when not everybody is at work, their wages have been cut, the middle class has shrunk, but then you don't put revenues on the table.  Some of those lucrative operations, these transnational corporations have operating offshore aren't bringing their money home. They are holding it over there.  Revenues need to be on the table and mandatory spending has to be on the table.  He walked away from me, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. It was a rather interesting conversation.  The Appropriations Committee can't do this alone, and we certainly shouldn't do it in sectors where America truly is hurting.  At a time when unemployed Americans are losing jobless benefits and many young families struggle just to survive, we should be creating jobs and securing the American Dream, starting with a self-reliant energy future.  This bill underfunds that. The chairman has spoken eloquently to that. And it harms American economicgrowth and energy growth and energy security, and it damages those portions of our budget that are critical to our national security: vital weapons programs, our Naval research reactor research, and nonproliferation funding.  We believe our bill builds America forward to achieve progress for our country again and not retrenchment.  So I oppose the gentlelady's amendment. I think she has the right spirit, but I think she is looking in the wrong place in terms of what we face as a country. I oppose her amendment.  I yield back my the balance of my time.
