Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong support of H.R. 6516. This bill does make several very minor technical changes to the recently enacted Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010. This legislation was put together with the cooperation of Mr. Cummings, Mr. Oberstar, and with the assistance of the Office of Legislative Counsel. I urge all Members to support H.R. 6516.  I yield back the balance of my time.
