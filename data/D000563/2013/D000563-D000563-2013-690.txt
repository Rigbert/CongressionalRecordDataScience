President, I have often come to the floor to talk about the remote and sometimes dangerous places around the world where our USAID and State Department Foreign Service Officers serve.  We all know about the difficult and dangerous places our brave military personnel serve, often at great sacrifice. We sometimes lose sight of their civilian diplomatic and aid colleagues working side by side.  I am always impressed that no matter where on the planet one travels, there is an outpost of American ideals and talent dedicated to diplomacy, human rights, and helping the less fortunate.  These civilians serving abroad can face a variety of threats. Yet they do it with dedication, patriotism, and a belief that the United States should always be a voice for good in the world.  Sadly, today I come here with a heavy heart, as the life of one of the brightest young officers from my home State of Illinois was cut short on Saturday in one of those dangerous places.  Twenty-five-year-old Anne Smedinghoff eagerly volunteered to serve the United States in Afghanistan on her second assignment as a State Department Foreign Service Officer. She was clear-eyed in her determination to make a tangible improvement in the lives of those around her. And after 2 years at our Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, Anne joined the Public Diplomacy team at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.  Anne was a bright spot on the Embassy compound, known to her friends and coworkers as an intelligent, caring, and optimistic young officer who worked hard to help Afghan women and children.  On Saturday, Anne traveled to Zabul Province to donate books to a school.  In a cowardly attack, a suicide bomber detonated near her convoy. Anne was killed along with four other Americans--three U.S. servicemembers and a Department of Defense civilian. Several others were wounded.  Anne leaves behind her parents, brother, and two sisters, as well as countless relatives, friends, and coworkers who deeply mourn her loss, not only personally but also as an example of the deep dedication our diplomats demonstrate every day in outposts all around the world.  I know my colleagues join me in our heartfelt condolences to her family and in our ongoing appreciation for the sacrifices made by our diplomatic corps.                         Tribute to Roger Ebert  This morning I went to a funeral in Chicago at Holy Name Cathedral. There was a large--in fact, it was a huge crowd. It was a tribute to America's foremost movie critic Roger Ebert, who passed away last week. It was my good fortune to know Roger and his wife Chaz and to be one of his greatest fans. Like myself, he hailed from downstate Illinois. He was born in Urbana.  In his memoir ``Life Itself,'' he tells an amazingly detailed story of his youth growing up downstate and how he finally made it to the big time, the Chicago Sun Times in Chicago, after he had been editor of the Daily Illini on the campus of the University of Illinois.  Roger came to movie criticism almost by accident, but in no time at all he set the standard, not only for the United States, maybe for the world. Rahm Emanuel, our mayor in Chicago, in a tribute to Roger today, said at the service that he wanted to personally thank Roger Ebert for sparing us from going to see so many terrible movies. So many of us would wait before we went to a movie, as the mayor said, to check the time of the movie but also to check what Roger Ebert thought about the movie. He was a go-to person when it came to movie criticism.  As you came to read the book about his life, there was much more than that. He was a brilliant mind. From a very early age, he had an insatiable appetite for the world around him. He used that in his skills as a journalist at the Chicago Sun Times and in analyzing the whole genre of movies, from the earliest classics all the way through the most modern. That life experience really put him in good stead when it came to taking a look at movies from the human perspective.  He, of course, became famous on television with Siskel, Roeper, and so many others. Most of us watched that program with a lot of joy as the two of them would squabble from time to time over whether a movie was worth seeing. But there was much more to Roger than that. We came to know today, in tributes that were paid to him, his deep sense of social justice, not just in the way he analyzed things but in his life itself. He really was committed to fairness and to helping the little guy. It showed in the way he lived his life, in the way he set a standard as a journalist.  Chaz, his wife, came along late in life for him but became a true partner. The two of them were inseparable, and they were a dynamic team in so many ways. But the things about Roger's life that impressed me the most--the most--was after he was stricken with cancer. It was a devastating cancer. He went through a series of operations. He eventually had his face literally deformed by the surgeries, as he lost his jawbone. Then he lost his ability to speak. Then he lost his ability to eat--to eat. Yet he soldiered on. He continued to write, reviewing movies, using computer-assisted voice translation so that he could express himself through a keyboard in words. He wrote a blog every day that I used to go to from time to time, not only because it was so good--so many insights into things I had never thought about--but also because it was inspiring that he would get up and go to work every single day when others in that same circumstance would probably just give up. Roger never gave up. That, to me, showed that he not only had a great mind and a great heart but a great spirit.  What a turnout today at Holy Name Cathedral for Roger Ebert. The balcony was full--if there had been a balcony--of fans with two thumbs up for a great movie critic, a great human being, and a great son of Illinois.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the close of my remarks here an excerpt from Roger Ebert's memoir entitled ``Life Itself'' in which he talks about death and very boldly says, ``I do not fear death.'' It is an inspiring message that he penned over a year and a half before he actually died. It is an indication of the kind of spirit he brought to his life, a spirit we all admire to this day.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Apr. 4, 2013]                    Roger Ebert: I Do Not Fear Death                            (By Roger Ebert)       I know it is coming, and I do not fear it, because I      believe there is nothing on the other side of death to fear.      I hope to be spared as much pain as possible on the approach      path. I was perfectly content before I was born, and I think      of death as the same state. I am grateful for the gifts of      intelligence, love, wonder and laughter. You can't say it      wasn't interesting. My lifetime's memories are what I have      brought home from the trip. I will require them for eternity      no more than that little souvenir of the Eiffel Tower I      brought home from Paris.       I don't expect to die anytime soon. But it could happen      this moment, while I am writing. I was talking the other day      with Jim Toback, a friend of 35 years, and the conversation      turned to our deaths, as it always does. ``Ask someone how      they feel about death,'' he said, ``and they'll tell you      everyone's gonna die. Ask them, In the next 30 seconds? No,      no, no, that's not gonna happen.     How about this afternoon? No. What you're really asking them      to admit is, Oh my God, I don't really exist. I might be gone      at any given second.''       Me too, but I hope not. I have plans. Still, illness led me      resolutely toward the contemplation of death. That led me to      the subject of evolution, that most consoling of all the      sciences, and I became engulfed on my blog in unforeseen      discussions about God, the afterlife, religion, theory of      evolution, intelligent design, reincarnation, the nature of      reality, what came before the big bang, what waits after the      end, the nature of intelligence, the reality of the self,      death, death, death.       Many readers have informed me that it is a tragic and      dreary business to go into death without faith. I don't feel      that way. ``Faith'' is neutral. All depends on what is      believed in. I have no desire to live forever. The concept      frightens me. I am 69, have had cancer, will die sooner than      most of those reading this. That is in the nature of things.      In my plans for life after death, I say, again with Whitman:       I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I      love,       If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.       And with Will, the brother in Saul Bellow's ``Herzog,'' I      say, ``Look for me in the weather reports.''       Raised as a Roman Catholic, I internalized the social      values of that faith and still hold most of them, even though      its theology no longer persuades me. I have no quarrel with      what anyone else subscribes to; everyone deals with these      things in his own way, and I have no truths to impart. All I      require of a religion is that it be tolerant of those who do      not agree with it. I know a priest whose eyes twinkle when he      says, ``You go about God's work in your way, and I'll go      about it in His.''       What I expect to happen is that my body will fail, my mind      will cease to function and that will be that. My genes will      not live on, because I have had no children. I am comforted      by Richard Dawkins' theory of memes. Those are mental units:      thoughts, ideas, gestures, notions, songs, beliefs, rhymes,      ideals, teachings, sayings, phrases, cliches that move from      mind to mind as genes move from body to body. After a      lifetime of writing, teaching, broadcasting and telling too      many jokes, I will leave behind more memes than many. They      will all also eventually die, but so it goes.       O'Rourke's had a photograph of Brendan Behan on the wall,      and under it this quotation, which I memorized:       I respect kindness in human beings first of all, and      kindness to animals. I don't respect the law; I have a total      irreverence for anything connected with society except that      which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food      cheaper and the old men and old women warmer in the winter      and happier in the summer.       That does a pretty good job of summing it up. ``Kindness''      covers all of my political beliefs. No need to spell them      out. I believe that if, at the end, according to our      abilities, we have done something to make others a little      happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier,      that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy      is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime      starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is      true no matter what our problems, our health, our      circumstances. We must try. I didn't always know this and am      happy I lived long enough to find it out.       One of these days I will encounter what Henry James called      on his deathbed ``the distinguished thing.'' I will not be      conscious of the moment of passing. In this life I have      already been declared dead. It wasn't so bad. After the first      ruptured artery, the doctors thought I was finished. My wife,      Chaz, said she sensed that I was still alive and was      communicating to her that I wasn't finished yet. She said our      hearts were beating in unison, although my heartbeat couldn't      be discovered. She told the doctors I was alive, they did      what doctors do, and here I am, alive.       Do I believe her? Absolutely. I believe her literally--not      symbolically, figuratively or spiritually. I believe she was      actually aware of my call and that she sensed my heartbeat. I      believe she did it in the real, physical world I have      described, the one that I share with my wristwatch. I see no      reason why such communication could not take place. I'm not      talking about telepathy, psychic phenomenon or a miracle. The      only miracle is that she was there when it happened, as she      was for many long days and nights. I'm talking about her      standing there and knowing something. Haven't many of us      experienced that? Come on, haven't you? What goes on happens      at a level not accessible to scientists, theologians,      mystics, physicists, philosophers or psychiatrists. It's a      human kind of a thing.       Someday I will no longer call out, and there will be no      heartbeat. I will be dead. What happens then? From my point      of view, nothing. Absolutely nothing. All the same, as I      wrote to Monica Eng, whom I have known since she was six,      ``You'd better cry at my memorial service.'' I correspond      with a dear friend, the wise and gentle Australian director      Paul Cox. Our subject sometimes turns to death. In 2010 he      came very close to dying before receiving a liver transplant.      In 1988 he made a documentary named ``Vincent: The Life and      Death of Vincent van Gogh.'' Paul wrote me that in his Arles      days, van Gogh called himself ``a simple worshiper of the      external Buddha.'' Paul told me that in those days, Vincent      wrote:       Looking at the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I      dream over the black dots representing towns and villages on      a map.       Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be      as accessible as the black dots on the map of France?       Just as we take a train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we      take death to reach a star. We cannot get to a star while we      are alive any more than we can take the train when we are      dead. So to me it seems possible that cholera, tuberculosis      and cancer are the celestial means of locomotion. Just as      steamboats, buses and railways are the terrestrial means.       To die quietly of old age would be to go there on foot.       That is a lovely thing to read, and a relief to find I will      probably take the celestial locomotive. Or, as his little      dog, Milou, says whenever Tintin proposes a journey, ``Not by      foot, I hope!''
