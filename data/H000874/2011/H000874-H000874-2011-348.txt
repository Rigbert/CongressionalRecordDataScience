Speaker, I rise to honor Pat Kelly, one of the longest-serving employees in the history of the House of Representatives. Pat retired yesterday after more than 53 years of outstanding public service.  Pat comes from a family that has always placed a high premium on public service. Her father, Edward, was a New York City Court justice; her mother, Edna, was a Member of the House of Representatives. Even further back, Pat can trace her family's history of service to a grandfather who was appointed Postmaster of Brooklyn, New York, by President Woodrow Wilson.  In her decades in the House, Pat worked as a research assistant, a legislative assistant for three Members of Congress and the House Rules Committee, and the Editor of the House Daily Digest. Pat served in that most recent role from 1999 to her retirement. She has seen more than half a century of history being made first-hand--and more importantly, she has helped shaped that history, through her diligence, hard work, and deep experience. For more than 53 years, Pat Kelly made herself indispensable to the House, and she will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
