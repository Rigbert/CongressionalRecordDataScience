 President, I thank Senator Dodd for that statement which clearly reflects the intent of the authors of the bill on these important sections. If the Senator would yield, I would like to ask him some questions regarding various sections of this bill.  This conference report has a section on alternative language accessibility of voting systems, but the bill does not expand the language accessibility beyond what is already required under the Voting Rights Act. Is that the understanding of the conferees on alternate language accessibility?
