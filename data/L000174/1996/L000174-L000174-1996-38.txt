This is equipment that in the past has sat on palettes in Federal warehouses gathering dust and becoming obsolete while schools all around the country try to scrape together the funds to buy computer technology equipment for their students.  I applaud the administration's effort to put this unused equipment to work in our classrooms. To help support that initiative I offered an amendment to the Treasury, Postal Service, and general Government appropriations bill with Senator Murray which reiterates the importance of this initiative and urges Federal Agencies to work with the Federal Executive Boards to implement it. I also strongly supported Senator Murray's language in the legislative branch appropriations bill bringing the Senate into compliance with the Executive order. We in Congress should be leading the effort to bring computer technology to our public schools.  Making unused computer equipment available to schools is too important to let fall between the cracks of the many bureaucracies involved in this initiative. A report to Congress at the end of the year is needed to ensure that the Executive order is carried out and to monitor its progress in bringing Federal surplus computers to our educators. The Office of Science and Technology Policy has been deeply involved in coordinating the implementation of the Executive order. I believe that the office is the appropriate one to carry out such a report.  I have written to John Gibbons, Director of OSTP requesting that his office provide such a report to Congress by January 30, 1997. He responded by concurring that such a report is needed and offering the services of his office to carry it out within available resources. I ask unanimous consent that those letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 1996.     Mr. John H. Gibbons,     Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Old          Executive Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Gibbons: I would like to congratulate you on the      work your office has done to implement the President's      Executive order to bring Federal surplus computer equipment      to schools. This initiative is sorely needed to transfer      serviceable computer equipment no longer needed by Federal      Agencies to our public schools where the need for this      technology is great.       Senator Murray and I offered an amendment to the Fiscal      Year 1997 Appropriations report for Treasury, Postal Service,      and General Government which reinforces the importance of the      Executive Order and urges governmentwide cooperation in      speeding its implementation. I also strongly supported      Senator Murray's language in the Legislative Appropriations      bill bringing the United States Senate into compliance with      the Executive Order. Congress should be leading the charge to      bring surplus and excess computer equipment to our schools--     Senator Murray's language will put the Senate in the race.      For your information, I have included a copy of the report      language in the Treasury and Legislative Appropriation bills.       I believe that the steps Federal Agencies are taking to      conform with the Executive Order will be effective in      bringing more surplus equipment to schools at less cost to      the government and the schools themselves. A timely analysis      of the progress that has been made and the problems      Departments and the Federal Executive Boards may have run      into would be very helpful in evaluating the success of the      initiative. Because of the central role your office has      played in this important effort to bring computers to      schools, I think the Office of Science and Technology Policy      (OSTP) is the most appropriate body to carry out such an      evaluation.       Specifically, I request that OSTP report to Congress by      January 30, 1997 on the implementation of the Federal      Executive Order. This report should include information on      the progress of Federal Agencies and Congress in making      surplus computer equipment available to schools, and on the      effectiveness of the Federal Executive Boards in channeling      this equipment through the regions.       I look forward to working with your office to make sure      that unused Federal computer equipment is made available to      schools around the country. If you have any questions about      the requested report please contact Amy Rainone in my office      at 224-4242.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senator.                                                                    ____           Executive Office of the President, Office of Science and            Technology Policy,                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 1996.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: As you know the President has worked      hard to ensure that education technology is used effectively      to prepare our children for the 21st century. I want to thank      you for the leadership you have provided in helping America's      schools make effective use of new technology. Your leadership      in the Senate Education Technology Working group is very much      appreciated.       I strongly concur with your recommendation that a study be      conducted to determine how effectively the executive order to      improve the transfer of excess federal computer equipment to      schools and nonprofit organizations is being implemented.      Within the limits of OSTP's resources, we will survey the way      federal agencies are responding to the order and provide an      estimate of the kinds of equipment that is being made      available to schools. The study will be provided to the      Congress by January 30, 1997 together with recommendations      about any administrative or legislative actions that may be      needed to improve the operation of the federal program and      advice about the need for further reviews and oversight.           Sincerely,                                                  John H. Gibbons,                                                         Director.
