 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it stand in adjournment until the hour of 10 a.m. on Thursday, March 13. I further ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted, and that there then be a period for morning business until the hour of 12:30 p.m. with Senators to speak for up to 5 minutes each, with the exception of Senator Domenici in control of 1 hour, Senator Bingaman in control of 1 hour, and Senator Burns for 5 minutes.
