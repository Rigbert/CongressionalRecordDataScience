Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague for yielding.  I must tell my friend, the gentleman from California, that on Monday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business; on Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning-hour debate and noon for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Friday, no votes are expected in the House.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The complete list of suspension bills will be announced by close of business tomorrow.  In addition, we will consider H.R. 1728, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, and the Fight Fraud Act of 2009.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Reclaiming my time, if I may ask my colleague, knowing that Congress is in session only for 3 more weeks before we break for Memorial Day and having just heard next week's schedule, I wondered if my colleague might elaborate on the last 2 weeks in May what we would be expecting in the House.  I yield to the gentleman.
