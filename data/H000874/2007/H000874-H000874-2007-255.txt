That was the proposition that the gentleman put to us and Mr. Obey whenwe discussed the appropriations bills. We agreed, and we have followed to the letter, bringing every appropriation bill considered under an open rule, every one.                              {time}  1945  There were no constraints imposed beyond unanimous consent constraints so that we had an open process. Everybody got an opportunity to make their points and to vote.  There is no one on this side of the aisle who has served for the last 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 years who does not understand the pain that you express of your Members. They have all felt it. You know that, and I know that. Frankly, we had a previous majority leader who was not nearly as tolerant as the present majority leader, I say with some degree of perhaps humor but some degree, I think, of real truth. I believe we have complied with that agreement.  We will now conclude the business for tonight, and we will back tomorrow, and we will complete the work that I have set forth on behalf of the majority that the House contemplates. And we hope that we can try, over the next few hours, to reach a greater level of civility on both sides so that we can proceed and try to accommodate the concerns of every Member. But that has not happened.
