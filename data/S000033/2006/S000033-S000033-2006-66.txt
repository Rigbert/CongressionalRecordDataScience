 Speaker, this past week the Visiting Nurses Association of Chittenden and Grand Isle Counties announced that it received a generous gift of $1 million from Lois McClure. It is what we have come to expect of Mrs. McClure. She, along with her husband, J. Warren McClure, who died in April 2004, has sustained and encouraged a great variety of community-building in the State of Vermont. From support for the hungry and the homeless to the preservation of Vermont history, from concern with teenage mothers to grants to champion Lake Champlain and its heritage, Lois McClure has used her substantial resources to make Vermont a better and more caring place to live.  In addition to the remarkable donation to the VNA which was recently announced, let me cite only a partial listing of the donations that Lois McClure and J. Warren McClure have given to support Vermont and Vermonters. One million dollars to the Burlington Community Land Trust, the first municipally-funded land trust in the Nation. One million dollars to the Vermont Historical Society for the study of Vermont history, and $100,000 for the Rokeby Museum which preserves that history, as does the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, also a recipient of McClure funds. And $1 million to renovate the USS Ticonderoga at the Shelburne Museum, along with generous funding to build an 88-foot working replica of a sailing canal boat, appropriately christened the Lois McClure. Two and a half million dollars to the Leahy Center for Lake Champlain to study and preserve and educate people about the lake on Vermont's western border. Education? Generous grants to Vermont's St. Michael's College, Champlain College, the Snelling Center for Government, and the UVM Bailey-Howe Library. Money for preserving our agricultural tradition to Shelburne Farms, for supporting community philanthropy for the Vermont Community Foundation, for improving health care on every level to the Vermont-New Hampshire Red Cross, generous gifts to the Vermont Respite House and to the Fletcher-Allen Hospital.  And money to build community, especially focused on the needs of the elderly, children and the homeless: To establish the McClure Multigenerational Center in Burlington, to support the Chittenden Emergency Food Shelf, and to the Baird Center for Children and Families and the Committee on Temporary Shelter (COTS) in Burlington.  Many people work to make Vermont a special place. They tend to those in need and feed the hungry. They educate young people and secure the health of all of us. They remind us of our past and give us a firm foundation to move securely into the future. Lois McClure is just one of those many, one of the countless generous people in our state. But, always, financial support enables the work that we all do together to build and strengthen our communities. Time and again Lois McClure and her late husband have supported the efforts of those who care, and provided funds for those in need. And for that we thank her, and honor her.                          ____________________
