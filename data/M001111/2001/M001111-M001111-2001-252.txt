 President, this amendment, I have sent to the desk is offered by Senator Shelby and myself and it will strengthen the truck safety provisions in the bill as reported by the committee.  It will require the Department of Transportation to implement a rigorous inspection regime under which every Mexican truck seeking to travel beyond the commercial zone will be required to be inspected at least every 90 days.  This inspection system has shown some level of success within the Stateof California in bringing down the high level of safety noncompliance that has been found in Mexican trucks seeking to cross the border.  We believe that his would improve upon the provisions already in place in the bill as reported by the committee.  I know that Senators McCain and Gramm have an interest in these provisions. In deference to them, I will not seek adoption of the amendment at this time. I will leave it as the pending amendment to the bill.  If need be, we can temporarily lay the amendment aside and take up amendments on other matters as debate occurs on this bill.
