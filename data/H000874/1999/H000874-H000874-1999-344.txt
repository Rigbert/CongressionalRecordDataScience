Speaker, I rise today to recognize and remember the millions of women and men who have given their lives to serve in our Nation's Armed Forces. Their courageous efforts have been honored at this time of year since the fighting of the Civil War. During the Civil War numerous families began their heartfelt commemorative efforts and since then the countless events which followed have generated an uncompromising level of respect and reverence for our beloved soldiers.  Yet we must not forget the reasons for which our Armed Forces have fought for our Nation: to preserve and protect the blanket of freedom under which we have rested with security for over 200 years. Since the end of the Civil War so much has changed, and yet so much in our society remains the same. Those Soldiers fought to protect our inalienable rights as humans and have continued to do so from that day to this.  Even today our men and women sacrifice their lives to protect our interests overseas. We must remember them in these times of conflict. Our sentiments go out not only to the soldiers who have fought in our conflicts of yesteryear. We must include today's Armed Forces in our thoughts and our prayers for they continue to struggle and rightfully defend our beliefs in life, liberty, and freedom in Europe and around the world.  Entering into the 21st century we look forward to a time of peace in which our decisions to take direction are reserved for reflection. I remind you Mr. Speaker that we do not remember in joy, but in sorrow. We do not reflect with happiness, we reflect in pain. The millions of men and women dedicated their lives to fight so that we can look forward to a time in which we shall fight no more and we must never forget them.  Since the first official commemoration of our soldiers of war on May 30, 1868, as Decoration Day, our Country has devoted a continuous and conscious effort to support our troops and the battles they have fought. In 1971, to recognize the weight of their importance, Congress declared Memorial Day a National holiday.  Mr. Speaker, to continue our recognition of our soldiers' tireless efforts, I am currently introducing a bill to grant the Korean Veterans Association a Federal Charter. Granting this Federal Charter is a small expression of appreciation that, we as a Nation, can offer to these men and women to show our continued support, one which will enable them to work as a unified front to ensure that the ``Forgotten War'' is forgotten no more.  Please join with me in expressing full recognition and thanks to those who have served our Nation and its Armed Forces on this Memorial Day. The respect and debt of gratitude we owe these honorable men and women for preserving our Nation and our freedom is immeasurable.                          ____________________
