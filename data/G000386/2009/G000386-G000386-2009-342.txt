 Lynn continues to defend straight pay, a policy that Secretary Cohen said didn't exist back then. He said it was necessary ``to ensure that contractors were paid on time.''  Well, can't you pay contractors on time by having invoices and all the proper documentation to write even a $1 check? That is the streamlining effect that former Secretary Cohen argued for in his failed June 2, 1998 DRI legislative initiative.  I exchanged followup Q and A on these matters with Mr. Lynn on February 5 and 6 this year, and I will include those letters in the record as well. As Chief Financial Officer at one of our biggest departments, Mr. Lynn signed the memo authorizing straight pay policy. It was his policy.  I ask unanimous consent that the followup documents be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                  Washington, DC February 5, 2009.     Mr. William J. Lynn,     Senior Vice President, Raytheon Company, Arlington, VA       Dear Mr. Lynn: I am writing to follow-up on our recent      exchange of correspondence regarding your record as the Chief      Financial Officer (CFO) at the Department of Defense (DOD).       I respectfully request that you respond to the following      questions in writing:       (1) On February 2, 1998, when you were CFO, Secretary of      Defense Cohen asked the Senate for legal authority to pay      bills without receipts with no dollar limit. This proposal      was embodied in Section 401 of the Defense Reform Initiative      (DRI). What was your position on this legislative proposal?       (2) In a letter to you dated January 19, 1999, I expressed      grave concern about a DOD payment policy known as ``Straight      Pay.'' This policy was authorized by you in documents that      bear your signature. The purpose of my letter was to verify      the facts pertaining to this policy that was brought to my      attention by a Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)      employee, Your response to this letter is dated March 9,      1999. In your letter, you report that ``Straight Pay'' does      not exist. This is what you said: ``Straight Pay'' is not      used at our Columbus Center . . . `Straight Pay,' as it was      reported to you, does not exist at the Columbus Center.''      Secretary Cohen made essentially the same statement in      response to questions I raised at a Budget Committee hearing      on March 2, 1999. He stated: ``there is no authorized      procedure called straight pay.'' In your February 3, 2009      letter, by comparison, you provided a description of the      ``Straight Pay'' policy. Did ``Straight Pay'' exist at the      Columbus Center in 1998-99?       (3) How do you explain a DFAS Memo dated March 8, 1999 that      contains the following instructions: ``Due to concerns over      the use of the term `Straight Pay' and its connotation, we      must delete all references, to `straight pay' from the policy      and clarify that policy does not create an environment for      fraudulent payments. Terms such as unmatched disbursements or      direct disbursements were substituted.'' Did you instruct      DFAS to get rid of the term ``Straight Pay.''       (4) Do you believe unmatched disbursements were a      satisfactory outcome?       (5) One day after DFAS gave ``Straight Pay'' policy a new      name, you issued orders to keep the policy alive. Your memo      of March 9, 1999 actually re-authorized the policy for      another 90 days beyond the March 22, 1999 expiration date. Is      that true?       (6) When you were CFO, were you knowledgeable or aware of      the arbitrary allocation scheme used by DFAS at the Columbus      Center for making progress payments? That policy also had an      informal name. It was called ``bucket billing.'' Both the      GAO. and IG had conducted numerous audits and reviews of      these procedures and declared them to be illegal. If you knew      about these bill paying practices, what specific steps did      you take to correct the problem?       (7) I note that the waiver granted to you in connection      with President Obama's new ethics rules was co-signed by OMB      Director Orszag and Mr. Gregory B. Craig, Counsel to the      President. I understand that you have past associations with      Mr. Craig. Please characterize your relationship with Mr.      Craig?       (8) According to the Project on Government Oversight      (POGO), Raytheon is ``ranked #4 in a top 50 corrupt list'' of      government contractors. POGO reports numerous instances of      double billing on aircraft maintenance contracts, contractor      kickbacks, defective pricing, False Claims Act violations,      substitution/nonconforming products, violations of SEC rules,      etc. involving Raytheon. As the top Raytheon lobbyist, to      what extent did you know about or become involved with any of      these issues? Did you ever discuss any of these issues with      DOD officials or Members of Congress or congressional staff?       (9) In view of the fact that your nomination appears to be      inconsistent with President Obama's rules pertaining to the      ``Revolving Door Ban,'' do you belief you have compromised      any of your personal and/or professional values by accepting      it?       Your continuing cooperation in this matter would be greatly      appreciated.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member.                                                 February 5, 2009.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to respond to your      letter of February 5, 2009. Following my February 3, 2009      letter, you asked nine additional questions.       (1) Although I took office as Under Secretary just before      the Defense Reform Initiative was submitted to Congress, I      did not participate in the development of Section 401. I do      not recall having taken a position on it. At this time, I      would not support a proposal that with no dollar limit would      allow the Defense Department to pay bills without a receipt.       (2) In your letter of January 19, 1999, you equated an      obligation to a contract, implying that ``Straight Pay''      allowed payment without a valid contract. As I explained in      both my recent February 3, 2009 letter and the earlier March      9, 1999 letter, ``Straight Pay'' required that the Department      be in possession of a valid contract as well as a valid      invoice and a valid receiving report prior to payment being      authorized. If this three way match existed, the policy      allowed payment without a matching obligation in the      accounting records, with the proviso that the Military      Services update the accounting records to ensure that a valid      payment had been made. In short, ``Straight Pay'' did exist      at the Columbus Center in 1998-99, but the process was      different than the one you described in your January 19, 1999      letter.       (3) I am not aware of the March 8, 1999 DFAS memo that you      referenced. To my knowledge, I did not sign or authorize it.       (4) Unmatched disbursements are not a satisfactory outcome.      They reflect the age and inadequacy of some of our finance      and accounting systems. This is one of the primary reasons      that I supported the modernization of our finance and      accounting infrastructure when I was Under Secretary in the      late 1990s and why I will continue to support that      modernization should I be confirmed as Deputy Secretary.       (5) As I stated in my February 3, 2009 letter, ``Straight      Pay'' was an attempt to strike the right balance between      meeting our obligations to pay on time and ensuring the      Department only paid vendors for what was actually received      under a valid contract. The 90-day extension of that policy      on March 9, 1999 was done because the backlog of unpaid      invoices remained at an unacceptable level.       (6) With regard to progress payments, I took steps to      ensure that payment procedures were tightened. In 1998, I      directed that on all new contracts, other than firm fixed      price contracts, the practice of prorating payments      proportionately to all accounting classification reference      numbers be discontinued. Effective August 31, 1998, the      Department began distributing progress payments on the basis      of the best available estimates of the specific work being      performed under the contract. Both the Office of the      Inspector General and the Office of the General Counsel of      the Department of Defense reviewed and approved the new      policy.        (7) I served on the staff of Senator Edward Kennedy in the      late 1980s with Gregory B. Craig, who is now Counsel to the      President.        (8) While at Raytheon, I did not participate in any of the      of the issues that you cite. Nor did I lobby on those issues      with either Defense Department officials or any Members or      staff in Congress.       (9) I am honored that President Obama nominated me to serve      as Deputy Secretary of Defense. If confirmed, I will serve      the Department and the nation to the best of my     ability. It is fully consistent with my personal and      professional values to return to public service at this time.           Sincerely,     William J. Lynn III                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2009.     Mr. William J. Lynn,     Senior Vice President,     Raytheon Company, Arlington, VA       Dear Mr. Lynn: I have reviewed your letter of February 5,      2009, in which you attempt to address the questions I raised      in a letter to you also dated February 5th.       I am baffled by some of your answers. You have answered      questions I did not ask; you have not answered questions I      did ask; and some of your answers appear to be incomplete as      follows:       First, in question #1, I asked you about your position on      Section 401 of Secretary Cohen's Defense Reform Initiative      presented to the Senate in February 1998. You responded as      follows: ``I did not participate in the development of      Section 401. I do not recall having taken a position on it.      At this time, I would not support a proposal that with no      dollar limit would allow the DOD to pay bills without a      receipt.'' In February 1998, you had been CFO for several      months. This issue fell directly under your purview. How      could you possibly avoid taking a position on an issue the      Secretary of Defense was urging the Senate to adopt? As the      Chief DOD lobbyist for Raytheon today, you say it was wrong.      My question is: As the DOD CFO back in 1998, why didn't you      know it was wrong and speak up?       Second, in question #2, I asked: ``Did `Straight Pay' exist      at the Columbus Center in 1998-99?'' You responded this way:      ``Straight Pay' did exist at the Columbus Center in 1998-99,      but the process was different than the one you described.''      Your response today is a bit different from the one you      provided me in 1999. In early March 1999, both you and      Secretary Cohen reported to me that ``Straight Pay'' did not      exist. Period. This is what Secretary Cohen said in response      to my questions at a Budget Committee hearing on March 2,      1999: ``there is no authorized procedure called straight      pay.'' And he attributed that statement to you. You are      saying it existed but not exactly as I described it. I find      these explanations somewhat confusing. Even if I did not      describe it exactly right, it still existed. And this is why      I raised question #3.       Third, The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)      employees were providing me with documents that clearly      indicated that the ``Straight Pay'' did, in fact, exist.       DFAS employees even provided me with an elaborate set of      rules on how this policy was to be implemented. Then I      received a high-level DFAS memo that appeared to constitute a      direct order to suppress the policy, bury it, if necessary,      or re-name it. This memo, dated March 8, 1999, contained the      following instructions: ``Due to concerns over the use of the      term `Straight Pay' and its connotation, we must delete all      references to `straight pay' from the policy and clarify that      policy does not create an environment for fraudulent      payments. Terms such as unmatched disbursements or direct      disbursements were substituted.'' As you know, unmatched      disbursements--like ``Straight Pay''--leave the door wide      open to fraud and theft. But that is a separate issue. In      question #3, I asked: ``Did you instruct DFAS to get rid of      the term ``Straight Pay?'' You did not answer this question.      You responded by saying you are not aware of that memo and      did not sign it or authorize it. I will re-phrase the      question, because some high official was probably creating      pressure for this change. While CFO, did you ever issue any      instructions to DFAS or anyone else regarding use of the term      or words ``Straight Pay''?       Fourth, in question #5, I asked you if you approved and      signed documents authorizing ``Straight Pay.'' In your      response, you tell me why the policy was necessary but do not      accept direct responsibility for approving the policy. While      CFO, did you ever approve and sign documents authorizing      ``Straight Pay''?       Fifth, in question #6, I asked you about your knowledge of      the arbitrary allocation scheme--also known as ``Bucket      Billing''--used at the Columbus Center for making progress      payments on contracts. At the time, both the GAO and DOD IG      had declared that this policy was illegal. As you may      remember, I addressed this matter in great detail with your      predecessor, Mr. John Hamre. You now report that a new policy      was put in place on August 31, 1998. You also reported that      the IG reviewed and approved that policy. Having a new policy      is an important first step, but my question is this: Is the      new policy working as advertised? In 1999, did you follow-up      and check to see if payments were being posted to the correct      appropriation accounts?       Sixth, in question #7, I asked you about your association      with Mr. Gregory B. Craig, who was directly involved in the      review and approval of the waiver you were granted in      connection with President Obama's new ethics rules. I asked      this question: ``Please characterize your relationship with      Mr, Craig?'' You answered: ``I served with him on the staff      of Senator Kennedy in the late 1980s.'' Again, please      characterize your relationship with Mr. Craig? What      discussions took place between you and Mr. Craig regarding      this matter?       Seventh, I will re-phrase question #9 as follows: Do you      believe that your nomination is fully consistent with the      spirit and intent of the ``Revolving Door Ban'' in paragraphs      2 & 3 of Section 1 of the new rules?       I very much appreciate your patience and cooperation with      this matter.           Sincerely                                                 Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member.                                  ____                                                 February 9, 2009.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing in response to your      letter of February 6, 2009. You asked some additional follow      up questions to your letters of February 3, 2009 and February      5, 2009.       (1) You asked about my position on Section 401 of the      Defense Reform Initiative in 1998. As I indicated, the      development of Section 401 took place before I took office as      Under Secretary in late 1997, so I was not engaged in the      process that led to the inclusion of Section 401 in the      Defense Reform Initiative. Further, Section 401 was dropped      before I ever had an opportunity to review or take a position      on the provision.       (2) You asked for further clarification on the issue of      ``Straight Pay'' at the Defense Finance and Accounting      Service (DFAS) Columbus Center. To my knowledge, ``Straight      Pay'' was an informal term used to describe a payment process      in the Air Force network. Your March 1999 letter and your      Budget Committee hearing question to Secretary Cohen used the      term ``Straight Pay'' differently, that is to describe the      pre-validation process used by the Mechanization of Contract      Administration System (MOCAS) at the Columbus Center. The      purpose of my response to your letter and Secretary Cohen's      response to your hearing question in 1999 was not to argue      over the term ``Straight Pay'', but rather to explain the      pre-validation process used at Columbus accurately and fully.      Specifically, we both described how the three-way match      procedures worked. They required that no payments could be      made without a valid invoice, a valid contract, and a valid      receiving report. If this three-way match existed, the policy      allowed payment without a matching obligation in the      accounting records, with the proviso that the Military      Services update the accounting records to ensure that a valid      payment had been made.       (3) As I wrote previously, I was not aware of the March 8,      1999 DFAS memo that DFAS employees provided to you. Nor do I      recall ever issuing instructions to DFAS or anyone else      regarding the use of the term ``Straight Pay''.       (4) You asked about documents that I signed authorizing      ``Straight Pay''. I am not aware of any official documents      that I signed that included the term ``Straight Pay''. I did,      however, approve and sign documents that authorized the      three-way match process described in my answer in paragraph 2      above. These included the March 9, 1999 memo, to which you      referred in your February 5, 2009 letter. This memo re-     authorized a temporary increase in the threshold on new      contracts paid by the MOCAS system due to the backlog of      payments. The original authority for the temporary increase      in the threshold was a December 1998 memo, which I also      approved and signed.       (5) With regard to the new policy that I directed on      progress payments in 1998, I did follow up and found DFAS was      following the payment distribution instructions required by      that policy. It is my understanding that the policy remains      in practice today with some enhancements to further ensure      payment distribution is made in accordance with the contract.       (6) As I stated in my previous letter, Mr. Gregory Craig      and I were co-workers on Senator Kennedy's staff in the late      1980s. Over the ensuing decades, we have had only very few      contacts. Additionally, my contacts with the review and      approval of my waiver were not with Mr. Craig, but with his      colleagues in the White House Counsel's office, who conducted      the extensive analysis supporting the waiver. Ultimately,      this analysis was then reported and approved by Mr. Craig.       (7) I believe that my nomination is consistent with the      spirit and intent of President Obama's Executive Order. I,      like every nominee, am bound by the Order's provisions.      However, because of my previous work experience, I was      granted a waiver to a portion of Section 1, which is allowed      under Section 3 of the Order. The reasons for receiving the      waiver were described in a February 3, 2009 letter to you      from Mr. Peter Orszag, Director of OMB and Mr. Craig, White      House Counsel. Notwithstanding, I remain bound by the Order's      revolving door exit provisions as well as all other      provisions contained in the Order.       Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your questions.           Sincerely,                                              William J. Lynn III.
