Being lawyers and having been on Capitol Hill for a while working in this environment, we have a tendency to speak in terms that perhaps the average person may not understand. I want the Senator from New York to help me come to the basic question about why any average person following debate on the floor of the Senate in America should even care about the compliance with rules because I think the Senator has made this point.  The Senator said that now, with the new Republican majority in the Senate, with the Miguel Estrada nomination, they are violating the traditions of the Senate in terms of questions to be asked for those seeking lifetime appointments to the Federal judiciary. The chairman, Orrin Hatch of Utah, of the Judiciary Committee has now said he is going to change the way Senators from a given State can approve of the nominees before they come up for consideration before the committee.  Senator Hatch, in one of his first acts as chairman, scheduled three controversial nominees for one day, in an unprecedented scheduling, which, frankly, called into question whether there would be enough time to ask important questions. And now, as late as last week, Senator Hatch has said he is going to virtually ignore the established rules of the Senate Judiciary Committee that have been in place through Democrats and Republicans, to cut off debate in the committee.  My basic question to the Senator is: Why is this important to the average citizen following this debate? Why should they care if Members of the Senate are twisted in knots over procedure and tradition? What is the bottom line here? Why is this significant? Is this the clash of titanic Senate egos, or is there something more at stake in this issue?
