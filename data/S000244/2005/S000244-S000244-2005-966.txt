Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Baird amendment. The gentleman from Washington has been very sincere in stating that there ought to be a Constitution amendment to provide for temporary appointments to the House of Representatives in case of a tragedy.  The House debated that amendment in the last Congress, and it was rejected by the resounding margin of 63 ayes to 353 noes. That should have closed the issue of having appointed Members serve, even on a temporary basis. Evidently it has not, and that is why we are debating this here today.  Earlier this year, the House passed the continuity of Representation Act. It was passed overwhelming, 329 to 68, a nearly 5-to-1 margin. And those who voted for that bill in February ought to vote against the Baird amendment today.  The expedited special election procedure will mean that the House will be filled up within 49 days. In this 49-day time frame, the election center has shown that there can be special elections that will have the vigorous debate that the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) wants to have in terms of selecting replacement Representatives for those of us who are wiped out.  But I would say that if the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) has his way, we could have a House of 350 appointed Members outvoting the 85 elected Members that survive the enemy attack.  That is not democracy. We would have an appointed House and perhaps an appointed Senate, and an appointed President of the United States. We ought to reject the Baird amendment. We ought to get the Continuity of Representation Act passed through the other body and made law because it is an important and vital homeland security measure.
