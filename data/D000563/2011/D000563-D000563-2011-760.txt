Think about that: a voucher to an insurance company, and the hope is they would provide the coverage you need.  Medicare, I want to tell you, is like Social Security, one of those programs that people have confidence in. They know the coverage and they know what has happened. Since the 1960s, under President Johnson, when we initiated Medicare, seniors live longer, they are healthier, they are strong, and they are independent. That is what you get with good quality health care. When you start making 60 percent cuts in Medicare benefits, such as Chairman Ryan's House Republican budget proposal, you run the risk that a lot of people will not get the good coverage they have today in Medicaid and Medicare.
