President, it is my honor to recognize a true friend of Vermont, State Senator Dick Sears of Bennington, who has been named by FiscalNote as the sixth most productive State senator in the United States.  Senator Sears, who was first elected in 1992, and as cited by FiscalNote, has sponsored 314 bills and has a 60 percent bill passage success rate. This recognition of Senator Sears' effectiveness comes as no surprise in Vermont, where he is respected and is a fixture on the nightly news during the legislative session.  In the Vermont Senate Judiciary Committee, where Senator Sears serves as chair, he has acted courageously on issues including civil rights, marriage equality, human trafficking, and adoption. He himself highlights his work on corrections and criminal justice reform, as well as his successful involvement in the 2010 rewrite of sex offender laws, as major accomplishments; yet he also attributes his success in these important issue areas to teamwork.  In addition to chairing the judiciary committee, Senator Sears also serves on the appropriations committee, the joint fiscal committee, is vice chair of the joint legislative child protection oversight committee, is vice chair of the joint legislative justice committee, and is a member of the legislative committee on judicial rules and the legislative council committee.  Clearly, Senator Sears is a legislator who deserves recognition, yet doesn't seek recognition. In honor of Senator Sears' outstanding accomplishments, I ask that the article by Christie Wisniewski from the July 31 edition of the Bennington Banner, ``Sears ranked 6th in productivity for U.S. state senators,'' be printed into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    Bennington Banner, July 31, 2018        Sears ranked 6th in productivity for U.S. state senators       This story by Christie Wisniewski was published by the      Bennington Banner on July 31.       Bennington.--State Sen. Dick Sears of Bennington is the      sixth most productive state senator in the United States,      according to an analysis released Monday by a Washington,      D.C.-based software startup. Each year, FiscalNote creates a      list of the top 10 state senators using ``unique data      analytics software,'' the company said in a press release.      The list ranks all senators and representatives in accordance      with their legislative productivity, which is defined as how      successful the legislator is at sponsoring and steering bills      through each stage of the legislative process.       This research also ranks the quality, endurance and      substantiveness of the bills each legislator sponsored and      introduced. For example, legislators score higher if they      sponsor a higher number of bills and if their bills make it      further in the legislative process. A bill that is enacted is      weighted more than a bill that does not make it past the      Senate floor. Finally, legislators score higher if their      bills are substantive a bill that attempts meaningful change      rather than a memorial or commendation.       Sears, a Democrat, was first elected in 1992. Since then,      he has sponsored 314 bills and has a 60-percent bill passage      success rate.       ``I'm just flabbergasted,'' Sears said of the report.      ``[I'm] really humbled and pleased, quite frankly.''       Sears was the only state senator from New England to make      the top 10.       State Sen. Brian Campion, who is running for re-election      alongside his district mate Sears as a team, lauded Sears for      his dedication to the county.       ``Bennington County was once the forgotten kingdom of      Vermont, but Dick has helped us rid ourselves of that      title,'' Campion said. ``He's incredibly hard working, and      I'm lucky to have him as a mentor and district mate.''       According to the National Conference of State Legislatures      website, there are 7,383 legislators across the United      States.       ``To be ranked in the top 10 of state senators is an      amazing thing,'' Sears said. ``. . . I've worked well with      various administrations over the years and sponsored some      really tough bills.''       Sears has worked successfully with four different Vermont      governors and sponsored bills dealing with civil rights,      marriage equality, human trafficking, adoption, and other      issues. He views his work with reforming state corrections      and criminal justice laws--especially with juvenile justice--     as a ``major accomplishment'' and also sees his involvement      with the 2010 ``complete rewrite'' of sex offender laws as a      success.       However, Sears doesn't want to take all the credit for the      bills that have passed under his watch.       ``Like anything else, you never do it alone,'' he said.       Rep. Timothy R. Corcoran II of Bennington also believes      Sears' recognition is well-deserved.       ``Dick has always lived by his convictions and never backed      down when he faced opposition to issues that weren't      universally accepted,'' Corcoran said. ``Bennington County      has been extremely lucky to have him represent us up in      Montpelier.''       Corcoran commended Sears' willingness to fight for      Bennington County, ``whether it's been PFOA, helping to      secure Amtrak bus service funding, fighting for the Vermont      Veterans Home, or just securing funds for Bennington County      in general.''       ``Dick has always stepped up to the plate and delivered,''      Corcoran added. ``Congratulations Dick; job well done.''                          ____________________
