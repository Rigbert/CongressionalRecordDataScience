President, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from New Jersey, paying tribute to colleagues on both sides of the aisle who for a variety of reasons are leaving this institution.  I think it goes without saying that those of us who have been involved in putting ourselves in battles for elections understand that it takes some courage and maybe some foolhardiness to put your name on a ballot and submit your fate to the neighbors and friends with whom you live. Those leaving this institution have done that time and again. I respect them. Although we disagree on issues and on philosophy, we respect them so much for the courage they have shown and for their dedication to public service.  One of the most important lessons I ever learned in politics was my first one. I was a college intern on Capitol Hill working in the office of the U.S. Senator, Paul Douglas. I had no sooner met the man in February than I fell in love with this life and decided to work in Government. A few short months later, he lost his election in an effort to be reelected to the State of Illinois.  It really came crashing down on me--that a man who served for 18 years, because of the decision of the electorate, could see his political career come to an end that bluntly.  A constant reminder in my public life is the fact that this is a fickle business, and no one can ever take for granted the next election. But I believe that the men and women who have served have done so honorably, and I salute those on both sides who will not be with us in the next Congress.  I say on a positive note that we had our organizational caucus of the Democratic Senators a few days ago in the Old Senate Chamber. We had a chance for each of the 10 new Democratic Senators to stand and speak for a moment about their feelings concerning their elections and service in the Senate. One word that was used most frequently by these new Senators was ``humility''--how humbled they were to be part of this institution.  I have always felt that. I think it is such an exceptional responsibility but also an exceptional privilege to serve in this great body. I have believed that representing a State as diverse and interesting as Illinois gives a special meaning.  The new Senators coming on both sides of the aisle will add something to this Chamber, as each new class of Senators does. I hope before we begin anticipating the next Congress and what it might mean, we take care of the business of this Congress.                      Passing Appropriations Bills  Mr. President, we are required by law, as of each October 1st, to pass spending bills, appropriations bills for the function of government. Most Congresses fail to meet the deadline of October 1st. Some miss it by a few days, some by a few weeks. Sadly, this Congress will miss it by a few months.  We still have major spending bills which have not been passed by this Congress. Frankly, we have run out ofexcuses. It is time to pass those bills which will continue the functions of government. The Labor-HHS bill is one that deals with education and health and labor standards in America. Is there any greater responsibility? How can we explain the fact that we still haven't done it? There is no excuse left. We need to pass that legislation and do it quickly.  Secondly, the bill related to the Commerce, Justice, and State Departments not only deals with the administration of justice and law enforcement but the representation of the American Government overseas, the representation of American business in an effort to create new jobs in this country. Yet we haven't passed that legislation.  I hope we won't fall on the easy solution suggested by some that we somehow postpone this for months or another year. That would truly be humiliating to this Congress, if it should fall into that trap. It is better to face four square our responsibility. I hope leaders on both sides of the aisle and the White House can come to an agreement as quickly as possible.  There is one special issue, though, that I hope we can address before we leave. It affects my State and the State of the Presiding Officer, the State of Illinois, the question of hospital care and reimbursement from the Federal Government. More and more, our hospitals across Illinois and around the Nation depend on the Medicare and Medicaid programs to adequately reimburse them for quality health care which American families expect. In an effort to balance the budget, we made cuts in reimbursement under the Medicare program. We had hoped to save a little over $100 billion over some years. We cut too deeply, and now we know unless we reverse that policy, the actual savings or cost cutting will be well over $200 billion.  On its face, it may sound like a good reason, that we are reducing the deficit even more, and that is a very valuable thing. But the price we are paying is too high because in hospital after hospital, in nursing homes and those agencies providing home health care services, they are inadequately reimbursed by the Federal Government and they are forced to cut back time and again on the services the people have come to expect.  Yesterday we had an interesting informal hearing on the Senate side. I hope it is a portent of good things to come. A bipartisan hearing with Senator Specter, Senator Hutchison, as well as Senator Collins on the Republican side, joined with Senators Kennedy, Rockefeller, Wellstone, and myself to talk about this issue and to say that before Congress adjourns, we need to address what is known as the Balanced Budget Act reform as it relates to Medicare and Medicaid. I believe there is a genuine sentiment on the floor of the Senate, a strong bipartisan Senate, that we do this before we go home.  In my conversations with hospital administrators and doctors, those who are managing nursing homes, those who are providing valuable health care services, there is nothing more important to them than getting this done before we leave. No excuse will do. It was part of the general tax relief bill that was pending before Congress, a controversial bill that involved over $250 billion in tax relief over the next 10 years. That bill is caught up in controversy and is going nowhere. The President has said he would have to veto it. The provision in there relative to Medicare and Medicaid would be lost in that process.  It has been reported in the newspapers, and I think it is probably accurate, that the leadership has pulled away from that tax bill now and believes it cannot pass. But we would make a serious mistake if we backed off from our commitment to deal with Medicare and Medicaid before we adjourn this Congress. I think there is a will and there is a way.  I have spoken with the representative from the White House, Mr. Lew, who heads up the Office of Management and Budget, and my colleague and friend, the Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, who understands the importance of this issue to the State of Illinois. I have talked to my colleagues on this floor. We clearly can achieve this. In achieving it, we can send back a message not only to rural hospitals, which frankly are facing the ruin of declining revenues at a time when they are trying to keep their doors open, but also hospitals in the inner cities and hospitals across America, teaching hospitals, and others that rely on these reimbursements.  I urge my colleagues, as we consider the next Congress, let's not forget the remaining agenda of this Congress. It is not enough to pack our bags, wish everyone a happy holiday, and head home. There are important items still to be resolved. We were elected and took an oath of office to resolve this. No excuse will do at this point. Let us pass those pending appropriations bills, make the compromises necessary to do so, and not forget our responsibility under Medicare and Medicaid across the United States to seniors, the disabled, and the disadvantaged, who rely on those programs for quality health care.  I think it can be done. I hope my colleagues join me in making certain we make that effort as we close this session of the Congress.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
