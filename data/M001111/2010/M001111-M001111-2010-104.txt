 President, I would like to take a moment today to recognize Mrs. Frankie Manning of the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle, WA. After over 40 years of service in the U.S. Army and the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mrs. Manning is retiring from government service. A pioneer in championing the needs of women veterans, she helpedcreate the Women Veterans' Program for the Western Region in the 1980s. This program developed standards of care for women in the VA system and is still in place today. She was also instrumental in ensuring that the rural areas of our State received equal access and care from the VA system. My office worked closely with Mrs. Manning to establish the Veteran-Virtual Clinic in Port Angeles, a project that allows 3,000 veterans living on the Olympic Peninsula to access specialty care at the VA in Seattle.  Mrs. Manning has filled many roles within the VA system and served most recently as the nurse executive, overseeing the nursing operations at the Seattle and Tacoma facilities. Mrs. Manning also had a distinguished career in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps, spanning 23 years that included a deployment to Saudi Arabia during the gulf war. Mrs. Manning retired from the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel.  These decades of service to our country demonstrate a dedication to public service matched by few. Mrs. Manning worked tirelessly to ensure the men and women serving in our armed services received the best health care possible and that this care continued for the rest of their lives. I would like to thank Mrs. Manning for her years of service to our country and to the people of Washington State. Her career is a tremendous example of public service, and her commitment to our veterans is truly appreciated. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors and know that her many talents will be missed at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System.                          ____________________
