 I am pleased to follow my colleague from California. I do not know that there are any two more stronger supporters of the institution than the gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio] and I. There are strong supporters on that side of the aisle as well, in particular the chairman of this committee. I believe and agree with the gentleman from California that he is going to be a strong supporter, and that he and the gentleman from New York [Mr. Serrano] are going to make a team that will stand up for honest debate and honest policies with respect to the administration of the House of Representatives, the people's House.                              {time}  1000  But I wanted to follow the gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio] and I wanted to follow him with respect to this investigation that is going on with respect to one of our Members, an investigation that has now been going on for 8 months that is unprecedented.  First of all, it is the first time in history, the first time in history, under the Federal Contested Election Act, where a Member has ever been allowed to have subpoena power to subpoena organizations like Catholic Charities and ask for all their financial records. It is the first time in history that we have not disposed of a Federal Contested Election Act case either because it was withdrawn or because in a preliminary fashion we decided there was not sufficient evidence to move forward.  The gentlewoman from California [Ms. Sanchez]. It is the first time in history in any district in America that INS has been asked to compare the names of the voters with their lists. My colleagues, think of the message that we are sending. Think of the message that we are sending to those Americans; Americans, I stress, of Hispanic background.  I am a Danish-American. Never in history has anybody asked that we check on Danish-Americans through the INS. That is why I am against this rule, because they did not allow debate on this critical issue and recompense of $150,000 to the INS, as they should do.
