President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:45 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the treaty on NATO enlargement. Senator Harkin will then be recognized to offer an amendment regarding U.S. costs.  Under the previous order, there will be 2 hours equally divided for debate on the amendment. At 12:45 p.m., the Senate will recess until 2:15 p.m., to allow the weekly party caucuses to meet.  When the Senate reconvenes at 2:15, there will be 10 minutes of debate equally divided for closing remarks on the State Department Reauthorization Conference Report. Following that debate, at 2:25 p.m., the Senate will proceed to the first of two stacked rollcall votes. The first vote will be on the adoption of the State Department Conference Report, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in relation to the Harkin amendment. Members should expect further rollcall votes throughout Tuesday's session on amendments to NATO enlargement, or any other legislative or executive items cleared for action.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
