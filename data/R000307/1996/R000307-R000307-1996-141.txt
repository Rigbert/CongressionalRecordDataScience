Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois [Mr. LaHood], a very valuable member of the committee.  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Chairman, it is a thrill for me to come down on this floor and speak on this bill because I think it is a very good bill. A lot of hard work has gone into it.  Before I say anything further, I want to pay special compliments to the chairman of the committee. This will be his last farm bill in this House. I know that he will be working on many more farm bills in the other body when he goes over there, but you have done great work, Chairman Roberts, in cobbling together all of the different interests.  I also want to pay my respects to the ranking member, who has added so much to farm policy in America over a long period of time, who is also retiring, not to the other body but back to Texas. And you have contributed mightily to farm policy in America, and I think I speak for Members on both sides who say we are in your debt to both of you for what you have done.  We have a good bill. This bill was not put together on the spur of the moment. There were 19 hearings held around the country, one in central Illinois, where we had 500 people show up and talked to us about what they thought was important about farm policy; 60,000 miles were traveled. This committee has worked hard to put together a farm bill.  The Agricultural Market Transition Act, formerly known as Freedom to Farm, is a very, very good bill. It will save the taxpayers of America, in round numbers, $13 billion over 7 years. It will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $40-plus billion, but it will save an enormous amount, and it will make the reform that is necessary and is needed in farm country and also with relationship to food policy.  This bill has the support of every major farm organization in America, and that is something that I think is also very, very important, because when you look at the diverse group of farm organizations in this country, they represent many different points of view. This bill has bipartisan support. Three Democrats on our committee voted for this bill, as well as all of the Republicans.  In the Senate, a similar bill was passed with 20 Democrats. It is not identical, but it is similar to. It makes the reform that is needed.  When we talk about reforming everything else in Government, we are also talking about reforming agriculture, decoupling agriculture from Government, getting the rules and regulations off the backs of farmers, giving them the flexibility to do what they know how to do best, which is plant and grow crops and provide the food and fiber for our country and for the world.  It makes an awful lot of sense for every Member of this Chamber to support this bill, and for those who had heartburn about certain provisions, they have been allowed to offer their amendments and will offer amendments later on.                              {time}  1430  I think that the Committee on Rules has been very fair in allowing many different points of view to be offered in their amendments.  So in the final analysis, I think it is incumbent upon all Members of this Chamber, both Republicans and Democrats, to support this bill. It is a good bill. It makes sense. For those who think we have taken all too long, at one time you were saying we have not taken enough time. Some say we have taken too much time. The time is now for foreign policy to be set so our farmers and ranchers across the country will know what the policy will be.  Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill. The gentleman from Kansas, Chairman Roberts, deserves a lot of credit for the work he has done. I congratulate the gentleman, and encourage all Members in this body to support this bill.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2854, the Agricultural Market Transition Act. But, first, Mr. Chairman, I want to personally commend the distinguished chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Pat Roberts. Pat, you have done a remarkable job. Your efforts are monumental and revolutionary. I wish you well in the future. Kansas will certainly benefit from your wisdom and tireless efforts for many years to come.  Mr. Chairman, the Agriculture Market Transition Act is a culmination of voices from around the country. Chairman Roberts took the committee on the road to gather input from real farmers. The committee traveled over 10,000 miles and heard from 300 witnesses on what farmers and ranchers wanted in Federal farm policy. The central Illinois men and women, who testified, all first, second, and third generation family farmers, were unanimous in their call for less regulation from Washington and a more market-oriented program, which allows producers to grow according to market signals, and not edicts from Washington. The message was clear, Mr. Chairman: give the family farmer a break. ``Let us decide what to plant, rather than bureaucrats in Washington''.  The Agriculture Market Transition Act, with its 7-year guaranteed payments, does just that. It removes burdensome regulation and allows producers to get more of their income from the marketplace. It frees production agriculture to meet the food demands of emerging economies around the world, as more and more countries embrace democratic ideas and principles. This bill, Mr. Chairman, takes American agriculture into the 21st century to meet those demands.  Mr. Chairman, the American public will not stand for the status quo. They want reform. This bill is reform. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from North Dakota [Mr. Pomeroy].
