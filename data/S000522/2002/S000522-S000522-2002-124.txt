Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, before yielding back the balance of my time, there are a number of people to thank again. I mentioned the Members earlier on. I would like to thank Peter Smith of our distinguished staff; Joseph Rees; Andy Napoli and George Phillips, who worked on this legislation; Nisha Desai, who also worked very hard on the bill; Jed D'Ercole, from the staff of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Roemer), for his work as well; and also Mr. Dan Freeman, who is our parliamentarian extraordinaire, who was also very, very helpful in crafting this legislation.
