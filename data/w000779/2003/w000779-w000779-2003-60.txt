 One very brief question. I have sensed from the beginning of the debate that probably the most contentious issue coming up is this question of making sure the public is still involved in the process, the whole question of what is called NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act.  The Senator is so correct in saying we have made it clear that the Senate bill is not something we are going to allow to be unraveled. But I think one of the reasons for it is because the Senate bill differs very dramatically with what the other body is talking about with respect to keeping the public in the process.  The other body, in effect, takes the public out of the process by predetermining these NEPA alternatives. What we have said in our compromise would be to say the public can actually offer an alternative. The public has a right to go into this process, known as scoping, and actually come to the table and offer an alternative.  The Senator has made the point that not one current opportunity for public comment would be lost under this compromise.  I would be interested in the Senator's analysis of how the public stays involved, because I think this is probably the most contentious question we may be faced with as we try to wrap up this bill, hopefully today.
