President, I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Robert W. Pratt to be a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa. Mr. Pratt is a well-qualified nominee.  We first received Robert Pratt's nomination in August 1996. He was not accorded a hearing last Congress and the President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. He had a confirmation hearing on March 18 where he was supported by Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley and was reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee on April 17, more than 4 weeks ago.  With this confirmation the Senate has confirmed five Federal judges in five months--one Federal judge a month. Even with the three judicial confirmation votes today, there are still almost 100 judicial vacancies in the Federal courts. Since this session began, vacancies on the Federal bench have increased from 87 to 103 and we have proceeded to confirm only five nominees. After these three confirmations, after more than doubling our confirmation output for the entire year in this one afternoon, we still face 98 current vacancies today and that number is continuing to grow. At this rate, we are falling farther and farther behind and more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to the detriment of more Americans and the national cause of prompt justice.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record recent articles on the crisis caused by the vacancies in the Federal courts.  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       [From Time, May 26, 1997] Empty-Bench Syndrome--Congressional Republicans Are Determined To Put                   Clinton's Judicial Nominees on Hold                           (By Viveca Novak)       The wanted posters tacked to the walls of courthouses      around the country normally depict carjackers, kidnappers and      other scruffy lawbreakers on the lam. But these days the      flyers might just as well feature distinguished men and women      in long dark robes beneath the headline ``Help Wanted.'' As      of this week, 100 seats on the 844-person federal bench are      vacant. Case loads are creeping out of control, and sitting      judges are crying for help.       The situation is urgent, says Procter Hug Jr., chief judge      of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers      California and eight other Western states. Hug says that with      a third of its 28 seats vacant, the court has had to cancel      hearings for about 600 cases this year. Criminal cases take      precedence by law, so at both the trial and appellate levels,      it is civil cases that have been crowded out. Civil rights      cases, shareholder lawsuits, product-     liability actions, medical-malpractice claims and so forth      are being pushed to the back of the line, however urgent the      complaints. Chief Judge J. Phil Gilbert of the southern      district of Illinois went an entire year without hearing a      single civil case, so overwhelmed was he by the criminal load      in a jurisdiction down to two judges out of four. ``It's      litigants who end up paying the price for the delays,'' says      A. Leo Levin, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania      Law School.       Things won't improve any time soon. Democratic Senators      have been slow in recommending names to the White House,      which in turn has dragged its feet in forwarding those      recommendations to the Senate for confirmation. At a private      meeting with federal judges last week, Clinton promised to      send close to two dozen new names to Capitol Hill by July 4.      But once they get there, they face new hurdles. Last year the      Senate confirmed only 17 federal district-court judges and      none for the appeals courts. This year looks even worse, with      only two confirmations thus far. The number of days from      nomination to confirmation is at a record high of 183, and 24      seats have been vacant more than 18 months, qualifying them      as judicial emergencies.       This slowdown in judicial confirmations is not due to      congressional lethargy. Just the opposite. With Republicans      firmly in control of the Senate, many of the party's      theorists feel they have the power--and the rightful      mandate--to implement the ideals of a conservative      revolution that lost its focus in recent years. So they      have been not so quietly pursuing a historic change in the      ambiguous ``advise and consent'' role the Constitution      gives the Senate in the selection of federal judges. The      successful assault by Democrats on Ronald Reagan's      nomination of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court helped      open the way for what has become a more partisan and      ideological examination of all judicial nominees.       Some Republicans have as much as declared war on Clinton's      choices, parsing every phrase they've written for evidence of      what they call judicial activism. That label has long been      applied to judges who come up with imaginative new legal      principles in their decisions rather than simply following      the letter of the law or the Constitution. Lately the term      has been tossed around like insults at a brawl. ``The      Republicans define `activist' according to their political      agenda,'' says a federal judge. ``It's O.K. to be an activist      if you're striking down affirmative action and gun-free      school laws. It's not if you're overturning abortions      restrictions and the line-item veto.''       Meanwhile, nominees are left adrift. The federal bench's      poster child of the moment is Margaret Morrow. Nominated in      May 1996 with broad bipartisan support, Morrow was the first      woman president of the California Bar Association, has had a      distinguished career in private practice and could fill a      trophy case with her awards and citations. She cleared the      judiciary committee unanimously but got stuck in last year's      G.O.P. freeze-out on the Senate floor. Clinton sent her name      back up this year, but in the meantime, conservatives began      raising questions about some of her writings the committee      hadn't seen. After another hearing, she received a letter      from Republican Senator Charles Grassley asking her position      on every ballot initiative that's come up in California over      the past decade, in effect asking which levers she pulled in      the voting booth. Morrow's nomination still isn't scheduled      for a vote, and she isn't even the longest-suffering nominee.      That distinction belongs to William Fletcher, named by      Clinton to the Ninth Circuit in April 1995.       Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,      says he would like to clear the backlog. ``Playing politics      with judges is unfair, and I am sick of it,'' he said in      March. But those close to him say he's feeling pressure from      the right, and indeed his remarks have become more combative.      Last week he told a group of judges that he would refuse ``to      stand by to see judicial activists named to the federal      bench.''       Republicans are also aiming rocket launchers at those lucky      enough to have already been issued their robes. Proposals      range from having three-judge panels, rather than a single      judge, hear challenges to ballot initiatives to radical      notions like amending the Constitution to eliminate lifetime      tenure. Lawmakers have taken to threatening impeachment      proceedings against judges whose rulings they dislike. House      majority whip Tom DeLay of Texas, a chief proponent of using      the impeachment process much more freely than it is now, says      he wants ``to make an example'' of someone this year. Some      candidates they're considering: Judge Thelton Henderson in      California, who struck down a voter-approved referendum      ending state affirmative-action programs (he has since been      reversed); Judge John Nixon in Tennessee, who has reversed      several death-penalty convictions; and Judge Fred Biery in      Texas, who has refused to seat a Republican sheriff and      county commissioner because of a pending lawsuit challenging      some absentee ballots. Not mentioned are judges like New      York's John Sprizzo, who freed two men who had blocked access      to an abortion clinic because they acted on religious      grounds.       So far, the Republicans see no real downside to picking on      the third branch of government. ``Some of these rulings have      inflamed mainstream America,'' says Clint Bolick of the      conservative Institute for Justice. ``So when the GOP      elevates this issue, it is seen as a winner.       It's ironic that these fusillades should be coming now,      when even activists like Bolick concede that Clinton's      nominees have been mostly moderate, and liberals are moaning      that the President hasn't done enough to counteract the      effect of 12 straight years of Republican court choices. But      what it adds up to is ``probably the most intense attack on      the judiciary as an institution ever,'' says Robert Katzmann,      a lawyer and political scientist who has written a book on      Congress and the courts. ``The framers of the Constitution      tried to create a system in which judges would feel insulated      from political retribution. That's being undermined.''                     [From U.S. News, May 26, 1997]    The GOP's Judicial Freeze--A Fight To See Who Rules Over the Law                      (By Ted Gest and Lewis Lord)       When Bill Clinton was first elected, liberals thought they      would finally get a chance to rectify what they saw as a      great injustice. For 12 years, Ronald Reagan and George Bush      had packed the judiciary with conservative judges. And their      rulings were shifting power toward police and corporations      and away from criminal suspects, environmentalists, and trade      unions. Clinton, it seemed, would be able to shift the      balance of power back.       Well into Clinton's second term, the judiciary's      composition has barely changed, thanks to an aggressive      Republican strategy of thwarting Clinton's nomineees--and a      remarkable timidity on the president's part. During his first      term, when Democrats controlled the Senate for two years, 202      of his nominations were confirmed. But in the past 16 months,      with the GOP firmly in control, the Senate has approved the      nominations of only 18 district judges and one circuit court      of appeals judge. Roughly 100 judgeships--12 percent of the      judiciary--are vacant, including a record 24 ``judicial      emergencies,'' seats that have been open for at least 18      months. Judges are working nights and weekends on the stacks      of new cases that keep piling up. Countless civil disputes      involving businesses and families--whether a worker should      get a disability benefit, whether a loss is covered by      insurance, whether an alien should be deported--are being      held up for months.       Congress has insisted on playing an unprecedented role. In      the past, the Senate paid close attention to a president's      Supreme Court nominees but usually gave him a free hand in      selecting other federal judges. Now, the Republican Senate is      demanding--and often getting--a voice in whom Clinton      appoints to the district courts, where judges and juries make      basic rulings involving federal law, and to the appeals      courts, which decide most constitutional and other big      issues. ``It's a scandalous and stunningly irresponsible      misuse of the Senate's authority,'' says law professor      Geoffrey Stone, the provost at the University of Chicago.                          authority challenged       The slowdown could become a constitutional showdown. ``In      all of American history there has never been a situation      where a newly elected president has faced this of challenge      to his judicial nominations,'' says Sheldon Goldman, author      of the upcoming book Picking Federal Judges: Lower Court      Selections From Roosevelt to Reagan. ``The gauntlet has been      thrown down to President Clinton. And now we will see if he      is going to fight or if he's going to back off.''       Last week, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, a conservative,      chastised the White House and the Senate for leaving so many      vacancies. ``Unless the executive and the legislative      branches change their ways,'' Rehnquist told the Federal      Judges Association, ``the future for judicial appointments is      bleak.'' He urged judges to meet with senators from their      areas. One judge who recently did is Procter Hug Jr. of Reno,      Nev., chief of the nation's busiest court--the nine-Western-     state 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has lost nine      of its 28 judges to retirement. Hug asked Sen. Orrin Hatch,      chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for action, and      Hatch replied that he would hold one judicial nomination      hearing each month. ``Nationally, there are 25 circuit-judge      vacancies,'' said Hug. ``The have got to hold more than one a      month.''       Republicans are resisting Clinton nominees aggressively in      part because they had to fight so long to get the judiciary      to their liking. The Reagan White House shrewdly decided not      to rely solely on GOP senators, who might have picked judges      mainly because of connections instead of ideology.      Instead, Reagan created the Federal Judicial Selection      Committee, which sought judges willing to reject      affirmative action, give police more authority, allow      restrictions on abortions, and permit voluntary school      prayer.       The emphasis on ideology stirred a hostile Democratic      reaction. Democrats in 1987 successfully blocked the      nomination to the Supreme Court of Robert Bork, which      increased Republican determination to protect their gains.      And they have. Reagan's appointees and those of Bush are now      considered the most conservative since the judges whom      Franklin Roosevelt assailed 60 years ago for curbing his New      Deal, and they make up more than half the federal judiciary.                            failure to fight       Liberals had hoped that Clinton would pull the courts back      from the right and, by the year 2000, establish a majority of      left-leaning judges. But he hasn't. For one thing, he has      been slow to send up nominees, partly because the Senate has      been reluctant to move     those already pending. Clinton has nominated candidates for      fewer than one third of the vacancies. More important, he has      shown an aversion to fighting for controversial nominees. One      prominent example involved an old friend, Georgetown      University law professor Peter Edelman. Clinton decided in      1995 not to nominate Edelman for a seat on the appeals court      in Washington, DC, after conservatives served notice they      would mount a Bork-like challenge, citing Edelman's writings      as ``too liberal.''       In essence, Clinton rejects the liberal view that he should      counter the Reagan-Bush emphasis on conservative views. ``He      doesn't want to make a federal bench in his image,'' House      counsel, Abner Mikva. ``What he really wants is a high-     quality bench that will do the right thing regardless of      ideology.'' Other insiders say that when the White House sets      legislative priorities, it is more interested in winning      votes from key senators on policy issues than in pressing      them to support judicial nominees.       This has left liberal activists bitterly disappointed. ``He      has an enormous opportunity to reshape the federal bench,''      says Nan Aron of the Alliance for Justice, an umbrella      organization of public-interest law groups, ``but rather than      hit the ground running, he has silently tolerated an      unprecedented number of attacks on the federal judiciary.''       Liberals like Aron are doubly disappointed because those      nominations Clinton has pushed have not been particularly      liberal. His trial judges, according to one study, seem      closer in ideology to Gerald Ford's judges than they do to      those of Jimmy Carter, who are considered the most liberal of      current judges.       To the extent Clinton has had a broad agenda for the      judiciary, the guiding principle has been not philosophy but      race and gender. ``Clinton's first term,'' says Goldman, who      teaches political science at the University of      Massachusetts--Amherst, ``was the first ever in which most of      a president's appointments went to women or minorities.''                            not mainstream?       Republicans argue that they have no choice but to hold up      Clinton's nominees because many are ``judicial activists''      far out of the mainstream. One would-be district judge tarred      as an activist is Margaret Morrow of Los Angeles, a former      state bar president who was first nominated to the bench more      than a year ago. In 1988, Morrow wrote an article suggesting      that California might be putting too many questions to a vote      in citizens' referendums. Senators now are demanding to know      her positions on many referendum issues.       ``Judicial activists do not abide by the law,'' says Hatch,      who defines a judicial activist as ``someone who makes law as      a superlegislator and usurps power from two other co-equal      branches.'' Mikva, who was a longtime judge before working at      the White House, offers a different view: ``An activist judge      is a judge who makes a decision you don't like.''       This month, Hatch did remind his GOP colleagues that      Clinton had won and thus was entitled to make nominations.      ``He deserves respect and support for his nominees as long as      they are qualified,'' the senator said. But he also has said      that judicial activists are not qualified.       The Clinton administration insists that it has a grip on      the problem. ``We are doing as much bipartisan consultation      as we can . . . to see how Republican senators' views can be      absorbed into the system,'' says White House Counsel Charles      Ruff. That approach fails to placate Clint Bolick of the      Institute for Justice, a libertarian group. When Clinton was      re-elected, he said, ``the stakes doubled,'' and the prospect      of a Democrat appointing a majority of judges became a ``very      real concern, not an abstract concern.'' Bolick's goal is to      thwart any Clinton choice who doesn't meet his sharply      conservative standards. He expects that in the coming months      his fellow conservatives will go after even more Clinton      nominees.
