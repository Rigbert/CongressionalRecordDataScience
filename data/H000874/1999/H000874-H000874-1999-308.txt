Chairman, I appreciate two things, I suppose. First of all, I appreciate the fact that the gentleman recognizes that we are raising a legitimate concern, which I think is the import of the gentleman's comments and subsequent actions; and secondly, that he has taken action which he believes will ameliorate the fears that we have, or perhaps not eliminate, but certainly ameliorate.  The problem, I say to my friend, the gentleman from Indiana, is that if we give to businesses, and although we call them small businesses, in this case it is up to 1,500, I believe, employees.
