 President, reserving the right to object, I would say to my Democratic friends that no effort to redefine what this is about will be successful.  The issue before the Senate is, has President Obama been treated fairly with regard to the confirmation of judges during his tenure in office? We are to a point where we know that so far during the Obama years, he has gotten 23 more judges than President Bush got to this point. That is the fundamental question. Has President Obama been treated in some way differently from President Bush? The answer, of course, is no. Therefore, I object.
