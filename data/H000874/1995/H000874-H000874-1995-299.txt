Chairman, I want to talk specifically about cuts in this bill which concern me greatly; cuts to the Mission to Planet Earth, a critical NASA program. The President requested $1.34 billion. This bill, unfortunately, includes only $1 billion. That is a lot of money, but it is a very significant reduction from the request and from the level adopted by the Committee on Science this week.  The committee, on Tuesday, reported a bill that authorizes $1.27 billion for Mission to Planet Earth. This is $272 million above the reported appropriation amount.  Mr. Chairman, we should restore that money, if the allocation to this appropriation measure was not so constrained. I understand the problem of the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis] and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Stokes] with respect to the funds available, but this program is a critical program for the future, not only of the space program, but for the future of the ability of those of us on Earth to understand better our environment and our weather.  Mr. Chairman, I would hope that the committee would see fit to increasing this sum as this bill moves through.
