Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Once again I am pleased to join the chairman of the Committee on House Oversight, Mr. Thomas, in support of this resolution. The nominee will, I am sure, make a very outstanding contribution to the work of the Smithsonian Board of Regents.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
