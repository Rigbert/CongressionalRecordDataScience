 Speaker, I want to bring to the Nation's attention, and to celebrate, the winner of this year's Deane C. Davis Outstanding Vermont Business Award, King Arthur, Flour of Norwich, Vermont.  Founded in 1790, back when the Nation's President was George Washington, King Arthur is the oldest flour company in America. It is also one of the most progressive. It had three owners 215 years ago; today, it has 200. For those who work at King Arthur Flour are not just employees: They own the company. In 1996 its management began an Employee Stock Ownership Plan [ESOP]. Today, King Arthur Flour is a 100 percent employee-owned company.  And King Arthur's president and CEO, Steven Voigt, is helping businesses all across the Nation follow the company's example, for Steve Voigt is chair of the ESOP Association. The ESOP Association, founded in 1978, is a national non-profit membership organization, with 18 local chapters, serving approximately 2,400 ESOPs.  King Arthur Flour itself was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1790 and moved its headquarters to Vermont in 1986. The company has grown since then from a regional staple to a brand known nationwide for its purity and consistent quality; from a small mail-order business with five employees in 1990 to the premier baker's resource in America with nearly 200 employees today; from a family-owned operation for five generations to a 100 percent employee-owned business. Its flour is sold in supermarkets in everyone of the Nation's 50 States.  While most of America's flour makers for the retail market have seen their sales decline, King Arthur has bucked the trend: Its sales have increased 15 percent over the past decade. This should be no surprise. Employee ownership is good for business.  Ten years ago, King Arthur made the move toward employee ownership. It holds quarterly owners' meetings, and its employees gather monthly in what they call ``Town Meetings'' to keep information flowing and to make sure decisions are participatory. The company's books are open.  An employee-owned company can have a larger and more progressive agenda than just its core business. King Arthur's employee-owners have established a program that allows them to volunteer up to 40 hours a year to a non-profit orgnization--and get paid by the company for that time. King Arthur knows that simply making and selling healthy, non-bleached and non-bromated flour is not enough: It has been offering free bread-making classes to 12,000 people a year in 40 American cities. And it has taught over 60,000 middle school students to bake bread--and taught them about giving and sharing, by providing the students ingredients so that they can bake bread for local foodbanks.  King Arthur Flour employees are worth recognizing because they show so plainly that CEOs who run companies from the top down, and who reward themselves with 431 times the amount that their average employees make, are not essential to running a corporation efficiently and well. ESOPS are soundly managed, good to work for, forward-looking, environmentally conscious. And they make a profit.  So there are many reasons why, in Vermont, one of our major ESOPs, King Arthur Flour, has just been recognized by the Chamber of Commerce and Vermont Business Magazine as the outstanding business in the entire state.  There is much to be learned from the model that the employees at King Arthur Flour have developed so successfully.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1035]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]            VERMONT'S OUTSTANDING BUSINESS IS EMPLOYEE-OWNED                                 ______                                                           HON.
