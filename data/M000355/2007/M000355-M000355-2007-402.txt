 President, just a brief word about the immigration bill. We could have been wrapping it up tonight.  As I indicated to my good friend, the majority leader, on Thursday afternoon, I thought there was every reason to believe we could have finished the immigration bill by tonight. Instead, we ended up having another cloture vote--in my view, a day or two premature--taking Friday off, and today spending our time on a meaningless resolution giving the President advice about whom the Attorney General ought to be.  Having said that, I appreciate the comments of the majority leader that he would like to finish the immigration bill. There is a substantial number of Republican Senators who believe this bill would be an improvement over the current situation, over the status quo, and so I hope we will be able to chart a path to get us back on track at some point and hopefully complete, on a bipartisan basis, what could well be the most important domestic achievement of this Congress.  I am pleased to hear the majority leader say there is a possibility that we could get back to this measure and wrap it up. That certainly is my hope, and I will look forward to working with him toward that end.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
