 We have a number of, certainly, relevant and important amendments to be considered in the context of that debate. As he may have indicated before I came on the floor, we are in the midst of a discussion about how to go forward on that legislation and at what point we can go forward on it. But I am optimistic that we will be able to work that out sometime in the next day or two and get started so that our Members will have an opportunity to lay down their amendments and get started. We will have a good debate on a very important issue confronting the country.                          ____________________
