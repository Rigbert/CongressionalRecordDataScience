 President, today the Queen of England will ask Theresa May to form a government and become the United Kingdom's next Prime Minister.  Our allies, the British, have stood with us through the toughest of times and remain a valued ally and partner. This was true under Theresa May's predecessor as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister--that is David Cameron, to whom we also send warm regards today--and it was true under the preceding Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as well. We have every expectation it will be true under her leadership as well.  From what I hear, May is tough, savvy, and she has promised to seek unity and ``a strong . . . positive vision for the future'' of her country.  So on behalf of the Senate, allow me to wish her the best in the days to come.                          ____________________
