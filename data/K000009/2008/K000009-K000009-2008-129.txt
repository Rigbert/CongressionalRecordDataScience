Mrs. Johnson is a founder of the Area Office on Aging of Northwest Ohio. She has been a leader of elder and women's issues throughout her accomplished career.  Billie Johnson can claim many ``firsts'': she was the first African American elected Governor of Zonta International--District 5, Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky; she was the first African American woman elected to the Board of Directors of National City Bank; she was appointed by former Governor James A. Rhodes to serve two terms on one of Ohio's first Women's Advisory Boards to recognize the achievements of women throughout the state and to improve opportunities and employment for women; she organized efforts to incorporate under Ohio law the first regional, non-profit office on aging in northwest Ohio; she launched the first SeniorNet Program in northwest Ohio--an affiliate of nationalSeniorNet Inc--that helped older citizens learn how to use computers and navigate the internet; fostered the development of the first information and assistance programs in Lucas County for grandparents and other kin who are raising children; she established the first Elder Friendly Program for Toledo--affiliated with the national Elder Friendly Program--with the assistance of the former Toledo Mayor Jack Ford, to help improve services and accessibility for older citizens shopping in retail stores and local businesses; she fostered the creation of a Senior Safety program for older citizens; and she spearheaded the organization of the first campaign to get a Senior Citizens Tax Levy on the ballot in Lucas County to help increase meals for homebound elders, expand home care for the sick and frail elderly, provide more services of Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers, and expand services for senior centers.  Billie Johnson is widely regarded by her colleagues in the aging network. Her leadership fosters a spirit of cooperation, allegiance and loyalty which is rare. Evidence of her skill is the development of a master plan, in cooperation with many partners, for the re-use of the 42 acres of county-owned land surrounding the Area Office on Aging into a comprehensive, continuing care complex for older adults. As the Area Office on Aging's first and only Executive Director for three decades, Mrs. Johnson has helped in the creation and development of many senior centers, nutrition sites for seniors, transportation programs, health services, adult day care programs, home care, and numerous other services for older adults. She has been an advisor, consultant and speaker for numerous local, state, national and international organizations and agencies serving older persons including: Iowa Commission on Aging, Ohio Department of Aging, National Church Residences, National Council on Aging/NISH, National Caucus and Center on Black Aged, Gerontology Program for the University of Toledo, and numerous Area Agencies on Aging located in Michigan, Ohio, Kansas and Iowa. She was even selected to participate in the United Nations World Conference on Women Forum in 1985 in Nairobi, Kenya. The International Federation on Aging later published excerpts of her white paper in a book entitled: ``Global Aging.''  More important than any professional achievement, Billie Johnson has carried forward the lessons learned at her grandmother's knee as she inspires and teaches her own daughter and granddaughters. She guides them in proud tradition and shows them by example how to be strong women in their own right.  I have counted on Billie Johnson's wise counsel throughout the years, as have many others in our region. She is a compassionate, caring, and dynamic woman, and a fine example to all as a Member of the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame. I know I join with many across our state when I offer my warmest and heartfelt Congratulations!                          ____________________
