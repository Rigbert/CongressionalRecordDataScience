Mr. Speaker, I am a man of peace, not of war. I am a believer in the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence. I am a disciple of the teachings of Gandhi, Thoreau and Martin Luther King, Jr. But there comes a time when force and military might become necessary to put an end to madness. It was Gandhi who said, ``Noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good.'' Mr. Speaker, we cannot sit idly by while thousands of people are murdered in Kosovo.  Today, President Clinton took bold, forceful, and decisive action to stop the slaughter of innocents in Kosovo. We have a moral obligation, a mission and a mandate to prevent a modern day holocaust. I am hopeful that our military action will be swift and sudden, that it will be compelling, and that it will persuade the Serbs that peace is the more excellent path.  Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers today are with our men and women in uniform. May they return home to their friends and families safe, sound and secure in knowing that, through their actions, they have saved the lives of countless men, women and children.                              {time}  1830  Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution.
