 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a thriving and successful business in Kentucky, the K-I Lumber & Building Materials company, headquartered in Louisville. K-I Lumber was founded in Louisville in 1932 by Mr. Walter M. Freeman, Sr., who was working as a lumber salesman for another company in the 1920s. As the Great Depression hit, the company he worked for began to decline, and this enterprising American decided that was the time to strike out on his own.  Mr. Freeman opened K-I Lumber's first headquarters in the Starks Building in downtown Louisville, and began selling carloads and truckloads of lumber to customers in Kentucky, Indiana, and surrounding States. By the early 1950s, he had purchased property for a distribution center and lumberyard. Walt's son, Walt Freeman, Jr., joined the business and began to expand it into Kentucky and Indiana's largest lumber company.  Walt, Jr. grew K-I Lumber until it had nine locations in three States and employed approximately 500 people, turning it into one of the largest independent lumber and building materials companies in the industry and earning it the Home Builders Association of Louisville Associate of the Year award until his passing in 2011.  Now led by the company's chairman, Sharon Freeman, and its president, Bob DeFarraro, K-I Lumber continues to serve as an example of the success Kentucky businesses can achieve with hard work, good leadership, and a passionate spirit. K-I Lumber recently celebrated its current employees for their combined total of 2,074 years of service to the company and to its customers in Kentucky and the region.  Speaking of the company's custom millwork division, Walt Freeman, Jr. was fond of saying ``If you can dream it, we can craft it.'' Whether it is custom millwork for one very special customer, or lumber needs for the largest distributors, K-I Lumber & Building Materials has survived and thrived over the past 80 years by crafting the desires of its customers, employees, and managers into reality. I know my colleagues join me in wishing many more years of success to this proud and locally owned Kentucky business.                          ____________________
