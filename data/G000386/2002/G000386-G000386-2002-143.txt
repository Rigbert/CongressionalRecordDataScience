  The intent is clear. It is an attempt to weaken trade promotion authority and create multiple and unlimited opportunities to derail trade promotion authority procedures during any given session of Congress. If the amendment is agreed to, a single Senator can put forward a resolution which would stop a particular trade negotiation in its tracks. We all know there are some Senators who do not like trade promotion authority and do not even like international trade. Should this amendment be agreed to, you can be assured that the Senate will be considering multiple procedural disapproval resolutions during any Congress.  Let us be clear. This amendment is designed to weaken trade promotion authority procedures, procedures which have effectively worked for over 50 years in advancing international trade interests. It really comes down to this: Either you believe in the proven effectiveness of the trade promotion authority procedures or you do not. If you do, then I strongly urge you to oppose this clever yet potentially devastating amendment.  I yield back the remainder of my time.
