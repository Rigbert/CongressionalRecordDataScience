 As the gentleman recalls, we had a relatively robust discussion about this last week.  Let me, first of all, say that the principle purpose of this bill was, is, and will be on Tuesday the funding of our troops in the field, providing them with the resources necessary to complete successfully or pursue successfully the task that we've given them and to provide for their safety and well-being to the possible extent we can. So that was the intent, it is the intent, and will remain the intent.  Now, let me make a suggestion that providing for some of the poorest nations in the world to be more successful economically will not only be beneficial to our country and to the international economy generally, but also to the safety of our troops, very frankly. It is, obviously, in deep poverty and frustration from which many of the terrorists that we have seen have been recruited. To the extent we provide for the economies of these small, troubled countries, we may well be a safer world, not only economically better off, but from a security standpoint better off. So we perceive the IMF as an integral part of a process of seeking security.  I might say that the IMF, as I quoted last week, very strongly supported by Ronald Reagan, very strongly supported by both President Bushes, but particularly President Bush the First, where they said investing in the IMF was an investment in the well-being of the international community and our own country.  As you indicate, the $108 billion scores at $5 billion because it's a loan guarantee; it's not a giveaway. We believe that the IMF is a very important part of it, and in answer to your question, the IMF will, in fact, be a part--as I think the gentleman probably knows--of the conference report that will be filed perhaps later tonight.  With respect to your second question regarding--well, I guess your third question because your first was about the security of the troops--the third question of Guantanamo, let me, first of all, read a letter, a paragraph of a letter dated June 11 to Mr. Obey and Mr. Inouye, the Senate chairman of the Appropriations Committee, from President Obama.                              {time}  1215  He says, On May 13 I announced I would resist the release of additional detainee photos because I did not believe it would add any additional benefit to our understanding of what happened in the past and that the most direct consequences of releasing them would be to further inflame anti-American opinion and put our troops in greater danger. Earlier today the Second Circuit granted the government's motion that will stay the earlier court order to release the detainees' photos, and we will now move forward with a petition to the Supreme Court to appeal the case.  He goes on to say, I deeply appreciate all you have done to help with the effort to secure funding for the troops, and I assure you that I will continue to take every legal and administrative remedy available to me to ensure that the DOD detainee photographs are not released. Should a legislative solution prove necessary, I am committed to working with the Congress to enact legislation that achieves the objectives we share.  With respect, lastly, Mr. Whip, to the detainees, as you know, one detainee was, in fact, transferred to the United States, to New York, for the purposes of trial. That is not unusual. As the gentleman knows, many terrorists have been tried in the New York District Court in which this trial will occur. In addition to that, four Uyghurs have been ordered released by the court because the court concluded there was no proof of terrorist activity by the Uyghurs. They've been released to Bermuda.  One Iraqi detainee, Mr. Sadkhan, was returned to Iraq. One Chadian detainee was returned to Chad. And Mr. Ghailani, to whom I have referred to earlier, has been transferred to New York City, where there is a standing indictment against him. He'll be tried for his role in the 1998 attacks in Tanzania and Kenya in which the father and brother of one of my constituents, Edith Bartley, were killed, Julian and Jay Bartley. So I, for one, am pleased that this gentleman, and I use that term loosely, unfortunately, but this individual will be tried and brought to justice.  All four Biscoe conspirators have been found guilty and are serving out sentence in the U.S. supermax prison. It has been agreed under the language, as I understand it, that has been adopted that detainees would be brought to the United States for no other purpose than prosecution.
