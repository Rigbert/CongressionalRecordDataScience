I could not help but compare it to what has been happening here in the Congress over the past week and a half.  While Secretary of State Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov have worked diligently to reach a historic agreement to destroy one of the world's largest arsenals of poison gas, the Congress has been consumed by political theater, debating an utterly pointless, politically motivated, doomed attempt to defund the Affordable Care Act. In doing so we are now perilously close to a shutdown of the Federal government that will cause untold damage to innumerable programs on which States, municipalities, and every community and family in this country depend and cost the taxpayers far more than if the government stays open.  Ironically, while just 2 weeks ago Congress was on the verge of authorizing a military attack against Syria, some of the most vocal advocates of an attack are the same Members who are toying with a government shutdown that could make it harder for the United States to help implement the U.N. resolution to destroy Syria's chemical weapons. If the government stops functioning, it will no longer be able to pay the salaries of our diplomats, nor to provide the funds to help pay for the weapons inspectors and the removal and destruction of the weapons.  I commend President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and our new U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power for their extraordinary efforts. We should also recognize the indispensable cooperation of Minister Lavrov and his government. While it will be many months before we know if this agreement will be faithfully implemented and achieve its goals in Syria, it is a dramatic step forward.  I also commend President Obama and Secretary Kerry for their efforts toseize on the positive overtures by the new President of Iran. Again, it is too soon to say where this may lead, but if there is a chance of resolving diplomatically and verifiably the issue of Iran's nuclear program, it would be a monumental achievement.  I ask unanimous consent that Ambassador Power's remarks at the U.N. last Thursday be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Remarks by Ambassador Samantha Power, U.S. Permanent Representative to     the United Nations, at the Security Council Stakeout Following                Consultations on Syria, September 26, 2013       ``Just two weeks ago, tonight's outcome seemed utterly      unimaginable. Two weeks ago the Syrian regime had not even      acknowledged the existence of its chemical weapons      stockpiles. But tonight we have a shared draft resolution      that is the outcome of intense diplomacy and negotiations      over the past two weeks.       Our overarching goal was and remains the rapid and total      elimination of Syria's chemical weapons program. This is a      class of weapons that the world has already judged must be      banned because their use is simply too horrific. This is a      fundamental belief shared by the United States, all members      of the Security Council and 98% of the world.       Tonight, the Council discussed a draft resolution that will      uphold this international norm by imposing legally binding      obligations on Syria--on the government--to eliminate this      chemical weapons program.       This resolution will require the destruction of a category      of weapons that the Syrian government has used ruthlessly and      repeatedly against its own people. And this resolution will      make clear that there are going to be consequences for      noncompliance.       This is very significant. This is the first time since the      Syria conflict began 2\1/2\ years ago that the Security      Council has imposed binding obligations on Syria--binding      obligations of any kind. The first time. The resolution also      establishes what President Obama has been emphasizing for      many months: that the use of chemical weapons anywhere      constitutes a threat to international peace and security. By      establishing this, the Security Council is establishing a new      international norm.       As you know, we went into these negotiations with a      fundamental red line, which is that we would get in this      resolution a reference to Chapter VII in the event of non-     compliance, that we would get the Council committing to      impose measures under Chapter VII if the Syrians did not      comply with their binding, legal obligations.       If implemented fully, this resolution will eliminate one of      the largest previously undeclared chemical weapons programs      in the world, and this is a chemical weapons program--I don't      have to tell you--that has sat precariously in one of the      most volatile countries and in one of the most horrific civil      wars the world has seen in a very long time.       In the span of a few weeks, the curtain that hid this      secret chemical weapons program has been lifted and the world      is on the verge of requiring that these terrible weapons to      be destroyed.       This resolution breaks new ground in another critical      respect. For the first time, the Security Council is on the      verge of coming together to endorse the Geneva Communique,      calling for the establishment of a transitional governing      body with full executive powers. If adopted, we will have      achieved what we were unable to do before--unable to do for      the last 2\1/2\ years--which is to fully endorse the      Communiqu and call for the convening, as soon as possible, of      an international conference on its implementation.       As Ambassador Churkin, with whom we've worked very      productively, has just stated, we are hoping for a vote      tomorrow in the OPCW Executive Council on the OPCW Executive      Council decision. And then in the wake of that vote--and we      hope in the immediate wake of that vote--we would have      Security Council adoption of this text, which we are      optimistic is going to be received very warmly. We're      optimistic for an overwhelming vote.       Before closing, just let me--bear in mind, or note that we      should bear in mind, even as we express appreciation for the      cooperation that brought us to this moment but let us bear in      mind the sobering catalyst for all of this: the use on August      21st of chemical weapons against people who were just      sleeping in their beds, against children who will never get      to share their dreams.       The precipitant for this effort was as ghastly as anything      we have ever seen. And I think the Council members are well      aware of that. A number of the Council members referred to      the events of August 21 and the importance of keeping the      victims of that attack and other chemical weapons attacks in      their minds as we seek to move forward.       The second sobering note, of course, goes beyond chemical      weapons, which is that every day Syrians are dying by      artillery, by air power, by Scuds. This monstrous conflict      has to come to an end. And we are hopeful that the spirit of      cooperation that we carried from Secretary Kerry and Foreign      Minister Lavrov's negotiations in Geneva back to New York,      that that spirit of cooperation will carry over now on      humanitarian issues and, fundamentally, on the political      solution we all know is needed to this horrific conflict.                          ____________________
