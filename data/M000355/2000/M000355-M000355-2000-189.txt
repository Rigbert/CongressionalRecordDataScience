 2: Professor Smith fails to acknowledge the Supreme Court's recent decision in Shrink-Pac.  As for this assertion, I would direct my colleagues to pages 20, 31, 36 and 40 of the published Rules Committee hearing report from March 8 of this year. Professor Smith clearly acknowledged the holding of the Shrink PAC decision, and, in particular explained:       Had I been on the Commission and the case had come forward      under Federal law . . . I would have had no problem voting      for [the] enforcement action . . . .  Of course, the reform groups won't tell you that the Supreme Court agreed with Smith's views and declared campaign finance laws unconstitutional in cases such as Colorado Republican, and McIntyre v. Ohio, and just last year in Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, or that, as Professor Nagle of Notre Dame Law School has written: Smith's ``understanding of the First Amendment has been adopted by courts in sustaining state campaign finance laws.''  Myth No. 3: Professor Smith will not enforce the law.  The letter of Dan Lowenstein of UCLA Law School, a 6 year member of the national governing Board of Common Cause rebuts this myth. He writes:       [Smith] will understand that his job is to enforce the law,      even when he does not agree with it. I doubt if anyone can      credibly deny that [Smith] is an individual of high      intelligence and energy and unquestioned integrity. When such      an individual is nominated for the FEC, he or she should be      enthusiastically and quickly confirmed by the Senate.  Let me address the Democrats' nominee, Commissioner Danny McDonald.  Commissioner McDonald and I are clearly in different campaign reform camps. If I follow the new litmus test that is being put forth by some in this confirmation debate, then I have no choice but to vigorously oppose his nomination.  I want to be clear that Danny McDonald is not my choice for the Federal Election Commission. I have serious questions about his 18-year track record at the FEC. McDonald's views and actions have been soundly rejected by the federal courts in dozens of cases.  Two of these cases even resulted in the U.S. Treasury paying fines because the action taken by McDonald and the FEC was ``not substantially justified in law or fact.'' And, just this month, the 10th Circuit struck down yet another FEC enforcement action as unconstitutional--finding, I might add, that reformer concerns of corruption were unsubstantiated.  I think Commissioner McDonald's voting record has displayed a disregard for the law, the courts and the Constitution. And, it has hurt the reputation of the Commission, chilled constitutionally protected political speech, and cost the taxpayers money.  Equally troubling, is the fact that Commissioner McDonald apparently chose to pursue the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee while serving as a commissioner to the Federal Election Commission.  I must say that I have serious questions about whether an FEC Commissioner exhibits ``impartiality and good judgment'' when he seeks the highest position in his political party and simultaneously regulates that party and its candidates--and regulates the competitor party and its candidates.  All of that being said, I am prepared to reject this new litmus test whereby we ``Bork'' nominations to this bipartisan panel. I am prepared to follow the tradition of respecting the other party's choice and to support Commissioner McDonald's nomination--assuming that McDonald's party grants similar latitude to the Republicans' choice, Professor Smith, which will be voted on first.  As an aside, let me say to my distinguished colleague from Arizona and my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin: even though we are in differentcampaign reform camps and even though we famously disagree on the First Amendment and federal election law, I would wholeheartedly support either of you to serve as the Democrat's nominee to the Federal Election Commission.  I urge my colleagues to also reject this new litmus test of barring government service for those who question Congress and its laws. Harvard Law professor and former solicitor general of the United States, Charles Fried, has summed up this point. This is what Solicitor Fried had to say:       I address . . . the proposition that because [Professor      Smith] has been critical of the Commission to which he has      been nominated and some of the laws which it administers he      is somehow disqualified for confirmation to the post of      Commissioner. This argument is not only dangerous, but so      far-fetched, so out of line with historic practice, that it      is hard to believe it is not being deployed strategically      only, and that those who urge it in this case would not      repeat it were they more in sympathy with the nominee or his      philosophical orientation. . ..       [I]f these arguments against Mr. Smith should prevail it      would have two dangerous consequences. It would limit more      and more the administration of laws to zealots. And it would      inhibit robust debate about the wisdom of laws, by using      views expressed in such debates as weapons used deny the      opportunity for public service on the basis of those views.      The first danger would give us an administration of zealots;      the second an administration of malleable non-entities.  In conclusion, I believe that Professor Smith's intelligence, his work ethic, his fairness, his knowledge of election law and--to quote from the statute: his ``experience, integrity, impartiality and good judgment'' will be a tremendous asset to the FEC and to the American taxpayers who have been forced to pay for unconstitutional FEC actions.  Professor Smith is a widely-respected and prolific author on federal election law, and, in my opinion, the most qualified nominee in the twenty-five year history of the Federal Election Commission. I wholeheartedly support his nomination to the bipartisan Federal Election Commission.  I yield the floor.

Senator Mitch McConnell,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I have found that one of the main      principles of political sciences is that power, like nature,      abhors a vacuum. The current reform measures being considered      by the Congress, including the McCain-Feingold bill on      campaign finance and ``soft money'' regulation, will have the      opposite of their intended effects, which (apparently) is the      restriction of the power of special interests. The problem is      that weakening parties always increases the power of interest      groups.       This opinion is widely held among social scientists, but      the fact that so many people recognize the danger of      legislation is not often recognized. As a way of bringing      this fact to public notice, I have solicited the signatures      of colleagues on the attached latter. Forty-five      distinguished scholars of the political process, including      six past Presidents of the Public Choice Society, have asked      that I list their names as supporters. This I have done, and      offer the attached open letter as a means of ensuring that      the dangers of wrong-headed reforms can be prevented.           Sincerely,                                                Michael C. Munger,                                   Professor of Political Science. Scholars' Letter to Congress: Why Campaign Finance ``Reform'' Is Ill-                       Advised and Will Not Work     Senator Mitch McConnell,     Chairman, Senate Rules Committee.       Dear Senator McConnell and Members of Congress:      Restrictions on campaign donations or expenditures do little      to limit the total amount spent on campaign and make      campaigns less competitive. Such rules entrench incumbents,      force donations to take hidden forms, increase corruption      through such mechanisms as ``straw donations,'' and make it      more likely that wealthy candidates will win election.       Campaign finance restrictions are similar to price controls      that deal with the symptoms rather than the reasons for the      donations and are likewise doomed to fail. With campaign      financing amounting to less than one-tenth of one percent of      government expenditures, campaign spending does not seem      large in either an absolute sense or relative to other      product advertising. The restrictions force campaign      expenditures to be spent in less effective ways and actually      leave voters less well informed.       The McCain/Fiengold bill's provisions on parties making      independent and coordinated expenditures on behalf of      candidates, and prohibitions on issue advocacy that refers to      a candidate, as well as restrictions on raising or spending      ``soft money'' in connection with elections are typical of      the rules that produce these problems. So called      ``voluntary'' limits that restrict who can help certain      candidates who violate certain rules are anything but      voluntary.       The different forms contributions can take are essentially      infinite and this makes regulation exceptionally difficult.      For example, in the extreme case, it would be possible to buy      up television and radio stations or newspapers to support      particular candidates. Providing favorable new coverage for      desired candidates would certainly benefit their candidacy,      but it is difficult to see how these kinds of ``in-kind''      donations would be regulated.       We advise Congress, before enacting yet more new laws, to      investigate whether many of the existing laws may have      contributed to the problems we currently face. The new      legislation is ill-advised.           Sincerely,       Professor Brandice Canes, Department of Political Science,      Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
