Chairman, as I understood the gentleman's answer was that the local governments needed to have this information coordinated and sent back to them on literacy.  Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman. What I said was that the $5 million was for work done here in Washington to coordinate that information, to send it back to the locals. But the money that the gentleman's amendment is adding back in is going to  be  spent  here  in Washington. I believe I am correct on that. If I am not, I stand to be corrected, but staff seems to believe that is the case.  The gentleman, in his answer to me, simply said that we sent it back, that we sent that information back. That is correct. He said they need it; they need that kind of coordination from Washington. I appreciate his observation.
