Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), ranking member, for yielding me this time.  I also want to thank the gentleman from California (Chairman Hunter) for including the amendment concerning America's energy independence in the en bloc amendments. I thank him for helping us move toward energy independence.  We all know that our Nation is petroleum addicted, that those supplies are being drawn down from the most undemocratic places in the world. America has to change and the world has to change in this century.  This amendment requires the Department of Defense and related agencies to conduct a study and report back to Congress on the use of new fuels, biodiesel and ethanol, that can be manufactured right here in the good old U.S.A. and used by the Armed Forces and the defense agencies, as compared to how the Department currently uses petroleum.
