Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chet Walker of Benton Harbor, Michigan, who was elected to both the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 7, 2012.  Mr. Walker began his career as the star of Benton Harbor High School's basketball team, leading the school to the Class A Boys' state finals in 1958. He then matriculated to Bradley College in Peoria, Illinois, where he became the school's all-time top scorer and rebounder, and was a two-time unanimous First Team All-America pick. Mr. Walker led the Bradley Braves to victory in the 1960 National Invitation Tournament and finished his college career with an outstanding 69-14 win-loss record.  His success as a college athlete caught the attention of the NBA, and after graduation Mr. Walker was drafted by the Syracuse Nationals in the second round. Mr. Walker continued in his tradition of success, and was named to the first ever NBA All-Rookie Team. The rest of his professional basketball career proved to be exceptional: over the span of his 13 years, Mr. Walker scored 18,831 points and grabbed 7,314 rebounds, had a free throw percentage of 79.6, was a seven-time All-Star, and won the 1967 NBA championship with what is considered by many today to be the greatest basketball team of all time.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Mr. Walker's achievements and am glad that he is being properly respected for his contributions by the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame and the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Chet Walker is one of the greatest to ever play the game and we are so proud in southwest Michigan.                          ____________________
