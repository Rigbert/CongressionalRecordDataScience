 President, I am offering today, legislation that would provide permanent residency to Suchada Kwong, a recently widowed young mother of a U.S. citizen child who faces the devastation of being separated from her child and family here in the United States.  Suchada Kwong's U.S. citizen husband, Jimmy Kwong, was tragically killed in an automobile accident in June of 1996, leaving a 3-month-old U.S.-born son and his 29-year-old bride.  Because current law does not allow Suchada to adjust her status to permanent residency without her husband, Suchada now faces deportation.  Suchada and Jimmy Kwong met in Bangkok, Thailand, through a mutual friend in 1993. He communicated with her frequently by phone and visited her every time he was in Bangkok. They fell in love and were married in September 1995, and Suchada gave birth to Ryan Stephen Kwong in May 1996.  Suchada was supposed to have her INS interview on August 15, 1996. However, Jimmy was killed in an accident in June, less than 3 weeks after his son was born and 2 months short of the INS interview. Now, because the petitioner is deceased, Suchada is ineligible to adjust her status. While the immigration law provides for widows of U.S. citizens to self-petition, that provision is only available for people who have been married for over 2 years.  Suchada's deportation will not only cause hardship to her and her young child but to Suchada's mother-in-law, Mrs. Kwong, who faces losing her grandson, only a short time after she lost her only son.  Mrs. Kwong is elderly, and though she is financially capable, could not care for her grandson herself. Mrs. Kwong is proud to be self-supporting, having owned and worked in a small business until her retirement. The family has never used public assistance, and through Jimmy's job, the family has sufficient resources to support Suchada and Ryan. It would also be difficult for Suchada as a single mother in Thailand. Here in the United States, she has the support of Mrs. Kwong and their church.  Suchada was granted voluntary departure for one year on October 1996 to explore other options or prepare to leave the United States. During that time period, Suchada and her family have explored all options but failed. Now, the voluntary departure period has expired and Suchada must leave the country, leaving behind her young child and her family here in the United States.  Suchada has done everything she could to become a permanent resident of this country--except for the tragedy of her husband's death 2 months before she could become a permanent resident. I hope you support this bill so that we can help Suchada begin rebuilding her life in the United States.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1961       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.),      Suchada Kwong shall be held and considered to have been      lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent      residence as of the date of the enactment of this Act upon      payment of the required visa fees.                                 ______                                       By
