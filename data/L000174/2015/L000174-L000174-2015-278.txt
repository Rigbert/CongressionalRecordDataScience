President, of course I also would like to see the trafficking bill go forward.  I am looking around the floor of the Senate, and I think I am the only person standing on the floor who has actually prosecuted people for molestation and endangerment of children.  I am not going to repeat what I said yesterday. I talked about some of those horrible cases, and I did mention having young children of my own at the time and how hard working on those cases hit me. When normally preparing for trials--in the evenings, in most cases--I could just work at home preparing for the trial. When preparing for these types of cases however, I didn't come home. I would work in my office for two reasons. I didn't want to take any chance, inadvertently, that one of my children would see any of the pictures or the exhibits that we were going to have in the trial, as graphic as they were. But also, I didn't want them to see their father crying, which I did as I would read these files, and have them ask me why I was crying, because I couldn't lie to them. It was better just to stay in the office.  I say that because we have to approach this not just in the after-the-fact manner expressed. I like the idea of having the $30 million to help those who have been hurt--the victims. I worry, as the House of Representatives worried, that if it is simply money that comes from fines, we are never going to see that money. All the people I prosecuted on crimes against young people went to prison. If you could have given them a $50 million fine or a $50 fine, they weren't going to pay it. They had no money. After their defense was over, they had no funds.  At some point we are going to have to correct that. Say $30 million is a good target, and any fines will go into that fund, but we should take taxpayers' funds to make up any difference.  When we lock these people up, we spend $25,000 or $35,000 a year to lock them up. But half of the time we tell the victim: It is terrible what happened to you. Sorry, we can't do anything for you.  We also have to approach the things necessary to prevent what happened. I am filing a Leahy-Collins amendment, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking Prevention Act. I will file that. The amendment will help runaways such as Holly Austin Smith. She was 14 years old when she was lured away from home by a man who promised her a glamorous life in California. Instead, he sold this 14-year-old for sex. She told her devastating story to the Senate Judiciary Committee last month. Both Senator Grassley and I were there and heard it. I was certainly moved by her words and call for action.  She told us to protect girls such as her, saying that ``policies on prevention should be one of our highest priorities.'' I agree. That is why Senator Collins and I are offering this amendment.  Of course we should have the ability to go after somebody who has committed these crimes. But wouldn't it be better for the victims if we could stop the crime from happening in the first place? If we can do something to help people such as this 14-year-old and we can stop it from happening in the first place, we would be much better off.  Too many of the runaway and homeless youth in this country have no place to go. They have no place to sleep at night. They are alone on the street without resources or adults to protect them, and human traffickers know that. One shelter survey found that 50 percent of the homeless youth have been solicited for sex by an adult within 48 hours of leaving home.  I ask any parent or grandparent in this Senate: What would you think if your children or grandchildren were put in that situation?  This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue, this is a human issue--this is an American issue.  It is our hope that we can work around what I hope is a momentary glitch in this bill so we can get to these things.  I will say again, based on my own experience as a prosecutor and based on everything I have heard over the years--part of the time as the ranking member and part of the time as chairman of the Judiciary Committee during the past 40 years--that when it comes to the fight against human trafficking, we cannot simply focus on ending demand and arrest our way out of this problem. We have to eliminate the conditions that make these children so vulnerable.  The good news is the program supported by this amendment has helped thousands of young people get back on their feet by providing shelter, job training, and caring adults to counsel and guide them. These programs work. They keep kids safe, and they save lives.  A growing number of homeless and runaway youth are LGBT, and many of them have been thrown out of their homes for who they are. Again, as a parent and grandparent, that is heartbreaking to me. We have to ensure that these particularly vulnerable children, who have already been rejected once, do not face rejection again, and that is why Senator Collins and I included a nondiscrimination provision in our amendment that will make clear that any program accepting Federal dollars must help care for all of these children. They can't turn these young people away because they do not like the way they look or dress or who they love. No program that takes Federal money should be allowed to discriminate, period.  The nondiscrimination language in this bill is nearly identical to the language that 78 Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike--supported in this body when we passed the Violence Against Women Act in the last Congress, the Leahy-Crapo bill. It is the same language the Republican-controlled House passed and the President signed into law 2 years ago.  Last year, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I moved this legislation through committee and Senator Grassley and Senator Cornyn, to their credit, and almost every Republican on the Judiciary Committee voted for it. If these protections are acceptable for adult victims of domestic and sexual violence, why shouldn't they be for children? No one should be discriminated against, but especially not these vulnerable children who have already faced more adversity than many of us will ever know.  We, as Senators, lead a privileged and sheltered life. We work hard, but it is still a privileged and sheltered life. We are not facing what these children are facing--a scared, vulnerable, lonely child at a bus stop or trying to get somebody to buy them a pizza because they are hungry or looking for a place where they can sleep out of the cold. We are never going to face that, but too many Americans do.  Some may argue and say that the antidiscrimination language somehow threatens religious freedom. That is not true. No one's religious freedom is threatened by this language. This is not about religion, it about supporting all of the children who most desperately need our help.  I understand their concerns. We have narrowed the scope of this provision so it applies only to these programs being reauthorized in this amendment. We have also clarified that nothing in this bill stops organizations from providing necessary sex-specific programming, such as shelters for homeless, runaway, or trafficked girls.  I have heard from dozens of service providers in my State of Vermont, and also across the country, that these programs work.  As Cyndi Lauper, a long-time advocate for homeless and runaway youth, wrote in an op-ed for The Hill yesterday, ``The time to act is now, because homeless youth don't have the time for us to wait until tomorrow.''  Who will help these young people if we do not? These children are too often left behind, and for too many being left behind means being trafficked. We cannot and should not leave them behind today.  I urge all Senators that when the amendment is called up to support it. I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed that was in The Hill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From The Hill, March 10, 2015] Don't Let the Senate Throw Away 40 Percent of America's Homeless Youth                           (By Cyndi Lauper)       ``Enough is enough.'' It's a phrase that is said all too      often about so many issues in our society, but unfortunately      not enough when it comes to our nation's most vulnerable      young people.       Congress must reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth      Act (RHYA), our nation's only federal law that specifically      funds vital services for homeless youth. Republicans and      Democrats have come together to ensure that our Federal      Government offers much needed support to all homeless youth.       Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine)      have introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize RHYA,      which will likely be brought up for a floor vote in the      Senate this week--possibly as soon as today.       The act includes a non-discrimination clause that will help      ensure lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)      homeless youth not only have access to critical services, but      that those services are safe, welcoming, and tailored to meet      the needs of all youth.       We need that clause and some groups are trying to push to      have it taken out. I was taught to listen to Proverbs 31:      Speak up for those who cannot speak up for themselves. Our      kids need us to protect them, not to discriminate against      them.       Research shows that while LGBT youth make up to seven      percent of the general youth population, they comprise, on      average, 40 percent of the 1.6 million youth that are      homeless in this country each year. Think about that. It's      impossible to ignore.       There is no getting around the fact that these kids are too      often being thrown out of their homes and left to fend for      themselves on the streets. The fact that this occurs each and      every day in our country is simply a tragedy--a tragedy that      does not have to continue.       At the True Colors Fund, we continue to hear stories of      young people being discriminated against, offered improper      services, and even turned away by service providers just      because they happen to be lesbian, gay, bisexual, or      transgender. By continuing to leave 40 percent of our      homeless youth unprotected, we are cutting our society off at      the knees.       Kids actually ARE our future. What kind of future do we      have in store if we do not care for all of our youth? ALL      deserve to have their needs met so that these incredible and      courageous young people can achieve their dreams and become      healthy, happy, and contributing members of our society.      These are our future teachers, parents, and leaders and we      cannot afford to leave even one of them behind.       Programs and services receiving federal funding must be      inclusive of all youth. Congress can start by passing the      Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act to      ensure that all youth are protected in the vital programs      that it would reauthorize. The time to act is now, because      homeless youth don't have the time for us to wait until      tomorrow.
