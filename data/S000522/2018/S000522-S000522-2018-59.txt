Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), who serves on the Education and the Workforce Committee and the Homeland Security Committee. His home State of Kansas was just ranked number five as the most pro-life State in the country by AUL's 2018 Life List. I thank him for his leadership all these years as well.
