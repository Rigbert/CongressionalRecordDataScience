                      Arts as Part of Our History  Mr. President, throughout this nation's history, the arts have been an integral part of our background and heritage. Over the years, music, dance, art, and personal expression have evolved to reflect our changing culture and attitudes. In a country of great diversity, from education and socioeconomic background to political perspective and religious views, all people should have the opportunity to experience America in its many forms, including the arts.                            NEA Is a Success  In 1966, when Congress created the National Endowment of the Arts, the mission was to expose all people, across the nation, from California to Maine, from New York to North Dakota, of all backgrounds and origins, to music, dancing, theater, art and literature. Since then, the NEA has more than succeeded with its mission. The NEA helps support community festivals, rural chamber music, arts centers, galleries, arts libraries, town halls, children's organizations, and other social and civic institutions where families can experience the arts. NEA-sponsored programs build bridges of understanding among diverse groups of Americans.                           Economic Benefits  The arts also stimulate local economies. By attracting tourist dollars, the arts stimulate business development, encourage urban renewal, attract new businesses, and improve the overall quality of life for our cities and towns. Nationally, nonprofit arts organizations generate an estimated $37 billion in economic activity and return $3.4 billion in federal income taxes to the U.S. Treasury each year. In other words, for every $ 1.00 dollar spent by the NEA, $34.00 are returned to the United States. Every $1.00 spent by the NEA attracts $12.00 to the arts from other sources.                      Increased Job Opportunities  The arts also create job opportunities for more Americans. More than 1.7 million Americans are employed in the non-profit arts industry. This number is higher than any other profession including legal services, police and firefighting, mining, advertising, and forestry and logging. Since 1970 the number of artists employed in the U.S. has more than doubled. Even with this increase, the United States still spends nearly fifty times less on the arts than any of its major allies.                 Creates State and Federal Partnerships  To ensure that people across the country have access to arts programs, the NEA promotes partnerships between the state and arts agencies, schools and local organizations. This cooperative system of arts support links local, state and regional associations in order to ensure that support and assistance is provided to organizations that work with culturally diverse populations, older adults, people with disabilities, and individuals living in institutions. Before the NEA, only 5 states had state-funded arts councils. Today, all 50 states do. Currently, the NEA sustains 25 partnerships with federal agencies including the Departments of Education and Justice, the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, and the National Science Foundation.                           education Benefits  The arts can improve learning and be part of a well-rounded education. Research from 1995-97 from the College Entrance Examination Board shows that students who studied the arts scored an average of 83 points higher than non-arts students on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, the SAT. Children with a piano background have also scored better on math tests.  The NEA and the state arts agencies provide $30 million in annual support for more than 7,800 arts education projects in more than 2,400 communities. In 1997, the NEA invested $8.2 million, 10 percent of its annual grant dollars, in kindergarten through grade 12 arts programs. Arts education improves life skills including self-esteem, teamwork, motivation, discipline, and problem solving that help young people compete in a challenging and high-tech workforce.              nea affects california and states nationwide  Cutting funding means cutting programs. NEA has supported many California efforts: programs such as the I Do Dance Not Drugs program in South Central Los Angeles that works with latch-key kids would be demolished; a grant to the Pacific Symphony Association in Santa Ana, California funds Class Act, 95 a program which supports and enhances music education for up to 17,000 students at 20 elementary schools in Orange County through a series of activities, including repeated interaction with an Orchestra musician and direct exposure and interactive experiences with the Orchestra and the music it performs, would not be possible without NEA funding; to support a comprehensive education program at Berkeley public elementary schools, the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra will help train teachers in music, encouraging student interaction with the composer, an introductory orchestral concert, classroom visits, and a culminating presentation at which students perform side by side with Berkeley Symphony Orchestra professional musicians; the California Arts Council supports arts education and the partnership project with the California Assembly of Local Art Agencies to strengthen the State's local art agencies; programs which support Native American artists in Eureka, California to put on workshops for students and citizens on art could be terminated.                          Public Supports NEA  By a margin of 3 to 1, Americans support govemment-funded arts programs. Moreover, a 1996 Lou Harris poll states that 61 percent of Americans said they would be willing to pay $5.00 more in taxes to fund the arts. This is important because private donations tend to support larger arts organizations, not smaller, independent projects and groups. The NEA works hard to fund a wide range of expression.                              NEA Reforms  With reforms now requiring grantees to adhere to strict guidelines, trying to address the concerns of some who worry that some projects are objectionable can rest assured. National panels of private citizens select grantees in a rigorous, democratic review process.  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues that the total for arts and humanities-related spending for the 1997 fiscal year was less than 1% of the total budget. The National Endowment for the Arts costs each American about 36 cents per year. Arts institutions have affected millions of Americans. Whether its been watching a famous play, wandering through a beautiful museum, or having the opportunity to live a dream by singing on stage in a local theater company, the NEA fosters an excellence, diversity, and vitality of the arts in the United States which could never be matched by any other institution. It represents a national commitment to excellence our nation's culture, heritage, and, most important, its people. The NEA benefits our citizens, educational institutions, economy, and our spirits. We cannont, in good faith, deny Americans access to such an national treasure.                          ____________________
