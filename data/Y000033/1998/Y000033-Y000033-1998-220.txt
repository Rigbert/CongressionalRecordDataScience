Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3164, the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation, which was introduced by our colleague, Jim Saxton, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife, and Oceans.  The purpose of the bill is to make much-needed improvements in the U.S. nautical charting program. The United States, and especially the State of Alaska, is dependent on marine transportation. However, every day large ships traverse 40,000 square miles of U.S. waterways that have shallow waters, known obstacles, and obsolete or inadequate charts. The vast majority of these critical areas are in Alaska. At last year's funding level, it will take more than 30 years to update the charts in Alaska alone. In the meantime, we are entrusting a significant portion of the Nation's oil supply, the safety of fishermen andcruise ship passengers, and the health of the marine environment to inadequate charts. This situation is not acceptable.  H.R. 3164 will help to correct this problem. First, it authorizes increased funding for nautical charting. Second, it will increase the use of private survey contractors to supply data used in producing U.S. charts. This will greatly increase the number of ships and other resources that can be used to reduce the backlog as quickly as possible.  We cannot afford to wait any longer to correct the nautical charting backlog. H.R. 3164 is an important contribution to fixing this problem, and I urge all of you to support it.
