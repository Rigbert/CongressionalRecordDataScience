Mr. Speaker, I rise against this election-year gimmick; 4.3 cents has nothing to do with the price of gasoline and everything to do with trying to buy an election, but the American people will not be fooled.  Not one voter, but not one voter from the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia has contacted me in support of this ill-conceived idea. Every letter, every phone call I have received has a simple message: Vote ``no''. Do not play games. Do not sacrifice common sense for nonsense.  The Concord Coalition, economists and deficit hawks all agree this is a bad bill. It is a silly bill. It is downright silly.  We must stand for something, my colleagues, or we will fall for anything. We cannot just pay lipservice to deficit reduction, we must vote for it. I urge my colleagues, all of us, to vote no.
