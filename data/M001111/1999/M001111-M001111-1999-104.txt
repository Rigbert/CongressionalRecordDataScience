 President, I commend our colleagues who are concerned about bureaucracy. That is one of the great things about the class size initiative. It was passed in a bipartisan manner last year. One form, one page takes one administrator a few minutes to fill out, and the class size money goes directly to hire teachers. Our Federal tax dollars go to pay for the teacher in the classroom--no bureaucracy, no big charts. The money goes to make a difference. That is why we believe it is the right way to go.  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York.
