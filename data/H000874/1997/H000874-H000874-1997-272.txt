Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up on what the gentleman said, because the chairman of our committee who works very hard and is very knowledgeable on this institution references the progress that has been made over the last 5 years, and I think that ought not to go without being referenced.  When in 1993 we adopted the economic program of this administration,to a person, to a person, the then-minority party stood and said the adoption of this program will lead effectively to the ruination of America's economy. To a person. The chairman of the Committee on the Budget now, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich], stood and said this is going to lead to high unemployment, high inflation and a ruinous economy. The gentleman from Texas [Mr. Armey], who tells us repeatedly that he is an economist, said to the President and said on the floor of this House that the adoption of that economic program would lead to disaster for America's future.  Mr. Speaker, it is refreshing and honest to hear in fact the opposite has occurred. The gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas], a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, has just ticked off where this economy now stands, not because of anything that was adopted in 1995 or 1996. As a matter of fact, the now-majority party laments the fact that the President did not allow them, as a result of vetoes, to enact their program so that they cannot honestly claim credit for the performance of this economy.  And in point of fact, as Alan Greenspan, appointed by George Bush, not by a Democrat, observed, this economy is in the best shape that he has seen it in in over 3 decades. He so testified before the Joint Economic Committee.  Yes, we consider a budget resolution for the committees of this House. As my colleagues know, it is always in my experience somewhat of a political exercise; the majority party points out how fiscally responsible they are being, and very frankly the minority party says, ``Well, you're being a little hypocritical.'' I really do not want to get too engaged in that debate.  Mr. Speaker, I think that this funding resolution is relatively reasonable. I have disagreements with parts of it. Very frankly, I think we are substantially wasting the taxpayers' money, wasting the taxpayers' money by funding this investigation in the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight way over what the U.S. Senate said was necessary to come to grips with the facts, and in fact, unlike the Senate who more honestly wants to look at the generic problem, this study obviously is a partisan attempt to embarrass the President of the United States, not to come to grips with what the facts are, as the U.S. Senate studied much broader in scope and much cheaper in cost.  Then, of course, we have this interesting device, the $7.9 million extra fund. Mr. Speaker, that does a number of things. No. 1, it allows committees to report that they are getting less money than ultimately they may get. No. 2, I would suggest to those who are very concerned about the reforms that have been brought to bear by the Republican revolution in 1995 when they said one of the things the Democrats are doing, my colleagues, is allowing agencies, horrors, to fund committee staff.  Now what did that mean? That meant detailees from various agencies were sent to committees for the purposes of working on substantive issues of which they had knowledge.  Well, lo and behold, the Republican revolution said that was wrong, it was obfuscation, it was hiding the actually costs. And so what did they do? They said we are not going to allow that anymore.  Lo and behold, my colleagues of this House, particularly those who came as freshmen in the revolution; lo and behold, there is $5-plus million in this budget resolution which we do not see. It is not included, it is not computed in the figure. Why? Because we have now changed our policy and we have said well, maybe we will allow detailees to be funded by agencies but to be utilized by committees.  My, my, my. Five million dollars in addition to the $7.9 million that does not show up in the committee budgets.  Now, as I said at the beginning, Mr. Speaker, these funding resolutions can be demagogued on both sides, and are historically.                              {time}  1130  I do not like to participate in that. I think the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas] has tried to come to grips, and from his side of the aisle, there are obviously disagreements within his own caucus. Some say that it ought to be far less and some say it ought to be more. That is the dynamics of funding enterprises where we are trying to come to grips with an administration, an executive department of government that has gotten at least $550 billion, which this Congress has the responsibility of overseeing.  We suggest a budget over two years of about $180 million to do that. I do not think the taxpayer, when they relate that $540 billion or $50 million of discretionary spending in the executive department, is taking that a coequal branch of government has the ability.  I frankly want to tell the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas], the chairman of my committee, the Committee on House Oversight, I thought $222 million was an appropriate sum. Was it exactly the right sum? I do not know that, but the fact of the matter is, I did not think it was out of line with this Congress's responsibility to oversee the operations of the executive department, Republican or Democrat.  Our constituents expect us to know what is going on. Our constituents expect us to know what are the proper amounts that we ought to fund. Our constituents expect us to know what the authorizing committees should do in oversight, in exercising the appropriate amount of care and diligence in determining whether the executive agencies are, in fact, operating effectively, honestly, within their budget, and spending the taxpayers' money appropriately.  That was a good investment. We can argue back and forth on the specific dollar amounts. But let us be clear: Irrespective of the amount in this funding resolution, the chairman did in fact point to what is important, and what is important is the policies adopted that have affected the quality of life in America.  In 1993 President Clinton came forth with an economic program, very controversial, and opposed to a person by the now majority party, the then minority party, with the observation that it would lead to disaster. In fact, as the chairman has very appropriately noted, not only has it not led to disaster, it has led to high employment, low unemployment, low inflation, higher working standards, a better dollar; in fact, a dollar that is so strong that perhaps we are going to have to evaluate whether or not we made the economy too strong. I read in this morning's paper, those who have talked about growth over and over and over and talked last Congress about how slow the growth was, I am sure we are glad to see that we had a 5.6 or 5.1, I am not sure which, GDP growth in the last quarter.  I say to my colleagues of this House, whether we adopt this funding resolution, and I presume we are going to, any funding resolution will be controversial. I know that there will be some of my colleagues, rightfully, who will want to make a statement that being penny wise and pound foolish by increasing spending on the operations of the House of Representatives, while at the same time reducing by a factor of $38 million assistance to women, infants, and children, which every side of the argument agrees has a tremendously positive payoff for children and families and for America, is an appropriate debate. And some of my colleagues will want to vote ``no'' on this, to make that very point that our priorities are skewed.  Mr. Speaker, I want to say that as we do vote on this funding resolution, let us on both sides of the aisle stop demagoguing this institution, stop belittling this institution. This institution has a critically important function to carry out. We are the people's House, elected every two years, closest to the people, to carry out the functions of adopting policy and overseeing its implementation. I think we have done that reasonably well; not perfectly by any stretch of the imagination.  But as we move forward on the debate, which I guess now is going to conclude on this funding resolution, let us understand that under the Democratic administration and the democratically controlled House and Senate, America, in the last five years has seen its deficit come down dramatically to a third of what it was when we took over, and its economy grow substantially to the benefit of its citizens and indeed the world.
