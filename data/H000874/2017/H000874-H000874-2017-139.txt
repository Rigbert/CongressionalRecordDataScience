 It is an amendment made in Rules. Is that going to be an amendment that will be made in order for full consideration and debate on the floor of the House of Representatives?  Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, I do not speak for the Rules Committee. It will be their process and their determination. It is a committee. They will decide as a committee.
