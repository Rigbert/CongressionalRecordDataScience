President, today I again will discuss mercury pollution and the serious and immediate health risks it poses to the health of citizens across our Nation.  This is not a new issue. We have known about mercury pollution for decades, and it remains one of, if not the last, major toxic pollutant without a comprehensive plan to control its release. We know where the sources mercury pollution are, we know where the pollution deposits, and we definitely know what harm it causes to people and to wildlife.  We need to confront mercury pollution because it is a threat to pregnant women and children. The Environmental Protection Agency's own scientists estimate that one of every six women of child-bearing age has elevated levels of mercury in her body above safe thresholds.  Mercury can cause neurological harm to children exposed to increased mercury levels while in the womb and during the first few years of their lives, which can lead to increased risk for learning disabilities, developmental delays, and other serious problems.  Just last year EPA scientists nearly doubled the previous estimate of the number of children at increased risk from exposure to elevated mercury levels in their mothers' wombs from 300,000 to over 600,000. This finding should alarm all of us and spur this Administration to promptly develop strong controls on mercury pollution from power plants that meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act and that fully protect women and children.  Yet unfortunately, this Administration has not done that. The Administration's new mercury rule and the so-called ``Clear Skies'' proposal turn back progress, ignore available clean air technology, and will leave more toxic mercury in our air, water, and fish and for a longer time than is necessary.  Because of this, on behalf of Senator Snowe and myself, I am reintroducing legislation today that will confront this problem directly and that will reduce mercury pollution from all sources.  Our bill will reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants by 90 percent by 2010. The cap-and-trade approach the Administration is pushing for in both the mercury rule and the President's Clear Skies proposal would only reduce emissions by less than 50 percent in the near future and possibly 70 percent over the next 15 years.  I introduce this legislation on the heels of two recent reports about the proposed EPA mercury rule, one from the Government Accountability Office and one from the EPA Inspector General. Both the IG and GAO reports severely criticize this Administration's mercury rulemaking process, saying it violated EPA policy, OMB guidance, Presidential Executive Orders and, in some instances, important provisions of the Clean Air Act.  I find this extremely troublesome. These are serious problems that greatly undermine the credibility of this Administration and that led them to create policies that fail to adequately protect the children in my state of Vermont and those all across the country. Rather than develop unbiased science-based limits on mercury pollution, they instead developed limits to fit predetermined numbers found in the President's industry friendly Clear Skies proposal.  The GAO found critical flaws with the economic analysis that basically prevent anyone from actually verifying the supposed benefits of the cap-and-trade approach proposed in both EPA's rule and in the Clear Skies plan. In simple terms you could call it another example of the smoke and mirrors this Administration has used to support its flawed dirty air pollution policies.  Not only were the supposed benefits of the cap-and-trade proposal virtually undocumented, they did not even bother to analyze whatsoever the health benefits to women and children from controlling toxic mercury. If protecting the health of women and children is truly important to this Administration, then why would they skip such an important analysis?  Not surprisingly, the EPA Inspector General confirmed what the GAO found. That EPA staff were directed to ignore the Clean Air Act and instead write a mercury rule to fit the weak mercury caps in the President's Clear Skies initiative.  Rather than let EPA's capable scientists and engineers do their jobs, they decided to play politics and bow to special interest groups. How else did industry favorable policies and analyses found in memos written by industry lobbyists make it into the rule, verbatim?  Both the GAO and IG reports make it clear that EPA staff were pressured to ignore parts of the Clean Air Act and to propose weaker mercury reductions than what are technically feasible and required under the law.  The President's Clear Skies proposal formed the basis for the flawed mercury rule, so it obviously shares the same flaws. These two reports confirm what many of us already suspected, that Clear Skies is based on biased analyses, inadequate and faulty justifications.  This Administration must stop the shenanigans. They need to stop downplaying the health risks of mercury pollution and stop catering to the special interests of the power industry and their lobbyists.  The clarity and diversity of voices opposed to their poor mercury policies are unprecedented in the 30-year history of EPA. Now is the time for them to listen to the voices of more than 600,000 citizens and more than one million sportsmen and women nationwide that sent EPA letters opposing the weak mercury rule.  Now is the time to listen to the nearly 100 national and local church leaders, representing dozens of denominations and millions of congregants, who sent a letter to President Bush expressing ``grave moral concern'' about his misleadingly titled Clear Skies Initiative.  I call on the Administration to take immediate action to correct the serious problems in EPA's proposed power plant mercury rules. Instead, I hope that we can begin to meet the targets set out in this bill and start protecting the health of women and children.  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    Overview of the Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2005         Sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy and Olympia Snowe     What will the Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2005          do?       The Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2005      mandates substantial reductions in mercury emissions from all      major sources in the United States. It is the only      comprehensive legislation to control mercury emissions from      all major sources. It directs EPA to issue new standards for      unregulated sources and to monitor and report on the progress      of currently regulated sources. It sets an aggressive      timetable for these reductions so that mercury emissions are      reduced as soon as possible.       With these emissions reductions, the bill requires the safe      disposal of mercury recovered from pollution control systems,      so that the hazards of mercury are not merely transferred      from one environmental medium to another. It requires annual      public reporting--in both paper and electronic form--of      facility-specific mercury emissions. It phases out mercury      use in consumer products, requires product labeling, and      mandates international cooperation. It supports research into      the retirement of excess mercury, the handling of mercury      waste, the effectiveness of fish consumption advisories, and      the magnitude of previously uninventoried sources.     Section 3. Mercury emission standards for fossil fuel-fired          electric utility steam generating units       The EPA's Mercury Study Report to Congress estimated 52      tons of mercury emissions occur per year from coal- and oil-     fired electric utility steam generating units. More recently,      an EPA inventory estimated 48 tons of mercury from coal-fired      power plants. Collectively, these power plants constitute the      largest source of mercury emissions in the United States. In      December 2000, the EPA issued a positive determination to      regulate these mercury emissions. But these rules will take      years to write and implement, and there is already vigorous      industry opposition. It is uncertain what form these rules      will take or how long they may be delayed. This section      requires EPA to set a Amaximum achievable control technology      (MACT) standard for these emissions, such that nationwide      emissions decrease by at least 90 percent.     Section 4. Mercury emission standards for coal- and oil-fired          commercial and industrial boiler units       The EPA's report on its study estimates that 29 tons of      mercury is emitted per year from coal- and oil-fired      commercial and industrial boiler units. This section requires      EPA to set a MACT standard for these mercury emissions, such      that nationwide emissions decrease by at least 90 percent.     Section 5. Reduction of mercury emissions from solid waste          incineration units       The EPA study estimates that 30 tons of mercury emissions      are released each year from municipal waste combustors. These      emissions result from the presence of mercury-containing      items such as fluorescent lamps, fever thermometers,      thermostats and switches, in municipal solid waste streams.      In 1995, EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions, and      these rules took effect in 2000. This section reaffirms those      rules and requires stricter rules for units that do not      comply. The most effective way to reduce mercury emissions      from incinerators is to reduce the volume of mercury-     containing items before they reach the incinerator. That is      why this section also requires the separation of mercury-     containing items from the waste stream, the labeling of      mercury-containing items to facilitate this separation, and      the phase-out of mercury in consumer products within three      years, allowing for the possibility of exceptions for      essential uses.     Section 6. Mercury emission standards for chlor-alkali plants       The EPA study estimates that 7 tons of mercury emissions      are released per year from chlor-alkali plants that use the      mercury cell process to produce chlorine. EPA has not issued      rules to regulate these emissions. This section requires each      chlor-alkali plant that uses the mercury cell process to      reduce its mercury emissions by 95 percent. The most      effective way to meet this standard would be to switch to the      more energy efficient membrane cell process, which many      plants already use.     Section 7. Mercury emission standards for Portland cement          plants       The EPA study estimates that 5 tons of mercury emissions      are released each year from Portland cement plants. In 1999      EPA promulgated final rules for emissions from cement plants,      but these rules did not include mercury. This section      requires each     Portland cement plant to reduce its mercury emissions by 95      percent.     Section 8. Report on implementation of mercury emission          standards for medical waste incinerators       The EPA study estimates that 16 tons of mercury emissions      are released per year from medical waste incinerators. In      1997 EPA issued final rules for emissions from hospital/     medical/infectious waste incinerators. This section requires      EPA to report on the success of these rules in reducing these      mercury emissions.     Section 9. Report on implementation of mercury emission          standards for hazardous waste combustors       The EPA study estimates that 7 tons of mercury emissions      are released each year from hazardous waste incinerators. In      1999 EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions. This      section requires EPA to report on the success of these rules      in reducing these mercury emissions.     Section 10. Defense activities       This section requires the Department of Defense to report      on its use of mercury, including the steps it is taking to      reduce mercury emissions and to stabilize and recycle      discarded mercury. This section also prohibits the Department      of Defense from returning the nearly 5,000 tons of mercury in      the National Defense Stockpile to the global market.     Section 11. International activities       This section directs EPA to work with Canada and Mexico to      study mercury pollution in North America, including the      sources of mercury pollution, the pathways of the pollution,      and options for reducing the pollution.     Section 12. Mercury research       This section supports a variety of mercury research      projects. First, it promotes accountability by mandating an      interagency report on the effectiveness of this act in      reducing mercury pollution. Second, it mandates an EPA study      on mercury sedimentation trends in major bodies of water.      Third, it directs EPA to evaluate and improve state-level      mercury data and fish consumption advisories. Fourth, it      mandates a National Academy of Sciences report on the      retirement of excess mercury, such as stockpiled industrial      mercury that is no longer needed due to plant closures or      process changes. Fifth, it mandates an EPA study of mercury      emissions from electric arc furnaces, a source not studied in      the EPA's study report. Finally, it authorizes $2,000,000 for      modernization and expansion of the Mercury Deposition      Network, plus $10,000,000 over ten years for operational      support of that network.                                 ______                                       By
