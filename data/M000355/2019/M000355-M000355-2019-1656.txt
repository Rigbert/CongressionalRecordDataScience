 We have an obligation to honor the values for which they fought and praise their efforts to preserve the freedom of this great country and the world.  This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Allied invasion of the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. With every step onto the European continent, the forces of freedom moved closer to ending the reign of tyranny. Kentucky's World War II veteran community also marks another important milestone this year. Fifteen years ago, Sandy Hart, of Wickliffe, organized a groundbreaking project to honor the service of Kentucky's veterans. Because of Sandy's remarkable leadership, more than 500 World War II veterans traveled to our Nation's Capital in 2004 to visit the new memorial dedicated in their honor.  It is my privilege to recognize Sandy for her many years of dedicated service to American veterans, whom she calls true heroes. For many of the members of the Greatest Generation, a visit to the World War II Memorial in Washington, DC, simply wouldn't have been possible without her. Through more than a year and a half of hard work, Sandy, the daughter of a World War II veteran, collected the necessary donations to fill 17 busloads and give every veteran the chance to visit their memorial free of charge. Although shy by nature, she is animated by her passion for honoring veterans.  To foster greater understanding and appreciation of the sacrifice veterans made for this county, Sandy and her husband Ray established the Kentucky Veteran and Patriot Museum. With donations of both funds and memorabilia, Sandy hopes the museum can be a meaningful place of engagement and remembrance both for current veterans and for future generations. With focuses on each of the modern American military engagements, Sandy's museum pays tribute to the heroes who defended our Nation.  I am not the only one who admires Sandy for her tireless work in Kentucky. In his series of books entitled ``Kentucky's Everyday Heroes: Ordinary People Doing Extraordinary Things,'' Steve Flairty profiled inspirational men and women throughout the Commonwealth who, in his words, ``go quietly about their daily living, making others' lives better, with little or no thoughts of personal benefit.'' Sandy's remarkable servant leadership clearly belongs among the ranks of these Kentuckians. Her inclusion in the book is a well-earned tribute to her lifetime spent in service to others.  To celebrate the 15th anniversary, the Wickliffe community will host a parade and a ceremony. They will also unveil new memorials to brave American veterans. This anniversary gathering is the latest opportunity for Kentuckians to honor our heroes that would be impossible without Sandy's committed vision. I am sure she would try to avoid the praise I am offering, but she deserves this and so much more. Sandy is an inspirational woman who has dedicated her life to the benefit of those around her, especially our veterans. So I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in marking this important anniversary and in thanking Sandy Hart for her extraordinary leadership honoring America's heroes.                          ____________________
