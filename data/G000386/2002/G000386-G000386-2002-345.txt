 President, I would like to make some comments in relation to the remarks the Senator from Nevada just made--not in disagreement with anything he said, but to supplement them and to put them in proper perspective.  In regard to tax cuts and the war on terrorism and their impact on the deficit, even after the tax cuts of last year, we are still going to have a level of taxation that is as high as we had in World War II.
