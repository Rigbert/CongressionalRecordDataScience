' That was very true of the many pieces of legislation I worked on as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. The Senate Agriculture Committee has proven time and again that Congress can work together when it wants to get a job done.  But I have to share with you that we had a secret weapon, at least when it came to the farm bill nutrition titles and the child nutrition bills. I know that we would have had a much tougher time getting that job done successfully without the assistance and technical expertise of Joe Richardson of the Congressional Research Service. Since 1971 Joe has played an important part of nutrition policy discussions and has played a key role behind the scenes working on countless pieces of legislation over these past four decades, including seven farm bills. As a member of the Agriculture Committee during most of those 40 years, including turns as chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, I have been fortunate to benefit innumerable times from Joe's institutional memory and impressive encyclopedic knowledge of our Nation's critical nutrition programs.  Very few Americans have ever heard about the Congressional Research Service, but for the men and women who served in the U.S. Senate and for all of our staff, we know the important role that this branch of the Library of Congress plays. The Congressional Service is a legislative branch agency within the Library of Congress and works exclusively and directly for Members of Congress, their committees and staff on a confidential, nonpartisan basis. The Congressional Research Service, Congress, and the American people have been well served by Joe Richardson and his impressive public career.  For the last four decades Joe Richardson has gone above and beyond to serve the Senate and House of Representatives with his objective and always helpful information and often 24 hours a day if needed. I know that Members of both sides of the aisle have the highest regard for his work, attention to detail, and dedication.  With the retirement of Joe Richardson, we are losing an important perspective and historical knowledge that I fear that no other single person will be able to fill. To say that he will be missed is a true understatement. While I wish Joe all the best in retirement, I certainly hope that he will make sure his replacement at the Congressional Research Service and the Senate Agriculture Committee still know how to get ahold of him during development of the next farm bill.                          ____________________
