Cotting. Today I ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible young man who died in service to his country.  Grant grew up in Corona, California and attended Santiago High School for three years before graduating from Buena Vista High School in 2007. During his senior year, Grant was part of the ROTC program and hoped to have a career in the military. School officials and counselors remember Grant fondly--he was a quiet student who never hesitated to lend a hand to fellow students.  Private Cotting enlisted in the Army after graduation and was assigned to the 515th Sapper Company, 5th Engineer Battalion, 4th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade based at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. A sapper company handles demolitions, laying and disarming mines, and other combat engineering tasks. On January 24, 2009, Grant was killed in Kut, Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Grant leaves behind his parents, Craig and Amanda, and four younger brothers, Branden, Nick, Scott and Lucas.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like Grant, who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. The news of Grant's death was probably the hardest day the Cotting family has ever faced and my thoughts, prayers and deepest gratitude for their sacrifice goes out to them. There are no words that can relieve their pain and what words I offer only begin to convey my deepest respect and highest appreciation.  Private Cotting's family have all given a part of themselves in the loss of their loved one and I hope they know that their son and brother, the goodness he brought to this world, and the sacrifice he has made, will always be remembered.                          ____________________
