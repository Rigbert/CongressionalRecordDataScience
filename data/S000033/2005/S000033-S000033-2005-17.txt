 So essentially what he is telling us, and this is the President of the United States' economic adviser, what he is saying to every corporation in America is, hey, dummy, they pay 50 cents an hour there, $15 an hour here, where are you going to go? Go. So what you have is the Bush administration essentially telling corporate America that they should throw American workers out on the street and move abroad.  I remember a couple of years ago, one of the largest corporations in America is, of course, General Electric. The fellow who is head of that corporation is a guy named Jeff Immelt. Mr. Immelt spoke to some GE investors and he said, and I roughly quote here, not the exact quote, he said, when I look at the future of General Electric, I see China, China, China, China, and China. Why not? Why would you want to pay an American worker a decent wage? Why would you want to reinvest in Oregon or in the State of Vermont when you can hire people abroad for 50 cents an hour or $1 an hour, and they go to jail if they stand up for their political rights? It sounds like a great place to do business to me.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Remember how they have sold this, how they sold CAFTA, NAFTA? It was, we are opening up markets for U.S. workers and U.S. products. We want to put Americans to work. We want to create wealth in this country. NAFTA, Bill Clinton said, was going to bring 400,000 jobs to America. He was off by a few. It actually exported 1.2 million jobs from America to Mexico, so he was off by a little bit there.  Bill Clinton talked about how all the Mexicans were going to buy our goods. The total buying power of Mexico is less than the purchasing power of the people of New Jersey. If they spent every peso they earned on U.S. goods, which, of course, they have to eat and provide housing, they could not do that. The same thing with CAFTA and the same thing with China. These workers who work in the plants that are producing these products, they cannot afford to buy them.
