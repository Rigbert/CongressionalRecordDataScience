 President, I rise today to discuss the importance of accuracy in the debate over bipartisan tax relief.  I was very pleased to work with over one-fourth of the Senate Democratic Caucus in passing the largest tax cut in a generation. That legislation has been the subject of a coordinated attack by the Democratic leadership and some of its allies in the media. For almost a year and a half, I have responded to these attacks in committee, on the Senate floor, and in the media.  The basic premise of my responses has been that participants ought to be intellectually honest in the data used in the debate. Reasonable folks can differ on whether bipartisan tax relief is a good idea or not. We ought to conduct that debate in a fair and open manner.  Apparently, my responses caught the eye of a key opinion maker, Mr. Paul Krugman of the New York Times. Mr. Krugman is a regular columnist and focuses mainly on economic policy. Mr. Krugman took aim at me and my statements in a column, dated October 18, 2002. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that op-ed be included in the Record.  Mr. Krugman defended the often-mentioned but seldom-sourced statistic on distribution of the benefits of the tax relief package. It's the statistic we hear over and over again. The statistic claims that 40 percent of the benefits of the tax relief package go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers.  Mr. Krugman claims that I did not have an alternative answer to the 40 percent statistics.  I responded in a letter to the editor, dated October 24, 2002.  My letter sources data from the unbiased, official scorekeeper of tax policy for Congress, the Joint Committee on Taxation. This data had been placed in the record in the statements Mr. Krugman criticized. That data, updated for the last year the tax cut is distributed, 2006, shows that the top 1 percent of taxpayers will receive a lower share of the benefits of the tax cut, 27 percent, than their burden, 33 percent. The remaining difference of 6 percent is distributed to taxpayers within comes below $100,000. That's why Joint Tax concludes that the bipartisan tax relief makes the Tax Code more progressive.  By the way, this fact is not incidental. It reveals a key ingredient to our bipartisan success in 2001.  My Democratic partners in the bipartisan bill insisted that we make the Tax Code more progressive as a condition for their support. That was a condition that I shared with them. We would not have produced the bill in the Senate without their support.  Mr. Krugman struck back at me again in a column dated October 29, 2002. He claimed my letter was ``misleading'' because I did not include the benefits of death tax relief in the analysis. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that op-ed be included in the Record.  I prepared a response to Mr. Krugman and submitted it to the New York Times editor. Unfortunately, the Times policy only permits two responses per person per year. So, Mr. Krugman can attack me every week if he wants to and my responses are limited. So, Mr. Krugman and the Times policy left me with the recourse of responding on the Senate floor. Otherwise, his charge would stand unanswered. That would be wrong.  Joint Tax does not distribute the death tax benefit because the analysisrequires a conceptual leap. Economists have attempted to distribute the death tax benefit.  For instance, the Clinton Treasury performed an analysis at about the same time the former President was readying a veto on a tax bill that contained death tax relief. Joint Tax attempted to distribute the same kind of analysis in the early 1990s, but abandoned it after finding problems with it.  If you only read Mr. Krugman's columns, you would think that this analysis is straight forward. It is not. Basically, to get to where Mr. Krugman and his allies want to go, you have to make a conceptual leap. You have to assume that heirs of an estate have the same income tax profile as the dead person. So, you need to ignore the reality that, for instance, tax-exempt organizations, can be heirs of an estate. You need to ignore the reality that, as a general matter, no two sets of heirs look the same for income tax purposes. For these reasons, an unbiased official source, like Joint Tax, does not distribute the death tax. That was the point I was not permitted to make in a response.  For the sake of argument, however, let's give Mr. Krugman the benefit of the doubt. Let's stack the deck further in his favor by assuming that all of the death tax relief provided in 2006 inures to the benefit of the top 1 percent. Let's perform this calculation even though it is analytically unsound. If you add that revenue loss, about $4.6 billion for 2006, into Joint Tax's distribution table, you will find that the top 1 percent receive 29 percent of the benefits of the tax relief package. This compares with the 27 percent official Joint Tax figure. Recall that the top 1 percent bear 33 percent of the income tax burden. In this case, the 4 percent difference, once again, though to a smaller degree, increases the progressivity of the Federal tax system.  Mr. Krugman also cites an alternative tax burden, total Federal taxes, as the appropriate measure. Joint Tax's distribution analysis includes the Federal tax burden and as the projection for the last year shows the total Federal tax system was made more progressive.  Mr. President, I agree with Mr. Krugman on some things. We need to change the tone in Washington. If the tone is to change, all participants, including public servants, like myself, and opinion makers, like Mr. Krugman, must participate in the change.  Several things must happen if the tone in Washington is to change. The first thing that needs to happen is everyone must debate in an intellectually honest manner. This means when a statistic is used, the source should be referenced. Mr. Krugman's op-ed is the rare exception when the source of the 40 percent figure has been revealed. Over the last 18 months, in countless Congressional debates, in press reports, and other venues, the 40 percent figure has been used without attribution. At every point when I have debated the other side of this issue, I have provided the source of my statistics.  The source of the data is important because, in an honest debate, any biases should be revealed. The source of Mr. Krugman's statistic is Bob McIntyre of the Citizens for Tax Justice. I respect Mr. McIntyre as a spirited liberal advocate of his version of tax reform. Mr. McIntyre's organization has an agenda. It is a tax policy agenda that tends to be on the left side of the political spectrum. There are competing organizations on the right side of the political spectrum such as the Heritage Foundation. These organizations also produce data on tax legislation. I doubt Mr. Krugman would ever use alternative analyses. If he did use these analyses, I would expect him to cite the source.  There are also unbiased sources of data. an honest debate ought to bring out that data and distinguish it from data produced from biased sources. The Joint Committee on Taxation, established in 1926, is an unbiased source of data on tax policy. By definition, Congress' official tax policy scorekeeper, Joint Tax works for the House and Senate. Joint Tax works for both sides of the aisle. Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat from Montana, is the current Chairman of Joint Tax. Last year, Congressman Bill Thomas, a Republican from California, was Chairman.  Opponents of the bipartisan tax relief package, like Mr. Krugman, do not use this objective source of data.  If we are to change the tone in Washington, not only do we need to be honest about statistics, but we should put statistics in the proper context. Mr. Krugman uses the tax benefit figure in isolation. Mr. Krugman ignores the context of tax burden. Joint Tax's distribution analysis for 2006, shows that taxpayers who received the greatest reduction in their tax burden were those with incomes between $10,000 and $40,000. For instance, taxpayers with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000 will enjoy a reduction in their tax burden of 13.6 percent. Taxpayers with incomes over $200,000 will see their tax burden reduced by 6.1 percent. This example, drawn from Joint Tax, not a conservative think tank, puts the benefits of the tax cut in context.  I agree with Mr. Krugman's objective. I also agree with many of his sentiments about my late friend, Senator Paul Wellstone. Senator Wellstone liked a good and vigorous debate. He did so in an intellectually honest manner. Let's change the tone in Washington. Mr. Krugman has a role as an opinion maker who opposes last year's bipartisan tax relief package. I welcome a lively exchange with him and others of his view. All I ask is that we have that exchange in intellectually honest terms.  So I describe a real difference in the approach of midwestern transparent Iowans and that of an ivory tower easterner.  I ask unanimous consent to print the aforementioned materials in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Washington, DC.                                                 October 30, 2002.     Re ``For the People,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Oct. 29): I          continue to call for unbiased tax data in policy debates.     To the Editor,     The New York Times.     New York, NY.                     Maybe You Can Take It With You       I share many of Mr. Krugman's sentiments about my late      neighbor and friend, Senator Paul Wellstone. As the Senate's      only working farmer, I was a ready partner of Senator      Wellstone in efforts to help family farmers.       Mr. Krugman described the data in my letter as      ``misleading.'' His dispute lies not with me, but with      Congress' official, unbiased, tax policy scorekeeper, the      Joint Committee on Taxation. Joint Tax says ``estate and gift      taxes are not included due to uncertainty concerning the      incidence of those taxes.''       The uncertainty arises, in part, because estate tax relief      goes to the estate's heirs, not the dead person. For income      tax purposes, generally the person earning income is alive to      enjoy it. Attempts to distribute the estate tax benefit are,      at best, a very rough calculation. In effect, those who take      Mr. Krugman's view, believe the dead person benefits from      estate tax relief. Only those in the ivory towers of academia      believe you can take tax relief to the grave.           Sincerely,                                           Senator Chuck Grassley,     Ranking Member, Finance Committee.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Oct. 29, 2002]                             For the People                           (By Paul Krugman)       Ghoulish but true: as Minnesota mourns the death of Senator      Paul Wellstone, many of the state's residents have been      receiving fliers bearing a picture of a tombstone. The flier,      sent out by a conservative business group, denounce the late      senator's support for maintaining the estate tax. Under the      tombstone, the text reads in part: ``Paul Wellstone not only      wants to tax you and your business to death . . . he wants to      tax you in the hereafter.''       To be fair, the people who mailed out those fliers--which      are carefully worded so that the cost of the mailing doesn't      officially count as a campaign contribution--didn't know how      tasteless they would now appear. Yet in a sense the mass      mailing is a fitting epitaph; it reminds us what Paul      Wellstone stood for, and how brave he was to take that stand.      Sometimes it seems as if Americans have forgotten what      courage means. Here's a hint: talking tough doesn't make you      a hero; you have to take personal risks. And I'm not just      taking about physical risks--though it's striking how few of      our biggest flag wavers have ever put themselves in harm's      way. What we should demand of our representatives in      Washington is the willingness to take political risks--to      make a stand on principle, even if it means taking on      powerful interest groups.       Paul Wellstone took risks. He was, everyone acknowledges, a      political who truly voted his convictions, who supported what      he thought was right, not what he thought would help him get      re-elected. He took risky stands on many issues: agree or      disagree, you have to admit that his vote against      authorization for an Iraq war was a singularly brave act. Yet      the most consistent theme in     his record was economic--his courageous support for the      interests of ordinary Americans against the growing power of      our emerging plutocracy.       In our money-dominated politics, that's a dangerous      position to take. When Mr. Wellstone first ran for the      Senate, his opponent outspent him seven to one. According to      one of his advisers, the success of that ramshackle campaign,      run from a rickety green school bus, ``made politics safe for      populists again.''       If only. Almost every politician in modern American      pretends to be a populist; indeed, it's a general rule that      the more slavishly a politician supports the interests of      wealthy individuals and big corporations, the folksier his      manner. But being a genuine populist, someone who really      tries to stand up against what Mr. Wellstone called ``Robin      Hood in reverse'' policies, isn't easy: you must face the      power not just of money, but of sustained and shameless      hypocrisy.       And that's why those fliers are a perfect illustration of      what Paul Wellstone was fighting.       On one side, the inclusion of estate tax repeal in last      year's federal tax cut is the most striking example to date      of how our political system serves the interests of the      wealthy. After all, the estate tax affects only a small      minority of families; the bulk of the tax is paid by a tiny      elite. In fact, estate tax repeal favors the wealthy to such      an extent that defenders of last year's tax cut--like Senator      Charles Grassley, who published a misleading letter in      Friday's Times--always carefully omit it from calculations of      who benefits. (The letter talked only about the income tax;      had he included the effects of estate tax repeal, he would      have been forced to admit that more than 40 percent of the      benefits of that tax cut go to the wealthiest 1 percent of      the population.) To eliminate the estate tax in the face of      budget deficits means making the rich richer even as we slash      essential services for the middle class and the poor.       On the other side, the estate tax debate illustrates the      pervasive hypocrisy of our politics. For repeal of the      ``death tax'' has been cast, incredibly, as a populist issue.      Thanks to sustained, lavishly financed propaganda--of which      that anti-Wellstone flier was a classic example--millions of      Americans imagine, wrongly, that the estate tax mainly      affects small businesses and farms, and that its repeal will      help ordinary people. And who pays for the propaganda? Guess.      It's amazing what money can buy.       In an age of fake populists, Paul Wellstone was the real      thing. Now he's gone. Will others have the courage to carry      on?                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Oct. 25, 2002]                          A Tax Cut for Whom?       To the Editor: Re ``Springtime for Hitler,'' by Paul      Krugman (column, Oct. 18): I stand by my call for unbiased      tax data in policy debates. Some observers claim that 40      percent of last year's tax cuts went to the top 1 percent of      taxpayers. The Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress's      official, unbiased source, says the top 1 percent will      receive 27 percent of the income tax cuts in 2006, the latest      projection available. Taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 and      less will receive the majority of the tax-cut benefits, with      67 percent.       The real story is that despite those cuts, the top 1      percent of taxpayers will still pay 33 percent of federal      income taxes. They will receive a lower share of the income      tax cut, 27 percent, than their burden, 33 percent.       The joint committee says the taxpayers who will receive the      greatest reduction in their tax burden have incomes between      $10,000 and $40,000. Those with incomes between $10,000 and      $20,000 will enjoy a reduction of 13.6 percent. Those with      incomes of more than $200,000 will see their burden reduced      by 6.1 percent. Intellectual honesty demands putting tax data      in context.     Chuck Grassley.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Oct. 18, 2002]                           (By Paul Krugman)                         Springtime for Hitler       You may recall that George W. Bush promised, among other      things, to change the tone in Washington. He made good on      that promise: the tone has certainly changed.       As far as I know, in the past it wasn't considered      appropriate for the occupant of the White House to declare      that members of the opposition party weren't interested in      the nation's security. And it certainly wasn't usual to      compare anyone who wants to tax the rich--or even anyone who      estimates the share of last year's tax cut that went to the      wealthy--to Adolf Hitler.       O.K., maybe we should discount remarks by Senator Phil      Gramm. When Mr. Gramm declared that a proposal to impose a      one-time capital gains levy on people who renounce U.S.      citizenship in order to avoid paying taxes was ``right out of      Nazi Germany,'' even the ranking Republican on the Senate      Finance committee, Charles Grassley, objected to the      comparison.       But Mr. Grassley must have thought better of his objection,      since just a few weeks later he decided to use the Hitler      analogy himself: ``I am sure voters will get their fill of      statistics claiming that the Bush tax cut hands out 40      percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers.      This is not merely misleading, it is outright false. Some      folks must be under the impression that as long as something      is repeated often enough, it will become true. That was how      Adolf Hitler got to the top.''       For the record, Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax      Justice--the original source of that 40 percent estimate--is      no Adolf Hitler. The amazing thing is that Mr. Grassley is      sometimes described as a moderate. his remarks as just one      more indicator that we have entered an era of extreme      partisanship--one that leaves no room for the acknowledgment      of politically inconvenient facts. For the claim that Mr.      Grassley describes as ``outright false'' is, in fact, almost      certainly true; in a rational world it wouldn't even be a      matter for argument.       You might imagine that Mr. Grassley has in hand an      alternative answer to the question ``How much of the tax cut      will go to the top 1 percent?''--that the administration has,      at some point, produced a number showing that the wealthy      aren't getting a big share of the benefits. In fact, however,      administration officials have never answered that question.      When pressed, they have always insisted on answering some      other question.       But last year the Treasury Department did release a table      showing, somewhat inadvertently, that more than 25 percent of      the income tax cut will go to people making more than      $200,000 per year. This number doesn't include the effects of      estate tax repeal; in 1999 only 2 percent of estates paid any      tax, and half of that tax was paid by only 0.16 percent of      estates. The number also probably doesn't take account of the      alternative minimum tax, which will snatch away most of the      income tax cut for upper-middle-class families, but won't      affect the rich.       Put all this together and it becomes clear that, such      enough, something like 40 percent of the tax cut--it could be      a bit less, but probably it's considerably more--will go to 1      percent of the population. And the administration's      systematic evasiveness on the question of who benefits from      the tax cut amounts to a plea of nolo contendere.       Which brings us back to the new tone in Washington.       When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on rich people, he didn't deny      that that was what he was doing. You could agree or disagree      with the supply-side economic theory he used to justify his      actions, but he didn't pretend that he was increasing the      progressivity of the tax system.       The strategy used to sell the Bush tax cut was simply to      deny the facts--and to lash out at anyone who tried to point      them out. And it's a strategy that, having worked there, is      now being applied across the board.       Michael Kinsley recently wrote that ``The Bush campaign for      was against Iraq has been insulting to American citizens, not      just because it has been dishonest, but because it has been      unserious. A lie is insulting; an obvious lie is doubly      insulting.'' All I can say is, now he notices? It's been like      that all along on economic policy.       You see, some folks must be under the impression that as      long as something is repeated often enough, it will become      true. That was how George W. Bush got to the top.                          ____________________
