Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank Chairman Tiberi for his kind work. We will miss the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott), and I thank him for this bipartisan effort because this is a good bill and I strongly support it.  This measure includes many important provisions as you have spoken about. But especially important to Alaska is section 103 language from legislation, H.R. 672, a 5-year extension of the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program. This demonstration program has worked well and has come to the aid of seniors in Alaska and healthcare providers across rural America.  Congress created the program to provide increased Medicare reimbursements for hospitals across the Nation that are too large to be considered Critical Access Hospitals, but too small to be supported by traditional low Medicare margins on inpatient services.                              {time}  1615  This program has helped three hospitals in Alaska: Central Peninsula of Soldotna, the Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, and Mt. Edgecumbe in Sitka. These hospitals serve a wide variety of patients all across those vast areas.  I do believe this is one of the better bipartisan efforts. Go back to the old days when we accomplished things together by talking with one another. It is vital we pass this bipartisan legislation and that the Senate act on it. I would suggest, respectfully, to both my chairman and ranking member, let's talk to the Senate and see if we can't get something done. Four hundred bills over there is wrong. This is one that shouldn't be hung up.  I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation.  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).
