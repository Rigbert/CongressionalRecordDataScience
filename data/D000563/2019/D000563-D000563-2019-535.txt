President, basketball brought Seymour Bryson to the Southern Illinois University at Carbondale in 1955. He had a record-setting career at the school, winning most valuable player all 4 years, setting a then-school record in scoring and holding the school's record for rebounds, which stands to this day. As remarkable as his basketball career was, Seymour went on to make his mark with more than four decades of work making SIU a better place.  Seymour was a three-degree alumnus of SIU, earning a bachelor's degree in social work in 1959, a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling in 1961, and a doctorate in educational psychology in 1972. At the time, he was one of three African Americans to progress from assistant professor to full professor at SIU, first African-American associate dean of a college, and the second of three African-American deans.  Generations of all ages could come to Seymour for advice. It was that kind of trust that earned him leadership roles throughout the community. He was active in a variety of roles, including president of the Carbondale chapter of the NAACP, member and chair of the Diversifying Faculty Initiative, president of the Jackson County 708 Mental Health Board, and president and member of the board of directors of the Carbondale United Way.  Seymour received numerous awards throughout his life, including the Senator Emil Jones Mentoring Award, the Introspect Access Award, the Distinguished Service Award from the Illinois Committee on Black Concerns in Higher Education, and the 2019 SIU Distinguished Alumni Award for his humanitarian impact.  His family was never far from his heart. He loved time with his grandchildren. They had wonderful trips to Dairy Queen and seeing movies together. They got their love of reading through him and their trips to bookstores. He captured much of these moments in film as an amateur photographer.  Seymour helped define what it meant to be a Saluki in his career and life. He passed away on May 5, we remember him for his service to his community.  Seymour is survived by his loving wife of 59 years, Marjorie Bryson; son, Todd Bryson; daughters, Robin Bryson and Keri and her husband Stephen Burns; grandchildren, Jordan Bryson, Keric Young, Kendall Young, Adrian Bryson, Francesca Sanchez, Fernando Sanchez, and Isaiah Burns; sisters, Susie Barnes and Janice Bryson Carol and her husband Paul Henry of Carbondale, and brother, Raymond and his wife Cynthia Bryson; and a host of nieces, nephews, and dear friends.                          ____________________
