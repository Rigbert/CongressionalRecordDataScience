And now, if I am not mistaken, we are going to be faced with this budget which is the largest deficit in the history of the United States of America.  My question to the Senator from Iowa is this: In basic terms for those following this discussion, how do we pay for the debt? I am told every minute the Bush administration spends $991,000 more than we take in in taxes. This results in a $520 billion deficit this year. I ask the Senator from Iowa, How do we balance the books? Where do we turn with a deficit like this to help balance the books?
