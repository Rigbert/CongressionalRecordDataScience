 More than 50 threats of bombs and other acts of violence have occurred in the last few weeks since Littleton, CO.  This amendment essentially says it will become a Federal crime to teach or distribute information on how to make a bomb or other weapon of mass destruction if the individual intends the information be used to commit a Federal violent crime or knows that the recipient of the information intends to use it to commit a Federal violent crime.  The Justice Department has reviewed the legislation. We believe that it is constitutional. The Fourth Circuit has heard a case and has effectively declared the methodology herein as constitutional.  The final part of this bill is the James Guelff Body Armor Act. It speeds body armor of 10,000 surplus pieces from the FBI and the DEA to local and State governments. It makes body armor more difficult to obtain by felons. And we are very hopeful this will be included.  So we have the gang amendments, we have the lawmaking amendment, and the body armor.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
