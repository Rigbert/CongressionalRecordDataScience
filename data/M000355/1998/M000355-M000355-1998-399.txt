 President, I rise today to introduce my amendment to bring the federal highway program into compliance with the Constitution and with the recent landmark case of Adarand versus Pena.  According to the Congressional Research Service, the federal government currently runs approximately 160 preference programs that hand out jobs and contracts based on race and gender. Congress now has an historic opportunity to take a small step toward equal protection for all citizens by ending one of these 160 preference programs.  As the Senate seeks to put a new transportation bill into play, we must allow the costly and divisive ISTEA quota to go into retirement.  ISTEA mandates that ``not less than 10 percent'' of federal highway and transit funds be allocated to ``disadvantaged business enterprises'' (``DBEs''). Firms owned by officially designated minority groups are presumed to be ``disadvantaged.'' The government has placed the stamp of ``disadvantage'' on groups with origins ranging from Tonga to Micronesia to the Maldive Islands.  And, Mr. President, what is the reward for these government-preferred firms? The reward is a $17.3 billion quota. In other words, if the government decides that you are the preferred race and gender, then you are able to compete for $17.3 billion of taxpayer-funded highway contracts. But, if you are the wrong race and gender, then--too bad--you can't compete for that $17 billion pot.  Frankly, I am astonished that any Member of this Senate would ever think such a provision is fair, prudent, or constitutional. In fact, the courts have clearly decided that this $17 billion quota is neither fair nor constitutional.                      respect for the constitution  First of all, Mr. President, the Constitution requires that we end this race-based quota. ISTEA's racial presumption was specifically addressed in the recent landmark case of Adarand versus Pena, where the Supreme Court found that the presumptions subjected individuals to unequal treatment under the law. The Court ruled that the presumption was unconstitutional--unless the government could establish that the race-based program was narrowly tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest.  Let me repeat. That is the test, Mr. President, narrowly tailored to meet a compelling Government interest.  The court held--and it is illustrated here on this chart, straight from the opinion, that: ``. . . Section 1003b of ISTEA . . . and . . . the regulations promulgated thereunder . . . are unconstitutional.''  The court specifically ruled on this program--yet somehow it is still in the bill--that it is unconstitutional.  Mr. President, I don't need to remind everybody that when we first came to the Senate, we took an oath right down here at the front of the room. And we said, ``I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.''  So, Mr. President, on the one hand we have a Supreme Court decision striking down this set-aside in the highway bill and, on the other hand, we have the oath that we took to uphold the Constitution.
