 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to grant garment imports from Nepal duty free status in the United States for two years. We have an opportunity the help one of the world's most impoverished countries sustain a vital export industry and promote political and economic stability after years of conflict.  My interest in Nepal goes back over 25 years and I have had the pleasure to travel there and visit with friends on many occasions. The warmth and friendliness of the people and the vitality and richness of the culture are only matched by the beauty of the breathtaking landscape.  Nevertheless, Nepal faces some serious challenges in the years ahead as it attempt to build a prosperous economy and raise the living standards of its people.  It ranks as the 12th poorest country in the world, with a per capita income of $240. Approximately 42 percent of the 24 million people live in poverty. Unemployment stands at 47 percent.  On top of this, Nepal has had to confront a Maoist insurgency which has claimed the lives of more than 7,200 people since 1996 with two thirds of the deaths occurring since November 2001. Estimated to include between 5,000 and 10,000 armed soldiers, the Maoists control between one-quarter and one-half of the country.  As a result of the political instability, for the first time in twenty years Nepal's economy contracted in 2002 by 0.6 percent and tourism, one of the main sources of income, fell by 27 percent. The situation became so dire last year that one advisor to Nepal's king noted that ``Nepal is on the verge of becoming a failed state.''  Yet there is reason for hope. On January 29, 2003 the Government of Nepal and the Maoist rebels reached a cease-fire agreement, opening the door for negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict. I am hopeful they will be successful. We now have the opportunity to build on the hopes of a peaceful solution to conflict and really make a difference in the lives of the Nepalese people.  Humanitarian and development assistance should be an important part of that effort. But we should also help the Nepalese help themselves and open the U.S. market to a critical export industry. In the end, economic growth and prosperity can best be achieved when Nepal is given the chance to compete and grow in a free and open global marketplace.  Success in that marketplace will lead to a lesser dependence on foreign aid and encourage Nepal to develop other viable export industries.  Since the mid-1980s, garments have emerged as a key part of Nepal's manufacturing sector. The garment industry in Nepal is entirely export oriented and accounts for 40 percent of the foreign exchange earnings. It employs over 100,000 workers half of them women and sustains the livelihood of over 350,000 people. The United States is the largest market for Nepalese garments and accounts for 80-90 percent of Nepal's total exports every year.  Yet, despite Nepal's poverty and the importance of the garment industry and the U.S. market, Nepalese garments are subject to U.S. tariffs of 17-35 percent. This is simply not acceptable and does harm to a country that can least afford it.  I might point out that this tariff rate is in contrast to the European Union, Canada, and Australia which allow or will soon allow Nepalese garments into their markets duty free.  The United States can make a real difference now to sustain the garment industry in Nepal and promote economic growth and higher living standards. My bill is simple and straightforward. It grants duty free status to imports of Nepalese garments and textiles for a two year period. This is the same status granted to participating lesser developed countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act.  For those of my colleagues who are concerned about the impact that duty free status for Nepalese garments and textiles would have on the domestic industry, it is worth noting that Nepalese garments, at their highest level, accounted for 0.1 percent of all garment and textile imports in the United States generating $29.5 million in revenue.  Nepal is, and will continue to be, a small player in the U.S. garment market, but the importance of the garment industry in Nepal compels us to action.  Let us not miss this chance to help Nepal build a better future for its people and demonstrate to them and the rest of the world the desire of the United States to see developing nations rise from poverty to economic prosperity. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 662       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TEXTILES AND APPAREL.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the      preferential treatment extended to apparel articles under      section 112(b)(3)(B) of the African Growth and Opportunity      Act (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(B)) shall also apply to apparel      articles that are imported directly into the customs      territory of the United States from Nepal in accordance with      the provisions set forth in such section as if such articles      were articles of a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan      African country, if Nepal has satisfied the requirements set      forth in section 113 of such Act (19 U.S.C. 3722), except      that--       (1) any reference in section 112(b) or section 113 of the      African Growth and Opportunity Act to a lesser developed      beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or countries) shall      be treated as a reference to Nepal; and       (2) such preferential treatment shall apply to apparel      articles imported into the customs territory of the United      States during the period beginning on October 1, 2003, and      ending on September 30, 2005.                                 ______                                       By
