Speaker, there is a lot of disorder in Washington, D.C.:  There is chaos and conflict and confrontation in the White House.  There is conflict within the majority party in the House of Representatives.  There was a representation that we were going to follow regular order. We have not.  There is no budget, which was supposed to be adopted some 3 months ago. A budget should have told all the Members of Congress and the country how much discretionary spending we were going to have.  The majority party has been unable to bring a budget to this floor and to pass it because of the disarray and disorder that we find in this House. This rule represents a litany of broken promises and exposes, frankly, the hypocrisy of this Republican majority.  This rule would add an amendment to the underlying bill that directs $1.6 billion of American taxpayer dollars toward the construction of President Trump's proposed border wall. This was not in the original bill.  The irony is, in the Rules Committee, an amendment that was in the original bill has been struck not by a vote of the Defense Committee or by the Appropriations Committee, but by the Rules Committee. They just struck out an amendment.  Let me remind my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, of the words of our Speaker, Paul Ryan. He said this: ``We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.''  Mr. Speaker, as you probably know, I have been here for some years--36, to be exact. I have never seen, in 36 years, an omnibus or minibus brought to the floor before September. Why? Because the regular order is to consider the bills one at a time, or, as the Speaker said: ``We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.''  But what the Republicans have done, Mr. Speaker, is to bring a bill and put so much in it, they dare people to vote against it because of the national security.
