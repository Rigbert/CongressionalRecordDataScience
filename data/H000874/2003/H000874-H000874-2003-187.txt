Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. I will be very brief and not take 2 minutes, but I want to bring to the attention, particularly of the Members on my side, I will be voting for the previous question. This is a procedure we have followed in the past. It is an honest, in-the-daylight procedure.  The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson) raises his point. He has raised it in the past. I would urge Members to vote for the previous question.  Then I think on our side we are very concerned about the rule itself, and many of us will not be supporting the rule, but I would urge my Members on this side to vote for the previous question.
