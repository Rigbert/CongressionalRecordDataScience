Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say that the previous speaker's comments missed by a mile what this is all about.  The Mexico City policy does not apply to a single country. It applies to organizations. Countries are expressly excluded from Mexico City policy. It is all about pro-abortion organizations, and whether or not we want to enrich and enable them to expand abortion. We want to put our money and in-kind contributions to those that have divested themselves from the killing of unborn children.  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
