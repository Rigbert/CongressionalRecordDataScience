President, I thank my colleagues for their unanimous and positive vote on the last nominee. I will bring everybody up to date.  Today, the Senate is voting on the 44th judicial nominee to be confirmed since last July when the Senate Judiciary Committee was reassigned new members in connection with the reorganization of the Senate after the shift in majority.
