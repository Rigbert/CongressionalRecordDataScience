President, today I wish to recognize and congratulate BG Louis W. Wilham, assistant adjutant general of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, for his extraordinary dedication to duty and service to our Nation. Brigadier General Wilham will soon retire from the Oklahoma National Guard after 31 years of service.  Brigadier General Wilham enlisted in the Oklahoma Army National Guard in 1987 and received his commission through the Oklahoma Military Department's officer candidate school in 1989. Since then, General Wilham has served in a variety of key leadership and staff positions within the Oklahoma National Guard, commanding at the company, battalion, and brigade levels prior to serving as the assistant adjutant general and interim adjutant general. Throughout the course of his career, Brigadier General Wilham has supported numerous mobilizations for both State and Federal missions. In 2008, he deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, serving with the Joint Area Support Group-Central in Baghdad. In 2017, while serving as the interim adjutant general of the Oklahoma National Guard, Brigadier General Wilham oversaw the mobilization of over 2,000 Oklahoma soldiers and airmen in support of Hurricane Harvey.  During the course of Brigadier General Wilham's service to our Nation, he earned awards and decorations, including: the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with two bronze oakleaf clusters, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Army Commendation Medal with one bronze oakleaf, Army Achievement Medal with three bronze oakleaf clusters, Iraq Campaign Medial with one Bronze Campaign Star, and Combat Action Badge.  On behalf of my colleagues and the entire U.S. Senate, I want to personally thank Brigadier General Wilham and his family for over three decades of selfless service to the State of Oklahoma and the United States of America. He will leave a legacy of leadership and integrity that will remain with the Oklahoma National Guard for many years to come. I wish Brigadier General Wilham, his wife Jodi and their daughters, Taylor and Shelby, the very best as he retires from military service.                          ____________________
