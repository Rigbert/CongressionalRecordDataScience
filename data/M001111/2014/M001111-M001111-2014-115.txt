 President, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 passed in December not only provided relief to families and the economy from the harmful effects of sequestration but also put an end to the recent fiscal crises and uncertainty by establishing a bipartisan congressional budget for 2 years. Specifically, the act authorizes the chairmen of the Senate and House Budget Committees to file allocations, aggregates, levels, and other enforcement mechanisms in the Senate and the House for budget years 2014 and 2015.  On January 15, I filed the first of the two budgets in the Senate for fiscal year 2014. Today, pursuant to section 116 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, I am filing the budget in the Senate for fiscal year 2015. Specifically, for the purpose of enforcing the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, section 116 directs the chairman of the Budget Committee to file: allocations for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 for the Committee on Appropriations; allocations for fiscal years 2014, 2015, 2015 through 2019, and 2015 through 2024 for committees other than the Committee on Appropriations; aggregate spending levels for fiscal year 2014 and 2015; aggregate revenue levels for fiscal years 2014, 2015, 2015 through 2019, and 2015 through 2024; and aggregate levels of outlays and revenue for fiscal years 2014, 2015, 2015 through 2019, and 2015 through 2024 for Social Security. That authority to file allocations, aggregates, levels, and other enforcement tools exists from April 15 through May 15.  In the case of the Committee on Appropriations for 2014 and 2015, the allocation shall be set consistent with the discretionary spending limits set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act, which imposes limits only on the amount of budget authority and divides those limits on budget authority between the revised security category and the revised nonsecurity category.  In the case of allocations for committees other than the Committee on Appropriations and for the revenue and Social Security aggregates, the levels shall be set consistent with the most recent baseline of the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO last updated its baseline on April 14, 2014.  In the case of the spending aggregates for 2014 and 2015, the levels shall be set in accordance with the allocation for the Committee on Appropriations and the allocations for committees other than the Committee on Appropriations, as described previously.  Pursuant to section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the allocations to the Committee on Appropriations and the spending aggregates can be revised for certain adjustments specifically authorized by section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The authorized changes include adjustments for overseas contingency operations and the global war on terrorism, disaster funding, emergency appropriations, and program integrity initiatives in the areas of continuing disability reviews and redeterminations and health care fraud and abuse control. These adjustments will be made after the reporting of a bill or joint resolution or the offering of an amendment thereto or the submission of a conference report thereon that includes language that qualifies for one or more of the authorized adjustments.  In addition, section 116(c) of the Bipartisan Budget Act authorizes the filing for fiscal year 2015 of deficit-neutral reserve funds included in sections 114(c) and (d) of the act, updated by 1 year to match the new enforcement windows. Accordingly, I am hereby filing and updating by 1 year each of the reserve funds included in sections 114(c) and (d) of the Bipartisan Budget Act. The reserve funds are updated to cover the period of the total of fiscal years 2014 through 2024 in the case of the reserve fund authorized in section 114(c) and the period of the total of fiscal years 2014 through 2019 and the period of the total of fiscal years 2014 through 2024 in the case of the reserve funds authorized in section 114(d). In the case of section 114(d), the reserve funds filed and updated here include sections 302,303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 338, 339, 340, 341, 344, 348, 349, 350, 353, 354, 356, 361, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 371, 376, 378, 379, and 383 of S. Con. Res. 8 (113th Congress), as passed by the Senate.  Section 114(a) directs the chairman of the Budget Committee also to reset the Senate pay-as-you-go scorecard to zero for all fiscal years. Pursuant to section 114(a), I am notifying the Senate and including the revised scorecard as part of the submission on revised enforcement for budget year 2015.  Finally, section 112 of the Bipartisan Budget Act establishes a point of order in the Senate against appropriations bills that provide advance appropriations. That act includes limited exceptions to this prohibition including up to $28.852 billion in advance appropriations for programs, projects, activities, or accounts included in a statement submitted by the chairman of the Budget Committee in the Congressional Record. Pursuant to section 112, the list of allowable advance appropriations subject to the limit is as follows:  Accounts Identified for Advance Appropriations--  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education: Employment and Training Administration, Job Corps, Education for the Disadvantaged, School Improvement, Special Education, Career, Technical, and Adult Education.  Financial Services and General Government: Payment to Postal Service.  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development: Tenant-based Rental Assistance and Project-based Rental Assistance.  Mr. President, my counterpart, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Congressman Ryan, similarly has filed allocations, aggregates, and levels in the House. The two filings will allow the House and the Senate to extend budget enforcement measures for 2015, an important principle of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing enforcement in the Senate for budget year 2015, including new committee allocations, budgetary and Social Security aggregates, detail on discretionary spending limits, and the Senate pay-as-you-go scorecard, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    BUDGETARY AGGREGATES, PURSUANT TO SECTION 116 OF THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2013 AND SECTION 311 OF THE                                        CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT OF 1974----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------               $s in millions                       2014             2015           2015-19          2015-24----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Spending:    Budget Authority........................        2,842,558        2,939,993              n/a              n/a    Outlays.................................        2,819,514        3,004,163              n/a              n/aRevenue                                             2,288,175        2,533,388       13,882,333      31,202,135----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------n/a = Not applicable.
