Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Beverly Jean Bloch. Beverly passed away on Wednesday, January 16, 2013. A resident of Corona for over a decade, she was a pillar of the community and will be deeply missed.  Beverly was born November 9, 1952 in Meeker, Colorado, the daughter of Calvin and Arlene (Gulliford) Fritzlan. Beverly grew up on a cattle and guest ranch, where her work ethic and values were formed. She attended school in Meeker and graduated with highest honors from Meeker High School in 1971. Beverly received an Associate's Degree at Seward Community College and a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration and Accounting at Oklahoma State University. In 1995, Beverly earned a Juris Doctor degree from Southwestern University Law School in Los Angeles, California and began practicing family law in Anaheim Hills. She opened her second law office in Corona in 2000.  Beverly served on the Corona Regional Hospital Board of Directors, the Corona Library Foundation Board and was the Board President for the Corona YMCA. She was a member of the Norco Area Chamber of Commerce as well as the Corona Chamber of Commerce, where she served as Chairman of the Board of Directors in 2007. Beverly was a member of and served as Bequest and Living Trusts Chairman of the Southeast District California-Hawaii Elks Association, Corona 2045. She was a member of the Orange, Riverside and Los Angeles Counties Bar Associations as well as the California State Bar Association.  It is hard to imagine that Beverly would have any free time on her hands, yet she always found time for her community. She was a member of the Corona Rotary Club, the Corona Women's Improvement Club, the Norco Horsemen Association and the Riverside/Corona Council of the Navy League, serving as the Vice Adjutant. She loved to travel and visited many countries all over the world, but she always said that the most beautiful place on earth was her family's home at Fritzlan's Guest Ranch in Northwest Colorado's White River Valley.  Beverly is survived by her son Joseph Bloch; mother Arlene Fritzlan; sisters Mona (Al) Avey, Betsie (Leonard) Thompson, Jackie (Roger) Bissell and Sandie Fritzlan; granddaughters Anna and Madeline Bloch; friend Dean Herigstad; many nieces and nephews; and all of Meeker, Colorado. She was preceded in death by her father Calvin Fritzlan and nephew Gene Scritchfield.  On Saturday, January 26, 2013, a memorial honoring Beverly's extraordinary life will be held. Beverly will always be remembered for her incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. Her dedication to her family, work, and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Beverly's family and friends. Although Beverly may be gone, the light and goodness she brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
