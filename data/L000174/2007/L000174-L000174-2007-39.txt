President, I am advised that there are between both sides nearly an hour and a half left to debate. My colleagues have been asking when we might vote on this and on the judge who is also to be voted on. If my friends on the other side are willing to yield back all their time, I am willing to yield back all time on this side and go to a vote on this measure. I am not trying to cut off anybody from their long speeches. But if they are willing to do that, we could save an hour and a half, yield back time on both sides, and then yield back everything but 1 minute per side on the judicial nomination and go straight to a vote on that. Do I hear any takers?  I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back on both the Republican and Democratic side.
