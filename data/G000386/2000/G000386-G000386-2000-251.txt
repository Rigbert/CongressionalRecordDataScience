 President, for the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider all nominations on the Secretary's desk in the Coast Guard. I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then return to legislative session.
