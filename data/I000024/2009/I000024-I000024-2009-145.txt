President, I thank the Senator for yielding.  First of all, I heard the dialogue going back and forth on the amendment and the positions taken several times in statements made, and there are several people in this Chamber who want to close Guantanamo Bay.  Let me make it very clear: I have never had any intentions of wanting to close it. I keep asking: What would be the reason someone would want to close an asset that we have that can't be replaced anywhere else? My feeling was since there was no answer to that, and since this is one of the few good deals, I say to both the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee: Have you ever had a better deal than this?  It costs us $4,000 a month, the same price it cost us back in 1903, and it is a great $200 million facility. It has facilities to try these cases. They have the expeditionary legal complex there,which they don't have anyplace else. So if you close that down, you couldn't have the tribunals. Somehow they might end up being--I am talking about the terrorists--in our court system, in which case the rules of evidence are different.  So for any number of reasons, and because everyone who goes down there--and I am talking about even Al-Jazeera the media goes down and comes back and shakes their heads and wonders why we would want to close it.  So I want to go on record that I want to go further than just not funding Guantanamo, but also what we are going to be doing with some 245 detainees. Hopefully, we can end this discussion about closing an asset that has served us very well for a number of years.  So I wholeheartedly support the Inouye amendment, which is the same language I had in my amendment. I think that will pretty much accomplish what I wish to accomplish.
