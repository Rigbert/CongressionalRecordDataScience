I also thank him for his reference to the march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge from Selma to Montgomery, which we will commemorate. That march occurred on March 7, 1965.  Yesterday, we had the honor of dedicating and accepting a statue in memory of Rosa Louise Parks. Rosa Parks, of course, is known in many respects as the mother of the civil rights movement that led to America's perfecting its Union--to its allowing and making sure that every American, irrespective of race or color or nationality or religion, could be treated equally. It's appropriate that we participate in this march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to recall this country's commitment in 1965 to the Voting Rights Act, which ensured that every American would have what is intrinsic in the definition of democracy--the right to vote and the right to have one's vote counted.  I look forward to being the honorary cochair--with the majority leader--of this march with a true American hero, who is the chair, the leader, the person who has shown such extraordinary courage, not only on March 7, 1965, but years before that and every year thereafter, including until today.                              {time}  1210  So I thank the gentleman for calling attention to that march, and I look forward to participating with him in Alabama this weekend.  Now, Mr. Leader, as all of us know, automatic, draconian--in my view, irrational--cuts will occur starting tomorrow as a result of the so-called sequester. I did not see any legislation on the floor for next week which would obviate the happening of that event, the sequester, although I do see that there is some desire, apparently, to make sure that the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs have the ability to manage those cuts in a way that will be least detrimental.  I would ask the gentleman--there are, of course, 10 other appropriation bills; there are 10 other major agencies and multiple departments and offices that will have a problem similar to that of the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration--is the gentleman aware of any efforts that will be made to accommodate the domestic side of the budget?
