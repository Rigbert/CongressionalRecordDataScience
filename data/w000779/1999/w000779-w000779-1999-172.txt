We want to see people recover in line with their State contract law.  If the Senator can show me something in the 2\1/2\ pages that he is so alarmed about--he has referred to the 2\1/2\ pages now three or four times--if the Senator can show me something in those 2\1/2\ pages that indicates that a plaintiff could not recover through their State contract law economic losses, I guarantee myself, Senator Dodd, and Senator McCain are interested in working with the Senator on it.  We cannot find anything. We have precedence and we have a legal analysis that backs up our point of view. If the Senator finds something in those 2\1/2\ pages that the Senator thinks indicates that a plaintiff cannot recover their economic losses according to State contract law, we will be very open to seeing it.
