Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I do not intend to take long so we can move to a vote on the gentleman's amendment.  I would just point out, in response to the gentlewoman from Colorado, who might want to visit with the assistant secretary of trade for agriculture, Secretary Schroeder, that we are spending 50 percent less under this bill than the previous bills, that we do provide conservation compliance for 7 years. The farmer is not going to leave the farm when he has to maintain the conservation compliance. I think we will have more crop land in production. As a result, our consumers will probably spend less than a dime of their disposable income dollar for the very valuable market basket of food. And we have reduced the payment that is being made available to farmers from 50,000 down to 40,000. That is a 20-percent drop. We currently have something called zero 85 and zero 92 in current farm program law. I know that is very difficult to understand from the nonagriculture sector, but it allows the farmer to let the ground lay fallow for environmental purposes. Out in my country, we do not get much rain so there are some years that the farmer would like to have the ground lay fallow. It is called summer fallow.  That is why we have the program that if you say, OK, if you let the ground lay fallow and you improve your conservation practice, you get 85 percent or 92 percent in regards to your payment. Some program, it is an environmental program. Farmers are not simply going to walk off the farm and not farm in regards to these payments.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, for the reasons already delineated, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
