President, I want to thank my colleague from Alabama for coming to the floor and addressing one of the most important bills we will consider this year, the question of the immigration system in America. My colleague and I may disagree--and we do disagree--on the substance of this bill, but I thank him for engaging the Senate in this conversation and dialogue. It is important that the American people know what we are about, and they should also know that we are taking our time to do it right.  I am a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee with the Senator from Alabama. We spent a lot of time on this bill, as we should have. It is a big challenge. I am not sure it is perfect. I think we can make it a better bill. But I am certainly pleased that the bill we brought to the floor is a balanced approach.  The one thing I like about it is it starts in the same place as many of its detractors want us to start, and that is to make sure that we have enforcement in this country. There should be laws; they should be enforced. That means we should do more, put more resources and more effort into making certain that our borders are not porous. It is a challenge. During the course of any given year, I am told that 300 million people pass between the United States and Mexico. The vast majority of them are doing it legally. But at the same time, there are people crossing that border into the United States illegally. We need better border enforcement, smarter border enforcement, using the best technology available today. Some of the suggestions we have heard I think are perhaps in answer to a problem of 100 years ago, but building a wall around the United States is hardly going to stop the immigration problem.  Over half the people currently in the United States undocumented did not enter illegally across the border. They came here legally, and because their visas expired or there were other circumstances or changes in the paperwork that they filed with our Government, they are not presently documented or in legal status. So this concept of building a fence or building a wall seems to me to be nothing more than a symbol--perhaps an unfortunate symbol--for a country as great as America.  Let me say a word or two about the bill that is going to be debated on the Senate floor for several days, perhaps through next week. It is a bill which addresses our immigration system in America. Most everyone agrees: This system needs to be changed. It is not fair. It is not a system that we are proud of because it doesn't deal with the serious issue of how many people are in the United States not in legal status--undocumented people.  One of the comments made several times during the course of the debate by my colleague from Alabama was that the bill coming out of the Senate Judiciary Committee creates amnesty. What is amnesty? Very simply, if you have been charged and found guilty of a crime, an amnesty says: We forgive you. We are not going to hold you responsible for your crime. There are things that you can do to pay your price to society for the crime you have committed. If you pay that price, people say: Well, that isn't amnesty. You have extracted some cost for the crime that has been committed.  Let me remind my colleague from Alabama what this bill does that comes to the floor.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the editorial from today's New York Times of March 29, 2006, entitled, ``It Isn't Amnesty.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            It Isn't Amnesty       Here's one way to kill a cow: take it into the woods in      hunting season, paint the word ``deer'' on it and stand back.       Something like that is happening in the immigration debate      in Washington. Attackers of a smart, tough Senate bill have      smeared it with the most mealy-mouthed word in the      immigration glossary--amnesty--in hopes of rendering it      politically toxic. They claim that the bill would bestow an      official federal blessing of forgiveness on an estimated 12      million people who are living here illegally, rewarding their      brazen crimes and encouraging more of the same.       That isn't true. The bill, approved by the Senate Judiciary      Committee in a 12-to-6 vote on Monday, is one the country      should be proud of. Four Republicans, including the      committee's chairman, Arlen Specter, joined eight Democrats      in endorsing a balanced approach to immigration reform. The      bill does not ignore security and border enforcement. It      would nearly double the number of Border Patrol agents, add      resources for detaining illegal immigrants and deporting them      more quickly, and expand state and local enforcement of      immigration laws. It would create a system to verify workers'      identities and impose tougher punishments on employers who      defied it.       But unlike the bill's counterpart in the House, which makes      a virtue out of being tough but not smart, the Specter bill      would also take on the hard job of trying to sort out the      immigrants who want to stay and follow the rules from those      who don't. It would force them not into buses or jails but      into line, where they could become lawful residents and--if      they showed they deserved it--citizens. Instead of living off      the books, they'd come into the system.       The path to citizenship laid out by the Specter bill      wouldn't be easy. It would take 11 years, a clean record, a      steady job, payment of a $2,000 fine and back taxes, and      knowledge of English and civics. That's not ``amnesty,'' with      its suggestion of getting something for nothing. But the      false label has muddied the issue, playing to people's fear      and indignation, and stoking the opportunism of Bill Frist,      the Senate majority leader. Mr. Frist has his enforcement-     heavy bill in the wings, threatening to make a disgraceful      end run around the committee's work.       The alternatives to the Specter bill are senseless. The      enforcement-only approach--building a 700-mile wall and      engaging in a campaign of mass deportation and harassment to      rip 12 million people from the national fabric--would be an      impossible waste of time and resources. It would destroy      families and weaken the economy. An alternative favored by      many businesses--creating a temporary-worker underclass that      would do our dirtiest jobs and then have to go home, with no      new path to citizenship--is a recipe for indentured      servitude.       It is a weak country that feels it cannot secure its      borders and impose law and order on an unauthorized      population at the same time. And it is a foolish, insecure      country that does not seek to channel the energy of an      industrious, self-motivated population to its own ends, but      tries instead to wall out ``those people.''       It's time for President Bush, who talks a good game on      immigration, to use every means to clarify the issue and to      lead this country out of the ``amnesty'' semantic trap. He      dislikes amnesty. Mr. Frist dislikes amnesty. We dislike      amnesty, too.       The Specter bill isn't amnesty. It's a victory for      thoughtfulness and reason.
