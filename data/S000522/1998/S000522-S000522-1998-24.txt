Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, survivors struggled to build their lives, and nobody knows this better than the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), and I want to commend him for bringing this legislation to the floor, for authoring it and for the very important provisions that it contains.  Mr. Speaker, Holocaust victims in Western countries generally received some compensation, some monetary compensation, from Germany, albeit very limited. Those victims whose homelands fell behind the Iron Curtain after World War II did not receive even this slight measure of justice. Other issues related to the Holocaust era, including the disposition of assets such as real or financial property, artwork, insurance policy proceeds, went unresolved for all of these individuals, as well as for religious communities.  Mr. Speaker, a belated measure of justice, and again, this is infinitesimally small compared to the unparalleled, horrific nature of the Holocaust, is within reach. Much has been achieved, including unprecedented settlements between Holocaust survivors, Swiss banks and European insurance companies.  Building on this momentum, as was pointed out, the State Department and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum will convene a Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets next month to address issues of Nazi-confiscated assets, including art, insurance, communal property, libraries and archives, as well as Holocaust education, research and remembrance. Conference participants will include government officials from over 40 countries, historians, experts and representatives of major NGOs, including the survivor community.  Mr. Speaker, this resolution should not and could not be considered at a more opportune moment. The resolution calls on countries to return expropriated properties to Holocaust victims or their heirs without arbitrary discrimination.                              {time}  2245  It calls for the opening of archives relating to the Nazi-era and for the continued prosecution of Nazi-era war criminals. It calls on Germany to provide reparations to all Holocaust victims without delay and without the use of unreasonable eligibility criteria. And of very real importance, this resolution calls on all countries to encourage education on the history of the Holocaust and the consequences of the failure to respect human rights.  It is a great resolution, very timely and important and I urge its passage.
