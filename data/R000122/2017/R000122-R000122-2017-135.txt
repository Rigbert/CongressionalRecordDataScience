President, I believe I still retain the floor.  Let me make the point that I appreciate very much the Senator from Arizona allowing me 5 minutes, but I will yield that 5 minutes so that at the end, the Senator from Arizona would have 5 minutes, and then I would suggest we recognize Senator Merkley so that we can conduct the vote at 2:45 p.m.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to modify my unanimous consent request that I be allowed 5 minutes prior to the vote.                           Order of Procedure  Before I do that, however, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 2:45 p.m. be equally divided between the managers or their designees, and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of S. 84; further, that following the disposition of S. 84, the Senate recess subject to the call of the Chair for the all-Members briefing.  So I would ask the Senator from Oregon how much time he needs.
