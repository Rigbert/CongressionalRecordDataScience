Speaker, well, we heard some interesting debate on the floor today. There are those who allege, well, if only, if only we opened up our most sensitive coastal areas, areas that are critical, for instance, for our fisheries, that we could drill our way out of this crisis. We could drill our way out of high prices for oil and gas.  But as one gentleman from the Republican side pointed out, actually, that is far from the truth, because even if additional significant finds are made, they would be sold into a market which does not reflect the costs of the production of the oil or its origins. It is essentially a market controlled by OPEC, the cartel mostly based in the Middle East, that is violating international trade laws by colluding to restrict supply and drive up the price of crude oil. And the Bush administration, who are great fans of free trade, the World Trade Organization, and rules-based trade, refuses to file a complaint against OPEC. I guess they are scared of OPEC and their clout.  But the point is, even if these finds were made, for instance, today it costs about 28 bucks on average for a barrel of Texas crude. But guess what? It sells for $70 a barrel.  Now, where does that other $42 go, one wonders. Well, it goes, in good part, to speculators. It turns out that the trade in crude oil in the United States of America, only a quarter of that market is regulated and controlled by the government under the rules for commodities, CommoditiesFutures Trading Commission. The rest of it is traded off the books. There is a lot of self-dealing going on, trades that would be illegal. One dealer sits next to another dealer and says trade, $5. Trade you back, $5. Trade you back, $5; trade you back $5, and suddenly we have jacked up the price to $70 a barrel.  Experts say that if we merely took the step, totally within the authority of this administration and the Congress to bring crude oil under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we would see an immediate 20 to 25 percent drop. That is not free-market oil. And then, if we took on OPEC and filed trade complaints against OPEC, we could further drive down the price.  Yes, there is a long-term problem with the availability of oil. Yes, we need to wean ourselves and become more energy efficient. But in the short-term, we don't need to allow the American consumers to be price gouged by the likes of ExxonMobil. Oh, they are not price gouging. They only made $100 million a day last year. And they handed their retiring CEO a $400 million pension. That is 4 days of gouging at the pump for ExxonMobil. That was no big skin off their backs. $400 million extracted from American consumers unfairly. Price gouging.  So if we were to regulate the markets and, secondarily, tax the windfall profits. Now some say, oh, we tried that in the Carter administration. It won't work. No, we say, okay, we are going to tax your windfall profits unless you invest that money in new refinery capacity, unless you invest that in new production. Unless you invest it in alternate fuels, we will tax the heck out of it. We are not going to allow you to give 400 million bucks to your retiring CEO or the next retiring CEO. We are not going to allow you to price gouge consumers and buy back your stock to drive up the value of the stock options of all the people sitting on the board of directors. But if you put it to productive uses, then it won't be taxed away from you. So we could take those two steps and provide some immediate price relief to the American people.  And then we need to begin investing in alternate fuels. You know, it would be nice if instead of buying our oil from the Mid East and that incredibly volatile region, supporting many countries who are, you know, working with the terrorists against the United States of America with our dollars, if we became energy efficient like Brazil did. They had a vision 30 years ago. They decided they were not going to import oil anymore. It took them 30 years. Tell me we can't do that in the United States of America; that we can't move it toward biofuels and alternative fuels and more efficient and alternative technology.  Now, the President has talked about it, which is nice. It is a change. It is a big change. He is talking about it. But his budget doesn't contain any money to get us there. If you invested the same amount of money into energy independence and efficiency that the President has proposed, if JFK had invested the same amount in getting us to the Moon, we wouldn't have gotten to the Moon yet. So he isn't following up on his rhetoric; might have something to do with his history with the oil industry and Dick Cheney's history with the oil industry and every other member of the administration's history with the oil industry.  We can become energy independent and efficient and have a greater future for the American people.                          ____________________[Pages H2874-H2875]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       THE TRUTH ABOUT OIL PRICES
