President, 150 years ago, on October 14, 1864, the Federal Government signed a treaty with the Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin Indian Tribes in the Klamath Basin establishing these tribes collectively as ``The Klamath Tribes'' and designating the Klamath Reservation in Southern Oregon.  I would like to recognize this historic event and acknowledge the great contributions made by the Klamath Tribesto the State of Oregon. As we commemorate the anniversary of the Treaty of 1864, it is also important to recognize the strained relations and broken promises that dot the history of the Federal Government's relationship with the tribes. This is a time to reflect on the Federal Government's obligation to these sovereign nations and celebrate the rich history and promising futures they bring to this great country.  The Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin Tribes have a rich history in my State. Today the Klamath Tribes contributes significantly to Oregon's history, cultural diversity, and economy. Oregon tribes are active in a variety of industries, with positive economic impacts felt far beyond the reservation boundaries.  Recently, Oregonians had the opportunity to learn first-hand the history and culture of the Klamath Tribes. To recognize and celebrate the anniversary of the treaty, the Klamath County Museum provided free tours, giving visitors a unique opportunity to visit the historical site near Fort Klamath where the treaty was signed and to learn about the rich and storied past of the Klamath Tribes.  I am pleased to recognize the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of 1864 and to ensure that this historic event is remembered as an important part of Oregon's past, and a lesson for the Nation's future.                          ____________________
