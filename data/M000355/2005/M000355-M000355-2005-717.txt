  The motions to lay on the table were agreed to.                           Amendment No. 1264(Purpose: To support a United States contribution to the Special Court                            for Sierra Leone)  Mr. McCONNELL. There are filed amendments which I will designate which I will send to the desk. They have been cleared on both sides. I call up amendment No. 1264, offered by Mr. Obama and Mr. Hagel. I ask its immediate consideration. I ask that Mr. Gregg and Mr. Leahy be added as cosponsors.  The amendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.
