 I expect I am correct in saying that filling up the tree has not worked except on occasions when the Republican leader agreed with the majority leader on filling up the tree, and there have been a few occasions on which I have agreed. I do not agree this time. This is not a process that is going to get us a bill. But we all continue to talk to each other, and we will hope that when the Sun comes up tomorrow, there will be a process agreed to that will give us a chance to get the votes we are going to have to get on this side of the aisle in order to complete a bill we would all basically like to complete.
