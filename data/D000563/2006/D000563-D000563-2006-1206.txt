 Now the tables have turned and the price of every barrel of oil brought out of Federal land is worth $70 to $75 and the Senator from Oregon is arguing why in the world would you give them relief from their royalty paymentswhen they are making so much money on oil that comes out of Federal lands that we all own.  It would seem to me the Senator's argument is that the oil companies, which are doing quite well, thank you, are going to experience a windfall if the price of oil goes up and the amount they have to pay to the Federal Government continues to be discounted or lowered. So they want it both ways. They want the consumer to pay more at the pump and they want the taxpayers to receive less for the oil they are taking from land they do not even own.  Am I missing something in this analysis?
