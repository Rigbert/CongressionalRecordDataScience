 President, as well intentioned as the amendment is to bring information to the Congress from the Joint Committee on Taxation, to bring a greater degree of transparency to where we are on certain tax legislation, I have to ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment because if it were adopted, it would force the bill back to the Houseand we would not be able to fund Government. We would also have a situation of having to have a conference. I urge my colleagues to vote against it.
