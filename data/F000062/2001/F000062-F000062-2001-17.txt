 President, today Senators Kennedy, Boxer, Miller, Corzine, Durbin, Clinton, and I are introducing legislation to make the cloning of a human being a crime. Unlike other bills, our bill would not criminalize cloning that could provide treatments for diseases, known as therapeutic cloning.  On November 25, scientists at Advanced Cell Technology, a Massachusetts biotechnology firm, announced that they had created the first human embryos ever produced by cloning. I believe that this announcement raises serious concerns and we are proposing a bill to address this development.  The bill we introduce today would: 1. permanently ban human reproductive cloning, the cloning of a human being; and 2. allow therapeutic cloning, that is, allow the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or other cloning technologies to create stem cells for treating diseases.  I support a ban on the cloning of human beings because I believe it is scientifically unsafe, morally unacceptable, and ethically flawed.  Our bill would allow cloning for therapeutic or treatment purposes. It would not allow cloning for reproductive purposes, for creating a human being. Specifically, it prohibits the implantation of the product of nuclear transplantation into a uterus. Nuclear transplantation is also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer.  There is broad agreement in the public, in the Congress, in the scientific community, in the medical community, and in the religious community that the cloning of a human being should be prohibited. This bill does just that.  The view that we should not clone human beings is held by many groups and authorities, including the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, NBAC, which concluded that it is unacceptable for anyone in the public or private sector to create a child using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. The Commission said,       At this time, it is morally unacceptable for anyone in the      public or private sector, whether in a research or clinical      setting, to attempt to create a child using somatic cell      nuclear transfer cloning.  The difference between our bill and several others including H.R. 2505, the bill passed by the House of Representatives is whether the bills protect valuable medical research that some day could provide cures for many dreaded diseases, diseases like cancer, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and heart disease; and conditions like spinal cord injury, liver damage, arthritis, and burns. This research may some day develop replacement cells and tissues to restore bodily function and treat diseases. Therapeutic cloning is particularly promising because the rejection of implanted tissues is less likely since the tissues would exactly match those of the person who donated the somatic cell nucleus.  To criminally prohibit this kind of research would be a big setback for science. Here's what some of the experts say about the promise of therapeutic cloning: The Association of American Medical Colleges:       Therapeutic cloning technology could provide an invaluable      approach to studying how cells become specialized, which in      turn could provide new understanding of the mechanisms that      lead to the development of the abnormal cells responsible for      cancers and certain birth defects. Improved understanding of      cell specialization may also provide answers to how cells age      or are regulated--leading to new insights into the treatment      of cure of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, or other      incapacitating degenerative diseases of the brain and spinal      cord. The technology might also help us understand how to      activate certain genes to permit the creation of customized      cells for transplantation or grafting. Such cells would be      genetically identical to the cells of the donor and could      therefore be transplanted into that donor without fear of      immune rejection, the major biological barrier to organ and      tissue transplantation at this time.  The Society for Women's Health Research wrote me on November 28:       Barring all therapeutic cloning would more likely drive      research underground and guarantee that only the most      unscrupulous would advance these technologies.  The National Health Council said:       Making reproductive human cloning unlawful must be done in      a way that does not deprive those suffering from debilitating      chronic diseases, potential relief and possible cures.  The Alliance for Aging Research wrote on November 28,       Scientists who utilized therapeutic cloning techniques in      the conduct of important scientific research would be labeled      as criminals. The consequence would be that important      research, research intended to save lives and reduce      suffering of tens of millions Americans, would be stopped in      its tracks.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote on November 1, 2001:       Therapeutic cloning may hold the key for repairing or      creating new tissues or organs that could alleviate myriad      medical conditions: diabetes, heart disease, spinal cord      injury and Parkinson's, to name just a few. This technology      is key to the ability to create ``customized tissues'' using      a patient's own DNA to avoid rejection problems, and at this      time, appears promising.  Other bills would make it a crime to clone cells that are used for therapeutic purposes that some day will save lives and suffering. I cannot support that approach, to criminalize legitimate medical research that could some day treat diseases and save human lives. That would be very short-sighted.  In summary, I believe that the cloning of human beings is wrong and should be outlawed. I believe that therapeutic cloning holds great medical promise and should not be prohibited. This bill will make it a crime to create human beings, but protect important scientific research that can save human lives and relieve human suffering.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the summary was ordered printed in the Record.          Summary of the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001       Findings: Cites findings by the National Bioethics Advisory      Commission and other respected bodies, which have recommended      that Congress enact legislation prohibiting anyone from      conducting or attempting human cloning but not unduly      interfering with important areas of research, such as somatic      cell nuclear transfer or nuclear transplantation.       Prohibitions: Makes it unlawful for any person: To conduct      or attempt to conduct human cloning; to ship the product of      nuclear transplantation in interstate or foreign commerce for      the purpose of human cloning; or to use federal funds for      these activities.       Definitions: ``Human cloning'' is asexual reproduction by      implanting or attempting to implant the product of nuclear      transplantation into a uterus.       ``Nuclear transplantation'' is transferring the nucleus of      a human somatic (body) cell into an oocyte (egg) from which      the nucleus or all chromosomes have been or will be removed      or rendered inert.       Penalties: Makes violators liable for a criminal fine and/     or up to 10 years in prison as well as a civil penalty of      $1,000,000 or three times the gross profits resulting from      the violation, whichever is greater.       Protection of Medical Research: Clarifies that the bill      does not restrict therapeutic cloning, stem cell research or      other forms of biomedical research such as gene therapy.       Ethics Requirements: Applies to nuclear transplantation      research the ethics requirements currently used by the      National Institutes of Health. These include informed      consent, an ethics board review, and protections for the      safety and privacy of research participants. Imposes a      $250,000 civil penalty for violation of the ethics      requirements.                          ____________________
