 President, I intend to object to proceeding to H.R. 4862, a bill that amends the Immigration and Nationality Act with regard to naturalization authority. H.R. 4862 would permit Members of Congress to administer the oath of allegiance to applicants for naturalization. I object to the bill because, according to administration officials, it would require Members of Congress to administer the oath of allegiance only at times determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security, notwithstanding the Senate Calendar or the legislative work that is required by Members of Congress. We need to understand what exactly this bill allows or requires and not just rush it through in the waning hours and minutes of this Congress.  Mr. President, I also intend to object to proceeding to the nomination of Norm Eisen to be Ambassador to the Czech Republic at the Department of State for the following reasons.  I object to the proceeding to the nomination because of Mr. Eisen's role in the firing of the inspector general of the Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS, and his lack of candor about that matter when questioned by congressional investigators. The details of Mr. Eisen's role in the firing and his misrepresentations about that matter are detailed in the Joint Minority Staff Report of the House Committee on Government Reform and the Senate Finance Committee, dated November 20, 2009.                          ____________________
