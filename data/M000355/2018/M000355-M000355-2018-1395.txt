 President, on one final matter, I wish to recognize a distinguished Kentuckian this morning: our longtime State historian, Dr. James Klotter. At the end of this semester, Jim will depart Georgetown College in Scott County, KY, for a well-earned retirement. Jim is a Kentucky native who has dedicated his entire professional life to preserving and appreciating the Commonwealth's history. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Kentucky and set out to examine a wide range of topics throughout our State's history.  As an author, coauthor, or editor, Jim has completed about 20 books, some of them with his wife and frequent collaborator Freda. He has worked to make Kentucky history accessible to students and readers of all ages. To quote Jim and his self-deprecating humor, ``Students can now be sick of Klotter at any level.''  Jim's scholarship has won local, State, and even international recognition. In 2016, the University of Kentucky Libraries honored him with the Medallion of Intellectual Achievement. On a personal note, I owe Jim a debt of thanks for all of his help as I prepared a series of historical speeches focusing on U.S. Senators from Kentucky. I recently finished the final speech in the series, and I couldn't have done it without Jim and his endless expertise.  Although Jim will soon retire from teaching, he will continue his research, his writing, and his service as State historian. I wish him well and look forward to all the great work that I am confident is yet to come.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
