 President, I am pleased to introduce, along with Senator Grassley, the Saving Kids From Dangerous Drugs Act of 2011.  For years, law enforcement has seen drug dealers flavoring and marketing their illegal drugs to entice minors, using techniques like combining drugs with chocolate and fruit flavors, and even packaging them to look like actual candy and soda. This bill would address this serious and dangerous problem by providing stronger penalties when drug dealers alter controlled substances by combining them with beverages or candy products, marketing or packaging them to resemble legitimate products, or flavoring or coloring them with the intent to sell them to minors.  Recent media reports demonstrate the need for this legislation. The Santa Cruz Sentinel had an article earlier this month about someone who is planning to market sodas laced with THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana. Some of his planned sodas include orange-flavored ``Orange Krush'' and grape-flavored ``Grape Ape'' which actually was the name of a children's cartoon character!  Regrettably, this is a problem that has persisted for many years, with drug dealers trying various methods of luring kids to try many dangerous drugs. For example, in March of 2008, Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, agents seized cocaine near Modesto, California, that had been flavored like cinnamon, coconut, lemon and strawberry.  Similarly, there have been many incidents involving methamphetamine. In a 2007 article entitled Flavored Meth Use on the Rise, USA Today stated that ``reports of candy-flavored methamphetamine are emerging around the nation, stirring concern among police and abuse prevention experts that drug dealers are marketing the drug to younger people.''  The size and sophistication of some of these operations is particularly alarming. In March of 2006, DEA discovered large-scale marijuana cultivation and production facilities in Emeryville and Oakland, California. Thousands of marijuana plants, and thousands of marijuana-related soda, candy, and other products were seized from the drug dealers' facilities. The products were designed and packaged to look like legitimate products, including an item called ``Munchy Way'' candy bars.  Current law already provides an enhanced penalty if someone distributes drugs to a minor. Under this provision, the maximum sentence for the underlying distribution offense is doubled, and tripled if it is a repeat offense.  Similarly, this bill would provide an enhanced penalty in those situations where drug dealers are altering controlled substances in ways that could make them more appealing to minors. Someone who is altering a controlled substance in ways prohibited by the legislation would be subject to a penalty of up to ten years, in addition to the penalty for the underlying offense. If someone commits a second offense prohibited by the act, they would be face an additional penalty of up to 20 years.  This bill sends a strong and clear message to drug dealers--if you flavor or candy up your drugs to try to entice our children, there will be a very heavy price to pay. It will help stop drug dealers from engaging in these activities, and punish them appropriately if they don't.  The Senate passed a similar version of this legislation in the last Congress, but it was not considered in the House.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 513       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Saving Kids From Dangerous      Drugs Act of 2011''.     SEC. 2. OFFENSES INVOLVING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES MARKETED TO                    MINORS.       Section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.      841) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(h) Offenses Involving Controlled Substances Marketed to      Minors.--       ``(1) Unlawful acts.--Except as authorized under this      title, including paragraph (3), it shall be unlawful for any      person at least 18 years of age to knowingly or intentionally      manufacture or create, with intent to manufacture, create,      distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance listed in      schedule I or II that is--       ``(A) combined with a beverage or candy product;       ``(B) marketed or packaged to appear similar to a beverage      or candy product; or       ``(C) modified by flavoring or coloring the controlled      substance with the intent to distribute, dispense, or sell      the controlled substance to a person under 18 years of age.       ``(2) Penalties.--Except as provided in section 418, 419,      or 420, any person who violates paragraph (1) of this      subsection shall be subject to--       ``(A) an additional term of imprisonment of not to exceed      10 years for a first offense involving the same controlled      substance and schedule; and       ``(B) an additional term of imprisonment of not to exceed      20 years for a second or subsequent offense involving the      same controlled substance and schedule.       ``(3) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any      controlled substance that--       ``(A) has been approved by the Secretary under section 505      of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355),      if the contents, marketing, and packaging of the controlled      substance have not been altered from the form approved by the      Secretary; or       ``(B) has been altered at the direction of a practitioner      who is acting for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual      course of professional practice.''.     SEC. 3. SENTENCING GUIDELINES.       Pursuant to its authority under section 994 of title 28,      United States Code, and in accordance with this section, the      United States Sentencing Commission shall review its      guidelines and policy statements to ensure that the      guidelines provide an appropriate additional penalty increase      to the sentence otherwise applicable in Part D of the      Guidelines Manual if the defendant was convicted of a      violation of section 401(h) of the Controlled Substances act,      as added by section 2 of this Act.
