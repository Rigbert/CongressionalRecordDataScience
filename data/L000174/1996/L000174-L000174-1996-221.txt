President, we all know the adage, that one is never too old to learn. I would like to call attention to a very special Vermonter, Buddy Zais, who embodies this truism.  Last Saturday, May 11, Buddy was one of the 203 students to graduate from Trinity College of Vermont. What makes Buddy stand out in this crowd is that he is receiving his bachelor of arts degree in philosophy 63 years after attending his first year of college at Boston University.  At the age of 80 years old, Buddy is the oldest person ever to graduate from Trinity College. In true form, Buddy graduated with magna cum laude honors. Now that he has his bachelors degree behind him, he is looking ahead to the next challenge he will undertake. I wish Buddy much luck in his next endeavor. I've been his friend for over 30 years and I'm so proud of him.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from The Burlington Free Press celebrating Buddy's graduation be printed in the Record.  On a final note, I must add that it comes as no surprise to me that Sister Janice Ryan, the president of Trinity College of Vermont, was one of the forces behind getting Buddy started back on his degree. Sister Janice has been a good friend for many years. Buddy and I know only too well that once she sets her sights on something she makes sure it happens.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 12, 1996]                   One Trinity Grad Magna Cum Lately                            (By Tamara Lush)       It took starting a business, raising a family and the death      of his wife before Bernard ``Buddy'' Zais decided to return      to college.       Now, after 63 years, Zais has finally gotten his college      degree.       The 80-year-old Zais was one of 203 Trinity College      graduates Saturday at the school's 71st commencement      ceremony. Zais received his bachelor of arts degree in      philosophy, and after the ceremony, had a few wise words of      his own.       ``I figured before I check out, I ought to have a college      degree,'' said Zais, pausing to hug other graduates old      enough to be his great-grandchildren.       As Zais--the oldest person to graduate from Trinity--was      handed his diploma, he received a standing ovation from the      hundreds of people who attended the ceremony at the Patrick      Gymnasium.       Zais said he was prodded into going back to school by      Trinity College President Sister Janice Ryan, who marked her      final commencement speech Saturday, following 17 years as the      college's top administrator. Ryan is stepping down from her      post this summer.       Shortly after his wife Mary died in 1992, Ryan asked Zais      how he and his family were doing. Zais reported his two      grandchildren had just gotten their college degrees. ``That      means that all three of my grandchildren, and my two      children, and Mary, had a degree, and I was the only one in      the family without one,'' he said.       So Ryan asked Zais to apply to the school, and even had an      admissions counselor contact him.       Zais, who formed a company called Health Insurance of      Vermont and had been an insurance agent his entire working      life, decided to study philosophy with a concentration on the      Greek philosophers.       He received credit for the one year he had gone to      college--in 1933, he went to Boston University and studied      journalism.       Going back to school and spending time with young people      was one of Zais' best life experiences. ``It was the most      satisfying, gratifying experience of my life, other than      raising my family,'' he said. ``It was much important than my      business life, much more important than selling insurance.''       And Zais, who graduate magna cum laude, isn't going to stop      at one degree.       He is considering attending school for his master's and      possibly his doctorate in philosophy. To do that, he said, he      might have to go out of state because no Vermont school      offers those degrees in philosophy. ``I'll have to go to      Albany, Boston or McGill University,'' he said. ``Will I do      it? Probably.''                          ____________________
