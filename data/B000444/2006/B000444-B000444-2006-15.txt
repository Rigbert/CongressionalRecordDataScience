 President, let me, in brief response, say I understand the intent of the amendment. But the amendment uses the words, for example, ``India cannot use United States-origin equipment . . . ,'' ``India cannot replicate and subsequently use. . . .'' No one can certify they cannot. It is possible they could. The question is whether we are insisting that they not use it. We are insisting they are not using it, and we have built into this agreement a requirement on the part of the administration to look at whether they are, in fact, doing it.  So the question is not whether they can or cannot. Anything can happen. A President cannot certify it is not possible. That is what ``cannot'' says. But he can certify to the best of his knowledge it is not occurring. That is what we require. ``Cannot'' makes this a deal-breaker. No President could certify it. ``Cannot'' translates into ``it is not possible to replicate, it is not possible to . . . ,'' and no one can certify to that.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
