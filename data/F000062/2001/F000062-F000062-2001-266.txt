 President.  I thank the ranking member of the Energy Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, for his remarks in opposition to the Wyden amendment. I also wish to thank Senator Murkowski, the chairman, who came to the floor last night and spoke against the amendment.  Last evening, I submitted for the Record several letters in opposition to the amendment from the Electric Power Supply Association, the Edison Electric Institute, The Williams Companies, Calpine, Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group, and the American Gas Association, all in strong opposition to the Wyden amendment, and also with one general theme. That general theme is that if the Congress of the United States were to determine the order in which debts would be discharged, it would trigger a bankruptcy because those who are not favored in that order would seek to protect their right by moving both Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison into bankruptcy. Virtually every single letter reiterated that concern.  I would like to reread from one of the letters so the Senate might understand the concern, and that is from the Electric Power Supply Association. That letter states:       We are writing to express our deep concern and opposition      to [the amendment]. Our fear is that this amendment could      precipitate a financial crisis and exacerbate the already      precarious situation in the West.
