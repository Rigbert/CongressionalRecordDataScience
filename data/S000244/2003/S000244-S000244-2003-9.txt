Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today when I was driving in, I followed a car that had a big bumper sticker on it that said ``Don't Mess with Texas,'' and I came to the House today with great fear and trepidation that by messing with Texas and deciding where the Federal courts will sit, I would be caught in the crossfire of a Texas cat fight, and I am happy to report that the cats are purring and the Members can mess with Texas and not get in trouble by passing this bill.  Senate 1720 implements the March, 1991, Judicial Conference proposal to designate Plano, Texas, as a place for holding court in the Eastern District of Texas. It also realigns the divisions of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas to reflect the closing of the courthouse in Denton County. The Paris division is eliminated and its counties redistributed among the other divisions of this court.  Plano is the largest city in the Eastern District of Texas. Of the 93 judicial districts in the United States, the Eastern District of Texas is the only one in which its largest city cannot hold Federal court.  This is a major impediment to the efficient operations of the Federal court system in the Eastern District of Texas. Senate 1720 will greatly assist the affected citizens, litigants, lawyers, and judges and also will promote the efficient administration of justice.  The bill is identical to language in section 102 of H.R. 1302, the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2003, which was introduced by the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. In addition, this Congress has passed this exact language on five previous occasions since 1991.  Following Senate passage of Senate 1720, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall) expressed concern that the legislation does not ensure that the eastern district caseload will be distributed equally between Plano and Sherman. While the judges of the eastern district have unanimously agreed to split the docket between Sherman and Plano, this agreement, in a signed resolution, is nonbinding.  I share the concerns of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall). Therefore, I support Senate 1720 premised on the understanding that the judges of the eastern district will do as they promised by implementing a system to assign at least 50 percent of the cases filed in or transferred to the Sherman district to a resident district judge sitting in the city of Sherman. The remaining 50 percent of the cases will be assigned to the Plano court.  Finally, in response to my request for assurance that the judges' agreement will be implemented, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has written a letter promising to do whatever is necessary to implement this plan. I will insert this letter along with the resolution signed by the judges of the Eastern District of Texas into the Record. With these assurances, I am sure that we can mess with Texas and not get caught in the crossfire.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                               Judicial Conference                                         of the United States,                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2003.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I understand that S. 1720, a bill to      designate Plano, Texas, will be considered by the House later      today. The bill would remedy a serious problem hindering      efficient judicial administration in the Eastern District of      Texas.       This bill has the strong support of the Judicial Conference      of the United States. As a provision of an omnibus court      improvement bill, it has been passed by the House in two      previous Congresses, only to remain unacted upon in the      Senate.       The judges of the Eastern District of Texas have formally      resolved that half of the Sherman Division caseload will be      docketed and tried in Sherman, Texas, and half will be      docketed and tried in Plano, Texas. A copy of an order of the      court of June 13, 2003, stating this specifically and in some      detail is enclosed hereto.       The Judicial Conference and the court in the Eastern      District of Texas are well aware of the concerns of those in      Sherman that the judicial business of the division would be      largely transferred to Plano. This is not and will not be the      case. This issue was considered by the Judicial Conference      Committee on Court Administration and Case Management when      the proposal was first considered. The resolve of the judges      to assure equity to Sherman, Texas, and other factors      relating to the great need for a court presence in Plano      caused that committee to recommend that the Judicial      Conference approve this proposal, which it did.       I congratulate you and the members of the Judiciary      Committee for taking prompt action on this bill which will      allow the court to better service the citizens of this region      of Texas.           Sincerely,                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,                                                        Secretary.       Enclosure.                        GENERAL ORDER NO. 03-15 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS  RESOLUTION REGARDING PLACES OF HOLDING COURT IN THE SHERMAN DIVISION       Since 1991, both this court and the Judicial Conference of      the United States have supported legislation authorizing      Plano as a place of holding court in the Sherman Division.      Rapid population growth in the Sherman Division over the past      decade, particularly in Collin and Denton Counties,      underscores the need for an additional court facility.      Sherman Division civil and criminal weighted filings over the      past five years have grown by 100%. Sherman now has the      second heaviest weighted caseload of the six divisions in the      Eastern District of Texas.       In the near future, two resident district judges, a      resident magistrate judge and a visiting district judge will      be hearing all Sherman Division cases in only two courtrooms.      The court has already run out of room in Sherman and needs to      acquire additional court facilities in the Division. Having      court facilities in both Sherman and Plano will enable the      court to better manage the rapidly growing caseload and      provide better service to a large population base in southern      Collin County.       It is the court's intention, when a place of holding court      in Plano is authorized, to assign the case filings as      follows:       50% civil and criminal cases docketed and tried in Sherman      (Judges Brown and Davis).       50% civil and criminal cases docketed and tried in Plano      (Judge Schell).       In light of the above, the judges of this court hereby      REAFFIRM our prior resolution to establish Plano as a place      of holding court in the Sherman Division, and RESOLVE, if      pending legislation passes that authorizes Plano as a place      of holding court, to have half the Sherman Division caseload      docketed and tried in Sherman, and the other half of the      caseload docketed and tried in Plano. If Judge Brown ceases      holding court in Sherman, a new resident judge shall be      designated to hold court in Sherman as soon as possible, and      pending the new judge's residing in Sherman, 50% of civil and      criminal cases shall be docketed and tried in Sherman, and      the clerk's office in Sherman shall remain staffed      sufficiently to support a resident judge.     Signed this 13th day of June, 2003.     For the Court:     John Hannah, Jr.,     Chief Judge.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1800
