 President, I would like to compliment the Senate and the leadership for acting on these resolutions today approving certain Congressional Accountability Act regulations. The first bill passed in this Congress was the Congressional Accountability Act. With great fanfare we stood together in this Chamber and announced to other Americans that we, as Senators, are no better than they are. We are not special, we are not different, and we will no longer make laws just for other Americans. Rather, we will make laws for all Americans, including ourselves. And with my bill, the Congressional Accountability Act, we applied 11 laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act, and so on, to ourselves.  Now the Office of Compliance, created by the Congressional Accountability Act, has promulgated regulations that require our approval. The resolutions before us approve the so-called 220(d) regulations. These regulations address the collective bargaining rights of nonlegislative offices. I am very pleased that the Senate is acting on these regulations today.  Unfortunately, neither of these resolutions contain the 220(e) regulations, which address the collective bargaining rights of legislative offices. The House Oversight Committee recently voted to send these regulations back to the Office of Compliance and asked that they be redrafted. And last week, the Office of Compliance's Board responded with two separate letters addressing the committee's actions. Due to these recent events, it seems pointless to push the Senate to consider these regulations at this time. However, I plan to ask the leadership to make the 220(e) regulations one of the first items of business for the 105th Congress.  If we are to be honest with the American people, we must not escape fully implementing the Congressional Accountability Act. For now, I ask that the Senate act on the 220(d) regulations by voting on these resolutions.                          ____________________
