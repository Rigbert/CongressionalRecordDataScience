President, I thank Senator Roberts for offering this amendment. As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, his expertise and advice on this bill have been invaluable. As he indicates, this preserves a requirement in section 504 of the National Security Act of 1947 that funds appropriated for an intelligence activity must also be specifically authorized before being obligated or expended.  It is my understanding that other committees with interest in this matter have been consulted and there is no objection. I will ask for the yeas and nays.
