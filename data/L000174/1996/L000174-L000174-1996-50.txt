President, on June 16, something happened that has tremendous implications for the American people and for people everywhere. On that day, Russia, which just a few years ago was the greatest threat to democracy in the world, held a democratic election to select its President.  That alone, Mr. President, is reason to celebrate. Despite calls from people across the Russian political spectrum who still do not understand what democracy is about to cancel the election, the Russian Government stuck by its commitment to democracy--  No decisions were taken by secretive Politburos.  Parties representing the full spectrum of political sentiment participated.  Candidates crisscrossed that vast country making promises to win the votes of ordinary people.  And in the end, most stunning of all, there was a graceful concession speech by the losing candidate, the leader of the Communist party that only a little while ago we regarded as the personification of tyranny, committing the party to challenge irregularities in the election ``in the courts, not in the streets.''  Mr. President, this was not a perfect election. There were irregularities. There may well have been instances of ballot box stuffing. I was quite concerned about the extent to which media coverage of the election appeared to favor one candidate. But it also occurred to me that, if I were a newspaperman covering an election in which one major party had a record of advancing democracy and the freedoms associated with it and the other had a 70-year history of suppressing the freedom of newspapers like mine, I might have tended to advocacy rather than neutrality too. That is not an excuse, but despite the irregularities, there is general agreement that the will of the Russian people was heard in this election.  The Russian people voted for democracy, and the tremendous significance of that should not be lost on anyone. Despite all of the hardship they are experiencing. Despite the crime and corruption. Despite their loss of empire. Despite the fact that the standard-bearer of the forces of democracy has made many mistakes, the brutal war in Chechnya being the most egregious, and is in poor health.  The Russian people voted for freedom. Freedom to speak their minds. Freedom to associate. As ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is not someone I admire, put it in explaining why he would not support the communists: freedom to decide where to spend his vacation. For some, it came down to things as simple as that, things which we take for granted.  Mr. President, the world has changed profoundly in the last decade. Communism as a world force is gone. Whatever the future may bring in terms of the distribution of power in the world, the age of ideological confrontation between communism and democracy is over. While there remain many aggressive forces in the world, I cannot help but feel that the world will be a safer place when its two greatest powers are both committed to democracy and the protection of individual rights.  And I think we owe credit to President Clinton, Secretary of State Christopher, and Deputy Secretary Talbott. Over the past three years, they have braved the attacks by those, including some in this chamber, who cannot bring themselves to give up their cold war notions about evil empires and would have us focus only on the vestiges of the old and ugly in Russia and ignore all that is new and promising.  Where do we go from here? As the ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I have watched as funding for foreign assistance has been slashed over the past 18 months, including assistance to Russia. Assistance to Russia is being phased out over the next 2 years, even though it is obvious that it is going to take the Russian people at least another decade to be able to take control of their own lives instead of expecting the government to do it for them, and that our assistance would be valuable to them.  President Yeltsin has won the support of his people to continue reform. But the Russian economy remains a shambles. The Russian Government has no money to finance its reforms. Crime is rampant. There are still pensioners on the streets of Moscow hawking pairs of children's rubber boots in order to survive.  Aid from the United States cannot possibly solve these problems directly. The problems are so immense that only the Russian people working together will be able to.  But what our aid can do is show them the way. Most Russians still have only a faint notion of what a market economy offers. Most also still carry the perceptions drilled into them by their Soviet masters that Americans are their enemies.  I have not been fully satisfied with the results of our aid program in Russia. There has been confusion, a lack of strategic thinking, and boilerplate approaches that did not fit the unique conditions there. Too much of the money has ended up in the pockets of American contractors, without enough to show for it.  But some programs have given the Russian people hope for a better future. People-to-people exchanges are an example of how we can help change old ways of thinking. I believe the thousands of exchanges of ordinary citizens that we have sponsored over the last 4 years played a role in President Yeltsin's victory. Farmer-to-farmer programs. Business exchange programs. Academic exchange programs. Civic organization development projects. They have shown the Russian people what is possible.  Americans have learned from these exchanges too. We have learned that the Russian people are not ogres. Like us, they are mostly worried about the welfare of their families. But they are learning for the first time that it is possible to have a system of government whose primary aim is the defense of individual rights, and which actually serves them.  Mr. President, there remains much to criticize in Russia. The democracy that exists there is fragile, and the future unpredictable. There will continue to be setbacks, and instances when Russia behaves in ways that are inconsistent with international norms. I have been horrified by the brutality of the Russian military in Chechnya. While it has been reassuring to see the outpouring of protest against this barbarity by the Russian people themselves, President Yeltsin and his security advisors need to recognize that Chechnya's future is not going to be decided by bombing its people into submission.  Having said that, let us today recognize how much has changed for the better in Russia compared to just a few years ago. And I hope we will also reaffirm our commitment to support reform in Russia. We know how to put our aid dollars to good use there, and there is much good yet to be done.                          ____________________
