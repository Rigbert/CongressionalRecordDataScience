I would rather wait until I get the amendment. There is one other I will want to have passed--several amendments are on Guantanamo Bay detention. This is on long-term, high-value detainees. It is my intention to offer that tomorrow.  I have currently four amendments that I will withdraw at this time so we can unclog some of this.  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendments Nos. 1094, 1095, 1096 and 1101.
