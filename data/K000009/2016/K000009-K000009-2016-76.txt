Chairman, I oppose this amendment and want to begin by saying that ideological riders have no place on appropriation bills, certainly on this bill, and, frankly, I don't believe that this is even germane to the Energy and Water Development bill.  This amendment is just the first of many possible attempts to tie the hands of the administration from implementing an extremely important international agreement that will result in exactly the opposite of what the gentleman infers.  The plan of action that was agreed to by several countries, P5+1, closed the four pathways through which Iran could get to a nuclear weapon in less than a year. We do not gain anything by putting limitations on United States' ability to engage or monitor Iran's compliance with the agreement. The President has repeatedly said that he will continue to take aggressive steps to counter any activities in violation of existing sanctions, and this includes restrictions on certain nuclear-related transfers, conventional arms, and ballistic missile items, certain asset freezes and travel bans, as well as cargo inspections.  Today, international inspectors are on the ground, and Iran is being subjected to the most comprehensive, intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program. Inspectors will remain to monitor Iran's key nuclear facilities 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. For decades to come, inspectors will have access to Iran's entire nuclear supply chain. That is an incredible achievement.  The Department of Energy's vast expertise in the nuclear fuel cycle, nuclear safeguards and security, and nuclear materials plays a critical role in informing and ensuring that Iran is meeting its nuclear commitments.  To date, experts at the Department of Energy headquarters, seven national laboratories, and two Department of Energy nuclear sites have been actively involved in reaching and now implementing the agreement. These experts will continue to support the International Atomic Energy Agency's monitoring and verification activities worldwide and are vital as the United States works with our P5+1 and European Union partners to ensure viability into Iran's nuclear program.  Why would we proactively cut off our nonproliferation program and experts from working to prevent Iran to achieve nuclear weapons? Isn't that counter to our own national security interests?  In other words, if Iran tries to cheat, if they try to build a bomb covertly, we will catch them, the world will catch them, unless we here in Congress undo these efforts and adopt amendments such as the one we are discussing now.  The bottom line is this: Iran was steadily expanding its nuclear program. The agreement has now cut off every single path to build a bomb.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this harmful amendment and encourage my colleagues to oppose as well.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).  The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Lowenthal
