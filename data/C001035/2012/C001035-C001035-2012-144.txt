President, I am pleased to have joined Chairman Lieberman in helping bring this important bill to passage today.  I would also like to single out Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, who was the first Member of this body to introduce legislation on this topic. His leadership in tirelessly moving this bill forward has been indispensable.  Today, we confirm that Members of Congress are not exempt from the country's insider trading laws. We have sent a strong message to the American people that we affirm that we come to Washington for public service, and not for private gain.  We have added several amendments today which I believe strengthened the bill's focus on transparency. We have also extended several of its provisions to encompass all branches of the Federal Government.  Again, I thank my colleagues for their hard work on the bill. And my thanks to our hard-working staff.
