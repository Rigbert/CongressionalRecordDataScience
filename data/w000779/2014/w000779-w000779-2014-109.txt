Today, I wish to join his wife Karen, his father Tom and a multitude of friends and colleagues in mourning the passing of this true son of Oregon.  Tim will be remembered as someone with a deep-felt love of Oregon's magnificent wild places. Those of us in Congress who had the honor to meet Tim and get to know him were impressed by his vast knowledge of Oregon, his personal history as a timber faller and an unmatched passion for Oregon's mountains and rivers.  He was not your stereotypical lobbyist. More comfortable in hiking boots than wing-tips, Tim would have much rather been out hunting elk in the Strawberry Mountains than tracking down Members of Congress. He was, in many ways, like former President Teddy Roosevelt--someone who liked to test himself against the elements, whether it was rowing down the John Day or Owyhee rivers or hiking into the Oregon's backcountry to camp among his beloved Ponderosa Pines.  Tim Lillebo was uniquely suited to help heal the differences between rural and urban residents. As a product of both Prairie City in Eastern Oregon and Salem in Western Oregon, he was at home on either side of the mountains, simultaneously maintaining a local's knowledge of the backcountry and an insider's perspective of the legislative process.  Tim and I did not always see eye-to-eye on forest management policies. But our differences were never personal, never acrimonious. He could disagree but was never disagreeable. As issues relating to Federal forests management changed, Tim adapted. He helped plan thoughtful restoration projects that improved forest health and protected rural communities, and did it with an air of collaboration. Without sacrificing his convictions and wilderness advocacy, he led by example in proving there were sometimes agreements in this often divisive issue. When he testified for my original Eastside Oregon forestry bill, he made it very clear that he strongly supported legislation to increase thinning restoration projects and at the same time it was necessary to protect old growth. One of those projects, the Glaze Meadow restoration project outside Sisters, OR, would not have gotten off the ground if Tim had not done the heavy lifting.  I will miss Tim Lillebo, both his wise counsel and his ready smile, along with his love of our State and his ability to bring people together to solve difficult problems. Our country could use more citizens like Tim.  On behalf of his family and friends, and his fellow Oregonians, I want to express my profound appreciation for the life and labors of Tim Lillebo.                          ____________________
