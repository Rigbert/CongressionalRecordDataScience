Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) must want tohave more lawsuits. The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) wants to have people who retaliated against whistleblowers being thrown in jail because that is a kind of form of witness tampering.  Now criminal penalties are not dischargeable in bankruptcy under the current law and under the proposal that has passed both Houses and is in conference. Civil judgments are dischargeable in bankruptcy. So under my plan, the bad folks who have stripped corporate issues of their assets and treated their employees are not going to be able to run to the bankruptcy court to get a discharge.  Under what the gentleman from Michigan is proposing, they can be sued civilly, they can lose the lawsuit. The court can enter a huge judgment against them, and then they are back in court, and they will get a discharge in bankruptcy, and as a result there will be no money that will be going out of their pocket. That is the difference between his complaint and my bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
