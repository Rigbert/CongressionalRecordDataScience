 DeFazio).  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, if we are going to extend a Federal tax benefit, if we are going to take the money of the American working people and give it to corporations, should we ask something in return? Just a little something? The answer in this legislation is, no. We should not. Here is the subsidy, do whatever is desired.  Let us take a no-brainer here which was knocked out. Should companies that set these new triangular tax scams to avoid both taxes on their overseas production and on their U.S.-based production by doing the Bermuda Triangle, should they be prohibited from receiving this subsidy? That is, they are not paying any taxes any more in the United States of America. They have set up a scam which the wonderful accounting companies have figured out. Should they receive these subsidies? The answer in this report is, yes. There was language in there to prohibit this that was taken out. These companies are not paying any U.S. taxes, but we will give them a subsidy.  We hear a lot about small businesses. Yes, a large number of the transactions do involve small businesses. That is true. But the real measure is what percentage of the U.S. taxpayers' dollars in subsidies are going to the small businesses. It is less than 10 percent.  So what we are saying here is a large number of transactions and a tiny amount of the money are going to help small businesses, and the largest amount of the money, more than 80 percent, is going to the largest corporations in the world. All Fortune 500. Could we have just a little bit more of a restriction there and a real direction towards small business? This conference report says no.                              {time}  1215  Then we just heard, we have prohibited in this bill a repeat of the Benxi Steel Company. Well, guess what? No, this bill does not prohibit that. The original version might have prohibited it, but the language that has now been adopted in the conference report is so watered down that, indeed, I would challenge either the ranking member or the Chair to stand up and say definitively that the language in this bill would prohibit a repeat of that travesty, U.S. taxpayer money going to fund a corporation in China to steal jobs from United States workers. It will not.  Then finally, we can go to the issue of future here. AT, they are going to get an $87.6 million loan under the condition of the Chinese Government that they can begin to sell telecommunications products in China. Good news for U.S. workers? Well, it might have been, except that the Chinese Government also said that within 5 years, all of the production for all the equipment sold in China must be based in China. We are going to subsidize that. United States workers, taxpayers, are going to subsidize this.  A colleague stood up before me and said this should not be about the measure of where the jobs are, U.S. or overseas, that it does not matter. It matters a hell of a lot to me and the people I represent and to the U.S. taxpayers. Yes, the jobs should be based here in the United States of America.
