Surely the majority leader knows that Secretary Snow said that the administration was going to create 200,000 jobs per month. Surely the gentleman knows that last month the economy created, in December, the last month we have figures for, 1,000 jobs. That is one-half of a percent of the performance that the Secretary of Treasury said was going to be accomplished, 1,000 out of 200,000. Surely the gentleman knows that during the time period in which he talks, the Clinton years, the 8 years, 22 million jobs were created. This administration has lost 2.5 million jobs over the last 3\1/2\ years.  Mr. Speaker, there is a commitment on this side of the aisle. There was the commitment in the Reagan recession, there was a commitment in the first Bush recession to extend. In fact, as the leader must know, we extended unemployment benefits more frequently with Democratic votes in the Reagan administration and in the first Bush administration than we have done in this recession, with Democratic not only support but leadership on those extensions. With all due respect, Mr. Leader, I would say that the assertion that somehow that Democrats are not for extending unemployment benefits when we have families in trouble is simply inaccurate.  I would be glad to yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. It is not inaccurate to state that in 1993, before the Clinton administration took credit for an economy that was created by a Republican Congress, the Democrat-controlled House cut off extended benefits. The gentleman knows that we can use figures all over the place. The gentleman is right, only 1,000 jobs were created in December, but it was very interesting to note that 146,000 long-term unemployed went off the rolls and went to work in December alone. The trends are that jobs are going up, the trends are that unemployment is going down, that jobs are being available and the long-term unemployed will be able to find jobs.
