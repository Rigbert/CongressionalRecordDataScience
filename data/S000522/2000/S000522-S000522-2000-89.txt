Mr. Speaker, I hope that every Member of this body will join me in supporting House Concurrent Resolution 253, which I introduced last February along with 37 other cosponsors.  This resolution puts the Congress on record as being strongly against the current anti-Catholic effort to expel the Holy See from the United Nations by depriving it of the Permanent Observer status that it has held for 35 years. The proponents of this effort make no secret of the fact that what really irritates them about the Holy See is its consistent position regarding the sanctity of life and family.  Mr. Speaker, the Holy See is more than entitled to this status that it holds at the United Nations. It is the governing body of the sovereign State of Vatican City. It has an internationally-recognized legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties and to send and to receive diplomatic representatives.  Its diplomatic history stretches back more than 1600 years, a millennium and a half longer than most U.N. Member states have been in existence.  The Holy See currently has formal diplomatic relations with more than 169 nations, including the United States, and it maintains 179 permanent diplomatic missions abroad.  If anything, the Holy See deserves a more permanent role at the United Nations. As our own State Department concluded and I quote, ``the United States values the Holy See's significant contributions to international peace and human rights.'' The Holy See has been an active participant in a wide range of U.N. activities since 1946.  Mr. Speaker, the removal of the Holy See's Permanent Observer status would constitute an absolutely unjustifiable expulsion of the Holy See from the United Nations as a State participant. Just like when there was an anti-Semitic effort some years back to expel Israel, if this anti-Catholicism succeeds, we will take all appropriate actions I am sure in this House, and we and the President and the Senate will to take a second look at our own participation in the United Nations.  Mr. Speaker, I hope every Member of this House will join me in supporting House Concurrent Resolution 253, which I introduced in February of this year along with Mr. Hyde, and which has 37 other bipartisan cosponsors. This resolution puts Congress on record as strongly against the current anti-Catholic effort to expel the Holy See from the United Nations by depriving it of the Permanent Observer status it has held for over 35 years.  The proponents of this effort make no secret of the fact that what really irritates them about the Holy See is its consistent positions concerning the sanction of the family, opposition to efforts to create an international right to abortion. Rather than answer the arguments raised by the Holy See in honest and open debate, these pro-abortion groups want to silence the voice of dissent in the United Nations. Mr. Speaker, this House must take a stand in favor of the free exchange of ideas, and we must also stand against the thinly veiled religious intolerance that lurks behind this effort.  Last year, a number of pro-abortion groups announced what they called the ``See Change'' campaign. This campaign is an attempt to pressure the U.N. into expelling the Holy See as a state participant. Frustrated by the success of the Holy See at cooperating with other delegations to defend the sanctity of life and the integrity of the family against radical proposals at U.N. international conferences, those organizations decided to try a new tack. They are now trying to subvert free discussion by a sovereign state on these topics in the future by depriving the Holy See of its rightful place at the table.  Mr. Speaker, the ``See Change'' proposal is an ideological power play, motivated by pro-abortion and anti-Catholic sentiment. ``See Change'' supporters have attempted to justify their claim that the Holy See does not deserve a seat at the United Nations by comparing the Holy See to EuroDisney and to the Soviet Politburo. I hope and expect that many Members from both sides of the aisle will want to join me in denouncing these offensive remarks--especially in light of the amount of time this House has spent examining far flimsier allegations of anti-Catholicism in the recent past.  In response these vicious insults against the Holy See, more than 1,000 nongovernmental organizations from 44 countries around the world have organized their own, much larger ``Holy See Campaign,'' which opposes the ``See Change'' proposal and supports the longstanding Permanent Observer status of the Holy See at the U.N. This effort is not just Catholic. Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, and Mormon leaders--among others--have also raised their voices in support.  Even those who may disagree with the Holy See on life issues should support H. Con. Res. 253. This resolution is about maintaining the integrity of the United Nations and supporting international pluralism. If ideological preferences are allowed to trump neutral principles of sovereignty--as the See Change activists desire--it will have grave consequences for the U.N. and for the world.  Who might be next on the expulsion list? Israel, or some other nation, with whom someone may disagree.  The Holy See is more than entitled to the status it holds at the United Nations. It is the governing authority of the sovereign state of Vatican City. It has an internationally recognized legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties and to send and receive diplomatic representatives. Its diplomatic history stretches back more than 1,600 years--a millennium and a half longer than most U.N. member states have been in existence. The Holy See currently has formal diplomatic relations with 169 nations, including the United States, and it maintains 179 permanent diplomatic missions abroad.  If anything, the Holy See deserves a more prominent role in the U.N. As the State Department has explicitly stated: ``The United States values the Holy See's significant contributions to international peace and human rights.'' The Holy See has been an active participant in a wide range of United Nations activities since 1946 and was eligible to become a full member state of the U.N. But it chose instead to become a nonmember state with Permanent Observer status in 1964. Because of this choice, unlike the governments of other geographically small countries such as Monaco, San Marino, and Liechtenstein, the Holy See does not possess a vote in the U.N. General Assembly.  The removal of the Holy See's Permanent Observer status would constitute an unjustifiable explusion of the Holy See from the United Nations as a state participant. It is the full legal equivalent of a state, and its expulsion would seriously damage the credibility of the United Nations by demonstrating that its rules of participation are manipulable for ideological reasons rather than being rooted in neutral principles and objective facts of sovereignty. It would also seriously damage relations between the United Nations and member states that find in the Holy See a moral and ethical presence with which they can work effectively in pursuing humanitarian approaches to international problems.  The United Nations operates largely by consensus. In the final analysis, the activists behind the ``See Change'' campaign would like to circumvent that process by silencing a voice they oppose. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this shameful eruption of anti-Catholic bigotry, and submit the following communication for the Record.                                            National Conference of                                             Catholic Bishops,                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2000.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Smith: I write to express our gratitude      for your support for maintaining the Holy See's status as a      Permanent Observer at the United Nations, a status it has      held since 1964.       The Holy See, a state with formal diplomatic relations with      more countries than any other sovereign state, has long been      an active and valuable non-voting participant in the work of      the United Nations.       Since the United Nations was founded, the Holy See has      offered strong moral support for this unique global      institution, the ideals for which it stands, and may concrete      ways in which it seeks to implement these ideals. The Holy      See has not only been a responsible participant in the      practical work of the United Nations, it has provided a      critical moral voice that has helped ensure that the United      Nations remains an effective means of protecting basic human      rights, promoting authentic development for the world's poor,      and encouraging peaceful resolution to violent conflicts      around the world.       It is unfortunate that, despite the strong support the Holy      See enjoys in the international community, its status at the      United Nations has become a matter of ideological and      partisan debate. I hope that the Congressional approval of      the resolution you have introduced will reaffirm the strong      support for the Holy See's role at the United Nations that it      enjoys among the community of nations.           Sincerely yours,                                 Most Rev. Joseph A. Fiorenza,                                      Bishop of Glaveston-Houston,     President, NCCB/USCC.                                  ____                                     Archdiocese of Baltimore,                                     Baltimore, MD, July 11, 2000.     Hon. Chris Smith,     Congress of the United States, Cannon Building, Washington,          DC.       Dear Congressman Smith: I have just learned that Resolution      253 will be considered today by the House of Representatives.      I write to urge the House Members to vote in support of the      Resolution.       The initiative to expel the Holy See from the United      Nations is one developed and supported by groups which have      nothing to do with member nations of the U.N.       As I am sure you know, the Holy See currently enjoys      diplomatic relationships with more than 175 nations. A      Resolution by the United States Congress in support of the      Holy See's status as Permanent Observer to the United Nations      would be an expression of the esteem in which Congress holds      the Holy See for its role in promoting world peace, human      development and human rights.       With every best wish, I remain.           Sincerely yours,                                       Cardinal William H. Keeler,                                          Archbishop of Baltimore.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
