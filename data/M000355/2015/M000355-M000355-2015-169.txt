 President, I completely neglected to mention an extraordinarily important player in all of this, and that is Neil Chatterjee of my staff, who befriended Senator Boxer and Bettina before I realized that there might be a possibility that we could do something together. Neil has done an extraordinary job. I think I can safely say he enjoyed the confidence of both sides and allowed us to work together in a positive and constructive way. I want to thank Neil Chatterjee for the great job that he did as well.
