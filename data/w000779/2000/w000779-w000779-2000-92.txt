President, I am introducing legislation today to help retain a unique environmental recycling program launched by Nike, a home-grown Oregon business, which involves recycling running shoes rather than dumping them in a landfill. The bill would resolve an issue on which the U.S. Customs Service has taken inherently conflicting positions: whether a duty drawback can be claimed on an item that has no commercial value and is no longer an item in United States commerce but which is recycled rather than destroyed. I believe recycling should be promoted and not punished, and that is what this legislation does.  Under existing U.S. Customs law, an importer is entitled to import duty drawback on products that are returned to the importer because they are defective. The point of this provision is to safeguard against an import duty being imposed on a product that does not end up in United States commerce. Customs law and regulation ensures that a product will not end up in U.S. commerce by requiring that the product be completely destroyed to the extent that the product has no commercial value, or that it be exported from the United States. In certain cases Customs has allowed duty drawback: for example, alcohol salvaged from destroyed beer and malt liquor which was sold as scrap rather than dumped as waste was accorded duty drawback.  Consistent with Customs' requirements, for a number of years Nike destroyed the shoes and placed them in a landfill. This amounted to thousands of tons of non-biodegradable shoes being dumped in landfills. Because shoes are not biodegradable, Nike developed a new, more environmentally-sustainable way to dispose of the defective shoes by chopping them into small pieces, called ``re-grind,'' and giving the regrind without charge or compensation to manufacturers of sport surfaces. The re-grind became part of playground, basketball and other surfaces that was used primarily for charitable purposes in poor urban centers around the country. The program, called the ``Re-Use A-Shoe,'' is one of the many initiatives Nike has undertaken to incorporate environmental sustainability into its operations.  The issue Customs has been grappling with is whether the re-grind is ``destroyed with no commercial value'' so as to qualify the destroyed shoes for duty drawback treatment. For several years Customs granted the re-grind shoes duty drawback, but a Customs audit team recently determined that the re-grind was not ``destroyed,'' as it had commercial value for court manufacturers and Customs recommended retroactive denial of Nike's drawback claims, totaling $11.6 million. Because Customs had already refunded the drawback, the audit team recommended that Nike repay the $11.6 million to Customs.  It is clear from Customs' decisions that an article is considered destroyed when it has been rendered of no commercial value and is no longer an article of commerce. In this case, the defective footwear, once shred, is valueless and of no commercial interest to anyone. Even when the shredded material is subsequently processed by Nike to recover some material of limited use, the recovered material is not saleable to anyone and therefore has no commercial value.  Mr. President, it seems to me that the position taken by the Customs audit team is not consistent with the intent of the duty drawback provision. There is no commercial value to Nike in the re-grind; the shoes have been destroyed. Nike gives the product to the manufacturer without charge or compensation, and the manufacturers have confirmed they would not pay for the material. I have copies of letters from each of the manufacturers attesting to the fact that they would not pay for the re-grind and that it is not commercially viable. It appears that the Customs audit team believes a more desirable outcome is to have Nike dump some 2 million pairs or 3.5 million pounds of shoes into a landfill rather than recycle the destroyed material. The outcome is the same: the shoes no longer have commercial value, nor are they a product in U.S. commerce. It would seem to me there is no public policy benefit in forcing Nike to dump the shoes in a landfill; but that there is much to be gained from recycling millions of pairs of shoes that would otherwise be dumped in a landfill.  The legislation I am introducing today resolves the question in favor of recycling, in favor of the environment and in favor of a rational duty drawback policy. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2571       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
