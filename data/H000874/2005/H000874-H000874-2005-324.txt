 Now, there is some speculation about an energy bill being considered. Obviously, gasoline prices are extraordinarily high. The American public is very concerned about their energy costs, about the policies of this country. Do you anticipate an energy bill coming to the floor any time within the next 2 weeks or 3 weeks?  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the question, because Members need to be aware that the Committee on Energy and Commerce is working on a fuel bill to try to address the concerns, particularly of supply and the lack of refining in this country.  The gentleman knows that there were a lot of issues that were dropped out of the energy bill that was signed by the President about a month ago that would be having an effect right now. We are going to revisit those issues.  There are other issues that have come to mind. People are starting to understand that as the cold weather starts closing in on us that the cost of fuel oil is going to be astronomical, that the increase in electricity costs are going to be astronomical. The cost of natural gas is going up, and we all understand that supply is the real problem; and we are going to try to address that and hopefully address it as soon as we can, do it in regular order, and bring it to the floor for consideration of this House.
