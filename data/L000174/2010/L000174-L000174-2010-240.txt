President, Kevin Pearce has been recognized as one of the best athletes that Vermont has produced. Like all Vermonters, Marcelle and I hold him in our prayers and thoughts after a devastating snowboarding accident while preparing for the 2010 Winter Olympics.  We have heard reports from his parents, Simon and Pia, about his recovery and like all Vermonters, and so many other Americans, we are so thankful he is back home and progressing every day in his recovery.  I watched Kevin's interview with Tom Brokaw on ``The Today Show'' and he discussed how well he was doing with Tom. I also wanted my fellow Senators to see the article about him in The New York Times and ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that article at the completion of my remarks. I can only image how much Kevin enjoys being home with his parents and his brothers and how much we all appreciate his tremendous courage and abilities.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Times, May 3, 2010]                ``No Place Like This for Soothing Care''                            (By John Branch)       Norwich, VT.--The renovated barn next to the family house      was always one of Kevin Pearce's favorite places. There is a      skateboard ramp out back and a giant recreation room inside,      with three loftlike bedrooms above.       But Pearce, 22, did not move into the barn until he was a      teenager, and soon he was off to snowboarding schools and      then on the worldwide circuit. Home, and his room in the      barn, became just somewhere to get away for a day or two.       Now it is the ultimate destination.       More than four months after sustaining a traumatic brain      injury during a training accident, after missing the Olympics      and living in hospitals in Utah and Colorado, Pearce has      returned, indefinitely.       ``It's the best thing ever,'' Pearce said Monday, sitting      on a living room sofa while holding hands with his mother,      Pia. Handwritten ``welcome home'' posters, balloons and      streamers hung about the house. ``There's nothing I could      think of that's any better than coming back home.''       And for a moment or two, it was easy to imagine that      nothing extraordinary had happened to Kevin Pearce at all. He      laughed with his family. He talked about snowboarding. He      discussed the Olympics. He smiled, big as ever.       ``Things feel very normal to me,'' Pearce said.       The past few months, much of which Pearce does not      remember, have been anything but normal. On Dec. 31, Pearce,      a rising rival to Shaun White who was expected to make the      United States Olympic halfpipe team and compete for a medal,      fell and hit his head (he was wearing a helmet) while      practicing a trick in Park City, Utah.       A helicopter flew Pearce, unconscious, to the University of      Utah Hospital in nearby Salt Lake City. The front half of his      shoulder-length hair was shaved so the recesses of his brain      could be drained of fluid. His family was summoned      immediately. Painful questions about whether he would live      slowly gave way to uneasy ones about how his life would be.       This is how, for now. Pearce walks without assistance, a      little gingerly but sturdily enough to navigate the stairs to      the familiar bedroom in the barn. He looks a little different      now, too. His hair, after being shaved to one length, has      grown back to the top of his ears. He wears bold, dark-rimmed      Oakley Frogskin frames with prismlike lenses. The vision in      each eye is fine, but the eyes themselves are a bit out of      sync, not quite tracking together.       ``My eyes are a little sketchy,'' he said. ``But they're      better than they used to be. They used to be scary blurry.''       Pearce says he does not remember the accident. He does not      remember much from the weeks before the injury, including      Christmas at home. He remembers nothing after the injury      until the first week of February, when he was flown from Utah      to Craig Hospital, a brain and spinal cord rehabilitation      center near Denver.       He does remember watching White win the Olympic gold medal.      Scotty Lago, a good friend of Pearce's who had had far less      big-event success, won bronze. It was tough, Pearce admitted.       But there is no memory of the moment when he learned just      how severe his injury was.       ``I never felt sorry for myself,'' Pearce said. ``This is      kind of what I signed up for when I started snowboarding.''       He vows that he will snowboard again.       ``Obviously, I won't be doing all the things I was doing,''      Pearce said. ``Hopefully, I can still do some of the      tricks.''       Pearce's promising comeback has not included a      recalculation of his long-range ambitions. His family is      consciously keeping him concentrated on the here and now.       ``There is little use thinking about the past, what could      have been, or what may be in the future,'' Simon Pearce, his      father, said. ``He has stayed focused on the present moment.      And it feels like it is working.''       For months, Pearce has undergone rehabilitation and      therapy, both mental and physical, often for six or more      hours a day. More recently, he went to a Denver-area gym,      too, riding stationary bikes and playing basketball. He left      only after making at least 7 of 10 free throws. That sort of      therapy will continue at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center      in nearby Lebanon, N.H., and at a local athletic club.      Pearce's rehabilitation continues to focus on vision, balance      and memory.       Pearce cannot fully appreciate how far he has come, however      often he watches videos that his family shot of him in the      hospital in January. But his parents and three older      brothers--Andrew (28), Adam (25) and David (24)--are still      amazed.       That hit home when the traveling party--Kevin, Adam, their      parents and their snowboarding friend Jack Mitrani--arrived      at the airport in Boston. Pearce walked through the airport      and carried his own bag.       They arrived at the family home about 9 p.m. Saturday.      About 30 friends and family members greeted them with cheers,      hugs and a few tears.       On Sunday, after a short hike up Gile Mountain, the family      gathered for supper. It was a rare reunion. Simon and Pia      generally alternated trips out West. Andrew, a manager for      the glass-blowing company founded by Simon Pearce, went back      and forth, too. Adam left his job as a snowboarding      instructor in Utah and has barely left Kevin's side, even      moving back to the barn. (Among other things, Adam provided      updates on a get-well Facebook page for more than 48,000      fans.) David, who has Down syndrome and has long provided      perspective and inspiration, mostly stayed in Vermont and      worked for the family business.       But one horrific accident, and one celebratory homecoming,      brought them together again.       ``Sitting at the table, for me, was a big thing,'' Pia      Pearce said. `` `Wow, here we are, back at our round table,      sitting together.' ''       On Monday afternoon, everything seemed normal. Kevin      Pearce, after taking a nap in his old bedroom in the barn,      was sitting in the grass out front with the snowboarder      Ellery Hollingsworth. The sun was shining. Pearce was      smiling.       Yes, it was good to be home. Awfully good.                          ____________________
