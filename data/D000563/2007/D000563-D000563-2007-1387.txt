Also, we began consideration of the continuing funding resolution, and cloture has been filed on the joint resolution. However, the majority leader has indicated on more than one occasion that we will continue to discuss the parameters of how the Senate will conclude action on the legislation. There will be no rollcall votes Friday, nor will the Senate be in session. Also, there will not be any rollcall votes Monday. However, we will be in session and continue our discussions about several issues, including the issue of BRAC, which has been the subject of some debate today. Senators are advised that the cloture vote on the funding resolution will occur Tuesday morning.  Mr. President, at this point, in deference to the minority leader, to make sure there are not any housekeeping items that should be considered before we close business, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
