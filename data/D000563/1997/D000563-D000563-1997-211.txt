President, simply put, this amendment which I have offered asks that we move toward more equitable tax treatment for the self-employed with respect to the deductibility of their health insurance premiums within this budget process. I believe this issue enjoys wide support among my colleagues in the Senate.  I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to a letter which has been sent to the Senate Finance Committee signed by over half of the membership of this body. A total of 53 Senators have urged that there be movement in this legislation toward the equitable treatment for the self-employed with respect to the deductibility of health insurance premiums.  Today, I would like to reaffirm our commitment to helping the self-employed afford health insurance and receive parity with their corporate competitors who can already deduct 100 percent of their health insurance premiums by passing this amendment.  Let me say at the outset, the term ``self-employed'' is a term of art used in the Tax Code but for those who are following the progress of this debate, they may be interested in the people who fall into the category of the self-employed. Those would include, of course, entrepreneurs, small business people, family farmers and the like. It is the fastest growing segment of the American economy.  More and more people are starting businesses. More and more people aspire to own their own businesses. More and more women are getting involved in entrepreneurial endeavors. So this amendment addresses a problem which exists and one which can only become worse as more people get into self-employment categories and still do not enjoy the same positive tax treatment as corporations and their employees.  There are over 23 million self-employed in the United States today. Unfortunately, over 5 million of these people have no health insurance. The rate is higher for self-employed people than the rate for salaried and waged workers. On the average, salaried and waged workers have only 16.8 percent of their membership uninsured, as against 25 percent of the self-employed that are uninsured.  The simple fact of the matter is there is a 50 percent higher likelihood that a person is uninsured--without health insurance--if they are self-employed, as opposed to being a salaried employee. Not only are the self-employed less likely to have health insurance, but those that do pay on the average 30 percent more for their health insurance premiums. They do not have access to group health insurance. They pay some of the highest rates in the Nation.  For those who follow closely the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which as I understand it is the largest organization of small businesses in America, they might be interested to know that when their membership was surveyed nationwide last year and asked their No. 1 issue for Washington, it was not capital gains; their No. 1 issue was the cost of health insurance. When I traveled across Chicago last year and met many entrepreneurs and small business people, I asked them the challenges they face, and time again they said, it is such a great concern to us and to our families that once having left the protection of a group health insurance plan and having moved into self-employment, into small business, or in many cases to family farms, they found themselves unable to afford health insurance.  I can recall a telephone call to my congressional office, when I served in the House. A woman called when she heard of my interest in this issue and said, ``I want to tell you my family story.'' It is one that is repeated many times on farms across America. She said, ``I was at home as a farm wife raising our children, raising the family. Then I decided I had to go to work in town.'' She said to me, ``Congressman''--I was a Congressman--``Congressman, the reason I work is because the salary I earn pays for two things: Day care for my children, which otherwise I would take care of at home, and the premiums for health insurance for our farm family.'' That story is repeated many times over, across the United States, where people are struggling to come up with the resources to be able to afford health insurance.  Currently, the self-employed in America may only take a tax deduction of 40 percent for the cost of health insurance premiums. However, corporations and their employees enjoy a full 100 percent deductibility. This is not fair.  I once asked some of the older Members of the House who had been around during many, many years of debate on tax bills why this disparity existed, why would we take one group of Americans working for businesses and give them full deductibility of health insurance, and say to self-employed people, you can only deduct 40 percent. I was certain there had to be some rationale behind this dichotomy. I spoke to Sam Gibbons, now retired Congressman from Florida, who served on the House Ways and Means Committee for many years. He said there is no good explanation for it. It came about sometime after World War II when corporations and unions asked for this advantage and it was given to them. The self-employed did not speak out. Health insurance was not a major issue, and as a consequence this dichotomy, this divergence in the deductibility of health insurance became enshrined in law.  Scheduled increases in current law for the deduction of the self-employed will slowly, slowly increase from the current level to 45 percent by 2002. We are talking about waiting 5 years for it to go up 5 percent more for deductibility, and then even by 2006, almost 10 years from now, under current law the deductibility for self-employment will only be 80 percent--never reaching 100 percent deductibility of a corporation or big business. That is a very long time for self-employed people to wait.  We should make progress on this issue on increasing deductibility this year within this budget package. Farmers and many other hard-working, self-employed individuals, including many women who recently started small businesses in record numbers, deserve help in this area, sooner rather than later.  You might take into consideration this fact: Of the 10 million uninsured children in America today, 1.3 million of them live in families where there is at least one parent who is self-employed. These children comprise approximately 13 percent of all uninsured children. So for these families, for the breadwinners who own the small businesses, for the family farmers and for their children, this is a very critical amendment.  Now, the obvious question to be asked of myself and others who come to the floor with changes in the Tax Code is this: How are you going to pay for it? How will you provide the resources to offset the cost of giving this new deduction to the self-employed? I will tell you, upfront, we raise the tobacco tax, the Federal tobacco tax.  The current cigarette tax is 24 cents per package. The current tax on smokeless tobacco is about 2.7 cents, for snuff; and 2.3 cents for a pouch of chewing tobacco. This bill increases the cigarette tax by 20 cents per pack to 44 cents. That is the bill that comes out of the Senate Finance Committee. It increases the tax on smokeless tobacco products by the same 83 percent. That will raise the tax to around 5 cents for snuff, 4.2 cents for chewing tobacco.  The amendment I offer to provide the deductibility, full deductibility for health premiums for the self-employed, is paid for by adding about 10 cents to the tax on cigarettes, about 10 cents, a tax--maybe a fraction higher that might be necessary to make certain that it meets this budgetary requirement. Ten cents, 10 pennies for a person buying a package of tobacco.  What will we buy as a Nation for these 10 pennies? We will buy protection for millions of Americans who today do not have it, health insurance that they can afford, giving them fair treatment under the Tax Code, saying to people who buy tobacco products you will pay a few pennies more for those products. We, as a Nation, will see great benefit coming to many families and many children across America.  We are waiting for a formal revenue estimate from the Joint Tax Committee. We have been in negotiation with them. We are told that the amount of the tax on a package of cigarettes may be slightly over 10 cents, but we are in this range of between 10 and 11 cents.  What happens when you raise the price of a package of cigarettes, as this bill does, by 20 cents already? Fewer children buy them. As you make tobacco products more expensive, kids stay away. Now, isn't that a good idea? Don't we all agree that to have 3,000 children start smoking for the first time every day in the United States is a bad idea? Shouldn't we discourage this addiction of our children? I think we all agree on that. I think even the tobacco companies have come to acknowledge that they are a major part of the problem that we have today in addiction to nicotine and tobacco.  In addition to taking care of a lot of children who are uninsured and a lot of self-employed and their families by increasing the tax on tobacco products slightly, by 10 cents or a few fractions beyond that, we will discourage children from using tobacco products. Is that a critical problem in our country? I think we all know that it is. Teenage smoking in America has risen by nearly 50 percent since 1991.  I will close with just a few brief remarks about the sales tax and just say to my colleagues it would be foolish, foolish, for us to ignore the reality that tobacco taxes are going to increase. We have asked for a survey of State existing tobacco taxes as of today. What are the taxes in each State imposed by those States and their legislatures on tobacco products? I say to my friends and colleagues if you will take a look here, you will see that more and more State legislatures are dramatically increasing tobacco taxes as a source of revenue.  For example, let me give you a few. In the State of Hawaii, the State cigarette tax will go from 60 cents to 80 cents in just a few weeks. In the State of Maine, the cigarette tax is going to double from 37 cents to 74 cents by the end of the year. In the State of Alaska, the tax rate on cigarettes and tobacco products will move from 29 cents to $1 dollar by the end of the year. In the State of Utah, from 26\1/2\ cents to 51.5 cents. State legislatures understand this is a good source of revenue. The Senate Finance Committee understood that when it added a 20-cent tobacco tax.  So I ask my colleagues to seriously consider a very minor increase of about 10 cents a pack to tobacco and measure it against what we will win as a Nation. We had this long debate a few years ago about universal health care. I certainly believe in it and subscribe to it. We did not finish that debate with a work product that achieved results. I hope with this amendment,though, we can move forward on the path toward moving more people into the protection of health insurance. The 5 million uninsured self-employed people deserve that type of protection. Those self-employed and their children will benefit greatly from this amendment.  I know that this may be a tough amendment for the Senate Finance Committee. I have watched the course of this debate over the last couple of days and it is clear that they do not always warm up to suggestions of change. Maybe this time there might be an exception. Maybe with the bipartisan support of some 53 Senators, the members of the Senate Finance Committee, the leadership, might consider this amendment. It is one which would greatly enhance the tax package which they offered.  I yield back the floor and offer my amendment.                           Amendment No. 520   (Purpose: To provide for children's health insurance initiatives)
