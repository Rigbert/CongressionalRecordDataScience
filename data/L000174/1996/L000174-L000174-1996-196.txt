President, Prof. Garrison Nelson is one of our country's foremost experts on Congress and the Presidency, and Vermont has been lucky to call him our own during his tenure at the University of Vermont. He recently wrote an interesting column for Roll Call about the historical record of Senate leaders who run for president. It is an entertaining and informative analysis that I hope other Senators will have a chance to read.  I ask that an article entitled ``Can Dole Escape Senate Leaders' Poor Presidential Record?'' be printed in the Record.  The article follows:       Can Dole Escape Senate Leaders' Poor Presidential Record?       Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's (R-Kan) decision to      resign from office in the midst of his presidential campaign      isn't so surprising when you take into account the history of      Republican Senate leaders in presidential contests.       That's because, almost without exception, a Congressional      leadership post has been the kiss of death for White House      aspirants.       Dole is the latest of several Congressional leaders      throughout the nation's history who have sought the      presidency. Whether he, by abandoning his post, will have      more success than others did remains to be seen.       In a recent assessment, I found some 112 broadly defined      ``blips'' made by Congressional leaders on the presidential      radar screen from 1856 through 1966. These ``blips''      represent instances of Congressional leaders who appeared      anywhere on the presidential (or vice presidential) charts--     whether in delegate votes at the nominating conventions, or      popular votes during the presidential primaries, or in      discernible mentions in public opinion speculations about      candidacies.       Some of these ``blips'' were trivial: ``favorite son''      votes at the convention or passing mentions in the opinion      polls. But others had real meaning.       Prior to the passage in 1912 of the 17th Amendment, which      instituted direct election of Senators, House leaders had a      clear edge over Senate counterparts in the presidential      calculus of the party kingmakers who put tickets together.      This was particularly true to Republican conventions, which      gave House leaders 20 considerations to only six for Senate      leaders during the selections made in some 15 conventions.       While the Democratic conventions in the 1856-1912 era may      have divided their presidential and vice presidential      considerations for Congressional leaders between the two      chambers equally--11 to 11--the point was relatively moot      because Republican nominees won 11 of the 15 presidential      contests.       Not until 1964 was a Democratic Congressional leader      nominated for president: Lyndon Johnson (Texas), who had      begun his executive service as vice president and was already      seated as president at the time of the convention.       Republican Congressional leaders have been more successful      at gaining the presidential brass ring. The first Republican      Congressional leader to be nominated for the top executive      post was House Speaker Schuyler Colfax (Ind), who was      nominated and elected as Ulysses S. Grant's first vice      president in 1868.       Four times in the 20 years between 1880 and 1900, past and      present House floor leaders were nominated for president by      Republican conventions.       Since then, almost a century has passed, and only one House      Republican leader has been nominated for either post and that      was Gerald Ford's 1976 selection as president. But Ford was      already president at the time, albeit unelected, and had not      made it onto the presidential screen at any time during his      nine-year stint as House Republican floor leader.       Senate leaders have been slow to develop as nominees. While      two sitting Senators were nominated and elected--Ohio's      Warren Harding in 1920 and Massachusetts's John Kennedy in      1960--it is important to remember that neither held a      leadership post.       It was not until 1928 that the nominating conventions took      serious note of sitting Senate floor leaders. That year, both      parties chose their respective Senate floor leaders as vice      presidential candidates. Republican Charles Curtis of Kansas      ran with Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover while Democrat      Joseph Robinson of Arkansas ran with New York Gov. Al Smith.       House Democrats were the least likely to be nominated, with      their 18 considerations generating only two vice presidential      nominations--both for Speaker ``Cactus'' Jack Garner of Texas      in 1932 and 1936. But both nominations were successful.      Running with FDR made the cantankerous former Speaker      electable.       House Republicans picked off six nominations for their 26      considerations--double the rate of the House Democrats. But      only one occurred in the past 90 years.       Senate Democratic leaders garnered the most considerations      (41), as well as the most presidential and vice presidential      nominations (seven). All four of their victories came after      World War II. Among them were: Majority Leader Alben Barkley      (Ky.) for vice president in 1948; Majority Leader Johnson for      vice president in 1960 and president in 1964; and Whip Hubert      Humphrey for vice president in 1964.       But it is Senate Republican leaders who seem to have      encountered the most difficulty. They received 27      considerations, but only five nominations--only one of which      was for president (Dole, this year, which has yet to be      officially confirmed).       Their four vice presidential nominations produced only one      victory--Curtis in 1928. So the 26 considerations which the      Senate Republican leaders received prior to 1996 produced one      vice presidential victory--a success rate of 4 percent, the      lowest for any of the four Congressional leadership      categories.       Even though it was a fellow Kansan who earned the lone      victory by a Senate Republican leader, clearly Dole made the      right move in getting out of the Senate. He has escaped the      Temple of Presidential Doom.       Now if he can just convince voters that he never held a      leadership post there, he might be able to move up in the      polls and avoid the kiss of death that those posts seem to be      in presidential politics.                          ____________________
