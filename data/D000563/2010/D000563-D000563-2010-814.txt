President, the Senator from Arizona suggested that the leaders--meaning the Democratic and Republican leaders--wanted these held. Is the Senator from Missouri able to represent to the body that Senator Reid would like to see all the names she is calling moved forward today, at this moment; that he is not asking for a delay in the consideration of any of these nominations?  Mrs. McCASKILL. All of these nominees have secret holds. The purpose of my exercise today is to begin to enforce the rule around here that everybody voted for, with the exception of a handful of people, that we weren't going to do secret holds anymore.  I am certainly aware that the leader supports us doing this; that the secret hold has brought the nomination process not only to a halt but, more importantly, it has done it without the public even understanding why.
