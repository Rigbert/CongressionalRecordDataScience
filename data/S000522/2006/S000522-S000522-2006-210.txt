Mr. Speaker, I would like to take his opportunity to recognize and congratulate Hal Pote on the occasion of his 60th birthday.  Hal, a friend of mine, diligently serves as the President of the Spina Bifida Foundation, SBF. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Spina Bifida Caucus, I have had the privilege of working along side Hal and truly appreciate his commitment and dedication to improving the quality of life for individuals living with Spina Bifida.  Mr. Speaker, Spina Bifida--our nation's most commonly permanently disabling birth defect--occurs in the first month of pregnancy when the spinal column does not close completely. Spina Bifida occurs in approximately 7 out of 10,000 live births and currently there are 70,000 men, women, adolescents, and children living with Spina Bifida in the United States.  In addition to Hal's strong professional commitment to improving the lives of those living with Spina Bifida, Hal has a binding personal tie that unites his heart with his expertise. Hal's nephew, Gregory was born with Spina Bifida almost 20 years ago.  Supporting his nephew through more than 20 surgeries, Hal counts it a privilege to share in Gregory's many wonderful moments like in 2004 when Gregory carried the Olympic torch. Hal is dedicated to ensuring that Gregory and all other individuals living with Spina Bifida enjoy a high quality of life. Through Hal's vision and dedication to helping Gregory and the tens of thousands of people like him, he joined with a group of colleagues to form the Spina Bifida Foundation in 1999.  In its 7 years of existence, the Foundation has achieved many amazing things for the Spina Bifida community. Just a few years ago, people born with Spina Bifida did not live past their teenage years and yet today, thanks to the advances in medical research and the dedication of public advocates like Hal Pote, many children with Spina Bifida are living to be adults. With more and more people with Spina Bifida living into adulthood, Hal and the Spina Bifida Foundation are committed to addressing the new challenges these adults now face.  One of the specific projects in which Hal has been instrumental is urging Gruma--one of the world's largest producers of corn flour and tortillas--to begin research and product testing on enriching its corn products with folic acid, a known preventative of Spina Bifida. At the urging of the Foundation and with the full and strong support of the Spina Bifida Caucus, Gruma now has a year-end goal of enriching all its corn products sold within the United States.  This is an outstanding and notable achievement. In fact, studies show that if all women in the United States consumed the recommended amount of folic acid every day before and during early pregnancy, up to 70 percent of neural tube birth defects could be prevented. Members of the Hispanic/Latino Community are at a higher risk of Spina Bifida affected pregnancies than any other ethnic group and this important and commendable action by Gruma has significant implications for improving the health and well-being of the US Hispanic/Latino population.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend Hal for his outstanding leadership of the Spina Bifida Foundation and his steadfast commitment to improving the quality of life not just for his nephew Gregory but for all individuals living with Spina Bifida. I wish him thebest on the occasion of his 60th birthday and am confident that he will continue to enjoy many successes in all of his charitable and professional endeavors.                          ____________________
