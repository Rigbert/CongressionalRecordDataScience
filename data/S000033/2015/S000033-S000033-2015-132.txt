 President, I wish to try to, as we are about halfway through the budget debate, summarize where we are and the very clear differences that exist between my Republican colleagues and those of us on this side. I think if the American people pay attention, the differences are very clear.  What some of us are trying to do is to take a hard look at the very serious problems facing our Nation and do our best to come up with sensible solutions to those problems. I think that is what the budget process should be about. What are the problems facing this country? What are the best solutions that we go forward with?  But, already, we have strong disagreements as to how we even look at the problems facing the country. From my perspective, and I think from the perspective, quite honestly, of the vast majority of the American people, the major economic problem we face is a disappearing middle class.  The good news is that compared to where we were 6\1/2\ years ago, we have made significant progress. I think most Americans remember that after the Wall Street crash--caused by the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street--that at that point, as President Bush was leaving office, we were hemorrhaging 800,000 jobs a month. That is hard to imagine, 800,000 jobs a month.  My Republican colleagues and I would agree and say the job creation now is not as strong as it should be. Fair enough. I wish to see more than 200,000 jobs a month being created. But no one will deny that 200,000 jobs a month being created is a heck of a lot better than losing 800,000 jobs a month, which is where we were when President Bush left office.  My Republican friends say the deficit is too high. I think they have a point. It is about $483 billion, a very high deficit. But I hope no one denies that a $483 billion deficit is a heck of a lot less than the $1.3 trillion deficit that existed when President Bush left office.  When President Bush left office, the financial system not only in America but all over the world was teetering on collapse. We learned later, actually, that economists literally believed the system would collapse. If you put your credit card into the ATM machine, nothing comes out. That is where we were 6\1/2\ years ago.  Today, for better or worse, the stock market is soaring and the financial system today seems reasonably solid. No one denies it is a lot better than it was 6\1/2\ years ago.  So we have made some progress despite, I must say, consistent Republican obstructionism, but we have made some progress. But I would be the first to agree, with my Republican friends or anybody else, that we are not anywhere near where we should be.  Unemployment has gone down. The official unemployment rate is about 5\1/2\ right now. But let me tell you, the official unemployment rate is not the real unemployment rate. When you include those people who have been given up looking for work and those who are looking for part time, real unemployment in this country today is about 11 percent. Youth unemployment--which we never talk about, but it is a very serious problem--is about 17 percent. African-American youth unemployment, which we never talk about, is much higher than that.  So what we are trying to do, as we look out and we recognize a problem that says--the American people tell us in every poll I have seen that their most serious issue is jobs and wages. How do we create jobs? How do those jobs pay us a decent wage?  Does anyone disagree with that? I don't think so. That is the issue. So what have we tried to do in this process? What we on this side have tried to do is say: OK, how do we create jobs? What is the fastest way we can create the millions of jobs our country and our economy need?  What economists tell us is the fastest way to create jobs is through investment in our infrastructure.  Does anybody, any Republican, Democrat, progressive, conservative, disagree that our infrastructure is in a state of terrible disrepair--that is, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, our airports, our rail systems, our levees, our dams. I don't think there is any disagreement.  What the experts tell us--and I speak as a former mayor and concur with the experts--is that when you delay work on infrastructure, it only gets worse. If you do not rebuild a crumbling road, it gets worse. If you do not rebuild a decaying water system, it becomes worse and more expensive to repair.  So what have we said here on this side? What we have said is, let's not kick this can down the road, which we have done for many years. Let's acknowledge the problem, and let's make serious investments in infrastructure--rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges and rail systems and water plants and wastewater plants, et cetera. That is what we have said. And we brought forth an amendment, which I offered, which would create some 9 million jobs in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure--9 million jobs over a period of 6 years. I think the way we paid for that $478 billion investment makes sense to most Americans, who understand we have major corporation after major corporation that pays zero in Federal income taxes because they take advantage of absurd loopholes--loopholes that allow them to invest their money and put their money in the Cayman Islands, in Bermuda, in Luxembourg, and in other tax havens and pay nothing in Federal income taxes. So we have said: Let's repeal those loopholes. Let's raise the revenue we need. Let's invest it in the infrastructure. In the process, let's create millions of decent-paying jobs. I would say that is a sensible response to the job crisis.  In terms of income and wages, I think everybody or almost everybody understands that the Federal minimum wage today of $7.25 an hour is literally a starvation wage. It has to be raised. What we are trying to do on our side is to raise the minimum wage, and I will have an amendment to do that.  We are trying to deal with the serious inequities regarding pay differentiation in America between male and female workers. Women workers are making 78 cents an hour compared to the wages paid to men. That makes no sense. We brought forth an amendment--Senator Mikulski brought forth an amendment to bring pay equity. That is an important issue.  We are also going to fight for reform of overtime rules so that people who are making $25,000 a year--so-called supervisors at McDonald's or Burger King--are not earning time and a half despite the fact they are working 50 to 60 hours a week.  So those are a few of the issues we are trying to focus on--creating jobs and raising wages. I have to say, unhappily, that my Republican colleagues have not been supportive of those efforts. What they have been absolutely persistent about is doing anything to cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, cut education, and cut nutrition. They will do anything other than ask the wealthiest people in this country, who are doing phenomenally well, the largest corporations, which are enjoying recordbreaking profits--they will do anything to prevent those groups from paying more in taxes even if it means massive cuts to programs working families desperately depend upon.                           Amendment No. 777  Mr. President, with that, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and call up amendment No. 777.
