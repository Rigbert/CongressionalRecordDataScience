 President, with that agreement, Senators should understand that tomorrow morning we will come in, there will be 20 minutes of debate between Senators DeMint and Kennedy on the DeMint amendment. We will go immediately to the four votes on amendments, with final passage to be completed in the morning. With that, there will be no more votes tonight.
