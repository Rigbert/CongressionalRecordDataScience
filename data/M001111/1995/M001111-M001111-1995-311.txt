  As the chairman may know, local education agencies [LEA's] which serve the dependents on active military personnel have a unique and very difficult challenge in meeting the needs of these students. Not the least of these challenges is maintaining a safe and productive learning environment in those educational facilities which are owned by the Federal Government and located on military installations.  This situation is particularly acute in several LEA's which were identified in the joint Department of Defense/Department of Education report, the Dole Commission report mandated by Public Law 99-661, as having the most severe problems while serving at least two major military installations. In fact, some of these facilities would not even meet local fire and safety regulations were they not located on Federal property.  Congress has addressed this problem several times in the past. In fiscal year 1994 Congress appropriated $10 million to initiate repair problems at the above mentioned installations. This allowed the Department to begin correcting the most severe building deficiencies in advance of ownership transfer to the involved LEA's. In fiscal year 1995 Congress appropriated an additional $20 million to continue and hopefully complete this work and transfer ownership.  Though the funds for fiscal year 1995 military school maintenance programs were appropriated almost 6 months ago, I am advised that the Department of Defense has yet to disburse these funds to the appropriate schools.
