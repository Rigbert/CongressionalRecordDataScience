 President, on June 27-29, more than 5,000 individuals and businesses will gather in Birmingham for Alabama Business Connections '95. This event is the Alabama Minority Supplier Development Council's largest and most important of the year. It represents an opportunity for suppliers and purchasing personnel from majority and government organizations to network and exchange information.  This important event also gives suppliers and purchasers the chance to develop mutually beneficial business opportunities. During the past 12 years, the Alabama Minority Supplier Development Council has represented a unique partnership of buyers and suppliers, serving as an important resource for identifying certified minority suppliers as well as a clearinghouse for business development news and purchasing information.  Mr. President, the members of the Alabama Minority Supplier Development Council acknowledge that suppliers can provide quality goods and services. The board of directors, membership and staff are committed to promoting economic development opportunities for minority businesses, and I am proud to recognize them here in the Senate for all of their important work. I wish them the best for a successful event in June and congratulate them on more than a decade of service to the members of Alabama's business community.                          ____________________
