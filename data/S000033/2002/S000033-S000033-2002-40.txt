 Speaker, one of the untold and unspoken-about crises facing this country is that in many respects we are losing our democratic traditions. As you know, France recently had an election, and 80 percent of the people voted in that election. We are going to have an election in November, and the estimate is that 35, 36 percent of the American people are going to vote in our election. And, in fact, we end up having by far the lowest voter turnout of any industrialized and major nation on earth.  What makes the situation even scarier is that as low as the voter turnout in general is, it is especially low among young people, people 25 years of age or younger. And the estimates are that about 80 percent of those people do not vote. And what sociologists tell us that as these people get older, they are less likely to vote, which means the voter turnout will go down and down and down. And it is not just voter turnout, Mr. Speaker, it is that poll after poll shows that millions of Americans do not know how government functions, do not know anything about the major issues facing our country, and I think that this is a very scary situation.  With these concerns in mind, Mr. Speaker, on April 8, 2002, I held a town meeting geared toward young people, high school students. I wanted these high school students to understandthat as citizens of the United States of America, they have the right to ask their Member of Congress questions and they have the right to voice their opinions about some of the most important issues facing our State and our country. And I am proud to tell you that we had about 14 different schools and youth organizations participate in that process.  I think the American people would have been extremely proud to have heard the intelligent comments and analysis and questions that these young people asked. I am very grateful that the University of Vermont allowed us to use their facilities. I am very grateful that we had many faculty members at high schools throughout the State helping us in this project.                              {time}  1930  Mr. Speaker, what I would like to do now is provide for the Record some of the very excellent testimony that we heard on that occasion.                           Is NATO Necessary?                      (On behalf of Hailey Davis)       HAILEY DAVIS: America is a great nation. It is a great      nation with great abilities. Fighting distant wars just      happens to be one of them. When it comes to equipment and      technology needed to fight its wars, America has it all. The      United States has become so independent and self-sufficient      militarily and intellectually speaking, that it can put up a      great fight alone. So the question arises: Do we need NATO      anymore?       The fact that the United States is so much more      technologically advanced than any of its NATO allies brings      about an answer of: No. Frankly, we don't. We have      increasingly lost every and any need for the NATO alliance,      due not only to our technology but to the unilateralism of      the Bush administration. He and his team tend to dislike      fighting with aid from allies who might get in the way or      limit America's room for military exercises.       Will the NATO nations ever fight together again? I'm      quoting New York Times journalist Thomas L. Friedman here      when I say that ``to fight a modern war today you need four      key issues: Many large transport aircraft to deploy troops to      far-flung battlefields; precision-guided bombs and missiles      that can hit enemy targets with a high degree of certitude,      hence lowering number of civilian casualties; a large amount      of special teams that can operate at night with the proper      equipment; and secure and cryptic communications, so that      ground and air troops can be connected in a high-tech war      without the enemy listening in.''       Now, America has all four of these Assets. No other nation      does. Although Britain comes close, with Germany, France and      Italy right behind it, the United States stands alone in its      military stature. The fact that the European defense      industries are not nearly as sophisticated as America's      today, constitutes primarily for their dependence on the NATO      alliance. Adding to this is the idea Europeans don't really      feel threatened by the U.S.'s enemies, such as Bush's Axis of      Evil, which includes Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and      therefore don't have much interest in spending a lot on      defense. So if the Europeans really want NATO to last,      perhaps they should invest more in military technology so      that they can potentially fight a war alone, much like the      U.S. can.       If the NATO alliance deals with countries helping each      other fight wars, and America doesn't need this help, then I      ask you to consider the question: Is NATO really necessary      for the United States?                                  ____                  Change of Leadership in Middle East                     (On behalf of Timothy Plante)       TIMOTHY PLANTE: Okay. The current aggression in Israel and      its occupied territories represent a clash between two      people, the Palestinians and the Israelis, and the leadership      of these two states or people represent a clash of values,      and the leaders of the two people--that would be are Arafat      and Sharon--are both very radical in their views, and they      are opposing. In order to come to an agreement and to peace,      something has to change, and that is what I'm going to deal      with.       Ariel Sharon epitomizes the political views of his Likud      party. This party's motto is: Don't give an inch.      Negotiations with the Palestinians will never happen as long      as Ariel Sharon is in power. He has no intention to negotiate      for peace. Sharon has actually used violence as a campaign to      get into his position.       One thing that he did during the run for the election of      prime minister was that he went to the Temple Mount, and he      basically did it to provoke violence from the Palestinians,      to make Ehud Barak look like he didn't have control over the      situation in Israel. As soon as we went up there, he--     although he didn't do anything, he just went up there and      looked around, he did that because he knew it would tick off      the Palestinians. And they started a campaign of violence in      retaliation, and this made Barak look bad, and therefore      Ariel Sharon came into power.       In order for Arafat to continue his campaign against the      Palestinians, he has now started to be extremely aggressive      against the Palestinians. The Palestinians have many martyrs,      as they call them, which have been--they have been killed by      the Israeli army as collateral damage, and these are women      and children and men, and these people didn't intend any      violence to the Israelis, but they died because the Israelis      were being aggressors.       And then the Palestinians take these martyrs, and they say:      Look what happens to us. We want to retaliate. So they      retaliate with suicide bombers, and then Ariel Sharon wants      to retaliate against the suicide bombers, and this creates a      cycle of violence and destruction.       I believe the only way to end this cycle is through our      allies the Israelis. Not many people know the U.S. gives, as      Tim said earlier, the .1 percent--or whatever the number was,      one-third of that money goes directly to the Israelis. So      one-third of our foreign aid goes to the Israelis, and of      that figure, $2.04 billion is in military aid, and $720      million is in economic aid. This is obviously showing that we      are as belligerent as Sharon is, and as the Israeli Likud      party is.       The only way to stop the aggression is by us altering the      funding that we give to the Israeli people. If we tell Sharon      that he needs to stop being violent and belligerent, he needs      to stop invading these territories and stop killing people,      and have his army stop doing all the negative things he is      doing, he might laugh. But if we say, We are funding your      country, and threaten to take away the funding, he won't have      an army anymore. He will have nothing to attack with. So if      we play hardball with Sharon, we will be able to influence      him into bringing along peace.       Now, on the other side is Yasar Arafat. And this guy is a      waffle. He picks one side that is the most popular, to stay      in power. He has been in power for a very long time. He      started out as a terrorist or as a freedom fighter, he did      terrorist acts, and he gained popularity. And he has changed      his views on the position several times. But he does this to      stay in power.       And the popular thing right now is to go against the      Israelis and the Americans. So what Yasar Arafat says to the      American press in English is not what he says to his own      people in his language. It is completely different. and he is      sending mixed messages to the world. He and his people are      using the international media as a way of showing their side      of the story, to gain sympathy in the international field,      and this is creating problems for Israel, making them look      bad, and this is creating problems for America, which has      been referred to as ``the big Satan.''       To recap, if we force the Israelis to come to a peace      agreement with the Palestinians by either giving up the      occupied territories or coming to some sort of agreement, a      cease-fire, the Palestinian people will find peace, they      won't have as many martyrs. This will be a good thing.      Because Yasar Arafat goes on popular opinion, and as popular      opinion will turn towards peace instead of violence, that      will bring an end to the problem in Israel.                                  ____                          Bettering Education                  (On behalf of Elizabeth Christolini)       ELIZABETH CHRISTOLINI: Middle East conflict. Just as I wish      that someday there will be peace between the Israelis and      Arabs, I wish also that there were peace in the workings of      the education system within the United States. The question,      then, which I propose, perhaps foolishly, is how to go about      achieving this peace.       By traveling 45 minutes twice a day, five days a week to a      parochial high school in Burlington. I am going to school not      so much for the religious faith but rather because my parents      and I felt that my local high school was not a place from      which I could create a solid future.       Our assessment of both schools was done much in the same      way that one's college choices may be established, by      research concerning a wide variety of things, the most      important of which was teacher accountability or lack      thereof, the lack of accountability--by that, I mean the      disregard on behalf of a teacher for his or her student, or      where a student is passed through a grade despite the fact      that he or she has not truly completed work satisfactorily      enough to be granted admission to the next grade.       While the school I currently attend is a far cry from      perfect, I feel that I have learned more than I would have      had I attended my local high school. As pleased as I am to      say that my education has done something to me and will      enable me to do more in the future, I, at the same time, find      myself thinking of the students who do attend my local high      school, who are, as I am, nearly finished with their high      school careers, and who may be wishing their own education      had been better or different.       My belief is that, if education is to work as it ought to,      there should be no need for private and public schools. There      should, instead, be the same form of education available in      each and every institution. In saying this, I do not mean      for the creation of a flat-out equality where what is      right for one is right for all, but, rather, the kind of      education that I received in my high school should be      given to all of the students; and vice versa, those      classes and options which are not available today in my      school should be maintained.       Such a sharing could be done through the creation of a new      institution where a public school is interconnected or      combined, whether a private or parochial school, while still     retaining the government funds, as well as the right of      separation of church and state. In essence, such an      institution would provide students everywhere for a better      and cheaper education, thus enabling more families to have      the funds needed to pay for cost of college tuition.       Within the shared schools, advanced placement, honors,      remedial and other classes which catered towards a person's      strengths and weaknesses would not only be available, but, as      well, each would hold to a strictly followed set of      prerequisites such as tests, shared recommendation for prior      classes, on which admission to such a class could be based,      allowing for the classes to be taught at a level specified to      students who truly meet this level.       Payment of teachers would be increased, in conjunction with      the more demanding set of stipulations on which these      teachers would be hired. Rather than giving the position to a      person simply for the fact that he or she showed up for the      interview and had achieved a minimal degree, a teacher's      performance in achieving this degree, as well as to their      overall talent and work ethic, would be considered.       With the hiring of these qualified as well as motivated      people--and I know there are some out there, as I have had      the privilege to work with a few of them--there would not be      the need for the constant testing as is proposed by President      Bush's No Child Left Behind Act, where each child from the      third to eight grade would be tested every year in areas of      math, science and English. If a teacher does his or her job      not just adeptly, but, as well, enthusiastically, it stands      to reason that, in combination with up-to-date facilities,      the testing of students each year to ensure the continued      progression of the student body would not be needed. It would      be an accurate assumption to say that both teaching and      learning are occurring at or above the standard level.       This new institution should be formed through the right      kind of slow but effective change. The place at which to      start these changes is in our current schools, public and      parochial as well as private. Reform should be made to      encompass a strict non-toleration rule concerning drugs and      alcohol. This action should include suggestions toward      rehabilitation centers as well as the intervention programs.      The following of this rule will alleviate the various student      behavioral problems, and leave within each school only those      truly willing to learn.       From this point, the reevaluation and decisions concerning      positions held and ability of each teacher should be tested      in a manner similar to the no-tolerance rule for students,      whereas those teachers who do not wish to, should not, and,      consequently, would not be teaching. Lastly, evaluation for      the remaining teachers as well as students should be made      concerning classes. A decision should be informed not only by      those classes which are had and not needed, but as well as by      those needed and not had.       With these changes put into effect, it is my belief that      the creation of a quality high school education for each and      every student in each and every institution would be on its      way.                                  ____                          Multinational Impact                   (On behalf of Rebecca Lee Marquis)       REBECCA LEE MARQUIS: I would like to speak today on the      subject of fast food and how it is permeating our society,      promoting an unhealthy way of life, costing a tremendous      amount of money in healthcare, and the immoral way in which      it targets young children around the world in its      advertising. Ray Crock, the founder of McDonald's, said, ``A      child who loves our television commercials and brings her      grandparents to a McDonald's gives us two more customers.''       We are a nation of instant gratification. We live in a time      when everyone moves at a fast pace. The act of eating,      whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner, is no longer a      social time for families. Our society used to be much more      aware of what it was eating and where the food came from. As      we become more isolated from food production, we become      ignorant of how it is grown, processed and marketed.       Many people today consider themselves too busy to take the      time to think about and prepare healthy meals. For breakfast,      lunch or dinner, we quickly pull into variously shaped but      strategically located buildings and emerge with breakfast      sandwiches, hamburgers, fish sandwiches, fried chicken,      tacos, pizza, fries, shakes, soda, and all the promotional      gadgets that accompany this food. Seesaws, slides, and      rainbow-colored balls are attractive, but when it gets down      to brass tacks, a brand new article on fast food notes, the      key to attracting kids is toys, toys, toys.       But what do we get for this trade-off of time for      convenience? We get overly priced, highly processed, high-     calorie, high-fat, low-nutritional food. We get food with      manufactured flavors that will taste exactly the same from      Boston to San Francisco to Tokyo. These types of eating      habits have led us to our national problem of obesity,      which translates into countless related health problems,      costing millions of dollars in healthcare.       The original Ronald McDonald was a man by the name of      Willard Scott. He was later deemed too overweight; McDonald's      wanted someone thinner to sell it burgers, shakes and fries.      These facts are well-known, and, as adults, we have the      ability to make informed decisions. What is appalling is that      we allow these massive corporations to direct huge national      advertising campaigns at our youth.       Three billion dollars a year is spent on just television      advertising. That number does not include the countless other      ways that advertisements are ingrained into our minds. These      corporations bribe our school systems with cash payments so      that they can market products to captive audiences. Instead      of schools being places of exploration and learning, they      risk becoming warehouses for corporations to sell products      and brainwash future consumers.       We allow the same corporations to develop movies and      cartoons that are nothing more than continuous      advertisements. The corporation's goal is to hook its      customers at younger ages so that they can create consumers      for life. The chains often distribute numerous versions of a      toy, encouraging repeat visits by small children.       What can we do to counter these less-than-admirable      situations? We can begin to slow down and take time to learn      where our food comes from and how it is processed. We can      become better educated about nutrition and try to buy only      foods that are grown, processed and marketed responsibly. We      can learn to grow small gardens, to become better acquainted      with our own health. We can lobby our government leaders to      outlaw the marketing in schools and the marketing to young      children. We need to stop being passive consumers or we risk      becoming captive consumers.                                  ____                   U.S. Aid to Third World Countries                     (On behalf of Tim Fitzgerald)       TIM FITZGERALD: Foreign aid, began by the United States      starting in 1941 and continued after the Second World War.      This plan for rebuilding war-torn nations became known as the      Marshall Plan. About $12 billion dollars was distributed      under this plan, and it was responsible for helping the      nations of Europe regain some financial stability.       Longer-reaching reconstruction was funded by the World      Bank. Later, aid was given to strengthen countries'      militaries, and less humanitarian aid was provided. In the      late 1990s, less than one percent of the gross national      product of the United States of America was used for foreign      aid.       A simple analogy can be used to understand this percentage.      Imagine a man who possesses 100 ears of corn, each with 100      kernels. Now, the man has many neighbors who are starving to      death on a yearly basis, but the man gives away only a total      of twelve kernels of corn in 1998. Not only is the percent      minuscule, but part of this amount never reaches these people      doe to the corruption in their governments.       This may seem ridiculous, but it is what is happening with      U.S. foreign aid. Instead of giving military aid to nations,      it would be much more conducive to provide food and supplies      to developing nations. Especially those in sub-Saharan      Africa, with the AIDS epidemic continuing to plague this part      of the world, this minuscule amount of financial support      being given seems ludicious       Even with President Bush' s provmise of $5 billion extra in      foreign aid, there are problems. Distribution of funds and      aid is a major problem. Giving aid directly to the unstable      regimes which govern the poorer states is not a good policy.      Work of this kind should be done directly with the      population. This would be more efficient for governments      that are unable to distribute aid and prevent corrupt ones      from stealing it.       An important part of foreign aid is healthcare. Many      African nations are unable to take care of giving children      basic inoculations, let alone the staggering number of      individuals living with HIV AIDS. In some places, about 35      percent of the adult population has contracted the disease.      Education is also needed to help these developing nations.       But the key to healthcare is efficiency. Private healthcare      organizations are leading the way with this. Vaccines often      go bad while on route to those who need them, so a new type      of indicator was developed to tell those containers that      still retain potency from those that are past their prime.      This development helps to waste as little as possible of      supplies that are often in short supply anyway.       Education is an important part of foreign aid, which is      often ignored. This includes people from all sections of      society--men, women, children, and all ethnicities. An      example of this is the amount of children being born in sub-     Saharan Africa. Traditionally, families in Africa has many      children, as a sign of prestige and help with work. If these      families were informed how having more children is both a      strain on family and country, they might have less children,      thus freeing more aid and bettering the chances for survival      of their child. With resources being strained less, there      might be a better chance for the development of a strong body      of workers who would in turn improve the economy, and      ultimately the government.       Foreign aid is an important part of foreign policy and must      be utilized in order to truly secure the United States of      America. States in poverty are often unstable and this can      translate into a hatred of the United States. For example,      the average income of an individual in certain states could      be under $500. That is not to say it is the only factor      involved, in certain situations. Far from it. But perhaps, if      the standard of living was increased, there would be less of      a sense of unrest.       Aid must, however, be reformed in two main ways. First,      more must be spend by the United States on foreign aid in      general. Secondly, distribution must be looked at. It is not      helpful to send aid to a foreign country which does not have      the means to distribute it or withholds it for some other      reason. A $5 billion increase will help, but so will      increasing efficiency so that money goes further.       So, Congressman Sanders, I would ask you that, when and if      legislation on foreign aid reform comes up, you work for and      vote for foreign aid reform.                                  ____                          Arab-Israel Conflict                     (On behalf of Pierson Booher)       PIERSON BOOHER: The increasing violence in the Middle East      led many people to question our nation's policy in the      region. Since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948,      the United States has had fluctuating relations with Middle      Eastern countries.       It took heavy convincing by President Jimmy Carter to      persuade Anwar Sadat to recognize Israel and form good      relations with the country and Prime Minister Menachem Begin.      The Camp David accords of 1979 stirred up the Arab world,      eventually resulting in the assassination of Sadat in 1981.       The Middle East is not a liberal region, but rather a land      of Islamic extremists ready to defend their faith to block      the spread of westernization. Back in time before the Gulf      War, before Lebanon, before the Six Day War, and even before      the creation of Israel, the world has been saturated with the      Middle East, not because of their culture or the beauty of      the land, but rather because of a prosperous natural product      that floods the region: Oil.       Our nation's dependency on oil has led us to base our      relations in the region solely on the influence of oil in      regards to a particular problem. President Bush has attempted      to find alternative sources of oil by improving regions with      Russian President Vladimir Putin, and pushing for drilling in      the Alaskan wildlife refuge.       The increasing numbers of suicide bombings in Israel has      led many to question the definition of the word      ``terrorism.'' Terrorism can be defined as an act of violence      done to a group of persons. Although there are many      similarities between President Bush's terrorists and Ariel      Sharon's terrorists, Bush has shifted his stance.       He recently sent envoy Anthony Zinney back to the region to      help ease tensions and push for peace. Bush also sent      Secretary of State Colin Powell to Israel last Thursday to      bid an end to the conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel      Sharon recently declared war on Yasar Arafat and the PLO.      Unwilling to resume peace talks until Arafat helps put an end      to terrorism existing in Israel. In response Arab leaders      have said that ending occupation will lead to the end of      terrorism.       President Bush's war on terrorism came as a result of the      September 11th tragedies, while Sharon's war on terrorism      stems from the suicide bombings that have taken place for a      few years, the bombings being a result of the 35-year      occupation of Palestinian territories. Diplomats have said      that the Arab world is looking to the United States to draw      red lines for Israel, for it to withdraw its forces from      Palestinian territories. In response, columnist Friedman has      said, if Arab leaders have only the moral courage to draw      lines around Israel's behavior, but no moral courage to decry      the utterly corrupt and inept Palestinian leadership for the      depravity of suicide bombers in the name of Islam, then we're      going nowhere.       Sharon probably wishes he had dealt with Arafat in Beirut      when he had the chance. But he did not do anything more than      allow the PLO to regroup and regain momentum. In order for      the United States to have an impact on the current Arab-     Israeli conflict, the country must begin working from the      bottom up. We have from the Iran Contra issue that there are      other anti-Israeli countries supplying Palestinian militant      groups with weapons.       Unlike the Israel army, the U.S. must seek to cut off the      suppliers, such as Iran. In doing so, the U.S. will destroy      the lifelines of the militant groups in the region, most      notably Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Al Aqsa Brigade and another      group. After the militant group's suicide bombings, all that      is left is the heart of the people. Yes, no one will be able      to destroy the foundation of the Palestinian struggle      (inaudible) nationalism. But the destruction of those who      facilitate the cause would be a decisive and crushing blow.       At a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair over      the weekend, the President said that Iraq would be a better      place without Saddham Hussein. The same can be said about      Palestine and Israel with regards to Yasar Arafat. One could      also say the same about the world with regard to Osama bin      Laden. But what President Bush needs to understand is that      there could very well be an even more persuasive, powerful      Napoleonic man looming in the background waiting for his      moment to take over in a coupless revolution.       If Hussein refuses to meet the demands of the U.N. weapons      inspectors, there could very well be a U.S. return to Iraq      and a more dangerous successor. The United States needs to      understand that our nation has become too reliant on the      Middle East oil. We live in a country that is enormously      dependent on a natural resource that is found in a hostile      region. The U.S. must reduce their dependence on the region's      oil and look elsewhere, something Bush has already begun to      do.       Because of our new relations with Russia and the access of      oil that is in circulation, gas prices have fallen 7.1 cents      since last year, to an average of $1.32 per gallon. A      decrease in dependency on the Middle East oil reserves will      help give the country more confidence and less to lose.       In the past we have based many of our diplomatic relations      and war strategies around the impact it would have on our      ability to obtain oil. Along with the exporting of oil,      Russia could serve as a possible coalition member down the      road. As a result of this retraction, the United States gives      itself more leeway in the Arab world and begins to lose the      title of taker.       There may never be a conclusion to the conflict between      Israelis and Palestinians. The fighting has gone for so long,      there does not seem to be an end in sight. The second      Intifada has proven many wrong when they said that the      Palestinians had no chance against the might of the Israeli      defense forces.       The disciplined Israeli army is scared to work in the      occupied territories, fearful that they will be killed by a      suicidal Palestinian. The Massad, Israel's renowned      intelligence bureau, and arguably the best in the world, has      failed in providing pivotal information.       The United States' success in the Middle East begins with      the successful defense of the Israeli policy of withdrawal of      dependency on the region's oil. But our diplomacy in the      region has been suspect in the past. We cannot handle      relations in Iran. We give foreign aid to Turkey, who turns      around and uses the money to oppress the Kurds. And we have      angered many of the Muslims who live in the world.       The United States needs to sit down and decide exactly what      stance it wants to take in the region, and deal with the      problems that result from their decision. The question now      is, Can the United States step up to the plate and prove that      we are the most powerful country in the world?                                  ____                       Alternate Energy Vehicles              (On behalf of Jack Fleisher and Elden Kelly)       JACK FLEISHER: We are going to be talking about alternative      energy vehicles today.       Motor vehicle transportation is invaluable to people across      the globe. In Vermont alone, fossil fuel comprises 65 percent      of total petroleum energy use. In today's industrial society,      the lifestyles of most humans depend on automotive      transportation.       Unfortunately, the operation of such vehicles requires the      combustion of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases as      carbon dioxide. Acting essentially as a heat-trapping gas      when released into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide could      potentially contribute to a rise in the global temperature.      The global warming is a serious environmental concern that      will significantly impact the entire world's ecology. That is      why we must begin to act now by taking advantage of currently      available alternative energy vehicles in Vermont as a step      toward a mode of transportation that is at once      environmentally sound as well as readily accessible.       ELDEN KELLY: I am going to discuss three types of      alternative energy vehicles, that being electric, hybrid, and      biodiesel.       First, we will direct your attention to electric vehicles.      For a motor vehicle that runs on gasoline, approximately 85      cents of every dollar are consumed by smoke and heat alone,      which leaves only 15 cents out of every dollar to be used in      actual operation. But for the electric car, with the      efficiency of a batter, 55 cents are used at the actual      driving wheels.       Batteries are only getting more efficient for electric      vehicles. Lithium batteries have increased the      mileage capacity from 120 miles from each charge to over      300 miles. an electric car can be 97 percent cleaner than      a car that runs on fossil fuels if the pollution of the      electric power plants are eliminated. Electric cars will      meet this efficiency standard as Vermont moved towards      utilizing more alternative energy sources, such as wind      and geothermal power, which Dean has mentioned as possible      litigation. Over 90 percent of the daily trips made in the      U.S. are under 50 miles. This is well within the range of      most electric vehicles, that are about 40 to 60 miles.       JACK FLEISHER: A second type of alternative energy      transportation are hybrid vehicles, which is a combination of      electricity and gasoline. There are primarily two hydrocars      available in the U.S., the Honda Insight and Toyota Prias.      The power source of the Insight is called a parallel hybrid      system. The car possesses a fuel tank that supplies gasoline      to an engine, as well as batteries that supplies power to an      electrical energy motor. Both the engine and the motor can      activate the transmission at the same time, setting the      wheels in motion.       As opposed to an electric vehicle, these two hybrid models      never have to recharge from an external electrical power      source. Instead, a set of batteries harnesses the energy      dispelled from the engine, as well as the energy released      from braking. The Insight, on the other hand is capable of      fuel efficiency at 70 miles per gallon. The Toyota Prias is      slightly different. It is comprised of a series hybrid      system. In this case, a gasoline engine is used to power a      generator that supplies energy to the battery's electric      motor.       The Prias is equipped with a gear box that allows the      vehicle to run solely on the electric motor, the gas engine,      or both simultaneously. Both hybrid cars exceed the fuel      efficiency of all vehicles that run solely on     gasoline, and cut greenhouse-gas emissions in half.       ELDEN KELLY: Next, we'll discuss biodiesel.       This ingenious concept springs from the fact that the oils      used in modern day petroleum come from the same plants that      are still around today, such as soy and palm oil. The      essential oils that, after much time, produce petroleum are      available immediately from nearly any vegetable substance.      The oils obtained can only be used as a fuel source for      diesel vehicles, due to a fundamental difference between the      operation of a diesel- and gasoline-powered engines.       A diesel system uses high heat and pressure for combustion,      which a gasoline-powered engine cannot provide. Biodiesel      requires conditions of high heat and pressure in order to      burn effectively. Fortunately, in order to use biodiesel, no      modification is necessary for the working diesel engine.       The production of biodiesel is incredibly simple compared      to the complex process of refining petroleum. Biodiesel is      composed of only a simple mixture of vegetable oil, lye and      methanol. The transglycerides present in the acids of the      vegetable oil are combined with sodium and potassium      hydroxide of the lye and methanol, which produces the      compound methyloxide. The triglycerides react with      methyloxides resulting in the formation of methyl esters,      which is burnable by biodiesel, and also a by-product,      glycerin.       Using biodiesel in vehicles is probably the single most      inexpensive manner of operating a fuel-burning vehicle, in      that its sources, vegetable oils, can be reused. Used soybean      oil, for example, from a fast-food restaurant that is      throwing away millions of gallons daily can be recycled in      the engine of the care burning clear of greenhouse-gas      emissions.       The little carbon dioxide that is released from the      combusion of biodiesel is reduced by the plants in      respiration. So the very sources of biodiesel plants have      what help to reduce these minor emissions. A plant by-product      in this way completes the natural role that plants already      play in a cycle of conservation. Unlike petroleum fuel,      biodiesel originates from the renewable sources that ensure a      supply of energy for vehicles in the future.       Moreover, the oils used in biodiesel are available right      now for usage in vehicles. 3.5 billion gallons of vegetable      oil are used in the U.S. every day, and already, biodiesel      companies are receiving soybean oil free, because of the      current surplus of soybean oil. Excitingly, this wasted      resource can be utilized in the vehicles that are now      unreasonably inefficient.       No longer will we have to worry about the dwindling supply      of petroleum resources, taking advantage of the more easily      produced and more readily available biodiesel.       JACK FLEISHER: In conclusion, we must assert that      alternative energy vehicles are not merely a scientist's      gadget or a new gimmick. As responsible human beings, we must      look towards ways in which we can better our actions, in      order to make the world a better place for future      generations. One of the ways in which we can do that is by      reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, which, when consumed,      result in various hazardous effects.       In recent months, concern over reliance on Middle East oil      has spread because of the attacks of September 11th. Many      speculated that money generated from Middle Eastern oil sales      to the United States has financed terrorist operations such      as the attack on the World Trade Center. Unfortunately, many      politicians have responded to this concern which a renewed      fervor for drilling domestically, such as in Alaska.       However, we wish to refocus this issue in terms of      alternative energy vehicles, which would rid our dependence      on oil altogether, ensuring that gas money doesn't end up in      Al Qaeda's pockets, and that the Earth is a cleaner, cooler      place for years to come.       This takes us to our next area of concern, the rise in      global temperature on Earth. Throughout history, major shifts      in temperature----       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: I will ask you to try to tighten it      up.       ELDEN KELLY: All right.       Lastly, we will close with possible ways to institute      alternative energy vehicles in Vermont. To place emphasis on      improved efficiency of such vehicles, tax incentives to be      supplied for owners of biodiesel, electric and hybrid      vehicles.       An active public campaign needs to be launched, with the      goal in mind and educate motorists of the environmental      impact of cars that run on fossil fuel, and to make them      aware of the attainability of these greatly affordable,      available and simple vehicles that do not impact the      environment negatively.       Already, alternative energy vehicles are in promotion      across the U.S. The organization E-Vermont has been testing      the viability of the vehicles in colder climates, and finding      great success. There was concern that the vehicles would have      difficulty remaining heated, since there is no direct heat      source, but space heaters have been installed to solve the      problem. Right here in UVM, a bus runs on biodiesel. Isn't      that a testament already to the real practicality of      alternative energy?       To continue our vision as concerned citizens, we wish that      the government of Vermont realizes the potential of      alternative-energy vehicles by making a conscious decision to      make energy efficiency a top priority in transportation, and      in doing so, to help the realization of alternative-energy      vehicles come to fruition.                                  ____                    Random Drug Testing of Students                      (On behalf of Lindy Stetson)       LINDY STETSON: I am here to discuss random drug testing      throughout high schools for students participating in      extracurricular activities. This is an action being taken      throughout the United States.       Even though most students prefer that it wasn't an option      for school authorities, I believe this is a good idea,      because, as a varsity sports participant and a band member of      my high school, I think that overall performance is important      in athletics and in music. Everyone should be on top of their      game, so to speak, which can't happen if someone on the team      is using drugs throughout the game or during the season.       But I think that, if random drug testing is going to be an      option, it is important about what happens once the athlete      or student who participates in extracurricular activities has      tested positive. I think that, at my school, we have a school      policy that addresses this issue, saying, if caught using      drugs or alcohol, the student is dismissed from the team for      14 calendar days, and must go through counseling.       I think this is a good start, but there needs to be a      stronger form of punishment, because if a student uses drugs,      then there is obviously something wrong, and they need help,      which should be more than counseling. Not only has the      participant harmed himself or herself, they also could cause      damage to the rest of the team.       For example, look at the recent events that have happened      in this winter sports season, especially at Middlebury High      School, where four varsity members were caught using alcohol      during the season. They were then forced to miss ten days of      the basketball season. This incident not only affected the      four athletes as individuals, but it forced the team to      forfeit four games, because these players were very important      players on the team. But what surprised me even more was that      these four athletes were still allowed to practice, but could      not participate in the games.       Even though many complain random drug testing violates      civil rights, I believe that you have signed a contract      stating that you will not use alcohol or other drugs while      participating in a sport event. I mean, look at the Olympics.      Many medals have been stripped from athletes because of using      drugs to enhance their performance. They have volunteered to      participate in the Olympics and have been selected by their      country to represent them there. And it is the same in high      school athletics. You have been chosen to show your high      school your ability, and other high schools throughout the      state.                                  ____                              Civil Rights            (On behalf of Vanessa Hinton and Thomas Lawson)       VANESSA HINTON: In the events of September 11th, we, the      citizens of America, have helped expose an unsafety in      America. In order to prevent any event related to terrorism,      the American government has passed the Patriot's Act that      allows them to take anyone into custody without reliable      evidence to back up their reasons.       This is dangerous for those who criticize the government,      giving the government officials the right to arrest anyone at      will. The U.S. is abusing domestic liberties by detaining      people suspected of terrorism and police surveillance of      those who oppose government policies. The military is also      holding private hearings of suspected persons without      releasing information. The government is violating human      rights by doing this, and are becoming terrorists themselves.       No war has been declared. So why are going to such extreme      measures as this? There has been a significant increase of      law enforcement to monitor technology and the Internet.      Government files have been released to lower-ranking law      enforcement, but not the public. They have also been given      the right to tap phone lines without probable cause. How can      we trust a government who doesn't give us reasons or evidence      as to why they are going to such extreme measures?       THOMAS LAWSON: For example, Sieem Al Aran (phonetic) a      Muslim professor at the University of South Florida, was      fired for reasons officials said was because of his speeches      presented to a class on Muslim views. The superintendent of      the school said that they felt at threat if Sieem stayed, and      wished they had fired him sooner. Does this not go against      the First Amendment of the Constitution, freedom of speech?       Another example takes place on an American flight from      Baltimore to Dallas, Wendel Shattner (phonetic) was told to      leave the plane for more checks because of his dark skin and      the fact that he was a federal agent carrying a gun. He had      previously filled out the proper form stating that he was a      federal agent, and, indeed, had a weapon. Yet Shattner got      off the plane, and a flight attendant found a book labeled      The Crusade through Arab Eyes. This was enough evidence to      take him back to headquarters, where he was further      questioned.       Maybe in order for our rights not to be violated, we      should, in turn, question our leaders. If we turn our heads,      we are just as guilty as the condemned.       Thank you.                                       ____                         National Civil Unions              (On behalf of Chastity Norris and Kim Lunna)       CHASTITY NORRIS: We are here today to talk about civil      unions. We believe that there should be a national one. I      know that when Vermont passed civil unions, there were a lot      of people who put up signs saying ``Take Back Vermont.''      People didn't feel it was right for homosexuals to have the      same tax benefits and marriage benefits. No matter what you      call it, marriage, holy union, commitment ceremony, it's      about the love between two people, no matter whether      heterosexual or homosexual.       KIM LUNNA: Of course, civil union marriages have the same      consequences as a hetrosexual marriage. Parties to a civil      union shall be responsible for the support of one another to      the same degree and in the same manner as married people. The      law of domestic relations, including separation and divorce,      child custody, and support, and property division and      maintenance, the rights of parties to a civil union with      respect to a child of whom either becomes the natural parent      during the term of a civil union shall be the same as those      of a married couple.       CHASTITY NORRIS: From the Internet, we got summaries of      talks about civil unions in other states. In November of      1998, the constitutional amendment added to Alaska's state      constitution, to be valid or recognized, a marriage must      exist between a man and a woman. In 1996, Arizona declared      that marriage between persons of the same sex is void or      prohibited, and that same-sex marriage from other states are      not valid.       KIM LUNNA: According to the Declaration of Independence, we      hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men created      equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain      unalienable rights, that cannot be taken away, that among      these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. How can      someone pursue happiness if they are not allowed to live      their lives the same way as everyone else and show their      commitment forever through marriage? We don't think that      everyone is being treated equal.       CHASTITY NORRIS: Ed Flanagan is the only openly gay state      auditor. His sexual orientation was not a problem five years      ago, but now it is. ``It is an issue in every race in      Vermont,'' said Flanagan, a Democrat. This is about quality      and fairness, and nothing more.       When people think of civil unions, they often only think of      gays and lesbians. They don't think of the benefits that come      from marriage, benefits such as estate, medical insurance,      social security and retirement. The decision of the marriage      should be up to those in the relationship, not outside      people.       A solution we had was to suggest a constitutional amendment      to force each state to vote on whether they believed in civil      unions or not.       Thank you.                                  ____                          Affordable Childcare               (On behalf of Amy Downs and Anissa Martin)       AMY DOWNS: We are here to make a presentation on affordable      child care for everybody. We are just here to make sure that      both single moms and struggling couples, whether if they're      married or single, receive proper child care assistance, and      for it to be a safe and educational environment.       As a person who doesn't have any kids, as opposed Anissa      here, I see that some families need assistance, including      those who are not on welfare and that have people working      making eight dollars an hour, and that's like $800 to $900 a      month they are just bringing in. That doesn't count the bills      they have to pay or the food to buy for their families, and      other necessities to support their kids.       People are having kids at a younger age, and in order to      get proper assistance they would basically have to be on      welfare to be able to afford it. And if they're not on      welfare, they will have to wait just a pay off their day care      bills. It is not worth it to some, and they just end up      falling back on welfare, and basically the whole point of the      system is to get people off of welfare. That is why it is      only like a five-year agreement now.       And you can't really do that if you have kids to look out      for all the time. Basically, in the long run, it isn't worth      dealing with the system. It doesn't help you out. It is just      a waste of time, and they don't have the time, when they have      kids, to worry about just it. They would rather just stay      home and collect welfare, and do nothing and get everything      paid for.       ANISSA MARTIN: Before I go on, kids need to stop having      kids. Thank you.       Child care cost about $468 a month in a licensed day care      with no assistance. Because people are having babies at a      younger age, they drop out of school and take care of them.      Now, when they decide to go back to school, they are going to      need help. Most get assistance, if they are single moms, to      help to meet their needs. Most get assistance if they are      single moms, but when you have one person that works and one      person that wants to go back to school, like me, you don't      get as much assistance as others would.       The system says to you, it's too much. When you are only      making $8 an hour, that is not enough. We want to make sure      that there is more assistance available for those who want to      work and go back to school, as well as those single moms that      are out there, who are struggling to get off welfare.       And it is real hard. Me and my fiance, I volunteered from      New York to move down here to better my life, and when I went      down to welfare, they did not help me. They said, well, it      was a voluntary move. And I had to struggle on my own to go      to school, finish my education and for my fiance to find a      good-paying job in order for us to survive. It is just me and      him; I don't have no family or no one. I expected for the      welfare to help me out, which they didn't. I had to do it on      my own. And I am only receiving food stamps up to this day.      But now we figured out, forget them, we are going to have to      do it on our own. It would be really helpful if they do help      me, which I am not receiving help.                                  ____                           Taxation of Minors   (On behalf of Keith Blow, Jessica Oakes, Jessica Davis, Shirlaine                       Miller, and Ruhin Yuridulla)       KEITH BLOW: We are here to raise the issue of tax      withdrawal from minors' paychecks. We feel it is unnecessary      to withdraw federal and state taxes from people under the age      of 18. We, as working teens, believe there is no need for our      money to be taken away from us before we are adults.       JESSICA OAKES: In today's society of high-priced items, it      is difficult for us to balance schoolwork and personal      possessions such as a car, school, gas, insurance, et cetera.      We work hard for the little money we earn. The reality is      that we only get minimum wage, and then should be able to      keep the little amount of money that we do earn. We feel we      should be able to keep this money to save up for higher      education, motor transportation and our personal expenses.       JESSICA DAVIS: My friend works as a cashier receiving only      5.50 per hour. This is not even minimum wage. Juggling      schoolwork and a social life, he is also trying to pay off a      truck. It is taking him longer to make payments because of      his small paycheck, not to mention the taxes being taken away      from it. If the government took out less or no taxes from his      paycheck until he was 18, he would be able to pay the truck      off more efficiently and have more time to concentrate on      other important issues, without worrying about not having      enough money to pay for the truck.       SHIRLAINE MILLER: At this age, we are not old enough to      vote, fight in the military, drink, or sign a legal document      for ourselves. Therefore, the law still considers us      children. With the government taking money out of our      paychecks, they are taking money away from their children. If      we aren't even allowed to vote, and if we have no say in what      the government does, why should we pay taxes towards that?       RUHIN YURIDULLA: Thank you, Congressman Sanders. I am not a      U.S. citizen, but as far as my experience is concerned,      living in the other countries far from the United States,      this thing of income taxes from a minor's check seems very      unfair to me. Because if they did not take taxes out of our      paychecks, it is likely they can get it from the food that we      eat, from the utilities that we use, and from all the things      we use in daily life.       So those taxes can be taken out and they can go to the      government, but unlikely if they take that check, I mean,      money from out of the paychecks of minors. That is like      nothing, because minors have to save some money for their      future. I mean, they are going to go to college, or they have      to build their own lives. I think it should be, I mean, a low      should be passed on this, in order to regard it as not to be      taking money out of minors' paychecks.       Thanks.       KEITH BLOW: So in conclusion, we feel the government should      not take out any taxes from people's paychecks that are under      the age of 18. It is unfair how the government still      considers us children if we are not 18, but it is      hypocritical of them when they take the taxes away from us,      because we can't even vote, so why should they take taxes      away from us if we can't have a say in what they do with it.       JESSICA DAVIS: Taxation without representation, pretty      much.                                  ____                         Investing in Children            (On behalf of Megan Sullivan and Alex McKenzie)       MEGAN SULLIVAN: Representative Sanders, Mr. Gutman, and      fellow students. Good afternoon.       My name is Megan Sullivan. I come before you now as a      representative of a group of students at Harwood Union High      School, in a class called Other Voices. This is a course that      focuses on the suppressed and forgotten voices of past and      present. We read part of a book by Jonathan Kozol entitled      Savage Inequalities.       In this book, Mr. Kozol addresses the issues of the lack of      responsibility that we as a society show for other peoples'      children. Children who are not even given a chance to fail,      let alone to succeed, but are put in the situation because of      their financial and, many times, racial backgrounds. As a      class, we explored the concept of other peoples' children,      and the social implications that such a concept holds.       We are here today because we reject that concept. The      children of the nation are the responsibility of the nation.      We should, as citizens of these United States, provide the      same opportunities to succeed in education, regardless of      one's ability to pay.       We live in a state that recognizes the right to equitable      education regardless of the ability to pay. Vermont's      solution to the problem of inequalities between schools in      the state was Act 60. Though this is a very controversial      issue among Vermonters, and a complicated act, the results      cannot be denied: Act 60 is making significant and steady      progress in reducing inequalities in student resources.       Prior to Act 60, property-rich towns spent an average of 37      percent more per pupil compared to the poorest towns. In the      fiscal year of 2002, the spending gap was less than 13      percent. Bearing in mind how well this has worked in a      mere few years in Vermont, we reason that setting up a      system much like Act 60 on a national level could have      similar effect on a much grander scale.       The right to an equitable education is not one that is      promised in the United States Constitution. However, the      federal government is putting mandates on schools, ranging      from funding of special education to national testing. It is      not ethical to make education reform without providing      adequate resources. The government does appropriate money      towards education, but it is not nearly enough.       The House Minority Report, Education in Crisis, notes that,      nationwide, state education cuts already total $11.3 billion.      The educational reforms included aim high by expecting all      students to meet challenging standards and holding schools      accountable when they fail. But if the federal government is      going to hold states accountable for student performance, it      must also provide the resources needed to meet new federal      goals.       Failing schools cannot be turned around with decreasing      funds. Federal funding is needed in schools where other      peoples' children have been left behind as second-class      citizens. Before we can expect them to succeed on national      standardized testing, we need to level the playing field.       Mr. Sanders, as concerned students and current and future      voters, we call on you and the U.S. Congress to appropriate a      larger portion of the federal budget to education, and to use      this funding to bring all our schools up to a collective and      equitable higher standard.       ALEX McKENZIE: Earlier in the day, students from Proctor      and Brattleboro high schools spoke of the exploitation of      children throughout the world as though these children are      partly our responsibility. We agree. Beyond our state, beyond      our nation, we seek to extend the principle that children of      the world are our responsibility. We call upon our Congress      to set an example for all wealthy nations of the world, to      address the inequity of the public spending on the children      of the world.       The issue of where our nation draws the line on who we are      responsible for is one that is argued feverishly all over the      world. The Declaration of Independence closes with, ``We      mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and      our sacred honor.'' And today, we make another pledge. These      men felt that the people were being oppressed, so they did      what they knew they must and fought back. We have come a long      way since these people wrote this document, and the words      they closed with should have the same meaning, purpose and      dedication for everyone, but with a broader worldwide      perspective.       In the past fifteen years, the world has grown      significantly closer. Communication and trade is but a click      of the mouse away. People are traveling more, cultures are      mixing, and countries growing. Globalization, like it or not,      is real and is here to stay. As our relationships with other      countries grow deeper, we're creating a new community, a      global community. The community is profiting a few of the      larger industrialized nations, but is failing very many      undeveloped countries.       Nearly half of the people in the world live on less than      two dollars a day, and a few survive on one dollar or less.      Most of the people in Latin America, the Middle East and      central Asia are poorer than at the Cold War's close.      Africans live no longer and have no higher incomes than they      did 40 years ago.       These facts are very disturbing and hard to understand.      Understanding is one-dimensional. It is the comprehension of      the intellect; it leads to knowledge, which we all hope we      have more of now. Realization, on the other hand, is three-     dimensional. It is the simultaneous comprehension of the      whole body--the head, heart and physical instincts. It comes      only from experiences. Life requires more than knowledge,      though; life demand right action if knowledge is to come      alive.       So in other words, we all know these injustices now, which      leads us to the question: What are we going to do about it?      If we leave it alone and continue to ignore the suffering,      what use is the knowledge I have shared with you? But there      are caring people in the world who are disturbed by these      facts, people who feel they are part of the global community      and feel it is their duty to help the people in the world by      pledging their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.       What needs to be addressed is how we are going to relieve      these people from oppression and suffering. The answer seems      to point towards a global developing project for the poor      nations of the world. Right now, the World Bank wants rich      countries to double their foreign aid. They have linked      poverty to terrorism, as well, concluding that the security      of rich nations depends on a more just distribution of      wealth.       Is it right to live in a community where so many people are      hungry and starving in a world with enough food for all?      Where so many seek a real education and only get trained in      anger and hatred? Where so many are in chains but aren't      given the freedom to demand it? These people live as part of      our global community, neglected to say the least.       President Bush agrees that poverty and terrorism are      linked, but has taken a different approach to aid. While      asking for huge increases in the military budget, his      administration proposes devoting far smaller amounts to      combat poverty and AIDS. A World Health Organization study      concluded that, by spending $27 million more each year to      fight infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and      malaria, would save 8 million lives a year in the developing      world. Washington seems more interested in stamping out      terrorism, rather than solving the roots of terrorism. Smart      bombs have their place, but smart development assistance can      be much more effective.       Many of these issues were brought up in a world leaders      meeting on March 17. Development of poor nations seems to be      the right way to bring the global community to a stronger,      more stable position. The main concern on a lot these richer      nations' minds was wealth. Essentially, it all does come down      to the issue of wealth. What is wealth if not a means to a      greater end? Aren't peoples' lives worth more than building      weapons? Wouldn't it be smarter to invest in the children of      the world to create a stronger, more stable future for the      new generations to come? I guess it all comes down to the      question: Would we rather pay now or pay later?                                  ____                         Impact of Tobacco Use               (On Behalf of Heidi Neil and Martha Mack)       HEIDI NEIL: We are going to start with a couple of facts      first.       MARTHA MACK: Five hundred million people alive today will      eventually be killed by tobacco. Another four million people      died from tobacco-related illnesses in 2000. By the year      2030, ten million people will die each year of tobacco.      Smoking-related diseases are responsible for one in ten adult      deaths worldwide.       Tobacco will soon become the leading cause of death      worldwide, causing more deaths than HIV mortality, automobile      accidents, homicide and suicide combined.       HEIDI NEIL: Every day, approximately 80,000 to 100,000      young people around the world become addicted to tobacco. If      this trend continues, 250 million children alive today will      die from tobacco-related diseases.       We are speaking today on the impact of tobacco on Vermont,      the United States, and, most importantly, teenagers.      Teenagers are the most important and integral part of big      tobacco's manipulation. The companies' advertising plan      markets cigarettes directly towards teenage consumers.      Millions and millions of dollars are spent annually by      tobacco companies to convince teens that smoking is glamorous      and hip and cool.       Cigarettes are a very interesting product to market. It's      one of the few products which, if used correctly, is actually      designed to kill the consumer. As we said before, four      million people died in tobacco-related deaths in the year      2000. That is more than 10,000 dying each day. The tobacco      companies would go out of business if they didn't pursue      additional consumers to replace the customers who are dying      each day.       In short, for each person who dies a tobacco-related death,      tobacco companies have to replace the person. Why replace      that person with another 40-year old who will die in a matter      of 40 years or less?       MARTHA MACK: Tobacco companies are much smarter and more      cunning than that. They market teenagers. If you start      smoking as a teenager, become addicted and smoking for your      entire life, big tobacco makes a lot of money off of your      life and your health.       There is, however, another very important reason that      younger and younger teens are the target group being marketed      by the tobacco corporations. Studies have also found that if      people do not start smoking cigarettes by the time they reach      the age of 20, it is very unlikely they will ever start.       HEIDI NEIL: There are informed and concerned teens out      there like us who are desperately trying to bring down      tobacco companies, using knowledge as our weapon, to educate      the masses. Margaret Mead said, ``Never doubt a small group      of thoughtful citizens can change the world; indeed it is the      only thing that ever has.''       We're trying to change the world and asking the help of      Vermont legislature. We're looking to the legislature to pass      the cigarette tax. While the 67-cent tax helps, we are sure      that we here in Vermont can do much better. We are sure that      we should do better. For the sake of the teens in Vermont and      for the long-term health costs associated with smoking, help      us change the world and Vermont.                          ____________________
