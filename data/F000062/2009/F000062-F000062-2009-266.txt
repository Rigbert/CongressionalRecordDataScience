 Amendments will be received to this bill. I say to my colleagues, if you have an amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill, please come to the floor.                           Order of procedure  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the September 16 order with respect to H.R. 3288 be modified to provide that the Senate resume consideration of the bill at 2:30 p.m., with the remaining provisions still in effect. That is the housing and transportation bill. Further, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:30 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Gerard E. Lynch to be a U.S. Circuit Court judge for the Second Circuit; that there be 2 hours of debate with respect to the nomination, with the time equally divided and controlled by Senators Leahy and Sessions or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the nomination be set aside to recur upon passage of H.R. 3288; that prior to the vote on confirmation of the nomination and the Senate resuming executive session,there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled; that upon confirmation, the motion to reconsider the vote be considered made and laid upon the table; that no further motions be in order; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate then resume legislative session.
