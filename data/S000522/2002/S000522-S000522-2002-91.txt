Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to reiterate to my colleagues that in a letter dated July 11, 2002, Secretary of State, Colin Powell; and Paul O'Neill, Secretary of the Treasury, have made it very clear that, and I quote them. ``We are writing to reiterate the administration's strong opposition to any legislative efforts that weaken the United States' current Cuba policy by permitting U.S. citizens to finance the Cuban purchase of American agriculture commodities or by changing the restrictions on travel.''                              {time}  2145  They would recommend a veto if the legislation reaches his desk with those changes.  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Moran amendment. I certainly respect my good friend and colleague, but I urge a ``no'' vote, nevertheless.
