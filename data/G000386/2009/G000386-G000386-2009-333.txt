 President, I come to the floor to raise questions about whether Mr. Lynn ought to be Deputy Secretary of Defense. I do it with the normal courtesy, that a President ought to be able to name people to his team, and I do it based upon two questions: One, the use of the waiver for him to be in this position contrary to the Executive order of President Obama; and, secondly, to raise questions about his activity as chief financial officer in the second Clinton administration, and now coming to be Deputy Secretary of Defense. I will try to lay this out as best I can with documentation.  I will not be able nor do I need to document the first consideration on the waiver. I wanted to express views on it.  I thought I had seen the last of Mr. Lynn when President George W. Bush first took office. I was dead wrong. So I had to send my staff out to where the Senate buries old skeletons. It is the Records Center out in Maryland, the scenic countryside about 20 miles from the Capitol. There I had my staff dig up the remains of what came to be known, and what I came to know about Mr. Lynn's activities as chief financial officer about 10 years ago.  I would give a little bit of word of advice to my colleagues, archival of your materials. I found that political nominees, good and bad, come back like Australian boomerangs. Some take longer than others to return, but eventually you will see them again.  Mr. Lynn is currently employed as senior vice president, government operations, of a major defense contractor, Raytheon. Until June 2008, Mr. Lynn was registered as Raytheon's principal lobbyist to the Department of Defense.  I have serious questions about the nomination. My first area of concern is that Mr. Lynn does not appear to meet President Obama's strict new ethical standards for executive branch appointees. Those standards were laid down in an Executive order of January 21, 2009.  It is important for me to say what ethics means to me. Everyone has a different idea as to what ethics represents. This is a complicated issue, and I don't want there to be any confusion about this word or principle. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines the word ``ethics,'' one, as the discipline dealing with what is good and bad, with moral duty and obligation. This definition is very clear, but I want to go a step further to say that, to me, ethics are very uncomplicated principles of life. Simply put, when faced with tough choices or decisions, we must always do what is true and correct.  Throughout the Presidential campaign, candidate Barack Obama repeatedly promised to close the revolving door and change the political culture in Washington. This was one of his top priorities. Consistent with those promises, within 24 hours of being sworn in, he signed the Executive order that set new ethical standards in stone. Under the ``revolving door ban'' section of those rules, Mr. Lynn should have been barred from serving as Deputy Secretary of Defense until July 2011. I understand Mr. Lynn has been given a special order by the administration to further the public interest.  According to a letter I have received from OMB Director Peter Orszag of February 3, 2009--and I have it here if anybody is interested in reading it. Senator Levin has already had this letter printed in the Record.  According to this letter from OMB Director Peter Orszag of February 3, 2009, Mr. Lynn's waiver was based on ``exigent circumstances relating to national security.''  Director Orszag stated:       Mr. Lynn is uniquely qualified for this position and is      urgently needed to serve on the President's national security      team.  Mr. Orszag was responding to my letter of January 29, 2009, asking for the justification of the waiver.  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 2009.     Hon. Peter Orszag,     Director, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC.       Dear Director Orszag: I write today to express my concerns      with the recent decision to grant a waiver for Mr. William J.      Lynn, exempting him from the strict new ethics rules outlined      in President Obama's Executive Order titled ``Ethics      Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel,'' signed on      January 21, 2009.       Mr. Lynn has been nominated by the President to serve as      the Deputy Secretary of Defense. He is currently employed as      a senior vice president at a major Department of Defense      (DOD) contractor--Raytheon Company. Until very recently, he      was also registered as Raytheon's principal lobbyist to the      DOD.       Throughout the presidential campaign, President Obama      repeatedly promised the American voters that he would ``close      the revolving door'' in order to greatly limit the role of      lobbyists in his administration. He warned lobbyists, they      ``won't find a job in my White House'' and [lobbyists] ``will      not run my White House, and they will not drown out the      voices of the American people.'' He also stated: ``If you are      a lobbyist entering my administration, you will not be able      to work on matters you lobbied on or in the agencies you      lobbied during the previous two years [emphasis added].''      Further, President Obama explained why it was important to      close the revolving door: ``Lobbyists spend millions of      dollars to get their way. The status quo sets in. . . . They      use their money and influence to stop us from reforming      [government policies]''. He added, ``. . . together, we will      tell the Washington lobbyists that their days of setting the      agenda are over.''       President Obama's message was crystal clear: allowing      lobbyists to pass freely through the revolving door was      simply not in the public interest. He espoused that lobbyists      in government ``are a problem'' because they block needed      reforms--reforms that Mr. Obama promised to the American      people.       President Obama's promises to ``close the revolving door''      seemed to be a top priority. He meant what he said. He kept      his promise. In fact, within 24 hours of being sworn in,      President Obama signed a new Executive Order titled, ``Ethics      Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel'' to cement his      campaign pledge into an official order. Paragraphs two and      three of Section One--entitled ``Revolving Door Ban''--     appeared to solidify President Obama's pledge to ``close the      revolving door.''       However, exactly two days after signing the Executive      Order, you exercised authority delegated to you under Section      3 of the Executive Order and issued a waiver to Mr. Lynn,      which effectively gutted the ethical heart of the President's      ``Revolving Door Ban.'' I find it difficult to reconcile Mr.      Lynn's nomination to be the Deputy Secretary of Defense with      the purpose and intent of the Executive Order.       Mr. Lynn was a registered Raytheon lobbyist for six years.      His lobbying reports clearly indicate that he lobbied      extensively on a very broad range of DOD programs and issues      in both the House and Senate and at the Department of      Defense. If confirmed, Mr. Lynn would become the top      operations manager in the Pentagon. He would be the final      approval authority on most--if not all--contract, program and      budget decisions. Surely, a number of Raytheon issues would      come across his desk. Mr. Lynn's conflict of interest has      been characterized by some as an ``impossible conflict.'' The      Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, has      stated that Mr. Lynn will have to recuse himself from those      decisions for one year. Since Raytheon is a big defense      contractor, those recusal requirements could limit Mr. Lynn's      effectiveness as Deputy Secretary of Defense.       Based upon President Obama's statements made during the      presidential campaign and leading up to and following the      signing of the Executive Order, I simply cannot comprehend      how this particular lobbyist could be nominated to fill such      a key position at DOD overseeing procurement matters, much      less be granted a waiver from the ethical limitations listed      in the Executive Order.       Additionally, I have serious questions about the message      that this waiver sends to other lobbyists seeking employment      in President Obama's administration. Despite strong language      limiting the role of lobbyists in the Executive Order, it      appears to me that Mr. Lynn's nomination and the waiver      granted to him leaves ``the barn door wide open'' for other      potential nominees with lobbying backgrounds to circumvent      the Executive Order. This is a giant loophole that places the      burden of granting waivers strictly with the Director of the      Office of Management and Budget (OMB). As such, I believe a      detailed explanation of the reason for granting the waiver is      warranted in order to ensure that the granting of future      waivers is done in a fully transparent manner and given the      sunshine such an important decision deserves.       The waiver provision in the Executive Order provides that      the OMB Director may grant a waiver for two reasons, (1)      ``that the literal application of the restriction is      inconsistent with the purposes of the restriction'' or (2)      ``that it is in the public interest to grant the waiver''.      These provisions are general and provide wide latitude in      determining when a waiver is applicable. For instance, in Mr.      Lynn's case, the waiver simply states: ``After consultation      with Counsel to the President, I hereby waive the      requirements of Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Ethics Pledge of      Mr. William Lynn. I have determined that it is in the      public interest [emphasis added] to grant the waiver given      Mr. Lynn's qualifications for his position and the current      national security situation. I understand that Mr. Lynn      will otherwise comply with the remainder of the pledge and      with all preexisting government ethics rules.''       While I am glad to see that the waiver does not appear to      fully circumvent the Executive Order or other existing      government ethics rules, the broad language used in      determining that the waiver is in the ``public interest'' is      a concern. Little detail is provided as to why the waiver is      necessary. Only general criteria used in the analysis and      justification for the waiver are given. Accordingly, I      strongly urge OMB to publicly set forth a list of criteria      utilized to examine whether a waiver would be in ``the public      interest.'' Further, OMB should also publicly set forth      criteria examined to determine when ``literal application of      the restriction is inconsistent with the purposes of the      restriction.'' By making these criteria public, it will go a      long way toward making OMB decisions transparent and      providing the American people with a full accounting of why      waivers to the Executive Order are necessary. I strongly      encourage OMB to do this as soon as possible to ensure those      decisions do not merely become an arbitrary basis to      circumvent the Executive Order.       Additionally, I respectfully request that OMB provide      responses to the following questions:       (1) What criteria did OMB use to determine that Mr. Lynn's      waiver was necessary to further ``the public interest''?       (2) Does OMB believe there are no inherent conflicts of      interest to have Mr. Lynn serve as the Deputy Secretary of      Defense overseeing procurement from a company he formerly      lobbied for? If not, why not?       (3) Given President Obama's position on lobbyists serving      in government positions, did anyone in OMB ask the President      or his Counsel to consider whether other candidates for the      position would be better qualified before granting the Lynn      waiver?       (4) Does OMB believe Mr. Lynn's requirement that he recuse      himself in certain instances under provisions of the      Executive Order not impacted by the waiver will hinder him      from doing the job? Why or why not?       The idea behind President Obama's promise to close the      revolving door and ban lobbyists from his administration had      one purpose: to protect the public interest. The new rules      are designed to protect the taxpayers against wasteful and      unnecessary expenditures and policies that might be advocated      by ``special interests'' inside the government. By granting      Mr. Lynn's waiver, it appears that OMB has undermined the      principal purpose of the new ethics rules--to protect the      public interest. It seems like the OMB waiver embraces the      lobbyist culture that President Obama promised to change. As      Director of OMB, your decisions set the tone for the entire      federal bureaucracy. By making the waiver process more      public, OMB would send a clear and unambiguous message:      transparency is first and foremost when it comes to dealing      with ethics rules.       Please bring transparency and accountability to Mr. Lynn's      waiver and all future waivers of the Executive Order by      providing details about why waivers have been granted and the      criteria used to determine them.       I would very much appreciate a prompt answer to my      questions.           Sincerely,                                                 Charles Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member.
