Mr. Speaker, I submit the following material for inclusion in the Record:           Partial-Birth Abortions: Behind the Misinformation        (By Douglas Johnson, NRLC Federal Legislative Director)       Note: The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833) has been      approved in slightly different versions by the U.S. House of      Representatives (Nov. 1, 1995, on a vote of 288-139) and by      the U.S. Senate (Dec. 7, 1995, on a vote of 54-44). It is      expected that the House will approve the Senate-passed bill      on March 27 and send it to President Clinton soon thereafter.      President Clinton will veto the bill because ``the President      shares the view of many that it would represent an erosion of      a woman's right to choose,'' White House Press Secretary Mike      McCurry said on December 20, 1995.       Opponents of the bill have disseminated an extraordinary      amount of misinformation regarding the partial-birth abortion      procedure and the legislation--much of it starkly      contradicted by the past writings and recorded statements of      doctors who have performed thousands of partial-birth      abortions. Some of this misinformation has been adopted and      widely disseminated by some journalists, columnists,      editorialists, and lawmakers. This factsheet addresses some      of these issues.         What is the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833)?       The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833) would place a      national ban on use of the partial-birth abortion procedure,      except in cases (if there are any) in which the procedure is      necessary to save the life of a mother.       The bill specifically defines a ``partial-birth abortion''      as ``an abortion in which the person performing the abortion      partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing      the fetus and completing the delivery.'' [emphasis added]      Abortionists who violate the law would be subject to both      criminal and civil penalties, but no penalty could be applied      to the woman who obtained such an abortion.       The bill is aimed at a procedure that has often been      utilized by Dr. Martin Haskell of Dayton, Ohio; by the late      Dr. James McMahon of Los Angeles; and by others. This      procedure is generally used beginning at 20 weeks (4\1/2\      months) into the pregnancy, is ``routinely'' used to 5\1/2\      months, and has often been used even during the final three      months of pregnancy.       The Los Angeles Times accurately and succinctly described      this abortion method in a June 16, 1995 news story:       The procedure requires a physician to extract a fetus, feet      first, from the womb and through the birth canal until all      but its head is exposed. Then the tips of surgical scissors      are thrust into the base of the fetus' skull, and a suction      catheter is inserted through the opening and the brain is      removed.       In 1992, Dr. Haskell wrote a paper (``Dilation and      Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion'') that      described in detail, step-by-step, how to perform the      procedure. Anyone who is seriously seeking the truth behind      the conflicting claims regarding partial-birth abortions      would do well to start by reading Dr. Haskell's paper, and      the transcripts of the explanatory interviews that Dr.      Haskell gave in 1993 to the publications American Medical      News (the official AMA newspaper) and Cincinnati Medicine.       Regarding the procedure, Dr. Haskell wrote, ``Among its      advantages are that it is a quick, surgical outpatient method      that can be performed on a scheduled basis under local      anesthesia.'' (p. 33). Dr. Haskell also wrote that he      ``routinely performs this procedure on all patients 20      through 24 weeks LMP [i.e., from last menstrual period] with      certain exceptions'' [i.e., from 4\1/2\ to 5\1/2\ months],      these ``exceptions'' involving complicating factors such as      being more than 20 pounds overweight.       Dr. Haskell also wrote that he used the procedure through      26 weeks [six months] ``on selected patients.'' [p.28]       Dr. James McMahon used essentially the same procedure to a      much later point--even into the ninth month. (Dr. McMahon      died of cancer on Oct. 28, 1995.)       In a letter to Congressman Charles Canady dated March 19,      1996, Dr. William Rashbaum of New York City wrote that he has      performed the procedure ``routinely since 1979. This      procedure is performed only in cases of later gestational      age.''    does the bill contain an exception for life-of-the-mother cases?       As originally passed by the House on November 1, 1995, HR      1833 contained an ``affirmative defense'' provision, which      would have shielded an abortionist from civil and criminal      liability if he showed that he had ``reasonably believed''      that utilization of the partial-birth abortion procedure was      necessary to save the life of a mother.       Similar ``affirmative defense'' exceptions are found in      literally dozens of federal criminal laws. Nevertheless,      after bill opponents distorted this provision, NRLC endorsed      and the Senate unanimously adopted the Smith-Dole Amendment,      which provides that the ban ``shall not apply to a partial-     birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother      whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or      injury.''       Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Ca.), the lead Senate opponent of      the HR 1833, immediately endorsed the Smith-Dole Amendment,      saying:       And now here we have it. Here we have it, an exception now      for life of the mother. I think that is progress, because      when we started there was no exception. It was an affirmative      defense. [Congressional Record, Dec. 5, 1995, p. S 18005]       Under the Smith-Dole Amendment, an abortionist could not be      convicted of a violation of the law unless the government      proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the abortion was not      covered by this exception. (In addition, of course, the      government would have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt,      all of the other elements of the offense--that the      abortionist ``knowingly'' partly removed a baby from the      womb, that the baby was still alive, and that the abortionist      then killed the baby.)       In a Jan. 31 letter to Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua of      Philadelphia, President Clinton acknowledged that the Senate      had added a life-of-mother exception.    what further changes does president clinton demand in the bill?       In a February 28, 1996 letter to certain Members of      Congress, the President insisted that abortionists must be      permitted to use the procedure, not only to save a mother's      life, but also whenever they assert that the procedure is      necessary to prevent unspecified ``serious health      consequences.''       The President's letter proposed precisely the language of      an amendment offered on the Senate floor by Sen. Barbara      Boxer (D-Ca.), which was endorsed by the National Abortion      and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) as a ``pro-     choice vote.''       NARAL and other pro-abortion advocacy groups clearly      recognized that the Boxer Amendment amounted to a re-     statement of the status quo. After the Boxer Amendment was      defeated by only a two-vote margin (51 to 47), a spokeswoman      for the pro-abortion Alan Guttmacher Institute said, ``We      were almost able to kill the bill.'' (Congressional Quarterly      Weekly Report, Dec. 9, 1995, page 3738)       President Clinton--a Yale Law School graduate who once      taught constitutional law--understands very well that with      respect to abortion, ``health'' is a legal term of art. In      Doe v. Bolton (the companion case to Roe v. Wade), the      Supreme Court defined ``health'' (in the abortion context) to      include ``all factors--physical, emotional, psychological,      familial, and the woman's age--relevant to the well-being of      the patient.''       Thus, the Boxer Amendment (demanded by President Clinton)      would allow abortionists to continue to perform partial-birth      abortions, even during the seventh, eighth, and ninth months,      for reasons such as ``depression.'' This is not a far-fetched      hypothetical, as discussed below under ``For What Reasons Are      Partial-Birth Abortions Usually Performed?''       Senator Boxer has added the word ``serious'' before      ``health,'' for optical effect, but adding the word does not      legally narrow the scope of ``health,'' since the amendment      confers on the abortionist himself the unlimited power to      define whether the ``depression'' or other ``health'' concern      is ``serious.'' No partial-birth abortion would ever be      blocked by the law, because the Boxer Amendment confers on      the abortionist absolute authority to decide what the law      means (``in the medical judgment of the attending      physician'').       Thus, a ``life'' exception and a ``health'' exception are      two vastly different things. For example: Prior to enactment      of the Hyde Amendment in 1976, the federal Medicaid program      paid for 300,000 ``health'' or ``medically necessary''      abortions a year; the term was construed to cover any      physician-performed abortion. The Hyde Amendment limited      reimbursement to ``life'' cases, which have been on the order      of 100 to 200 annually. In other words, the ratio of      ``health'' cases to ``life'' cases, under Medicaid, was more      than 1,000 to 1.            how many partial-birth abortions are performed?       Nobody knows. Pro-abortion groups have claimed that      ``only'' 450 such procedures are performed every year. But      the combined practices of Dr. Martin Haskell and the late Dr.      James McMahon alone would have approximated that figure.       In a letter to Congressman Canady dated March 19, 1996, New      York doctor William K. Rashbaum wrote that he has performed      the procedure that would be banned by HR 1833 ``routinely      since 1979. This procedure is performed only in cases of      later gestational age.'' Moreover, The New York Times      reported in a Nov. 6, 1995 news story about the bill:       ``Of course I use it, and I've taught it for the last 10      years,'' said a gynecologist at a New York teaching hospital,      who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``So do doctors in      other cities.''       It is impossible to know how many other abortionists have      adopted the procedure, without choosing to write articles or      grant interviews on the subject. Both Haskell and McMahon      spent years trying to convince other abortionists of the      merits of the procedure. That is why Haskell wrote his 1992      instructional paper. For years, Mr. McMahon was director of      abortion instruction at the Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Los      Angeles.       There are at least 164,000 abortions a year after the first      three months of pregnancy, and 13,000 abortions annually      after 4\1/2\ months, according to the Alan Guttmacher      Institute (New York Times, July 5 and November 6, 1995),      which is an arm of Planned Parenthood. These numbers should      be regarded as minimums, since they are based on voluntary      reporting to the AGI.   For what reasons are partial-birth abortions typically performed?       Some opponents of HR 1833, such as NARAL and the Planned      Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), have persistently      disseminated claimed that the procedure is employed only in      cases involving extraordinary threats to the mother of grave      fetal disorders. Regrettably, more than a few reporters,      commentators, and members of Congress have uncritically      embraced such claims and disseminated them as ``facts.''       For example, PPFA said in a press release that the      procedure is ``done only in cases when the woman's life is in      danger or in cases of extreme fetal abnormality.'' (Nov. 1,      1995) But (as PPFA well knows), this claim is inconsistent      with the writings and recorded statements of doctors who have      performed thousands of these procedures, or with documents      gathered by the House and Senate judiciary committees.       Dayton abortionist Dr. Martin Haskell, who wrote a paper      describing step-by-step how to perform the procedure (he's      done over 1,000), described it as ``a quick, surgical      outpatient method that can be performed on a scheduled basis      under local anesthesia.''       Dr. Haskell wrote that he ``routinely performs this      procedure on all patients 20 through 24 weeks'' (4\1/2\ to      5\1/2\ months) pregnant [emphasis added], except on women who      are more than 20 pounds overweight, have twins, or have      certain other complicating factors.       In 1993, after NRLC's publicizing of Dr. Haskell's paper      engendered considerable controversy, the American Medical      News--the official newspaper of the AMA--conducted a tape-     recorded interview with Dr. Haskell concerning this specific      abortion method, in which he said:       And I'll be quite frank: most of my abortions are elective      in that 20-24 week range * * * In my particular case,      probably 20% [of this procedure] are for genetic reasons. And      the other 80% are purely elective.       In testimony in a lawsuit in 1995, Dr. Haskell testified      that women come to him for partial-birth abortions with ``a      variety of conditions. Some medical, some not so medical''      Among the ``medical'' examples he cited was ``agoraphobia''      (fear of open places).       Moreover, in testimony presented to the Senate Judiciary      Committee on November 17, 1995, ob/gyn Dr. Nancy Romer of      Dayton (the city in which Dr. Haskell operates one of his      abortion clinics) testified that three of her own patients      had gone to Haskell's clinic for abortions ``well beyond''      4\1/2\ months into pregnancy, and that ``none of these women      had any medical illness, and all three had normal fetuses.''       Brenda Pratt Shafer, a registered nurse who observed Dr.      Haskell use the procedure to abort three babies in 1993,      testified that one little boy had Down Syndrome, while the      other two babies were completely normal and their mothers      were healthy. [Nurse Shafer's testimony before the House      Judiciary subcommittee, with associated documentation, is      available on request to NRLC.]       Dr. James McMahon voluntarily submitted to the House      Judiciary Constitution subcommittee a breakdown of a self-     selected sample of 175 partial-birth abortions that he      performed for what he called ``maternal indications.'' Of      these,the largest single category of ``maternal      indication''--39 cases, or 22% of the total sample--were for      ``depression.'' (Other ``maternal indications'' included      ``spousal drug exposure'' and ``substance abuse.'') Dr.      McMahon's self-selected sample of ``fetal indications'' cases      showed he had performed nine of these procedures for ``cleft      plate.'' Even though this data is cited in the official      report of the committee, when NARAL President Kate Michelman      was asked at a November 7, 1995 press conference about      ``arguments . . . that these procedures . . . are given      for depression or cleft palate,'' Ms. Michelman responded,      ``That is . . . not only a myth, it's a lie.''       Dr. McMahon also wrote: After 26 weeks [six months], those      pregnancies that are not flawed are still nonelective. They      are interrupted because of maternal risk, rape, incest,      psychiatric or pediatric indications. [Emphasis added.]      [``Pediatric indications'' was Dr. McMahon's terminology for      young teenagers.]       Dr. Pamela E. Smith, director of Medical Education,      Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mt. Sinai Hospital,      Chicago, gave the Senate Judiciary Committee her analysis of      Dr. McMahon's sample of 175 cases in which he said he had      used the procedure because of maternal health indications. Of      this sample, 39 cases (22%) were for maternal ``depression,''      while another 16% were ``for conditions consistent with the      birth of a normal child (e.g., sickle cell trait, prolapsed      uterus, small pelvis),'' Dr. Smith noted. She added that in      one-third of the cases, the conditions listed as ``maternal      indications'' by Dr. McMahon really indicated that the      procedure itself would be seriously risky.       Reporter Karen Tumulty wrote an article about late-term      abortions, based in large part on extensive interviews with      Dr. McMahon and on direct observation of his practice, which      appeared in the Los Angeles Times Magazine (January 7, 1990).      She concluded: If there is any other single factor that      inflates the number of late abortions, it is youth. Often,      teen-agers do not recognize the first signs of pregnancy.      Just as frequently, they put off telling anyone as long as      they can.       Dr. George Tiller of Wichita, Kansas, specializes in late-     term abortions, including third-trimester abortions. Dr.      Tiller's spokeswoman, Peggy Jarman, told the Kansas City      Star: About three-fourths of Tiller's late-term patients,      Jarman said, are teenagers who have denied to themselves or      their families they were pregnant until it was too late to      hide it.       In 1993, the then-executive director of the National      Abortion Federation (NAF) distributed an internal memorandum      to the members of that organization which acknowledged that      such abortions are performed for ``many reasons'': There are      many reasons why women have late abortions: life      endangerment, fetal indications, lack of money or health      insurance, social-psychological crises, lack of knowledge      about human reproduction, etc.''       Likewise, a June 12, 1995, letter from NAF to members of      the House of Representatives noted that late abortions are      sought by, among others, ``very young teenagers . . . who      have not recognized the signs of their pregnancies until too      late,'' and by ``women in poverty, who have tried desperately      to act responsibly and to end an unplanned pregnancy in the      early stages, only to face insurmountable financial      barriers.''       It is true, of course, that some partial-birth abortions      involve babies who have grave disorders that will result in      death soon after birth. But these unfortunate members of the      human family deserve compassion and the best comfort-care      that medical science can offer--not a scissors in the back of      the head. In some such situations there are good medical      reasons to deliver such a child early, after which natural      death will follow quickly. is a partial-birth abortion ever the only way to preserve a mother's                             physical health?       Dr. Pamela E. Smith, Director of Medical Education,      Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mt. Sinai Hospital,      Chicago, testified, ``There are absolutely no obstetrical      situations encountered in this country which require a      partially delivered human fetus to be destroyed to preserve      the life or health of the mother.''       Dr. Harlan R. Giles, a professor of ``high-risk''      obstetrics and perinatology at the Medical College of      Pennsylvania, performs abortions by a variety of procedures      up until ``viability.'' In sworn testimony in the U.S.      Federal District Court for the Southern District of Ohio      (Nov. 13, 1995), Prof. Giles said:       After 23 weeks I do not think there are any maternal      conditions that I'm aware of that mandate ending the      pregnancy that also require that the fetus be dead or that      the fetal life be terminated. In my experience for 20 years,      one can deliver these fetuses either vaginally, or by      Caesarean section for that matter, depending on the choice of      the parents with informed consent . . . But there's no reason      these fetuses cannot be delivered intact vaginally after a      miniature labor, if you will, and be at least assessed at      birth and given the benefit of the doubt. [transcript, page      240]       Opponents of H.R. 1833 have publicized the cases of several      women whose babies suffered from severe hydrocephalus      (enlargement of the head). But an eminent authority on such      matters, Dr. Watson A. Bowes, Jr., professor of ob/gyn      (maternal and fetal medicine) at the University of North      Carolina, who is co-editor of the Obstetrical and      Gynecological Survey, wrote to Congressman Canady:       Critics of your bill who say that this legislation will      prevent doctors from performing certain procedures which are      standard of care, such as cephalocentesis (removal of fluid      from the enlarged head of a fetus with the most severe form      of hydrocephalus) are mistaken. In such a procedure a needle      is inserted with ultrasound guidance through the mother's      abdomen into the uterus and then into the enlarged ventricle      of the brain (the space containing cerebrospinal fluid).      Fluid is then withdrawn which results in reduction of the      size in the head so that delivery can occur. This procedure      is not intended to kill the fetus, and, in fact, is usually      associated with the birth of a live infant.     is the baby alive when she is pulled feet-first from the womb?       Yes, in most cases the baby is alive until the end of the      procedure. American Medical News reported in 1993, after      conducting interviews with Drs. Haskell and McMahon, that the      doctors ``told AM News that the majority of fetuses aborted      this way are alive until the end of the procedure.'' On July      11, 1995, American Medical News submitted the transcript of      the tape-recorded interview with Haskell to the House      Judiciary Committee. The transcript contains the following      exchange:       American Medical News: Let's talk first about whether or      not the fetus is dead beforehand.       Dr. Haskell: No it's not. No, it's really not. A percentage      are for various numbers of reasons. Some just because of the      stress--intrauterine stress during, you know, the two days      that the cervix is being dilated [to permit extraction of the      fetus]. Sometimes the membranes rupture and it takes a very      small superficial infection to kill a fetus in utero when the      membranes are broken. And so in my case, I would think      probably about a third of those are definitely are [sic] dead      before I actually start to remove the fetus. And probably the      other two-thirds are not.       In an interview quoted in the Dec. 10, 1989 Dayton News,      Dr. Haskell again conveyed that the scissors thrust is      usually the lethal act: ``When I do the instrumentation on      the skull . . . it destroys the brain tissue sufficiently so      that even if it (the Fetus) falls out at that point, it's      definitely not alive,'' Dr. Haskell said. Does anesthesia given to the mother kill the baby? Does the baby feel                        pain during the procedure?       In Dr. Haskell's 1992 instructional paper, he lists among      the ``advantages'' of the procedure that ``it is a quick,      surgical outpatient method that can be performed on a      scheduled basis under local anesthesia.'' [emphasis added]      According to Prof. David H. Chestnut, editor of Obstetric      Anesthesia: Principles and Practice, ``Rational use of local      anesthetic drugs does not affect the fetus.'' (Testimony to      House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee, March 21, 1996).       Dr. James McMahon utilized general anesthesia, at least in      some cases, but anesthesiologists say that these drugs do not      harm the fetus/baby unless given in amounts that would kill      the mother or place her in grave danger. (See below.)       Nevertheless, many critics of the bill have insisted that      the unborn babies are killed by anesthesia given to the      mother, prior to being ``extracted'' from the womb. For      example, syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman wrote in November      that, based on her review of statements by supporters of the      bill, ``You wouldn't even know that anesthesia ends the life      of such a fetus before it comes down the birth canal.''       The Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) has      been among the most persistent purveyors of this mythology.      Another leading proponent of the ``anesthesia myth'' has been      Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and      Reproductive Rights Act League (NARAL). For example, in an      interview on ``Newsmakers,'' KMOX-AM in St. Louis on Nov. 2,      1995, Ms. Michelman explained that she thinks it is wrong to      call the procedure a ``partial birth'' because (she claimed)      the baby is already dead. Kate Michelman's verbatim statement      follows:       The other side grossly distorted the procedure. There is no      such thing as a `partial birth'. That's, that's a term made      up by people like these anti-choice folks that you had on the      radio. The fetus-- I mean, it is a termination of the fetal      life, there's no question about that. And the fetus, is,      before, the procedure begins, the anesthesia that they give      the woman already causes the demise of the fetus. That is, it      is not true that they're born partially. That is a gross      distortion, and it's really a disservice to the public to say      this.       However, the claim that anesthesia can kill an unborn fetus      has been emphatically refuted in congressional testimony by      the heads of the leading professional societies of      anesthesiologists. These exports have criticized both pro-     abortion leaders and certain journalists and commentators,      for disseminating these bogus claims, while failing to      publicize the authoritative statements of experts that these      claims are entirely bogus.       In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on      November 17, 1995, Dr. Norig Ellison, president of the      34,000-member American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA),      said that such claims have ``absolutely no basis in      scientific fact.'' On behalf of the ASA, Dr. Ellison      testified that regional anesthesia (used in many partial-     birth abortions and most normal deliveries) has virtually no      effect on the fetus. General anesthesia has some sedating      effect on the fetus, but much less than on the mother; even      pain relief for the fetus is doubtful, and certainly      anesthesia would not kill the baby, Dr. Ellison testified.      (In March 1996, Dr. Ellison said that his testimony had been      reported in the medical press and that not one      anesthesiologist had contacted ASA to express any      disagreement.)       In testimony before the House Judiciary Constitution      Subcommittee on March 21, 1996, Dr. David J. Birnbach,      president-elect of the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and      Perinatology, testified, ``I have never witnessed a case of      fetal demise that could be attributed to an anesthetic. . . .      In order to cause fetal demise, it would be necessary to give      the mother dangerous and life-threatening doses of      anesthesia.''       Recently, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America      (PPFA) and NARAL have tried to ``explain'' that they were      really just referring to the practice of the late Dr. James      McMahon--who, they claimed, used massive doses of narcotic      anesthesia. But Dr. Birnbach said, ``Although there is no      evidence that this massive dose will cause fetal demise,      there is clear evidence that this excessive dose could cause      maternal death.''       Brenda Pratt Shafer, a registered nurse from Dayton, Ohio,      stood at Haskell's side while he performed three partial-     birth abortions in 1993. In testimony before the Senate      Judiciary Committee (Nov. 17), Shafer described in detail the      first of the three procedures--which involved, she said, a      baby boy at 26\1/2\ weeks (over 6 months). According to Mrs.      Shafer, the abortionist delivered the baby's body and the      arms--everything but the head. The doctor kept the baby's      head just inside the uterus. The baby's little fingers were      clasping and unclasping, and his feet were kicking. Then the      doctor stuck the scissors through the back of his head, and      the baby's arms jerked out in a flinch, a startle reaction,      like a baby does when he thinks that he might fall. The      doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction      tube into the opening and sucked the baby's brains out. Now      the baby was completely limp.       Since the baby is usually not dead before being removed      from the womb, does the baby experience pain? Yes, according      to experts such as Professor Robert White, Director of the      Division of Neurosurgery and Brain Research Laboratory at      Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, who testified before      the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee: ``The fetus      within this time frame of gestation, 20 weeks and beyond, is      fully capable of experiencing pain.'' After analyzing the      partial-birth procedure step-by-step for the subcommittee,      Prof. White concluded: ``Without question, all of this is a      dreadfully painful experience for any infant subjected to      such a surgical procedure.''       Similar testimony was presented to the subcommittee on      March 21, 1996, by Dr. Jean A. Wright, associate professor of      pediatrics and anesthesia at the Emory University School of      Medicine in Atlanta. Recent research shows that by the stage      of development that a fetus could be a ``candidate'' for a      partial-birth abortion (20 weeks), the fetus ``is more      sensitive to pain than a full-term infant would be if      subjected to the same procedures,'' Prof. Wright testified.      These fetuses have ``the anatomical and functional processes      responsible for the perception of pain,'' and have ``a much      higher density of Opioid (pain) receptors'' than older      humans, she said.  is there a more ``objective'' term for the procedure than ``partial-                           birth abortion''?       Congressman Charles Canady (R-FL), the author of H.R. 1833      and the chairman of the subcommittee that conducted hearings      on the bill, said on March 23, ``It it time for some in the      media to stop editing or denigrating the legal terminology      that has been adopted by the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate,      which is partial-birth abortion.''       (When Congress defined certain firefarms as ``assault      weapons,'' that terminology was readily accepted by most      journalists and editors--even though manufacturers of such      devices utilize other terms.)       Some opponents of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (H.R.      1833) insist that anyone writing about the bill should say      that it bans a procedure ``known medically as intact dilation      and evacuation.'' But when journalists comply with this      demand, they do so at the expense of accuracy. The bill      itself makes no reference whatever to ``intact dilation and      evacuation'' abortions. More importantly, the term ``intact      dilation and evacuation'' is not equivalent to the class of      procedures banned by the bill.       The bill would make it a criminal offense (except to save a      woman's life) to perform a ``partial-birth abortion,'' which      the bill would define--as a matter of law--as ``an abortion      in which the person performing the abortion partially      vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus      and completing the delivery.'' [emphasis added]       In contrast, the term ``intact dilation and evacuation''      was invented by the late Dr. James McMahon, and until      recently, was idiosyncratic to him. It appears in no standard      medical textbook or database, nor does it appear anywhere in      the standard textbook on abortion methods, Abortion Practice      by Dr. Warren Hern.       Because ``intact dilation and evacuation'' is not a      standard, clearly defined medical term, the House Judiciary      Constitution Subcommittee staff (which drafted the bill under      Congressman Canady's supervision) rejected it as useless for      purposes of defining a criminal offense. Indeed, it is worse      than useless--a criminal statute that relied on such a term      would be stricken by the federal courts as ``void for      vagueness.''       Although there is no clear definition of the term, we know      enough to say that it is inaccurate to equate ``intact      dilation and evacuation'' abortions with the procedures      banned by HR 1833, since in his writings Dr. McMahon clearly      used the term so broadly as to cover certain procedures which      would not be affected at all by HR 1833 (e.g., removal of      babies who are killed entirely in utero, and removal of      babies who have died entirely natural deaths in utero).      Indeed, some of the specific women highlighted by opponents      of HR 1833 had various types of ``intact D&E'' abortion      procedures that were not covered by HR 1833's definition of      ``partial-birth abortion.''       The term chosen by Congress is in no sense misleading. In      sworn testimony in an Ohio lawsuit on Nov. 8, 1995, Dr.      Martin Haskell--who has done over 1,000 partial-birth      abortions, and who authored the instructional paper that      touched off the controversy over the procedure--explained      that he first learned of the method when a colleague      described very briefly over the phone to me a technique that      I later learned came from Dr. McMahon where they internally      grab the fetus and rotate it and accomplish--be somewhat      equivalent to a breach type of delivery.       In short, it is a misguided notion of objectivity for the      any journalist to denigrate the term for a criminal offense      that has been adopted and explicitly defined by the U.S.      House and the U.S. Senate, in favor of a undefined term      recently manufactured by the very special-interest that would      be ``regulated'' by the legislation.       [In his 1992 instructional paper, Dr. Haskell referred to      the method as ``dilation and extraction'' or ``D&X''--noting      that he ``coined the term.'' The term ``dilation and      extraction'' does not appear in medical dictionaries or      databases.]    are the five line drawings of the procedure circulated by NRLC                    accurate, or are they misleading?       American Medical News (July 5, 1993) interviewed Dr. Martin      Haskell and reported: Dr. Haskell said the drawings were      accurate ``from a technical point of view.'' But he took      issue with the implication that the fetuses were ``aware and      resisting.''       Moreover, at a June 15, 1995, public hearing before the      House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Dr. J.      Courtland Robinson, a self-described ``abortionist'' who      testified on behalf of the National Abortion Federation, was      questioned about the drawings by Congressman Charles Canady      (R-Fl.). Mr. Canady directed Dr. Robinson's attention to the      drawings, which were displayed in poster size next to the      witness table, and asked Dr. Robinson if they were      ``technically correct.'' Dr. Robinson responded:       That is exactly probably what is occurring in the hands of      the two physicians involved. [Hearing record, page 89.]       Professor Watson Bowes of the University of North Carolina      at Chapel Hill, co-editor of the Obstetrical and      Gynecological Survey, wrote in a letter to Congressman      Canady:       Having read Dr. Haskell's paper, I can assure you that      these drawings accurately represent the procedure described      therein. . . . Firsthand renditions by a professional medical      illustrator, or photographs or a video recording of the      procedure would no doubt be more vivid but not necessarily      more instructive for a non-medical person who is trying to      understand how the procedure is performed.       On Nov. 1, 1995, Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder and her      allies actually tried to prevent Congressman Canady from      displaying the line drawings during the debate on HR 1833 on      the floor of the House of Representatives. But the House      voted by nearly a 4-to-1 margin (332 to 86) to permit the      drawings to be used.         does the bill contradict u.s. supreme court decisions?       The Supreme Court has never said that there is a      constitutional right to kill human beings who are mostly      born.       In its official report on HR 1833, the House Judiciary      Committee makes the very plausible argument that HR 1833      could be upheld by the Supreme Court without disturbing Roe.      In Roe, the Supreme Court said that ``the word `person,' as      used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the      unborn.'' Thus, under the Supreme Court's doctrine, a      human being becomes a legal ``person'' upon emerging from      the uterus.       But a partial-birth abortion does not involve an ``unborn      fetus.'' A partial-birth abortion, by the very definition in      the bill, kills a human being who is partly born. Indeed, a      partial-birth abortion kills a human being who is four-fifths      across the `line-of-personhood' established by the Supreme      Court.       Moreover, in Roe v. Wade itself, the Supreme Court took      note of a Texas law that made it a felony to kill a baby ``in      a state of being born and before actual birth,'' and the      Court did not disturb that law.       Thus, the Supreme Court could very well decide that the      killing of a mostly born baby, even if done by a physician,      is not protected by Roe v. Wade.       should congress ever ban specific ``surgical procedures''?       Some prominent congressional opponents of the bill to ban      partial-birth abortions, including Rep. Schroeder (D-Co.),      argue that Congress should not attempt to ban a specific      surgical procedure. But Rep. Schroeder is the prime sponsor      of HR 941, the ``Federal Prohibition of Female Genital      Mutilation Act.'' (The Senate companion bill is S. 1030.)      This bill generally would ban anyone (including a licensed      physician) from performing the procedure known medically as      ``infibulation,'' or ``female circumcision.'' (Some      physicians perform the procedure in response to requests from      immigrants from certain countries, based on the rationale      that those involved otherwise will probably obtain the      procedure from persons without medical training.) The bill      provides a penalty of up to five years in federal prison.      Supporters of this bill argue, persuasively, that subjecting      a little girl to infibulation is a form of child abuse. But      then, so too is subjecting a baby to the partial-birth      abortion procedure.
