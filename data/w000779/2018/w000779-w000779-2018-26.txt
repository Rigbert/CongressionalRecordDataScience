President, today I wish to recognize the sesquicentennial of Lincoln High School in Portland, OR.  One of the oldest and most celebrated public secondary schools west of the Mississippi River, Lincoln was established in 1869, a decade after Oregon's founding. Originally known as Portland High School, it was eventually renamed in honor of President Abraham Lincoln. Currently located in the Goose Hollow neighborhood of Southwest Portland, Lincoln High School has moved four times over the past 150 years and is currently planning a fifth campus to accommodate its growing student body.  Lincoln High School's college preparatory program has graduated generations of Oregon students. Over 60 faculty members oversee and implement a wealth of academic and extracurricular opportunities, including enhanced and advanced coursework in literature, the social sciences, foreign languages, mathematics, and physical and life sciences. Lincoln offers a celebrated international baccalaureate program, in addition to a full Spanish immersion program.  Outside the classroom, Lincoln's Constitution Team has won 23 State championships and six national titles. Its speech and debate team ranks among the top in the State, and its mock trial team competes nationally. The school's student newspaper ``The Cardinal Times'' is the oldest continuously published high school paper on the West Coast. Lincoln's magazine ``Beyond the Flock'' and its Spanish-language magazine ``Puno y Letro'' add to the school's rich and diverse literary tradition. Lincoln's student athletes have brought home 38 State championships in a variety of sports. Seventy-seven student-led clubs and unions serve the larger Portland community and demonstrate Lincoln's commitment to an inclusive, engaged, and diverse student body.  Lincoln students are dedicated to fostering an open and welcoming community for all and have committed to carrying those values forth into 2019, the school's 150th year. For 150 years, Lincoln High School has inspired generations of global thinkers who have bettered their communities in the Cardinal spirit of academic and civic engagement.  I rise to acknowledge the significant contribution of Lincoln High School to the State of Oregon and the Nation as a whole and to offer my congratulations to the students, faculty, and alumni on the occasion of its sesquicentennial.                          ____________________
