Levin of Michigan.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this limited fast-track trade debate.  Proponents of TPA are trying to lure votes for this Pacific deal by cynically adding $700 million to trade adjustment assistance to take care of millions more people who are going to lose their jobs as billions and billions more of our productive wealth is outsourced to other countries. What a fig leaf. It is too little for the damage about to be done.  The eyes of working families in communities across our country are focused on Congress today, hoping we will finally stand up and do what is right for America. This latest job outsourcing trade deal serves only the 1 percent, rewarding the few at the expense of the many. It is a great deal for Wall Street, and it is a great deal for transnational corporations. But for Main Street, a shrinking middle class, and millions more of our workers, it is another punch to the gut.
