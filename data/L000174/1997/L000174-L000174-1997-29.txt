President, I hope we can complete these foreign aid bills. I would also say to my friend from Mississippi, he mentioned whether we should use taxpayers' money for abortion in the foreign aid bill. There is a specific prohibition against any U.S. dollars being used for abortions abroad in the foreign aid bill.  In fact, as Senator Mark Hatfield, former chairman of the Appropriation Committee, and I pointed out on the floor earlier--he was very much a right-to-life, antiabortion Senator, consistent in that--pointed out that the family planning moneys that have gone in the foreign aid bill have dramatically decreased the number of abortions in those areas where they were used.  An example was Russia where abortion was used as a form of birth control, where we gave them family planning money and the number of abortions dropped dramatically.  So I hope that we will continue to do that and realize, while family planning is something available to most people in the United States, in a lot of other countries it is not available because of costs, because of techniques, because of training, for whatever reason. Unfortunately, in those countries ofttimes abortions are a means of family planning. So I hope that those who are against abortion would realize family planning money can help us prevent that.                          ____________________
