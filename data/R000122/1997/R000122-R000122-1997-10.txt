Again, I think it's probably not even that clear in terms of what they can do because, essentially, as I read the restrictive language directly related to trade, it could be read to simply say that we have a product, for example, that we are sending in with a label on it, and if the country objects to it or wants more labeling, then we can say, well, that is impermissible. But as far as whether they have pretreatment of their waste, as far as whether the respirators in their factories, as far as whether they have environmental standards--air quality and water quality--that seems to be totally off the table. But that is what impacts on the quality of the workplace. Also, it is an inducement for capital to go from our country into these countries because, essentially, they are avoiding costs.  The Senator probably was contacted, like I was, by individuals concerned about the proposed ambient air quality regulations in the United States. Some representatives of major companies have bluntly told me, ``If these pass, we are going to Mexico. They don't have these ambient air quality standards, and we will avoid millions of dollars in costs. We will just move out.''  Now, that might simply be a bluffing tactic, a negotiating ploy to try to stop these regulations. But at some point, if we continue to try to have a clean and healthy and safe environment, these costs add up and companies can avoid them by going elsewhere.
