Chairman, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. Barrett]. Through his leadership we have crafted an outstanding piece of legislation that deals with the conservation reserve program. He has been working very diligently in regard to trade and other matters, in regard to his subcommittee chairmanship.
