President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters in support of Jerome Holmes be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 21, 2006.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: I am writing to encourage the      confirmation of the nomination of Jerome A. Holmes to be a      United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit Court of      Appeals.       As a U.S. District Judge for over 30 years I have known and      worked with many federal law clerks, lawyers, district and      circuit judges. I have known first hand of their      intelligence, skills, judgment, character, temperament and      sense of fairness. In every single one of these criteria Mr.      Holmes has uniquely excelled. His scholarship and other      credentials are well documented so permit me to emphasize one      critically important additional one. Mr. Holmes is dedicated      completely to the rule of law, the proper role of the      judiciary and to applying and interpreting the law without      regard to personal views on given issues. I have seen this      commitment guide his every professional task, in civil and      criminal cases, as a law clerk, prosecutor and civil      practitioner. The Senators and the people of the country can      be assured that, if confirmed, Jerome Holmes will be a      circuit judge of compassion, fairness and a total commitment      to the rule of law. Having personally observed these      qualities throughout the years, I could not give a higher      recommendation.           Respectfully,     Ralph G. Thompson.                                  ____                                                    July 24, 2006.     Senator Jim Inhofe,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: I write in support of the nomination      of Jerome Holmes to be a Judge on the Court of Appeals for      the Tenth Circuit. In his many years of public service--     including over a decade with the Department of Justice--     Jerome has earned a reputation for excellence that few can      equal. He served as the Deputy Criminal Chief and the lead      prosecutor on some of the most important and challenging      investigations and cases in this Office. He was recognized by      his fellow career prosecutors for his legal talents,      fairness, and fine character.       As Assistant United States Attorneys together, I had the      opportunity to work closely with Jerome on counterterrorism,      public corruption, and civil rights investigations and cases.      I observed first-hand his tremendous dedication, legal      acumen, judgment, ethics, professionalism, and commitment to      equal justice under the law.       I am confident that, as a Judge on the Court of Appeals, he      will continue to serve our Nation with great distinction.       If I can provide you any further information, please do not      hesitate to contact me.           Sincerely yours,     John C. Richter.                                  ____                                              Crowe & Dunlevy,                                 Oklahoma City, OK, June 14, 2006.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: I am writing in support of the      nomination of Jerome A. Holmes, Esq. to the United States      Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. I have know Jerome by      reputation since 1991 when I was working for the Honorable      Glenn English (D-OK) and personally since 1993 when I moved      back to Oklahoma to begin my legal career.       Jerome is a known leader in a multitude of community      activities. He currently serves as a Commissioner on the      American Bar Association's Commission on Homelessness and      Poverty where his local work has translated into national      recognition. He also serves as Chairman of the Board for our      local City Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter located in      Oklahoma City. As a member of the board myself, I can attest      to Jerome's devotion to assisting those who are less      fortunate and his incredible leadership style culminating in      proven results for the homeless of Oklahoma.       Hard work and dedication to his profession are just some of      Jerome's hallmarks through which he has earned the respect of      his colleagues in the legal profession. He always displays a      judicious demeanor and temperament that will serve him and      his country well on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The      first person to turn the lights on and the last to turn the      lights off at our office, Jerome's unwavering commitment to      his chosen profession is evident. I highly recommend Jerome      Holmes for confirmation--both personally and professionally--     one cannot find a better nominee.           Very truly yours,                                                  William H. Hoch,     For the Firm.                                  ____                                                  Crowe & Dunlevy,                              Attorneys and Counselors at Law,                                 Oklahoma City, OK, June 14, 2006.     Re Jerome Holmes     Senator James M. Inhofe,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: I write to support the nomination of Jerome      Holmes to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the      Tenth Circuit. Having served as United States Attorney for      the years 2001--2005, I am well acquainted with the very high      standards expected in the federal judicial system, and I know      that Jerome would be an outstanding addition to the bench.       I have known Jerome for many years in the course of us both      practicing law in Oklahoma City. I worked closely with Jerome      when we were both Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the early 1990s      and observed first hand Jerome's work ethic, professional      excellence, and intelligence.       Later when I returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office in      2001, I had the opportunity to work very closely with Jerome      again. One of Jerome's strengths is his ability to take on      and be successful with the hardest and most complex tasks.      For example, he served as Anti-Terrorist Coordinator for the      Western District of Oklahoma. He made a success of that      position because of his ability to analyze the complex issues      involved, his ability to work well with many different      government agencies, and his outstanding judgment. He also      proved himself to be an outstanding administrator in his      service as Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division.       One of the most significant cases Jerome prosecuted was a      public corruption case involving the Oklahoma Department of      Health. In that case, a nursing home owner had been bribing      the Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Health. Jerome      tried the case, won convictions, and won the appeals. The      case was significant not only because it was a complex and      difficult public corruption case, but because it led to      material reform at the Department of Health and within the      nursing home industry in Oklahoma. The case is an example of      the dedication Jerome brings to his work as a public servant.       Jerome's character is beyond reproach. He approaches every      task with the highest level of professional integrity and      ethics. He has the right temperament for service on the bench      as well. He can be counted on to be courteous, fair, and      reasonable in any endeavor.       Jerome is well liked and well respected within the local      bar. His ability to get along with people and inspire trust      in others is illustrated in his election as Vice President of      the Bar Association for the State of Oklahoma and his      selection to serve on prestigious community boards such as      the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, the Oklahoma      Academy for State Goals, and the Oklahoma City National      Memorial Foundation.       Jerome would be an outstanding court of appeals judge. He      possesses the judgement, intelligence, professional      excellence, and integrity to be a truly great judge.           Sincerely yours,     Robert G. McCampbell.                                  ____                                  Oklahoma City, OK, July 6, 2006.     Re Nomination of Jerome A. Holmes     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,     U.S. Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Kennedy: This letter is written to you in your      capacity as a member of the Senate Committee on the      Judiciary, and in support of the pending nomination of Jerome      A. Holmes to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Under      separate cover I have also written to Senator Specter with a      copy to Senator Leahy. Rather than merely sending a copy of      the other letter to you, I wanted to take time to write to      you personally.       For the past 30 years I have had the pleasure of serving as      a member of the legal profession, as an active trial lawyer      on both the State and Federal level. For 22 of those years, I      have also served as the chief municipal judge for the City of      The Village, a community located in the northwest quadrant of      the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. My practice is not on      the appellate level, although, of necessity, I carefully      follow the decisions that emanate from the appellate courts.       Since my primary practice involves criminal defense, I      have, on numerous occasions, had reason to meet with, oppose      and observe Attorney Holmes. There has never been a time when      I felt the nominee was anything less than candid,      knowledgeable, professional and ethical. He is a worthy      opponent, an excellent trial attorney, and has the respect of      my fellow defense counsel.       The appellate courts of our country need--and deserve--to      have jurists of Attorney Holmes' high caliber. I have      absolutely no doubt that the nominee would devote his      considerable intellect to ensuring that the Constitution is      properly protected and that cases before him are decided      based on the law. If he is elevated to the Tenth Circuit,      there will undoubtedly be times when I disagree with his      opinion, as is always the case. I can, however, assure you      that I firmly believe he will never insert personal beliefs      or bias into his judicial thoughts.       Please permit me a point of personal privilege as part of      this letter.       In 1961 I reported to Marine Barracks, 8th & Eye Streets,      as a PFC just out of Parris Island. For the next two years I      served as a member of Ceremonial Guard Company.       The highlight of my tour at 8th & Eye was on July 12, 1962      when, as a member of the Silent Drill Team, I had the honor      of drilling for President Kennedy, the reviewing officer that      evening for the Sunset Parade. I saved the program and sent      it to the President. An autographed copy of the program and      the transmittal letter from Ms. Lincoln occupy a position of      honor on my office wall.       Senator, I am a Democrat, with deep ties to the party. My      father was a Central Committeeman in Ohio, and my grandmother      was the party's poll watcher in our small town. I imagine      Attorney Holmes is a Republican or he would not have been      nominated. His party affiliation does not bother me in the      least. He is a lawyer first and foremost and will, I believe,      continue to bring honor to our profession and Constitutional      protection to our clients.       As I told Senator Specter, should an opportunity present      itself, I would be honored to personally appear before the      Committee to speak on behalf of Jerome Holmes.           Respectfully yours,     Robert A. Manchester, III.                                  ____                                         Oklahoma City University,                                                School of Law,                                 Oklahoma City, OK, July 21, 2006.     Re Confirmation of Jerome Holmes     Senator James Inhofe,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: I write in support of the confirmation      of Jerome Holmes to serve as a Judge of the United States      Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.       I have worked closely with Mr. Holmes over a period of      years on an important committee of the Oklahoma Bar      Association tasked with revising the rules of professional      conduct for lawyers. As co-chair of this committee, I      observed him closely. He was always extremely well-prepared,      thoughtful, cooperative, and considerate. In addition, as a      supervisor of student externs from my law school, he was      always conscientious and responsible.       While Mr. Holmes has taken positions on issues with which I      disagree, I have no reservations regarding the criteria by      which he should be judged in this confirmation: professional      competence, integrity, and judicial temperament.       Thus, I hope the Senate will confirm Jerome Holmes for this      position.           Sincerely yours,                                              Lawrence K. Hellman,     Dean and Professor of Law.                                  ____                                              Crowe & Dunlevy,                                 Oklahoma City, OK, July 21, 2006.     Re confirmation of Jerome Holmes.       Dear Senator Inhofe: I wish to voice my support for the      confirmation of Jerome Holmes to serve as a Judge of the      United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.       I have known Jerome Holmes for several years, first when he      was an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and most recently when he      associated with my firm, Crowe & Dunlevy of Oklahoma City. I      know him to be very intelligent, very diligent and to possess      a high degree of competence on the functioning of the federal      judicial system. His background in the law will serve him      well in this position. He is dedicated to serving the justice      system and the legal profession.       Although I am a registered Democrat, I believe Jerome      Holmes is entitled to non-partisan support because he will be      an outstanding jurist who will follow the law, not personal      views or beliefs.       I hope the Senate will confirm Jerome Holmes for this very      important judicial post.           Sincerely,                                                  William G. Paul,     Past-President, American Bar Association.                                  ____     Senator James Inhofe     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Re Nomination of Jerome Holmes.       Dear Jim: I write in support of the nomination of Jerome      Holmes to become a Judge of the United States Court of      Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.       Jerome is a very bright, capable, and conscientious person.      I have known him for many years, and I know that he became a      very able prosecutor in the years he served as an Assistant      United States Attorney for the United States Western District      of Oklahoma. In that position, he demonstrated common sense      and fairness in applying the law.       When Robert Macy retired as the District Attorney for      Oklahoma County, I served, at the appointment of then      Governor Frank Keating, on the committee to select a      successor. Jerome Holmes was one of the finalists, and I was      assigned the task of doing a workup on his skills, abilities,      and suitability for the job. In that capacity, I interviewed      several federal judges and several agents of the F.B.I. who      had observed and worked with Jerome in his years in the U.S.      Attorney's Office. All were high in their praise for Jerome,      his dedication, and work ethic.       He has been most helpful in establishing minority      scholarships here at the College of Law.       He is a delightful person, and I commend him to you for      this judgeship enthusiastically and without reservation.                                                  Andrew M. Coats,     Dean and Professor, College of Law.                                  ____                                              County of San Diego,                            Department of the Public Defender,                                     San Diego, CA, June 15, 2006.     Re Jerome A. Holmes     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Specter: I am honored to support the      nomination of Jerome A. Holmes to the Tenth Circuit Court of      Appeals. I am a deputy public defender, Chair of the ABA      Commission on Homelessness and Poverty and co-founder of the      Homeless Court Program.       Jerome is a member of the ABA Commission on Homelessness      and Poverty. Jerome's contributions to the Commission's      discussions on homeless and poverty issues are always well      reasoned and articulate. He is inquisitive and insightful.      Commission members rely on his input and value his      contributions. I know Jerome to be thoughtful and      deliberative in his approach to a myriad of issues that come      before the Commission. He is respectful of diverging      viewpoints that     come with review of a wide range of issues such as housing,      education and people involved with the criminal justice      system, to name but a few.       I am confident Jerome will uphold the highest level of      judicial decorum and professional integrity as a member of      the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. I recommend Jerome A.      Holmes for appointment to this important judicial position.       If you have any questions, please call me at (619) 338-     4708.           Sincerely,                                                    Steven Binder,     Deputy Pubic Defender.                                  ____                                          City Rescue Mission,                                 Oklahoma City, OK, June 21, 2006.     Re Nomination of Jerome A. Holmes, Esq. to the United States          Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: I am writing in support of the      nomination of Jerome A. Holmes, Esq., to the United States      Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. I have known Jerome      since 2001 when Jerome and I were selected for the class of      Oklahoma City Leadership. In 2003, Jerome was asked to serve      as a director on the board of City Rescue Mission, a local      homeless shelter and rehabilitation center located in      Oklahoma City.       Jerome is a recognized leader in many levels of community      service. Locally, he currently serves as Chairman of the      Board for City Rescue Mission. His leadership has greatly      contributed to City Rescue Mission's national recognition as      a model rescue mission for the homeless and poor. Nationally,      he currently serves as a Commissioner on the American Bar      Association's Commission on Homelessness and Poverty where      his work has received national recognition. I can personally      attest to Jerome's leadership ability seasoned with character      and integrity.       Jerome is passionately dedicated to his profession as well      as his volunteer leadership roles. He has gained the      respected of his colleagues in the legal profession as well      as those in the human services realm. I have witnessed Jerome      in a variety of leadership situations and have always been      greatly impressed with his demeanor, temperament, and      thoroughness. Jerome is the first person I call when I need a      fair unbiased carefully considered point of view--he leaves      no stone unturned. I highly recommend Jerome Holmes for      confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals for the      Tenth Circuit--he will serve our country well.           Respectfully,                                             Rev. Glenn Granfield,     President/CEO.                                  ____                                             Oklahoma City, OK                                                    July 24, 2006.     Hon. James Inhofe,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: This letter is written to support the      nomination of Jerome Holmes to the 10th Circuit Court of      Appeals. I am an African American attorney and active member      of the community as well as an adjunct teacher at Douglass      High School and I hope that Jerome is confirmed by the U.S.      Senate. I have known Jerome for almost 15 years and I am very      proud to call him a friend. It was that friendship I relied      upon when I asked that he serve as a volunteer coach for the      Frederick Douglass High School Mock Trial team which has a      predominantly African American student population.       Jerome was very instrumental in helping the Frederick      Douglass team in the first year of competition advance in the      competition. It was a result of his personal and professional      dedication to the students that he was successful in helping      inspire these young African American students both male and      female to excel in this academic competition. I know Jerome      stated that he was greatly enriched by the young men and      women that competed on his team.       I strongly believe that Jerome Holmes has the integrity,      personal track record and character to represent the 10th      Circuit in a successful manner. Jerome Holmes is a good      person who has always reflected his strong belief in the      American dream. I personally witnessed as he was able to      effectively, passionately and successfully share with the      Douglass students that the dreams they hold can be realized      in the same manner. I am confident that Jerome Holmes if      given the opportunity to serve will uphold the Constitution      first and foremost and serve in such a manner that I along      with the mock trial students at Douglass will celebrate this      achievement.       If I can provide additional information please don't      hesitate to contact me.                                          L.
