Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Education and Labor Committee and the Majority Leader and his staff for their help in bringing this bill to the floor.  Today I rise to honor and celebrate the 20th anniversary of the National Black Arts Festival. This wonderful festival is taking place right now in my district--the 5th Congressional District of Georgia.  Each year, Atlanta welcomes thousands of visitors, artists, and performers who come from across the country and all over the World to take part in the National Black Arts Festival.  The two week festival is an incredible showcase of the arts and cultures of the African Diaspora.  The National Black Arts Festival has become a leader in arts-education in Atlanta, and across the country organizing special art events for students, including the African American History Quiz Bowl, professional development courses for teachers, and international trips to experience foreign art first hand.  The year-long education programs of the National Black Arts Festival help open the eyes of our young people to sculpture, and painting, to music and writing. It opens windows to the world.  We must reach more students, and more teachers, from around the country and around the world.  I am proud of what the National Black Arts Festival has accomplished over the last 20 years. The sky is the limit for this wonderful organization, led by its talented Executive Producer Stephanie Hughley.  I ask my colleagues to join me today to celebrate the National Black Arts Festival, and the rich artistic history and diversity of the African Diaspora throughout the world.  I am so proud to have the National Black Arts Festival in my district and I look forward to its continued success.  I yield back the balance of my time.
