President, I come to the floor today to speak in support of the Drug Quality and Security Act, H.R. 3204. Getting this bill to where it is today--and I thank the leader for just making that possible, along with our minority leader--has been a long and sometimes very difficult road, one on which I have been working for over a decade--yes, 10 years.  This is an issue that hit far too close to home in Kansas. Several years ago, a pharmacist in Kansas City, Robert Courtney, was found to be diluting cancer drugs for his patients. Unfortunately, over 4,000 patients were affected before authorities could stop him. Senator Kit Bond at that time and myself worked together to hold the first Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on pharmacy compounding.  Since that time I have continued my interest in the compounding-related issues. Unfortunately, last September, over a year ago, the tragic meningitis outbreak began. This outbreak was the result of contaminated compounded medications produced by the New England Compounding Center.  Of the 751 people who became ill, 64 people lost their lives. Many of those who became ill are still suffering and have experienced painful relapses in their condition. Unfortunately, that is not the only occurrence in the last 10 years. Without proper safeguards and clear authority, I fear that these tragedies would only continue.  We acknowledged then that we had to buckle down and really get something done. Since that time, I have been working with my colleagues to draft the pending legislation before this body, the Drug Quality and Security Act, with the desire to protect patients and improve regulation of the pharmacy compounding industry.  I think that we have finally achieved what we all intended from the beginning, which is a bipartisan, bicameral product that is supported by a majority of the stakeholder groups and a variety of those groups. This legislation has the support of the pharmacists led by the National Community Pharmacists Association and the American Pharmacists Association. It has the support of the patient advocacy groups such as the Cancer Leadership Council and of industry groups such as the Pharmaceutical Distribution Security Alliance. In fact, this is quite a long list. I will not take the Senate's time to go over that list. But I would ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record at this point in its entirety.
