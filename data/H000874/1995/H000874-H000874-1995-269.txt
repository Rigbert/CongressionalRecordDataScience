Chairman, reserving the right to object, obviously I am not going to object, I do want to thank the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman]. The gentleman from New York is one of the real gentlemen of this House irrespective of party. He is my close friend, and he and I have worked closely together for over a decade on issues of concern to human rights and international peace and justice. I want to thank the gentleman for his consideration during the course of this debate. It is very much appreciated.
