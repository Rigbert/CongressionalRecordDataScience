Speaker, welcome to the Great River Boat Gamble of 2001. Today our Republican friends are urging the American people to take a luxurious vacation into the tax cut casino. But let us remember, we have not even written our budget yet and do not have any idea whether or not we can afford it.  Everyone agrees that we ought to have a tax cut, and in 1997 I voted for that bill to which the gentleman referred. We need tax relief. It is clear from this fiscally irresponsible bill, however, that the GOP has not learned a thing from the mistakes of the past.  Twenty years ago, President Reagan assured America we could have it all, a huge tax cut, a major defense buildup, and a balanced Federal budget, which he guaranteed us in August of 1981 when he signed the tax cut. He said it would be balanced by October 1, 1983. We had about a $100 billion deficit that year alone.  George Bush, our current President's father, said that was voodoo economics. He was right. It is the taxpayers' money; and, my friends, the debt is also the taxpayers. Let us be responsible. Let us vote for the Democratic alternative. Let us make sense for America.
