I hope all of us will support this bill.  Another constituent of mine who works at Pax River said this: ``Please continue to work toward a solution that ends the furloughs for all Federal employees affected by the shutdown, not just a select few,'' as we're doing.  Mr. Speaker, we must reopen our government, and we could do so today, this hour. But until the majority allows a vote on the bill to reopen the government, let us at least provide the dedicated, patriotic Federal employees who want nothing more than to go back to work with the peace of mind that they will still be paid for their service.  I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran). Mr. Moran, like the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), has been an extraordinary leader on behalf of Federal employees, as well as Congressmen Gerald Connolly and Steve Lynch who sit here and others on the Republican side who have been aligned on that effort as well. Surely, surely we, the board of directors of the greatest enterprise on Earth, can take care of our employees and give them the confidence that they deserve.  I thank the gentleman from Maryland for the additional time.
