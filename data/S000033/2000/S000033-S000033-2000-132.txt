 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see the government do regarding these concerns.  I submit these statements into the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                        Prescription Drug Costs       KAYLA GILDERSLEEVE: To start off, good afternoon,      Congressman Sanders. We sincerely thank you for providing      some time for young people to be able to voice their opinions      and concerns for our state and our country. And today we have      come to you to encourage you to continue the battle with      pharmaceutical companies for our senior citizens.       ANGELA DEBLASIO: In the Year 2000 the United States of      America as well as our fine State of Vermont have a problem,      the soaring cost of prescription drugs. There are millions of      Americans, an estimated 13 million elderly Americans who need      drugs; they cannot afford them because they do not have      prescription drug coverage. This just does not affect poor      people. Many middle class seniors without additional private      insurance struggle to pay for what they need. Those who      cannot afford the prescription drugs pay for their drugs by      taking their limited amount of money out of their food budget      or not adequately heating their homes in the winter season;      thus their quality of life deteriorates. The result is that      some do without their prescribed medications, take half a      dose or in extreme cases use their partner's medication,      assuming they are one in the same, and so they suffer, die,      or travel to the emergency room with higher cost to the      health care and Medicare systems.       TESS GROSSI: Congressman Sanders, you have stated in a May      3rd press release that, and we quote, ``The industry is      continuing to fleece Americans while working to kill major      prescription drug legislation in Congress.'' As the Fortune      500 number shows us, pharmaceutical companies took in more      profit than the top auto, oil and airline companies. This is      approximately an 18.9 percent     profit, the highest margin of any industry in the nation.      These pharmaceutical companies are raking in more profit, and      the elderly and the sick all over can't afford the care and      the help they desperately need.       KAYLA GILDERSLEEVE: Of course these companies make claims      that their high profit margins are necessary to support      research and development.       These development costs do not even begin to explain the      rising prices of existing drugs which are projected from the      price competition by patent. However, only 20 to 30 cents of      each dollar is spent in actual; research and development and      less; between 5 to 25 cents is spent on actual production of      the drug. The remaining 40 to 70 cents is spent in marketing,      selling and administration.       Many industry critics call the R & D warning a scare      tactic, noting a huge percent return on revenues for the      previous year. The reality is that they are earning a lot      more than they spend on research and development. In      addition, drug companies spend approximately $30 million on      ad campaigns to combat any attempts to regulate drug pricing.      They spend even more on state and federal lobbying efforts.       TESS GROSSI: Congressman Sanders, we have an industry that      makes an exorbitant profit off of sickness, misery and      illness of people, and that is disgusting. Drug companies      come close to getting $4 billion every year in tax breaks and      still Americans pay more and more for these drugs than      citizens from other countries. There should be a way that      consumers can afford the prescription drugs and at the same      time a way for drug companies to make a modest profit and      continue research and development. Senior citizens need fair,      modest drug prices and it is in America's best interest to do      so.       ANGELA DEBLASIO: Therefore, we urge you to continue your      work with the International Prescription Drug Parity Act      which allows pharmacists, wholesalers and distributors to re-     import prescription drugs from other countries as long as      those drugs meet strict FDA standards. We also encourage you      to continue to take bus trips to Canada to help our elderly      fill or refill their prescriptions. It is one of those random      act advantages in living in a border state that not every      American has access to which is why continuing to push for      prescription drug legislation is necessary and vital to our      economy and the lives of our country's senior citizens. We      must fulfill our responsibility to protect elderly Americans      and to do this we must provide affordable prescription      medication.       KAYLA GILDERSLEEVE: Thank you for your time.                                  ____                                   Need For Alternative Activities To Keep Kids From Alcohol, Drugs and                                 Tobacco       APRIL NILES: I am April and I am the PR outreach worker for      Youth services and I work with Kids Against Tobacco group      which is these guys, and we are basically here to talk about      alternatives to doing drugs and alcohol and just trying to      think up some activities to keep teens from doing drugs. And      as it is now we have one activity night a week down at the      Living Room where I work, and we just basically play pool and      watch movies and we cook a dinner every Thursday but we would      like to have more activities to do. And that is about it.       BLAKE KINCAID: I am Blake and we just recently held a dance      in our group and it was Kids Against Tobacco and we had facts      on the walls for students to read, and we had speakers and we      held a raffle and Craig will tell you about the speakers.       CRAIG STEVENS: We had two speakers at the dance, one of      them was Wes who lost his voice box and used a machine to      project his voice. Another one we had was Lola, and she lost      her father to emphysema or lung cancer.       NATE POWERS: Some of the activities that we are trying to      do, we are trying to have the towns build board parks or      skate board parks. Also we have a very strange question. We      have asked local officials why they are worried about giving      two-dollar parking tickets instead of smoking underage      tickets for $1.50 and why they are more worried about two-     dollar tickets than students' lives. So we have come to--     Blake and I and one of our other CAT members went to a job      share a few days ago and we were asked to ask a couple      questions about exactly--Blake asked why they were doing two      dollar tickets instesd of $2.50 tickets. Mine was how many      fires start with tobacco use, and there was a significant      amount of fires and deaths the last two years that I have      know. And that is about it.       BLAKE KINCAID: The activities we would like to do beside      the skate park, we would also like to have bike paths and we      would like to have better places for students to go because      The Living Room is only open from one until five, so that      does not give students much time to do what they have got to      do because from five on they are out on the streets and they      cannot do anything about that. It is just one to five without      funding.       NATE POWERS: And around St. J. our local bike path is in      Newport which transportation for these children is a big      problem. These children say the reason that they are smoking      is because there are not any activities for them to do. I      have to agree with the clubs, drug-free clubs, yeah, I agree      with that. But I think it is our officials that let that      happen because I mean some children ruin it for other      students.       We have had significant changes in Lyndonville's local      restaurants. They have had a lot of business since the      smokers had to be kicked out, and we just want to put out the      smoking instead of the children, and I just think that the      dance with Wes was talking to children, made a lot of      children screaming because it was pretty horrible when they      saw what happened to these children when they smoked, and Wes      is a nice guy.                                  ____                                                             Same Sex Marriage       KELLI FREEMAN: I am here today to tell you about an issue      that I have a strong opinion about. That issue is how Vermont      gets dumped on because of the Civil Unions Bill. I think that      for the safety of one's state the law should have been talked      about more carefully. I have heard some pretty mean and nasty      jokes that have been said about Vermont and I do not agree      with it. Sometimes in different towns and states people spray      painted signs, saying ``Vermont, the Gay State'' and ``Take a      Fairy to Vermont'' and comments like that. Vermonters do not      need to hear or see stuff like that because we are upset as      it is. We are afraid to leave the state because we are      embarrassed about our license plates because we are afraid of      what other people are going to say. That is the main reason      why I am talking about this today; we should not be afraid or      threatened of what people are going to say about us and we      should not be embarrassed because we are Vermonters.       The people who harass us about the law that was passed,      they do not know what it is like to live in a state that      everyone discusses in a negative way all the time. We are      sick and tired being called the Gay and Lesbian State and if      you care at all about the people in this state, then you      would think they absolutely would hate what is going on. They      are probably scared and just as upset as you are. So when you      see a Vermont license plate or a Vermont sign before you say      ``The Gay State,'' look at the other citizens and then ask      yourself what are they going through because they have to      live there and they do not like how they are being pictured      either.                                  ____                                                           Youth Advocacy Rights       STEVE HOFFMAN: We work in Burlington, that is where the      majority of our work is with Club Speak Out around Chittenden      County, and I am just going to read off our vision and our      mission to give you an idea of what Club Speak Out is and our      goals.       Our vision is Club Speak Out envisions the ability for      youth to take the initiative without any constraints, being      able to embody positive outcomes in our own lives with the      feelings of being valued by the community through interests      that arise in the area of youth development.       And our mission is, Club Youth Speak Out's mission has      become a resource for all the youth in all aspects of their      life, empowering youth to help themselves in creating healthy      developmental programs and resources that will impact their      lives positively, using businesses, legislators, schools, the      community, and any other area where outcomes can be positive.      And that is what this program was designed for, was to go out      in Chittenden County and we worked in Burlington to build a      model and to give children something to do, take them out of      risky behavioral situations and put them where the outcomes      can be positive.       And what we are here today is to ask a question: What can      the government do or have in order to increase positive      outcomes in the lives of youths? And some of the things that      we came up with is provide less competitive monetary funds      for programming, and give it to the state and local      governments in order to give out to the organizations that      are around for youth. What happens is that when you go to      apply for a grant there is not that much money out there and      there is a lot of competition, and when a new program does      come in, a lot of people are scared and they try to stop it.      And that is just not right because as long as the program has      the right passion and it is designed to work functionally      with other programs and positive outcomes can be made then      they all have should be given a chance because every little      bit helps and counts. If the federal government can provide      more money that would be great, and they did just decrease      the safe school money I believe, National Safe School money,      that was just decreased by 17 percent which is tremendous.      And a lot of the grants given out now the money has to be cut      which is not too good when we are trying to build programs to      build healthy communities.       Another thing is increase the ability for youth to utilize      the resources that state and federal representatives offer;      more awareness for youth to be able to come to your office or      come to Senator Jeffords and Leahy's office and their local      governments and be able to come up and say, This is an issue      that we have, how can you help us, what steps do we have? And      then form youth governmental boards that have the ability for      youth to have a say in working and forming youth policies in      accordance with adult policymakers, and we feel that that is      real important.       One issue that did come up today was the dance club and      that is something we are working on because we had a Speak      Out and with other youth have come up and said we really need      something to do, we need a dance club. 242 is a nice club but      unfortunately it is not diverse enough and does not really      fit the mission and the original reason why it     was in place. So we want to kind of start a dance club where      all students can go with a game room without any drinking so      if they didn't want to dance there is other stuff that they      can do that is open until twelve o'clock at night every      night. We hire youth, it is run by youth, the money goes      right back to the youth, it is not in any business's hands.       So that would be nice to get definitely some money and      support from the government for that too, because we can      easily go out and get different companies to donate their      services, but as far as the funds and stuff it does cost a      lot of money to fundraise that, and it is just a lot,      especially with the skateboard park where we had to raise      $50,000 for that, and it adds up, and when you keep asking      people they are like How much do we have to give? So we feel      that is very important.       JONATHAN CUMMINGS: We would just really like to see youth      be involved. When youth run their own organizations they      accomplish a lot more and they are a lot more connected with      what they are doing which is why our mission is both youth      and not necessarily have adults run our programs. I am      trying--like my group, I run myself now and I see that      students that I work with are a lot more involved when it is      youth leading them rather than an adult.                               ____________________
