President, on vote No. 175, I was necessarily absent due to a weather delay with my plane from New York (Delta 1959). Had I been present for that vote, I would have voted to confirm the nomination of Sandra Segal Ikuta to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit.                          ____________________[Pages S6056-S6057]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                BIRTHDAY WISHES TO DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI  Mr. McCONNELL. As with all supporters of freedom and democracy in the, world, I rise today to extend birthday wishes to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Laureate who remains under house arrest in Burma.  Much like her previous several birthdays, Suu Kyi's birthday today almost certainly will not be a happy one. The ``gift'' given to Suu Kyi by the ruling State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, a few weeks ago was the news that it was again extending her detention.  Under the autocratic rule of the SPDC, drug trafficking, disease and human rights violations are rampant and pose growing problems to the region as a whole. The SPDC adheres to policies that seek only to consolidate its own power, and the ruined lives of the Burmese people are the result. Indeed, there is little reason for celebration in Burma today.  The plight of Suu Kyi symbolizes the plight of her countrymen. Moreover, her commitment to freedom and justice through peaceful political change has created a legacy that will endure long after the SPDC's reign is no more.  The best gift the free world can give Suu Kyi is to remain steadfast in support of freedom in Burma today. She can count on my support.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed in today's Wall Street Journal by Under Secretary of State Paula Dobriansky be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 19, 2006]                     ``Press for Change in Burma''                        (By Paula J. Dobrainsky)       Today marks the 61st birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi, the      elected leader of Burma's National League for Democracy. It      is the third consecutive birthday that she has spent under      detention--and a stark reminder that not only she, but 50      million fellow Burmese are living without basic freedoms and      human rights. Absent change, Burma is likely to continue a      dangerous decline that threatens the welfare of its people      and its neighbors alike.       Only by unconditionally releasing Ms. Suu Kyi and all other      political prisoners, restoring a democratic form of      government, and observing international standards of human      rights can Burma's regime bring stability, prosperity and      peace to its country--and international respect to its      leaders. Toward that end, we are seeking a United Nations      Security Council resolution that underscores the      aforementioned goals, which were communicated by U.N.      Undersecretary General for Political Affairs Ibrahim Gambari      to senior Burmese officials during his visit to the country      last month. The U.S. is committed to working with the U.N.      Security Council, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, regional      institutions and governments to press for genuine national      reconciliation in Burma.       The threat to the Burmese people from their own leaders is      clear: In only the last few months, attacks against ethnic      minorities have displaced thousands. Military units abuse      their power regularly and commit egregious human rights      abuses with impunity, including rape, forced labor, murder      and torture. The regime's continued economic mismanagement      and corruption have led to a widespread failure of the      banking system and rampant inflation, which increases the      daily hardships of the Burmese people. Making matters worse,      the military's restrictions on U.N. and nongovernmental      organizations have hampered the ability of relief      organizations to deliver assistance to Burma's most      vulnerable populations.       Infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and avian      flu are best controlled by responsible governments with      transparent public health systems that cooperate closely with      international institutions. Yet even as the Burmese regime      spends considerable     sums to finish relocating its capital, malnutrition is rising      and thousands are dying from treatable diseases like malaria      and tuberculosis. This tragic failure calls into question the      Burmese junta's willingness and ability to protect and      improve the well-being of its people.       Burma's people are not alone in facing the consequences of      their government's actions: the country's deterioration poses      a real danger to its neighbors and--in today's interconnected      world--even to those far away. The drug trade and trafficking      in persons are rampant; both flow across porous borders and      spread corruption, political instability and disease.       America will persist in its strategy to increase      international pressure on Burma by working with individual      governments and regional organizations, such as the European      Union, to seek to return the country to its people through a      transparent, inclusive political process. The U.S.      administration will continue to impose economic sanctions on      the Burmese government, while insisting upon the      unconditional release of Ms. Suu Kyi and other political      prisoners; an end to attacks on civilians and other human      rights violations; and a real dialogue leading to peace,      democracy and national reconciliation.       In Asia, the U.S. will continue to collaborate with Burma's      neighbors, including members of the Association of Southeast      Asian Nations, who have a particular interest in seeing      Burma's decline reversed. Asean leaders have already publicly      called for the release of political prisoners and for the      resumption of a national dialogue with all political      stakeholders. On June 3, Indonesian Foreign Minister Hasan      Wirayuda stated that ``the junta [can] not deflect criticism      of the Nobel peace laureate's detention by saying it was an      internal matter. The truth is no country can claim that human      rights abuses are its own internal affairs.''       Finally, the U.S. will work in the U.N. to press for change      in Burma. We are pleased that the U.N.'s Economic and Social      Council will discuss Burma's forced labor practices in its      July session. The U.S. will continue to pursue a U.N.      Security Council resolution. As U.S. Secretary of State      Condoleezza Rice has said, America stands with the people of      Burma, and we have not forgotten their dream of democracy.       The economic, political and public health situation in      Burma has deteriorated to the point where the regime's      combination of repression and its unwillingness--or      inability--to meet its own citizens' needs pose a threat to      the peace, security and stability of the region. We must all      act together to help the Burmese people win the freedom and      prosperity they deserve.
