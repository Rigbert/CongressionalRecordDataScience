 Res. 220       Whereas Colombia is home to the oldest democracy in Latin      America and has consistently been a friend of the United      States;       Whereas Colombia has been affected by the violence      generated by the terrorist acts of illegal armed groups;       Whereas the largest of these groups, the Revolutionary      Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), has used kidnapping,      extortion, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking to raise      money for its activities;       Whereas those most affected by the targets of these      activities have been the people of Colombia;       Whereas in October 1997, almost 10,000,000 Colombians voted      for a mandate for peace that asked all presidential      candidates to find peace in Colombia through political      negotiation;

      Whereas the Government of Colombia put forth several      proposals for peace and made sacrifices in sovereign      territory and commitments in funding in hopes of achieving      peace in Colombia only to have these overtures repeatedly      rejected;       Whereas, on January 20, 2002, the Government of Colombia      and the FARC were able to agree on a schedule to be followed      in order to define the future of the peace process;       Whereas, since this accord was signed by the FARC, the FARC      has consistently and repeatedly taken violent actions against      the people and the Government of Colombia in the form of      terrorist attacks, including--       (1) car bombs;       (2) attacking government installations;       (3) mining new fields;       (4) homicides, including women and children;       (5) destroying electric pylons;       (6) bombing oil pipelines;       (7) destroying bridges;

      (3) Representative Orlando Beltran Cuellar, a member of the      Liberal party from the Province of Huila and elected by the      people of Colombia, who was kidnapped by the FARC in the      municipality of Gigante, Province of Huila, on August 28,      2001;       (4) Representative Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo, a member      of the Liberal Party from the Province of Huila and elected      by the people of Colombia, who was kidnapped by the FARC in      the municipality of Hobo, Province of Huila, on September 11,      2001;

and       Whereas Saturday, February 23, Presidential Candidate      Ingrid Betancourt and her campaign manager Clara Rojas were      kidnapped by the FARC as she traveled to San Vicente del      Caguan: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) expresses its strong support for the democratically      elected Government of Colombia and the Colombian people in      their struggle to protect their democracy from terrorism and      the scourge of illicit narcotics;
