Feingold, and Mr. Dorgan) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:                            S. Con. Res. 54       Whereas heart disease remains the leading cause of death in      the United States;       Whereas heart disease affects men, women, and children of      every age and race in the United States, regardless of where      they live;       Whereas approximately 325,000 coronary heart disease deaths      annually occur out of hospital or in an emergency room;       Whereas approximately 95 percent of sudden cardiac arrest      victims die before arriving at the hospital;       Whereas sudden cardiac arrest results from an abnormal      heart rhythm in most adults;       Whereas in 27.4 percent of cases of sudden cardiac arrest,      the victim is located in a place other than a hospital and      receives cardiopulmonary resuscitation by a bystander;       Whereas prompt delivery of cardiopulmonary resuscitation      more than doubles the chance of survival from sudden cardiac      arrest by helping to maintain vital blood flow to the heart      and brain, increasing the amount of time that an electric      shock from a defibrillator can be effective;       Whereas an automated external defibrillator, even when used      by a bystander, is safe, easy to operate, and highly      effective in restoring a normal heart rhythm, significantly      increasing the chance of survival for many victims if used      immediately after the onset of sudden cardiac arrest;       Whereas death or severe brain injury is likely to occur      unless resuscitation measures are started no later than 10      minutes after the onset of sudden cardiac arrest;       Whereas the interval between the 911 call and the arrival      of EMS personnel is typically longer than 5 minutes, and      achieving high survival rates therefore depends on a public      trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated      external defibrillator use; and       Whereas the American Heart Association, the American Red      Cross, and the National     Safety Council are preparing related public awareness and      training campaigns on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and      automated external defibrillation to be held during the first      week of June each year: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That the Congress--       (1) supports the goals and ideals of a National      Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated External      Defibrillator Awareness Week to establish well-organized      programs to increase public training in cardiopulmonary      resuscitation and automated external defibrillator use and to      increase public access to automated external defibrillators;      and       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and      interested organizations to observe such a week with      appropriate ceremonies and activities.
