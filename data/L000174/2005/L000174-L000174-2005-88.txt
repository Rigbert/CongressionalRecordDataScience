President, I also thank the Senator from California for her involvement. Nobody wants to kill the PATRIOT Act by this action. I know our distinguished majority leader has said he would oppose the extension. We will see what happens in that vote. Many of us say we will oppose things, and they happen. I am talking about the 3-month extension. Even if the other body has left, they always leave back a couple of people who can do things by unanimous consent.  The Senator from New Hampshire is in the Chamber. How much time does he wish?
