 As you know, the Northwest Power Act requires the Power Planning Council and Bonneville Power Administration to mitigate the effects of the hydro-electric system on fish and wildlife generally, and anadromous fisheries specifically. The amendment proposed by the senior Senator would require the council to consider ocean conditions prior to making its science-based recommendations for mitigation priorities to Bonneville. Does the Senator agree that his amendment does not expand the scope of Northwest Power Act with respect to hydro system mitigation, nor does it make hydro system mitigation efforts contingent on known ocean conditions?
