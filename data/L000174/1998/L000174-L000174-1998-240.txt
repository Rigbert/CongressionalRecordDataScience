President, earlier this month, a three-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit decided United States v. Singleton, in which it found that the prosecutor had violated the federal gratuity statute and a state ethics rule by entering a plea agreement with a cooperating defendant that made certain promises in exchange for the cooperator's truthful testimony at trial. The promises in question were the sort of plain vanilla promises that appear in virtually every cooperation agreement, and are the lifeblood of bringing successful prosecutions.  As a former prosecutor, I found this decision bizarre and dangerous. In effect, it makes it illegal--a federal felony--for prosecutors to offer leniency in return for testimony on the theory that leniency is a form of bribery. Defense attorneys across the country have already begun to jump on the Singleton bandwagon. In my state, Vermont, the decision has already triggered new motions in a major drug smuggling case involving a billion dollars worth of hashish. The defendant, Martin Scott, is scheduled to go to trial in September, and the government's evidence includes testimony by cooperating codefendants. Scott has now moved to exclude this testimony on the ground that it was obtained unlawfully in return for government promises of leniency, citing Singleton.  If this controversial decision stands, prosecutors would be exposed to the threat of felony liability and disciplinary action just for doing their jobs. In addition, this decision could result in a tidal wave of reversals and suppression rulings in cases involving cooperator testimony.  I was relieved to see that the Tenth Circuit acted swiftly to vacate the panel decision and set the case down for en banc rehearing in November, and I am confident that the ruling will eventually be thrown out--but not before the issue has been raised and relitigated at every turn in every district and circuit court in the land. At a minimum, this will delay trials, squander scarce judicial resources, and generally waste everyone's time.  We need to insure that prosecutors have the tools they need to do their jobs effectively, and being able to enter into cooperation agreements is critical. That's why I am introducing legislation today to make crystal clear that prosecutors and other public officials acting in the performance of their official duties may enter cooperation agreements and make other such commitments, assurances and promises in return for truthful testimony.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this matter, and ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2314       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
