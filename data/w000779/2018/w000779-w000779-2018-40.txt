President, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Throughout its half century, this landmark conservation law has played a critical role in maintaining the natural, free-flowing qualities that make the country's wild and scenic rivers so special.  The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, signed October 2, 1968, by President Lyndon B. Johnson, has protected rivers across the United States for recreation, salmon and fish habitat, important geology and cultural values, and countless other important benefits. This bedrock environmental law is especially important for Oregon where, in 1968, the remarkable wild Rogue River received protection as part of the first eight rivers protected by the Act.  Since then, Congress extended Wild and Scenic designations to many of Oregon's most iconic rivers, including important segments of the Chetco, the Deschutes, the Elk, the John Day, the Lostine, the Owyhee, and over 50 other rivers and streams in every corner of my State. In total, Oregon has more river segments designated than any other State in the Union, with over 1,900 miles in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.  A free-flowing, unencumbered river is truly a sight to behold, which is why I am working now to add even more miles to Oregon's already impressive list of Wild and Scenic rivers through passage of the Oregon Wildlands Act. The Oregon Wildlands Act adds a total of nearly 200 miles, including many of the important tributaries to the Rogue River and the Elk River--home to one of North America's healthiest salmon, steelhead, and cutthroat trout populations along the Pacific Coast--and the Molalla River, to name a few.  Over the last 50 years, Congress designated 209 units of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, totaling nearly 12,600 miles of Wild and Scenic rivers and streams in 40 States and Puerto Rico to protect and provide remarkable habitat for endangered salmon and steelhead, drinking water for millions of Americans, and recreation opportunities for countless recreation enthusiasts who come from all over the world.  This is precisely what makes the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act so important after all these years as a tool to protect, for this and future generations, the very qualities that make America's and Oregon's natural treasures so unique and wonderful.  As Henry David Thoreau noted in his book, ``A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers,'' ``He who hears the rippling of rivers in these degenerate days will not utterly despair.'' Fifty years ago, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act started as a novel idea to protect and enhance the Nation's waterways from pollution, dams, and construction that could interrupt their free-flowing condition. By 2018, it has become a remarkable success story deserving of celebration and commemoration.  As climate change and other environmental factors continue to threaten the health of America's rivers, it is important to build on the successes of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and continue to protect rivers across the county. It is in our best interest to do so, and I remain committed to continuing the legacy of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and to work to further its protections throughout the Nation.                          ____________________
