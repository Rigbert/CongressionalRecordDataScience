Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Darrell G. Rice, a dedicated firefighter, community member and friend who passed away on April 22, 2014. As a pillar of the community, he will be deeply missed.  By the nature of their jobs, firefighters must be committed individuals willing to put their lives in harm's way for the safety of their communities and for the protection of life and property for those surrounding them. Darrell Rice not only fulfilled these responsibilities, but often went above and beyond the call of duty throughout his twenty-two years of service. Darrell took on the challenges of this position with full knowledge of the inherent dangers he would have to face daily. This willingness to accept a responsibility of such magnitude speaks to Darrell's courage and dedication.  Day in and day out, Darrell faithfully represented his department and acted as a refreshing inspiration to all who surrounded him. As a strong believer in teamwork, Darrell would continually provide encouragement to all staff. Darrell was successful in spreading this sentiment throughout the community as well during his time in his final assignment as an inspector. Working with the Fire Prevention Division's Petroleum Chemical Unit, Darrell worked with businesses to ensure their safety for the public, and understood the responsibility of his job.  As such a dedicated individual, Darrell will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic and charismatic leadership. I extend my deepest sympathies and condolences to Darrell's family and friends, most especially to his wife, Phyllis, and his daughter, Candace, of Corona, California. Although Darrell may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the community remains and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
