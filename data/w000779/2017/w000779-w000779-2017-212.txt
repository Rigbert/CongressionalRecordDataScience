 I think what you are saying is that it is critically important that we get more predictability and more certainty in the private insurance market. What I am struck by is, of course, this is the private sector. This is not the government. This is the private sector. The President has been basically pouring gasoline on the fires of uncertainty in the private insurance market because he is always in or out on this question of cost sharing, and the private insurers then say: We can't really predict what our rates are going to be, and maybe we have to pull out or we have to raise rates.  Could the Senator again highlight his thoughts with respect to more predictability and more certainty? It is such an important point.  After my good friend from Maryland has made that point, I know the Senator from Delaware is interested in the same subject.
