Reid, on behalf of himself, Senator Craig, and Senator Bryan.  As I read the amendment that has been proposed by the Senator from Nevada, there is virtually no change in the original language offered by Senator Craig.  What the Senator from Nevada seeks to do is to say those mining operations currently in operation, those which have the plans of operations submitted to the Bureau of Land Management prior to October 1 of the year 2000, will not be subject to limitation on the acreage that can be used for their dumping of their mill site. I would suggest to the Senator from Nevada it is a slightly different approach, but the net impact is the same.  I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Nevada. I understand his knowledge and familiarity with this subject is certainly far better than my own. But I can tell the Senator, if he drives across my home area in down State Illinois, he will see the legacy of mining which we continue to live with.  In years gone by, in the State of Illinois, and many other States, mining companies literally took to the land, extracted whatever was valuable, and left the mess behind for future generations. You can see it, not only in the areas where we had shaft mining, but you have on our prairies small mountains of what was left behind, often toxic in nature, that now have to be reclaimed by today's taxpayers. Or you might visit Fulton County or southern Illinois and find areas that were strip mined. What is left behind is horrible. It is scrub trees, standing lakes, but, frankly, uninhabitable and unusable--left behind by a mining industry that had one motive: Profit.  It is interesting to me this debate really focuses on a law which was written 127 years ago. Not a single Member of the Senate would suggest that our sensitivity to environmental issues is the same today as it was 127 years ago. We know better. If you want to mine coal in Illinois today, you are held to high standards. The same is true in virtually every State in the Union. You can no longer come in and plunder the land, take out the wealth from it, and leave behind this legacy of rubbish and waste, this lunar landscape. That is today. That is the 20th century. That is 1999.  But when it comes to hard rock mining, we are driven and guided by a law that is 127 years old. It is interesting that the hard rock mining industry has not really worked hard to bring about a real reform of the law. I think that has a lot to do with the fact they have a pretty sweet deal.  For $2.50 an acre, they can take taxpayers' land--owned by Americans--and use it for their own profit, leaving their waste and mess behind, and move on.  For hundreds of dollars, they can extract millions of dollars of minerals and not pay the taxpayers a penny.  The Senator from Nevada says: Don't beat up on the mining industry. I think that is a fair admonition. I don't believe we should beat up on the environment either. We certainly shouldn't beat up on taxpayers. The 1872 mining law does just that.  What is this all about? You will undoubtedly hear in a few minutes from the Senator from Idaho and others that some bureaucrat in the Department of the Interior in November of 1997 took it upon himself to decide what the law would be and all this amendment is about is to try to say to that bureaucrat: It is none of your business. We will decide how many acres you can use to dump your waste after you have mined on Federal land.  What is it all about? On November 7, 1997, the solicitor of the Department of Interior, Mr. Leshy, issued an opinion enforcing a provision of the 1872 mining law which restricts the amount of public land that can be used to dump waste from hard rock mines.  Now, some of those who support this amendment believe that the 1872 mining law is open to interpretation. Interestingly enough, the other body, the House of Representatives, by a margin of almost 100 Members, said that that interpretation is wrong. They go along with the position supported by the Senator from Washington and myself. With respect to mill site claims, the law states: ``No location made on and after May 10, 1872, shall exceed 5 acres.'' The law allows one 5-acre mill site claim per mineral claim. It means that if you buy, at $2.50 an acre or $5 an acre, the right to mine for these minerals, you can only use a 5-acre plot to dump your waste on the so-called mill site.  The effect of the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Idaho is to say: No, you can dump on as many acres as you want to, unlimited. Go ahead and leave the waste behind. Let the taxpayers in future generations worry about the environmental impact and what it does visually to America's landscape.  The Leshy opinion in 1997 simply reaffirms the plain language of the law and prior interpretations by Congress and by the mining industry.  I have in my hand citations of the mill site limitations under the 1872 mining law. I ask unanimous consent to have this printed as part of the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Millsite Limits Under the 1872 Mining Law       1872--Mining Law enacted, stating: ``no location [of a      millsite] shall exceed five acres.'' 30 U.S.C. Sec. 42(a).       1872--One month later, General Land Office issues      regulation stating: ``The law expressly limits mill-site      locations made from and after its passage to five acres .  .       .'' Mining Regulations Sec. 91, June 10, 1872, Copp, U.S.      Mining Decisions 270, 292 (1874) (emphasis in original).       1884--Secretary of the Interior rules in J.B. Hoggin, 2      L.D. 755, that more than one millsite may be patented with a      lode claim, provided that the aggregate is not more than five      acres.       1891--Secretary of the Interior rules in Hecla Consolidated      Mining, 12 L.D. 75, that the Mining Law ``expressly limits      the amount of land to be taken in connection with a mill to      five acres.''       1891--Acting Secretary of the Interior rules in Mint Lode      and Mill Site, 12 L.D. 624, that the Mining Law ``evidently      intends to give to each operator of a lode claim, a tract of      land, not exceeding five acres in extent, for the purpose of      conducting mining or milling operations thereon, in      connection with such lode.''       1903--Acting Secretary of the Interior rules in Alaska      Copper Co., 32 L.D. 128, that the ``manifest purpose [of the      millsite provision of the Mining Law] is to permit the      proprietor of a lode mining claim to acquire a small tract of      . . . land as directly auxiliary to the prosecution of active      mining operations upon his lode claim, or for the erection of      a quartz mill. . . . The area of such additional tract is by      the terms of the statute restricted to five acres as      obviously ample for either purpose.''       1914--Curtis H. Lindley writes in the third edition of his      oft-cited treatise Lindley on Mines, Sec. 520, that a ``lode      proprietor may select more than one tract [for a millsite] if      the aggregate does not exceed five acres.''       1955--Denver mining attorney John W. Shireman writes in the      First Annual Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Institute that ``Each      lode claim is entitled to one mill site for use in connection      therewith . . .'' Shireman, ``Mining Location Procedures,'' 1      Rocky Mtn. Min. L. Inst. 307, 321 (1955).       1960--Congress amends the Mining Law to allow location of      millsites in connection with placer claims. In its report on      the bill, the Senate Interior Committee explained that it had      modified the language of the bill ``so as to impose a limit      of one 5-acre millsite in any individual case preventing the      location of a series of 5-acre millsites in cases where a      single claim is jointly owned by several persons. . . . In      essence, [the bill] merely grants to holders of placer claims      the same rights to locate a 5-acre millsite as has been the      case since 1872 in respect to holders of lode claims . . .''      S. Rep. No. 904, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., at 2.       1960--The first edition of American Law of Mining (which is      written primarily by attorneys for the mining industry)      states: ``A mill site may, if necessary for the claimant's      mining or milling purposes, consist of more than one tract of      land, provided that it does not exceed five acres in the      aggregate.'' 1 Am. L. Mining Sec. 5.35 (1960).       1968--The American Mining Congress (the leading trade      association for the mining industry) presents the following      argument for mining law reform to the Public Land Law Review      Commission:       ``When the mining laws were enacted in 1872, provision was      made for the acquisition of five-acre millsites to be used      for plant facilities on mining claims. The typical mine then      was a high-grade lode or vein deposit from which ores were      removed by underground mining. The surface plant was usually      relatively small, and acquisition of five-acre millsites in      addition to the surface of mining clams . . . adequately      served the needs of the mines. . . .       ``Today, the situation is frequently different. . . . A      mine having 500 acres of mining claims may, for example,      require 5000 acres for surface plant facilities and waste      disposal areas. It is obvious that such activities may not be      acquired through five-acre millsites.''--American Mining      Congress, The Mining Law and Public Lands, at 29 January 11,      1968).       1970--An analysis of the Mining Law prepared for the Public      Land Law Review Commission by Twitty, Sievwright & Mills (a      Phoenix, Ariz. law firm that represents the mining industry)      closely tracked the argument by the American Mining Congress      two years earlier:       ``When the mining laws were enacted in 1872, provision was      made for the acquisition of five-acre mill sites to be used      for mining or milling purposes. The typical mine then was a      high-grade lode or vein deposit from which ore was removed by      underground mining. The surface plant was usually relatively      small, and the surface of the mining claims together with the      incident mill sites adequately served the needs of the mines      for plant facilities and waste disposal areas.       ``Today, the situation is frequently different. The high-     grade underground mines have, for the most part, been mined      out. Open pit rather than underground mining is, with      increasing frequency, the most economical way to mine the      low-grade deposits which now comprise a major portion of      the reserves of many minerals. The mining industry now      relies on mechanization, the handling of large tonnages of      overburden and ores and the utilization of large surface      plants in order to keep costs down so that these low-grade      deposits may be mined and treated at a profit. Such mining      operations require not only substantial areas for plant      facilities, but much larger ares than formerly for the      disposal of overburden and mill tailings. The surface      areas of mining claims and mill sites are no longer      adequate for such purposes. * * *       ``If a mineral deposit is partially or entirely surrounded      by the public domain, the acquisition of adjacent nonmineral      land from the United States for necessary facilities is now      frequently extremely difficult because the laws do not      provide a satisfactory way to make these acquisitions. Small      areas may be acquired as mill sites, and in certain      instances, if the lands meet the statutory requirement as      isolated or disconnected tracts, larger acreages may be      acquired at public auction. Mining companies planning large      mining operations have been obliged to meet their needs for      nonmineral lands by obtaining the necessary lands by other      means.''       Twitty, Sievwright & Mills, ``Nonfuel Mineral Resources of      the Public Lands; A Study Prepared for the Public Land Law      Review Commission,'' (Dec. 1970), at vol. 3, pp. 1047-48      (emphasis added).       The Twitty, Sievwright study also states: ``Under the first      clause of subsection (a) of [30 U.S.C. Sec. 42], each lode      claimant is allowed, in addition to his lode claim, five      acres of land to be used for mining or milling purposes.''      Id. at vol. 2, p. 323.       1974--the Interior Board of Land Appeals rules in United      States v. Swanson, 14 IBLA 158, 173-74, that:  [A millsite] claimant is entitled to receive only that amount of land needed for his mining and milling operations, and this amount can embrace a tract of less than five acres. The statute states that the location shall not ``exceed five acres.'' . . . The reference to five acres in the statute is clearly a ceiling measure, not an absolute, automatic grant.''       1977--Salt Lake City mining attorneys Clayton J. Parr and      Dale A. Kimball write that ``Theoretically, one five-acre      millsite can be acquired for each valid mining claim.'' Parr      & Kimball, ``Acquisition of Non-Mineral Land for Mine Related      Purposes,'' 23 Rocky Mtn. Min. L. Inst. 595, 641-42 (1977).       1979--In an analysis of federal mining law, the      Congressional Office of Technology Assessment states:       ``[I]t is highly doubtful that [millsites] could satisfy      all the demands for surface space.There could be at most as      many millsites as there are mining claims, and each milliste      would be at most one-fourth the size of the typical 20-acre      claim, so that the millsites, in the aggregate, would be one-     fourth the size of the ore body encompassed by the claims.''       Office of Technology Assessment, Management of Fuel and      Nonfuel Minerals in Federal Land, at 127 (April 1979).       1984--In the second edition of American Law of Mining,      Patrick J. Garver of the Salt Lake City law firm Parsons,      Behle & Latimer (Mr. Garver is now executive vice-president      of Barrick Gold Corp.) writes: ``Uncertainty also surrounds      the issue of the amount of land that may be used by millsite      claimants.'' 4 Am. L. Mining, Sec. 110.03[4] (2d ed. 1984).       1984--Salt Lake City mining attorneys Clayton J. Parr and      Robert G. Holt write in the second edition of American Law of      Mining: ``Because of the relatively uncertain tenure of mill      site claims, few miners choose mill sites as a location for      permanent mining support facilities.'' 4 Am L. Mining      Sec. 110.03[1].       1987--In the revised second edition of American Law of      Mining, Phoenix mining attorneys Jerry L. Haggard and Daniel      L. Muchow write:       ``The acquisition of federal lands or interests therein by      means other than the locating of mining claims or mill sites      is sometimes necessary to provide the additional ground      needed for a planned mining operation. The restraints on the      number and sizes of mill site claims can limit their      usefulness as a land acquisition method.''--4 Am. L. Mining,      Sec. 111.01 (2d ed. rev. 1987).       1997--Solicitor of the Department of the Interior John D.      Leshy issues opinion titled ``Limitations on Patenting      Millsites Under the Mining Law of 1872.''
