BOXER. It was in 2000. It was a case of a Nebraska law. And, yes, the Court found it unconstitutional.  What the authors of S. 3 will tell you is they have met the test. But what constitutional lawyers tell us is that the test isn't met at all. There is no exception for health. My colleague actually carried the health exception.  Now, this is what the Supreme Court said--and I am glad my colleague asked this question--in Stenberg v. Carhart. They basically said: If you are outlawing a medical procedure, you have to have a health exception.       The governing standard requires an exception ``where it is      necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for the      preservation of the life or health of the mother.''       Our cases have repeatedly invalidated statutes that in the      process of regulating the methods of abortion impose      significant health risks.  My friend is right on target. This is the Supreme Court.
