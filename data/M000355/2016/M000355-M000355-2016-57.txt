 President, yesterday the Senate voted overwhelmingly to take the next step in the 21st Century Cures Act, bipartisan legislation to bolster medical innovation.  This legislation promotes critical investments in research and treatment development. It helps cut through unnecessary regulations that would hinder the development of cures while also protecting safety. It builds upon the progress of innovative therapies and regenerative medicine.  This legislation puts patients first, it helps strengthen the kind of research and treatments needed to cure the most devastating diseases, and it includes provisions to help enhance mental health programs and to provide funding to help fight opioid abuse.  I have heard from health professionals across my State who have expressed the impact this legislation can make, from the Kentucky Hospital Association to the University of Kentucky, our State's largest research university.  This bill, the U.K. president says, reflects the ``growing support from Congress for increased investment in research that addresses the compelling questions of our day.'' I will be pleased to welcome U.K. President Capilouto to the Capitol this morning. He says Cures is one example of how the university will be better equipped ``to improve the lives of those in our Commonwealth.''  We know this bill wouldn't have been possible without Chairman Alexander's ceaseless efforts, alongside Ranking Member Murray, to drive it forward.  We thank them both, as well as Members such as Senator Cornyn, Senator Hatch, and Senator Cassidy, who have all endeavored to make the bill the strongest it could be.  I also recognize my friend Vice President Biden--who joined us yesterday--for his efforts to include his Cancer Moonshot issue in the package. This is an issue that hits close to home for the Vice President, as we all know. He has been a leading voice in supporting efforts to strengthen cancer research and to find a cure. I am pleased we will pass this legislation soon so we can begin to put its provisions to work on behalf of American families.  On the other important issues before the Senate, I have spoken with the Speaker on a number of occasions about an issue facing coal miner retirees, such as those I represent in Kentucky, and have insisted that the CR include a provision to address that issue so these retirees don't lose their health care benefits at the end of the year. We hope to have a final bill to share with Members soon, and we lookforward to turning to it as soon as possible after House action. I will have more on that later.  We are also working to wrap up a number of conference reports, including for the Defense authorization bill and the Water Resources Development Act.  Last night I took the next step on the Defense conference report so we can pass it this week. This legislation will provide more of the tools servicemembers need to take on national security challenges, help strengthen our military posture, and support our men and women in uniform with the benefits and pay raises they have earned.  I hope the Senate will also take the next step soon on the Water Resources Development Act conference report. This water resources conference report will invest in our Nation's waterways infrastructure, enhance commerce, and support safe and reliable water sources to prevent future situations, such as the one we saw in Flint, MI. To that point, this bill also includes assistance for families such as those in Flint who have already been impacted by lead poisoning.                          ____________________
