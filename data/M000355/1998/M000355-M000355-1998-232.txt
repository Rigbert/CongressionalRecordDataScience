 President, the amendment is really quite simple. The Federal Election Commission is like no other commission of the Federal Government. It has three Republicans and three Democrats. The general counsel, under the current system, could serve for a lifetime. All the McConnell amendment does is require that every 4 years the general counsel come up for reappointment and not be reappointed unless he can achieve at least four votes, thereby demonstrating to the full Commission, on a bipartisan basis, enough confidence to continue for another 4-year term.  This guarantees that the general counsel will operate in a bipartisan manner, because a general counsel who, after 4 years, could not achieve votes from both parties, it seems to this Senator, clearly would fail a test of bipartisanship.  This is not about the current occupant of the office. It is about ensuring that the Federal Election Commission continues to operate on a bipartisan basis. I hope the amendment will be approved.
