 Let me just outline how this side is going to use its 30 minutes. I have a few comments to make, and I may respond to some of the things the Senator said about Governor Leavitt. I understand Senator Bond wants to come down and have about 5 minutes.  I ask if Senator Jeffords would mind if Senator Hatch could have our last 10 minutes because he was not able to spend as much time in the Chamber yesterday in order to respond to anything else that has been said about Governor Leavitt.
