Chief Justice, like others, I want to thank you for your professionalism and good humor in these proceedings even though I suspect there are days that both you and I wish we were back at our homes in Vermont rather than here.  But I want to tell the Senators also of an extraordinary day that my good friend, Senator Stevens of Alaska, and I spent. We left Sunday afternoon from Washington for the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan. We came back at about 2 o'clock yesterday morning. The delegation was an extraordinary one: Two other Members of Congress, senior members of the President's staff; even the parents of the King's widow, Queen Noor of Jordan, were with us.  And the airplane, Air Force One, that is so recognizable around the world as a symbol of America, underscored our country's presence even as it landed. And Ted will recall the TV was on in the plane. We could see they interrupted national television in Jordan to show our plane landing. What was most remarkable to the people assembled from around the world for the funeral was the dramatic appearance not only of the President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton, but three former U.S. Presidents--Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush--they joined with President Clinton as an extraordinary demonstration not only of bipartisanship but of a united American commitment to the peace policies of King Hussein, and the U.S. role in a continuing peace process.  The symbol of American presence and the American continuity could not have been stronger with these four Presidents. It was a privilege to be there, a privilege I will always cherish.  In the frenetic hours on the ground, I observed the leaders from the Middle East and around the world.  I saw leader after leader making a strong effort to come to President Clinton and to speak with him. I listened to his conversation. It was clear to me he had a very good understanding of the issues that faced not only our country, but their country, and an understanding about how America's interest affect all of us.  Probably the greatest contrast was in President Clinton's brief meeting with Boris Yeltsin, the President of Russia, a country that long symbolized our polar opposite during the cold war. We saw an aging President Yeltsin, unable to stand without two men helping him, a man who had to leave very shortly thereafter--well before the funeral was over--because his strength had faded. What a contrast.  We saw a dynamic Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of England. We saw the leaders of Israel, Japan, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Pakistan, India, Germany, France, Ireland, Egypt, and others coming together, brought together by their respect for King Hussein. Much of their attention was focused on the leader of the United States.  The questions raised by this trial came back to me. I thought, do we abandon our elected leader because of concern about his personal conduct? Now, if this question was in my mind, it was in the minds of a lot of people there. I have been privileged to know many of them, and many asked me the question, Are we really serious about impeachment and removal? They asked that because they said the United States is not a parliamentary system of government, and the one thing that they can rely on is when we elect a President, even if it is not the President they wished we had elected, there are 4 years to deal with him and they can determine their foreign policy with the most powerful Nation on Earth accordingly.  They said they have great respect for our strength and leadership, and they asked if it is really possible that partisanship in the Congress could destroy that heritage overnight.  In my notes, as I flew back throughout the dark night, I asked myself, Are we going to spend our heritage of continuity and strength this way? Are we going to convict the President on these charges in this record? Are we going to destroy a heritage and continuity we earned, from our own Revolution, through a Civil War, through World Wars, through deaths and assassinations of Presidents, through great economic prosperity and devastating recession and depression. I completed my notes by writing, ``It is no longer a question of whether we do this to Bill Clinton, but whether we do it to ourselves.''  The record of this impeachment trial is a time capsule. We leave it for succeeding generations. As the trial began, we reopened the records of 1868. I looked at those records. I thought, someday someone will review ours in the same way. We leave behind a trail of precedents. Our successors will try to understand them. If we act wisely, they will try to emulate it. Our actions can stir a chord that will vibrate throughout the history of our Republic.  So in explaining my decisions in this trial, I know that I am addressing myself to fellow Vermonters and fellow Senators, but also to future generations. In that future generation is my own grandson and perhaps even his grandchildren.  The conclusion I have reached on the articles of impeachment is imbued with this solemn knowledge and sense of duty. My conclusion is we must not avenge the faults of William Jefferson Clinton upon our Nation, our children and our Constitution.  Extreme partisanship and prosecutorial zealotry have strained this process in its critical early junctures. Partisan impeachments are lacking in credibility. The framers knew this. We all know this.  Socrates said: ``The greatest flood has soonest ebb; the sorest tempest, the most sudden calm.''  In many ways, I say to my friends, especially our two distinguished leaders who worked so hard on this, in many ways the Senate's work has been the calm after the storm. We began the 106th Congress, the last of the 20th century, facing a challenge no Senate has been called upon to address since the aftermath of the Civil War. We took a special oath administered to Senators who must determine whether to override the election by the people of the United States of their President and remove him from office.  The Constitution purposely restrains the Congress, and carefully circumscribes our powers to remove the head of the executive branch of the Federal Government. The Constitution intentionally makes it difficult to override the electoral judgment of the American people. I will cast my vote wary of the dangers posed by the House managers' seductive invitation to vote to remove the President for symbolic purposes.  We all agree the President's conduct was inexcusable. It was deeply disappointing, especially to those who know the President and who support the many good things he has done for this country and the world. His conduct in trying to keep this relationship secret from his wife and family, his friends and associates, from the public glare of a politically charged lawsuit, may be understandable on the human level, but it has had serious consequences for him personally and for the legacy of his Presidency.  The President has admitted before a Federal grand jury terribly embarrassing personal conduct and has seen a videotape of that grand jury testimony broadcast to the entire Nation, with excerpts replayed over and over again. This modern day version of the public stockade has been difficult to witness for those who know this man and his family and care about them.  The Jones lawsuit has now been settled and $850,000 has been paid on a case that the District Court judge had dismissed for failing to state a claim.  The Clinton Presidency has been permanently tarnished. The Senate trialprovided a forum to replay the embarrassing and humiliating facts of the President's improper relationship. No one cay say the Presidency has emerged unscathed.  For me, the most regrettable action is the nationally televised statement to the American people, where he shook his finger defiantly and said the allegations were untrue. That was not charged in the articles of impeachment, but it was intended to mislead the American people. That statement was wrong. And even though he later apologized for his action, I feel strongly that no President should so intentionally deceive the American people.  But condemning the President is not the purpose of the impeachment trial. Impeachment cannot be about punishing the officeholder. One of the predecessors of mine and of Senator Jeffords, Senator George Edmunds of Vermont, explained in 1868, that:       [p]unishment by impeachment does not exist under our      Constitution. . ..[The accused] can only be removed from the      office he fills and prevented from holding office, not as      punishment, but as a means merely of protection to the      community. . ..  So our focus has to be on whether conduct which the House has charged has been proven and warrants President Clinton's removal from office to protect the public.  The President's indiscretions alone did not bring us to this point. Raising this matter to the level of a constitutional impeachment only began with the referral from the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr. Justice Robert Jackson, when he was attorney general, observed that the most dangerous power of prosecutors is the power to ``pick people that he thinks he should get rather than cases that need to be prosecuted.'' I am concerned that is what has happened in the case of President Clinton.  Does anyone recall after the fruitless years of investigation of this President, the past year of upheaval, that it was the talking points given to Ms. Tripp by Ms. Lewinsky which were supposed to be the smoking gun that proved a vast conspiracy to suborning perjury? I don't think anybody doubts Ms. Lewinsky's account that she wrote the talking points based on her discussions with Ms. Linda Tripp, and she never discussed them with the President.  Monica Lewinsky consistently maintained that no one ever asked or encouraged her to lie; she was never promised a job for her silence. Indeed, in her 24th interview, the Senate videotaped deposition demanded by the House managers, she testified to her own purposes in keeping her relationship secret. She acted in what she thought was her own best interests. She sought to conceal this relationship because she did not want to be humiliated in front of the whole world. And the record establishes it was Linda Tripp rather than President Clinton who acted in the conflicting roles as Ms. Lewinsky's intimate confidante and ultimate betrayer.  As a former prosecutor, one of the questions I asked is whether these criminal charges of perjury and obstruction would have been brought against Bill Jones rather than Bill Clinton. Experienced prosecutors, Republican and Democrat, testified before the House Judiciary Committee that no prosecutor would have proceeded based on the record compiled by Mr. Starr, and prosecutors I have talked to have said they wouldn't even get to a jury with it. As a former prosecutor, I agree and note that during the course of the Senate proceeding, the case has gotten weaker.  The testimony in the record shows that Ms. Lewinsky had no intention of revealing her relationship with the President. She is the person who originated and carried out the plan to hide certain gifts from the Jones lawyers. The only crimes shown to possibly have occurred are not high crimes but those for which Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp have already received immunity from prosecution from Ken Starr. To influence our judgment, the managers have argued that the consequences of the President's acquittal of their unproven charges would be dire for our children, I have been married for 37 years to a woman I love; my wife and I have raised three wonderful children. I don't need the House of Representatives to tell me how to raise my children. I trust the parents of America to raise their children, to explain what the President did was wrong, to point out the humiliation and other consequences brought on himself and his Presidency. That is not our the Congress' job. That is the job for parents in this country.  I don't believe the Constitution calls upon us to remove a duly elected President for symbolic purposes. Rather, I believe the precedent set by conviction without proof and removal without constitutional justification would be far more dangerous for our Republic than his actions.  The House managers have warned that should the President be acquitted, it would damage the ``rule of law.'' I strongly disagree, because the supreme rule of law in this country is the Constitution; that is what we have to uphold.  Partisan impeachment drives are doomed to fail. The Senate must restore sanity to this impeachment process. We must exercise judgment and do justice. We have to act in the interest of the Nation. History will judge us based on whether this case was resolved in a way that serves the good of the country, not the political ends of any party or the fortunes of any person.  We have all talked about President Andrew Johnson's impeachment. Few people will recall that after the unsuccessful effort to remove him from office, former President Johnson returned to serve this country as a U.S. Senator. I look forward to the day when the Senate can close our work as an impeachment court and that we can all return to our work--our important work we face as U.S. Senators representing our States.  I have served here with 259 Senators, including the 100 here now. I have respected all of you. I have had great affection for many of you on both sides of the aisle. I count among my best friends many Senators on both sides of the aisle. This is a difficult time. I will not question any Senator's vote on this. But the Senator from Vermont cannot vote to convict and I will not.  Thank you.

OATH OF OFFICE       On the first day of this Congress, the Vice President of      the United States administered the oath of office to the most      recently elected Members of the Senate. I was honored by the      people of Vermont to be among those Members and to take the      oath of office to serve here as a representative of Vermont.      With this oath I have again sworn to protect and defend the      Constitution of the United States.       We were reminded by the Majority Leader at the beginning of      the last Congress that the oath we take was formulated in      1868 to help bring the country back together. As Senator Lott      has noted, following the Civil War, some urged continued use      of an ironclad test oath that barred those who had served the      Confederacy from serving in the Federal Government. It took      ``nearly a quarter of a century of confusion and acrimony''      for the Senate to settle upon the oath that we take today.       The same year in which our oath was developed, our country      experienced its first, and until now, its only presidential      impeachment trial. History has judged harshly the ``Radical      Republicans'' who pursued that impeachment against President      Andrew Johnson. A notable exception is William Maxwell      Evarts, a Vermonter who was criticized by many Republican      party leaders for defending a President of the opposite      political party.       I have been proud of another Vermonter, Gregory Craig, who      has played a critical role in the defense of President      Clinton. This     Senate is the last of the 20th century. We began this first      session of the 106th Congress facing a challenge that no      other Senate in over 100 years has been called upon to      address. To deal with that challenge, we all took another      oath, an oath to do ``impartial justice according to the      Constitution and laws.'' That is the oath administered to      Senators who must determine whether to override the election      of the President of the United States and remove him from      office. That oath calls upon us to rise above partisan      politics and our personal feelings about President Clinton.       I focus first on the oaths we take to be Members of the      Senate and to serve in this impeachment trial since the House      Managers opened and closed their presentation to the Senate      pointing to the oaths the President swore to uphold when he      assumed on two occasions the office of the President.       The Managers have emphasized that the President's inaugural      oath of office imposes a constitutional duty to ``take Care      that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' Their argument is      that the presidential oath spelled out in Article II, section      1 of the Constitution establishes a special standard of      conduct for the President, and when the President violates a      law which he has sworn faithfully to execute, he should be      removed.       Frustrated by the restrictions placed on Congress's      impeachment power, which limits the grounds for removal to      ``Treason, Bribery or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors,''      the Managers seek to find alternative constitutional footing      to remove this President. But, the Constitution simply does      not say that a President shall be removed for ``Treason,      Bribery, or other conduct inconsistent with his presidential      oath and duties.'' Nor does it say that a President shall be      removed for ``Treason, Felony, or other Crime,'' which is the      formulation used in the Constitution's Extradition Clause.       The Framers purposely restrained the Congress and carefully      circumscribed our power to remove the head of the co-equal      Executive Branch of the Federal Government. As Professor      Laurence Tribe pointed out last November, during a House      subcommittee hearing on the history of impeachment, the      presidential oath and Take Care clause cannot properly be      invoked so as to make the President of the United States more      vulnerable to impeachment and removal from office than other      federal officials. ``[I]t simply cannot be the case under our      Constitution that removing a sitting president should be      easier, not harder, than removing a vice president, a cabinet      officer, or a sitting federal judge.''       The Managers have invited the Senate to lower the bar for      impeachment and removal of a President by distorting the      constitutional text and using the presidential oath in a      manner never contemplated by the Framers. I cast my vote      mindful of the dangers this seductive invitation poses not      only for this President but, more importantly, for the future      of the presidency and our constitutional framework.       As my oaths demand, I will work to protect and defend the      Constitution. I will continue to defend our constitutional      democracy against encroachments from all sides.       Over the last few years, we have seen scores of      constitutional amendments introduced each Congress and      several voted upon each year. I have spoken about the assault      by amendment being made against the Constitution and defended      the Constitution against these ``bumper sticker'' proposals      for constitutional edits. The impeachment of the President is      a matter of similar importance. What we do, in terms of the      standards we apply and the judgments we make, will either      follow the Constitution or alter the intent of the Framers      and lower those standards for all time. I have heard more      than one Senator acknowledge that in this sense it is not      just the President but also the Senate on trial in this      matter.       In considering what to do we cannot and must not ignore how      we arrived at this point lest our actions countenance      repetition in the future. We are now in a position to write      the lessons we want heeded by future Members who have the      privilege to serve America in Congresses into the next      century and millennium.                        II. HOW DID WE GET HERE?       When former Senator Dale Bumpers spoke to us about the task      before us, he posed a question that many of us have asked      ourselves over the course of these impeachment proceedings.      He asked, ``How do we come to be here?'' I raised virtually      the same question in an opinion editorial published on      December 13, 1998, in the Los Angeles Times. I noted Barbara      Tuchman's gripping account in The Guns of August of how the      world teetered into the catastrophe of World War I. She      recalled a former German chancellor's question to his      successor: ``How did it all happen?'' ``Ah, if only we      knew,'' was the reply.       Future generations may ask the same question of us as they      ponder not only how but also why this sorry episode of      admitted presidential misconduct led this great country to      the brink of paralysis over the possibility of removing a      popular President, whose leadership has given this country      not just a balanced budget but a surplus two years running,      the lowest unemployment in decades and the strongest economy      in the world. Our economy is in the best shape in a      generation in no small part because of the President's      economic policies. We should be working with the President to      make the hard choices and develop the bipartisan cooperation      that are needed to move the country forward into the 21st      Century with a secure Social Security, strong Medicare and      needed investments in education.       Instead, we find ourselves facing the first impeachment      trial of a duly-elected President and only the second      impeachment trial of a sitting President in the history of      this country. We find ourselves in this situation due to the      poor judgment of the President, whose personal conduct was      inexcusable; the antics of a Special Prosecutor run amok; and      the political posturing of partisan House Republican leaders,      who misconstrued the constitutional role of the House and      advanced a take-it-or-leave it strategy of impeachment or      nothing. Each step of this unfortunate process has notably      lacked one important element: the exercise of sound judgment.       That is why the country has looked to the Senate to restore      political sanity to this process. The demand on us is not      simply to uphold the ``rule of law,'' about which the      Managers have repeatedly lectured us. Our oath requires far      more than the ministerial act of applying the law to the      facts or accepting blindly the facts and conclusions      presented by either side in this trial. We are required to      evaluate the facts, not in isolation, but in the context of      our precedent and the history of impeachments, and with our      focus always on what is good for the country. In short, we      are required to do what has been missing up to now: exercise      judgment, and do so in an impartial fashion. The beginning      point in this process must start with the President.     A. The President's Conduct       We can all agree that the President's conduct with a young      woman who was working in the White House was wrong. It was      also deeply disappointing, especially to those who know the      President and who support the many good things he has done      for this country and the world. His conduct in trying to keep      his inexcusable relationship secret from his wife and family,      his friends and associates, and from the public glare of a      politically-charged lawsuit, though understandable on a human      level, has had terrible consequences for him personally and      for the legacy of his presidency.       For me, one of the President's most regrettable actions was      his nationally-televised statement to the American people in      which he shook his finger and defiantly told us that the      allegations were untrue. Although not charged in the Articles      of Impeachment, that statement was intended to mislead the      American people with respect to the nature of his      relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. While I understand the      pressures that he was under at the time, that statement was      wrong. Although the President later apologized for his      actions, I feel very strongly that no President should      intentionally deceive the American people and I condemn him      for having done so.       Senator Bumpers reminded us of the human costs that have      been paid by this President and his family. The President has      admitted before a Federal grand jury terribly embarrassing      personal conduct and has seen a videotape of that grand jury      testimony broadcast to the entire nation, with excerpts      replayed over and over again. This modern day version of the      public stockade has been difficult to witness for those who      know this man and his family. His punishment has also taken      its financial toll. The underlying lawsuit has now been      settled and $850,000 paid on a case that initially sought      only $75,000 in compensatory damages--a case that the      District Court judge had dismissed for failing to state a      claim.       His presidency has been permanently tarnished by      impeachment. The Senate trial has provided a forum to replay      the embarrassing and humiliating facts of the President's      improper relationship. No one can say this President or his      presidency has emerged unscathed.     B. Special Prosecutor Starr       But the President's indiscretions and conduct did not alone      bring us to this point. Raising this matter to the level of a      constitutional impeachment only began with an investigation      and referral from Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr.       Justice Robert Jackson, when he was Attorney General in      1940, observed that the most dangerous power of the      prosecutor is the power to ``pick people that he thinks he      should get, rather than cases that need to be prosecuted.''      When this happens, he said, ``it is not a question of      discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for      the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the      man and then . . . putting investigators to work, to pin some      offense on him.'' ``It is here,'' he concluded, ``that law      enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime becomes that      of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group,      being attached to the wrong political views, or being      personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor      himself.''       In the case of President Clinton, things became personal a      long time ago. When Whitewater failed to produce, the      President's detractors began searching for a scandal.      ``Travelgate'' went nowhere. ``Filegate'' was another dead      end. Vincent Foster's tragic death was a suicide. Last      summer, it was reported that the Special Prosecutor had his      investigators scouring the countryside looking for women who      may have been intimate with Bill Clinton at some point over      the last several years. I spoke out then, noting my concern      and trying to sound a cautionary note that the permanent      investigation of the     President was taking yet another wrong turn.       Finally, after four years of fruitless investigations,      Special Prosecutor Starr renewed his acquaintance with Linda      Tripp and began the Monica Lewinsky phase of his      investigation. According to Mr. Starr, that contact with      Linda Tripp began on January 8, 1998, days before Ms.      Lewinsky had filed her affidavit in the Jones case and before      the President's deposition in that matter.\2\ As an officer      of the court, he could have immediately referred Ms. Tripp's      information to others with authority over such matters. But      he did not.       Most law enforcement authorities strive to prevent crimes      from occurring. Not so with Special Prosecutor Starr. He      engaged all the influence, power and authority he could      muster to get the President. He adopted Ms. Tripp as his      agent, arranged to provide her with immunity from      prosecution, and had her wear a wire and lunch with Monica      Lewinsky while surreptitiously recording her. He then tried      over an extended period of many hours to convince Ms.      Lewinsky to agree likewise surreptitiously to record      conversations and help him make a case against the President.       Does anyone recall after the past year of upheaval the      crimes the Special Prosecutor was seeking to find last      January? Recall that the ``talking points'' given to Ms.      Tripp by Ms. Lewinsky were supposed to be the ``smoking gun''      showing that the President was involved in a vast conspiracy      and cover-up to suborn perjury from Ms. Tripp. No one now      doubts Ms. Lewinsky's account that she, and she alone, wrote      the talking points based on her discussions with Ms. Tripp.      Moreover, no one now doubts that Ms. Lewinsky never even      discussed those talking points with the President, the      President's attorneys, the President's friend Vernon Jordan,      or anyone associated with the White House.       Also recall that Mr. Starr justified his pursuit of this      investigation based on Vernon Jordan helping Ms. Lewinsky      find a job in New York. His theory, as described in his      referral, was that Ms. Lewinsky was influenced to lie about      her relationship with the President through the assistance of      Mr. Jordan in finding her a job. Yet it was not the President      but Linda Tripp who, in early October 1997, first suggested      that Ms. Lewinsky move to New York and first discussed with      Ms. Lewinsky that she enlist Mr. Jordan's help with her New      York job search. Indeed, Linda Tripp's role in this scandal      is a pivotal one.       Fresh from conferring with Mr. Starr's investigators, armed      with promises of immunity from prosecution, Linda Tripp met      with the Jones lawyers on the eve of the President's      deposition and briefed them on the President's relationship      with Ms. Lewinsky. Even Mr. Starr eventually admitted that      his office could--and should--have kept ``better control'' of      Ms. Tripp.       A number of concerns have been raised about how this      investigation was initiated and conducted by the Special      Prosecutor, including whether Mr. Starr withheld material      information from the Attorney General when seeking to extend      his jurisdiction over the Lewinsky matter, whether he      concealed his prior consultations with the attorneys in the      Jones case, threatened a potential witness with the loss of      the custody of her child, and subpoenaed a minor at school. I      have also expressed my concern over the aggressiveness and      lack of prosecutorial discretion of his investigation in      requiring the testimony of mother against daughter, attorney      against client, and Secret Service protectors against      protectee--the latter raising serious security issues that      could jeopardize the future safety of presidents--and      requiring bookstores to disclose their customers' choice of      reading material.       Finally, the persistent and politically damaging leaks of      secret grand jury proceedings have tarnished Mr. Starr's      investigation and fueled concern over his partisanship.      Indeed, soon after he had been appointed as special      prosecutor, leaks from ``law enforcement sources'' about the      Whitewater investigation under his supervision prompted Mr.      Starr to confirm publicly his understanding of the grand jury      secrecy rules. He issued a press release on October 20, 1994,      pledging that the Office of Independent Counsel (``OIC'')      would ``abide by all of the obligations imposed upon us to      protect the integrity of the grand jury process and our      ethical obligations as professionals, including those      requiring the secrecy of our proceedings.''       Despite this pledge by Mr. Starr, a federal judge      determined in June 1998 that the evidence established a prima      facie case that Mr. Starr's office had violated federal      secrecy rules prohibiting attorneys for the government from      disclosing confidential grand jury material. A final      adjudication of the matter has not been made.       Then we come to the matter of the referral from Mr. Starr's      office. The Independent Counsel statute authorizes an      independent counsel to ``advise the House of Representatives      of any substantial and credible information . . . that may      constitute grounds for an impeachment.'' This provision      should not be construed to make an independent counsel the      House's Grand Inquisitor, nor to require an independent      counsel to become an advocate for impeachment. Rather, a      simple, straightforward delivery of the facts collected by      the independent counsel, unadorned by surmise, conjecture and      conspiracy theories is all that is authorized.       Nevertheless, Mr. Starr used this statutory authorization      as a springboard to advocate impeachment. His conduct stands      in stark contrast to that of the Special Prosecutor in      Watergate. As Georgetown University Law Professor Robert      Drinan, who served with distinction on the House Judiciary      Committee, observed last November in testimony before the      House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution:       ``It is noteworthy that in 1974, the Special Prosecutor      gave information and facts to the House Judiciary Committee.      He did not, however, recommend impeachment. He knew that the      power to recommend impeachment was committed solely to the      House of Representatives by the Constitution itself.''       I am not alone in questioning Mr. Starr's conduct and his      misinterpretation of his role. His own ethics advisor felt      compelled to resign his position after Mr. Starr appeared      before the House Judiciary Committee as the chief cheerleader      for impeachment.       Thereafter, Mr. Starr went from chief cheerleader to chief      ``talking head,'' making a lengthy television appearance on      the news show 20/20. This was only days after he told the      House Judiciary Committee, ``We [the OIC] go to court and not      on the talk-show circuit.'' In this regard, it bears mention      that Mr. Starr's public relations advisor and his highly      touted ``career prosecutors'' have also appeared on countless      talk shows over the past year.       Even during the Senate impeachment trial, Mr. Starr has      overstepped his proper role and intruded into the Senate's      prerogatives on how these proceedings should be conducted. In      effect, he became the chief prosecutor for impeachment. In      contravention of a unanimously adopted consent resolution on      how the trial would proceed, the Managers enlisted Mr.      Starr's help to force Monica Lewinsky to meet with them as      part of her immunity agreement. If she did not say the right      things, she subjected herself and her mother and father to      prosecution.       Press accounts make clear that while Mr. Starr's      representatives were allowed to attend the interview of Ms.      Lewinsky on January 24, 1999, neither the Senate nor the      President's counsel were extended such courtesy. This      collusive move between the Managers and Mr. Starr was unfair      to the President's counsel and contemptuous of the Senate,      which had resolved to defer the issue of witnesses until      later in the trial.       Mr. Starr's continued meddling during the Senate      impeachment trial has been roundly criticized by both      Democrats and Republicans. With his appetite whetted by one      weekend's interference with the Senate impeachment trial, the      very next weekend, on Sunday, January 31, 1999, Mr. Starr's      office leaked word to the New York Times that he had      determined he could indict a sitting President. Even the      House Managers balked at this interference, saying Mr.      Starr's latest leak was ``not helpful at all.''     C. The House Judiciary Committee       The next protagonist in this constitutional saga was the      House Judiciary Committee. In addition to the serious      substantive concerns raised by the way the Committee drafted      the Articles of Impeachment--which I will discuss later--the      Committee also made at least four critical procedural errors.       First, the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee      used the muscle of the majority to force its partisan will.      History tells us that, to be successful, impeachments must be      handled in a bipartisan manner. Chairman Henry Hyde himself      has observed on more than one occasion that bipartisanship is      crucial to any impeachment proceeding because a political,      partisan impeachment will not be trusted.       The Framers anticipated that impeachments might be driven      by partisanship rather than real demonstrations of guilt. The      distinguished historian Arthur M. Schlessinger, Jr., stressed      the need for bipartisanship in impeachment proceedings in his      testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the      Constitution on November 9, 1998, stating:       ``The Framers further believed that, if the impeachment      process is to acquire popular legitimacy, the bill of      particulars must be seen as impeachable by broad sections of      the electorate. The charges must be so grave and the evidence      for them so weighty that they persuade members of both      parties that removal must be considered. The Framers were      deeply fearful of partisan manipulation of the impeachment      process. . . . The domination of the impeachment process by      `faction' would in the view of the Framers deny the process      legitimacy.''       In the 24 years that I have had the honor of serving as a      United States Senator, there have been three impeachments,      all of Federal judges. Questions have been raised about how      our actions as a body and as individual Members in those      prior judicial impeachments should serve as precedent for      this impeachment trial. I will address the significant and      dispositive factual differences between these trials later,      but want to stress another significant difference: Those      three judicial impeachments were, from beginning to end,      handled in a bipartisan fashion. In each case, the House of      Representatives was unanimous, or nearly so, in voting to      impeach and there was strong bipartisan support in the Senate      to convict. Unfortunately, this was not the model followed in      the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.       Second, the Committee skirted the important threshold      question whether, as a matter of constitutional      interpretation, the accusations set out in Mr. Starr's      referral stated a sufficient basis to justify the President's      impeachment and removal. Despite the concurrence of over 800      historians and constitutional scholars that no impeachable      offenses     had been alleged, the majority on the House Judiciary      Committee never questioned Mr. Starr's initial judgment that      the President had committed impeachable offenses. Had the      Committee addressed itself to this issue at the start, a      factual inquiry may have been unnecessary.       Third, having avoided this threshold issue, the Committee      then failed to conduct an independent fact-finding inquiry,      as it was instructed to do by House Resolution 581. This      resolution, adopted on October 8, 1998, directed the      Committee ``to investigate fully and completely whether      sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives''      to impeach the President. For making such investigation, the      resolution authorized the Committee to issue subpoenas for      the attendance and testimony of any person, to take      depositions of potential witnesses, to require the production      of documents and other things, and to issue interrogatories.       House Resolution 581 was patterned from the resolution      adopted by the House in February 1974, directing the      Judiciary Committee to investigate President Nixon. That      Committee spent almost five months gathering its own evidence      and hearing testimony from multiple witnesses before debating      and voting to adopt articles of impeachment.       By contrast, the House Judiciary Committee in 1998 relied      entirely on the referral of Special Prosecutor Starr. The      Committee called not a single witness with first-hand      knowledge of the facts to testify about the matters contained      in Mr. Starr's referral. The Committee instead relied on the      one-sided testimony procured by Mr. Starr's lieutenants in      the grand jury. Though this testimony was under oath, it      certainly was not tested by cross-examination nor was the      Special Prosecutor's office interested in any information      that might have been exculpatory to the President.       The most probative testimony by Ms. Lewinsky before the      grand jury, for example, about no one asking her to lie or      promising her a job, was elicited by a diligent grand juror.      Yet another startling omission of exculpatory information      from Mr. Starr's referral was only discovered during the      Senate deposition of Ms. Lewinsky. She testified in response      to Manager Bryant's inquiry about whether the President told      her she should turn the gifts over to the Jones lawyers that      she had previously told Mr. Starr's agents that the President      saying, ``Well, you have to turn over whatever you have,''      sounded familiar to her.       Nevertheless, the House Judiciary Committee gave a standing      ovation to this Special Prosecutor, who misconstrued his      statutory role on advising the House and who failed the most      basic of a prosecutor's duties to be fair and to disclose      exculpatory information in his possession.       Fourth and finally, the House Judiciary Committee minimized      the constitutional role of the House in the impeachment      process. The Committee erroneously relegated the House to the      role of mere ``accuser'', leaving to the Senate the heavier      responsibility of determining whether the conduct at issue      warranted removal of the President. Chairman Hyde said, on      September 11, 1998, at the beginning of the House impeachment      process, ``We are acting as a grand jury . . . we are      operating as a grand jury.''       This view persisted during the House floor debate on the      Articles of Impeachment against President Clinton. Manager      Buyer told his colleagues that the House served ``the grand      jury function.'' Yet another House Member said, ``the role of      the House and our duty to the American people is to act      simply as a grand jury in reference to the impeachment      charges presented.'' This erroneous view of the role of the      House of Representatives in the impeachment process has      persisted even in this trial, with one Manager telling us      that the House of Representatives ``operates much more like a      grand jury than a petit jury.''       Having incorrectly analogized its role to that of a grand      jury, the House then applied a grand jury ``probable cause"      standard in reviewing the evidence. Manager Barr confirmed      this mistake, stating, ``the House performed admirably in      essentially reaching the conclusion that there is probable      cause to convict the President of perjury and obstruction of      justice.'' Manager Hyde likewise described the House as      having ``a lower threshold . . . which is to seek a trial in      the Senate.''       Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe warned House      Republicans against misinterpreting and minimizing their      constitutional impeachment role. He testified before the      House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution that, ``the      fallacy is that this is not, despite the loose analogies that      some invoke, not like a grand jury.'' His warning went      unheeded.       Minimizing the House's role has had serious consequences.      It explains why the majority in the House Judiciary Committee      forfeited the opportunity and shirked its responsibility to      conduct any independent examination of the facts. The House's      constitutional responsibility for charging the President      should not be misinterpreted to justify applying only a grand      jury's ``probable cause'' standard of proof.       It also amounted to giving the House a ``free vote'' since      they could duck any responsibility for actually removing the      President. On the contrary, House Members who vote to impeach      should also be convinced this President has so abused the      public trust and so threatens the public that he should be      removed. Sending impeachment articles to the Senate means      exactly what the articles say: That based on the evidence      reviewed by the House, the President has committed acts      warranting his conviction and removal.       Even some Republican Members of the House who voted for      impeachment admitted, belatedly, in a letter to the Senate      Majority Leader that they did not mean it. They said they      actually did not want this President removed and urged the      Senate to consider censure.       In spite of what the House Manager's believe, the      impeachment process is not a ``cause.'' It should not be      about partisan political pique or about sending a message.      Rather, along with the power to declare war, it is one of the      gravest constitutional responsibility of the Congress. This      impeachment asks the question whether the conduct charged in      the Articles of Impeachment passed by the House require the      Senate to override the judgment of the American people and      remove from office the person they elected to serve as      President.       That is what the impeachment process is all about--removal      from office. It is the Constitution's fail-safe device. It is      not to be undertaken lightly or without justification for it      has serious consequences.       We suffered a lengthy Senate impeachment trial because      House Republicans misinterpreted their constitutional role.      House Republican leaders mistakenly relegated the House to a      limited role, depreciated the function of impeachment and      expressly left to the Senate responsibility for reviewing the      charges and determining whether the charges warrant the      President's removal from office. Articles of Impeachment are      simply not an appropriate vehicle for the expression of      political disapproval to be punted by a partisan vote in the      House to the Senate for some face-saving compromise verdict.       Not surprisingly, given their misinterpretation of their      own role, the first ruling that the Chief Justice was called      upon to make in this trial was to correct the Managers'      mischaracterization of the role of the Senate. The Chief      Justice sustained Senator Harkin's objection and corrected      the Managers, stating, ``the Senate is not simply a jury; it      is a court in this case. Therefore counsel should refrain      from referring to the Senators as jurors.''     D. Vote by the House of Representatives       Proceedings in the full House were themselves a sorry      spectacle. On December 19, 1998, a lame duck session of the      House of Representatives approved two Articles of Impeachment      against President Clinton on the slimmest of partisan      margins.       1. Lame Duck House       The two Articles of Impeachment now before the Senate were      decided by the votes of a handful of Members who were      defeated in the November election or are no longer serving.      Article I passed with an 11-vote margin, which is the number      of House Republicans replaced by Democrats in the new      Congress due to election defeats and retirements. Article III      (now Article II in the Senate) passed with only a 5-vote      margin, which is the number of House Republicans who lost      their reelections in November and were replaced by Democrats.      There is no record of any prior impeachment reaching the      Senate on so slim a margin.       The House Republican leadership pressed an extreme, all-or-     nothing action through a lame duck House without allowing an      opportunity to vote on a censure or other alternative.       Those who claim that censure is unconstitutional are just      plain wrong. There is ample historical precedent for censure.      Both the House and the Senate have adopted resolutions      expressing disapproval of various individuals, including      sitting Presidents. The Senate censured Andrew Jackson in      1834; the House censured James Buchanan in 1860. As early as      1800, with ``Founding Fathers'' then serving in Congress, the      House debated a resolution to censure John Adams, though this      resolution was ultimately rejected.       Perhaps it should not be surprising that the final votes in      the divisive speakership of Newt Gingrich set the Congress      and the nation on this course. Mr. Starr's investigation has      dragged on for five years, with no end in sight. The entire      House impeachment inquiry lasted a short three months. Why      the sudden push to bring this matter to the floor? There were      at least five good reasons-- the five seats that the      Republicans had lost in the election--which might have      altered the outcome on at least one Article of Impeachment.      The sixth reason is also clear: Speaker Gingrich had said he      was resigning from the House, and his seat would be vacant      when the new House convened.       An impeachment resolution supported by only one political      party against a twice-elected incumbent of the opposing party      is divisive and damaging for the country. During Watergate,      constitutional scholar Charles L. Black, Jr., wrote that a      close vote along party lines ``would go to the Senate      tainted, or at least suspicious, and would be unlikely to      satisfy the country, because party motives would be      suspected.'' The impeachment of a President must be      bipartisan. A partisan impeachment cannot command the respect      of the American people. It is no more valid than a stolen      election.       House Republicans have permanently marked this President as      impeached, but I do not believe that history will judge them      kindly either. Instead, the manner in which these impeachment      proceedings were conducted in the House Committee on the      Judiciary and in the full House of Representatives will serve      as a model of mistakes that should be avoided in the future.       2. Rejected Charges       In the end, the House did not approve the 11 articles      recommended by Special Prosecutor Starr or the 15 articles of      impeachment recommended by the Republican Committee staff.      The House rejected outright two of the four articles reported      along party lines by the House Judiciary Committee, and      authorized Managers to exhibit only two Articles of      Impeachment in the Senate. In considering these two Articles,      the Senate has been forced to sort through what is left of      the allegations against the President in light of the matters      rejected by the House.                          III. SECRET EVIDENCE       Before the vote, press reports indicated that wavering      House Members were escorted by Republican House Judiciary      Members to review certain ``secret evidence'' that the      President's counsel had never been allowed to review or given      an opportunity to rebut.       That action was fundamentally unfair. A bedrock principle      of our system of justice is that the prosecutor, not the      accused, has the burden of proof. The accused is presumed      innocent unless and until adequate proof of guilt is      presented. Such proof may take many forms--direct or      circumstantial, testamentary or physical. But whatever form      it takes, it must be introduced, admitted into evidence, and      subject to examination and inspection before it may be      considered by the fact finders.       I note that in 1974, the House Judiciary Committee made      available to President Nixon and his counsel all the      documents and other material considered by the Committee,      whether in executive or open session. In short, during the      House Judiciary Committee's investigation of Watergate, there      was no secret evidence and President Nixon and his counsel      were allowed to see--fully and completely--every item of      evidence in the possession of the House Judiciary Committee.       As both a judge and juror in the Senate, I take seriously      my responsibility to ensure that the Senate's consideration      of these Articles of Impeachment is fair. Part of that      fairness requires that the only evidence we consider relates      to the Articles actually approved by the House--not what the      House refused to charge and not matters that are not charged      by the Articles of Impeachment. During the depositions      authorized by the majority in the Senate, I and the other      Presiding Officers from both parties stood firm on this      principle and insisted that the Managers' questions remain      focused on the subject matters already in the Senate record      and on the Articles before us.       Certain House Republicans suggested before this trial began      that Senators should review the ``secret evidence'' as part      of their deliberative processes. This suggestion was first      advanced at about the time that the ``secret evidence'' began      leaking to the press. From what I have read about it, it      seems as flimsy as it is inflammatory, and completely      irrelevant to any issue now before the Senate. Clearly,      Senators should not allow themselves to be influenced by      shady accusations and innuendo that would be excluded from      any judicial proceeding in the land. Consideration of the      Articles must be based on only one record--the trial record--     and evidence that is not admitted at trial must play no part      in our deliberations.       I should note that the House Managers have selectively      tried to keep secret certain unfavorable evidence elicited      during the Senate trial. For example, they argued strenuously      and successfully to subpoena witnesses for depositions and      for permission to introduce parts of those depositions into      evidence. The parts they introduced do not, as the Legal      Times pointed out ``tell the whole story.''       As one of the Presiding Officers at those depositions, I am      well aware of the parts of those depositions intentionally      omitted by the Managers. In fact, following their      presentation of the evidence obtained from the depositions, I      asked unanimous consent that the record be made complete and      include Vernon Jordan's brief remarks at the end of his      deposition, ``defending his own integrity.'' There is no      question but that the Managers attacked and impugned Mr.      Jordan's word and his integrity. Senator Boxer echoed this      unanimous consent request at the conclusion of the Managers'      rebuttal presentation. Due to Republican objections, however,      neither request was accepted and, unfortunately, the Senate      trial record does not contain that moving and important part      of Mr. Jordan's deposition.                 IV. THE ARTICLES ARE UNFAIRLY DRAFTED       Close examination of the Articles exhibited by the Managers      reflects the underlying unfairness in the impeachment      proceedings in the House.     A. Article I is Defectively Vague       Article I is drafted with such vague accusations, a      significant question arises whether Senators can responsibly      and constitutionally pass judgment on it.       The notion that William Jefferson Clinton committed perjury      before the Starr grand jury has been a legal conclusion in      search of a basis for some time. In his referral to the House      of Representatives, Special Prosecutor Starr urged only three      allegations of possible perjury before the grand jury as      grounds for seeking to remove the President. Article I merges      those three allegations into one generalized allegation that      President Clinton gave false testimony ``as to the nature and      details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.'' In addition,      the House Judiciary Committee has joined three additional      categories of allegedly false testimony, without specifying      the allegedly perjurious statements. Those additional      categories cover statements that the President made or      allowed his attorney to make during the Jones case, in spite      of the fact that a majority of the House of Representatives      rejected such statements as a basis for a separate article of      impeachment.       Since the outset of the Senate trial, the charges of grand      jury perjury have continued to be a moving target. In their      initial Trial Brief, the Managers alluded to 26 instances of      grand jury perjury. Manager Rogan spoke of 34 instances. In      their Reply Brief, the Managers tallied up 48 instances of      grand jury perjury.       Yet, Article I does not identify a single statement before      the grand jury that the House of Representatives alleges to      have been perjurious, false and misleading. All the Senate is      told in Article I is that the allegedly perjurious statements      fall into ``one or more'' of four broad categories. This is      wholly inconsistent with criminal law and Senate standards      for identifying perjury.       First, requiring the President to defend himself against      such an unspecified charge is fundamentally unfair. Vague,      generalized charges of perjury, such as the charge now before      the Senate, would never hold up in a court of law. Under      federal law, a perjury indictment must set forth the precise      falsehood alleged and the factual basis of its falsity with      sufficient clarity to permit a jury to determine its      veracity. The Justice Department's manual for Federal      prosecutors acknowledges this basic principle of law.       This is not just a technical matter of proper, lawyerly      pleading. It is a matter of fundamental fairness and due      process. As the respondent in this proceeding, the President      has been denied the basic fairness of having clear notice of      the specific charges against him and of knowing in advance of      the trial precisely what the House of Representatives accuses      him of having done that merits removing him from the office      to which the people of the United States have twice elected      him.       Providing specificity in perjury articles has been the      practice in past impeachments. Two prior impeachments before      the Senate, both of Federal judges, involved perjury charges.      In both instances, the House of Representatives identified      each alleged falsehood in a separate Article of Impeachment.      In the case of Judge Alcee Hastings, 14 of the Articles      alleged that he had committed perjury with respect to a      different specific statement. In the case of Judge Walter      Nixon, two of the Articles alleged perjury, again, each with      respect to a single discrete statement.       This time, however, the House of Representatives chose to      be unacceptably vague. Republicans on the House Judiciary      Committee flatly refused to pin themselves down to specific      statements in the resolution they drafted or in their      Committee debate. In fact, the only change the House      Judiciary Committee made to Article I had the effect of      making it even more ambiguous and obscure: They amended it to      allege that the President testified falsely as to ``one or      more'' of the four categories, rather than all of them. By so      doing, they have undermined the basic fairness of these      proceedings.       Second, the lack of specificity in Article I makes it      impossible to know whether the requisite majority of the      House of Representatives agreed that any specific statement      was perjurious. To impeach President Clinton under Article I,      House Members had only to find that he made one or more of an      unspecified number of unspecified false statements, broadly      categorized. Accordingly, it is impossible to know whether      the House properly exercised its exclusive, constitutional      power of impeachment.       If there are 3, 4, 7, 34 or possibly 48 allegations of      perjury, but only one vote by the House, how can the Senate      be sure, how can the President be sure, and, most      importantly, how can the American people be sure that a      majority of the House agreed on any single allegation of      perjury? Only a narrow majority of 228 members of the prior      House of Representatives voted in favor of Article I. If as      few as 11 members of that slim majority did not agree on      which of the 3 to 48 perjury allegations were to be forwarded      to the Senate, that Article did not have the support of a      majority of the House and should not be considered by the      Senate.       Third, the lack of specificity makes any Senate vote for      conviction on Article I similarly constitutionally suspect.      If, as the Managers' Reply Brief indicates, there are 48      separate allegations of perjurious statements by the      President before the grand jury, then as few as two Senators      could believe any particular allegation of perjury had been      established and the Senate as a whole could nonetheless      convict and remove the President--so long as enough other      pairs of Senators thought alternative allegations were      established. This falls far short of the two-thirds of the      Senate required to concur before a President is removed from      office.       The Managers ignore the grave constitutional questions      raised by the vagueness of Article I presented to the House      and now to the Senate for a vote. Instead they defend the      fairness of this Article by asserting that if President      Clinton had suffered from any lack of specificity, he could      have filed a motion in the Senate for a bill of particulars.      \10\ Just as the Managers had to be corrected by the Chief      Justice about the role of the Senate, they also overestimate      their power to detail the particulars of the conduct      underlying Article I.       The Constitution vests the sole power of impeachment in the      House of Representatives, not in a handful of managers      appointed by that body. Just as prosecutors may not save a      defective indictment without usurping the constitutional role      of the grand jury, these Managers may not save a defective      bill of impeachment without usurping the constitutional role      of the full House. Put another way, 13 Members may not take      it upon themselves to guess what was in the minds of over 200      Members of the 105th Congress when they voted to impeach the      President. The full House must pass on any amendments to the      Articles.       That is how it has always been done. In 1933, for example,      impeached judge Harold Louderback moved the Senate to require      the House to make one of its articles ``more definite and      certain.'' In that instance, the Managers wisely consented to      the motion. An amendment to the articles was then approved by      the full House and presented to the Senate.       Similarly, in the case of Judge Nixon, it was the House of      Representatives that amended its articles in light of      evidence presented during the Senate proceedings. That      amendment was made to correct the text of one of the      statements that the House alleged to be false.       The Managers do not have the power to make the Article more      specific, nor have they tried. Instead, they have exploited      the vagueness in Article I by continuing to add to the litany      of alleged falsehoods by the President. Any advantage gained      by the House Managers by purposely crafting Article I in this      vague fashion diminishes the fairness of the entire      proceeding.     B. Both Articles Charge Multiple Offenses       Both of the Articles before us allege that the President      committed ``one or more'' of a laundry list of misdeeds. In      fact, as I already mentioned, Article I was specifically      amended in Committee to use this ``one or more'' formulation.      Manager Rogan tried to spin this as ``a technical amendment      only,'' but it was obviously much more.       With this amendment, Article I not only fails to identify a      single allegedly perjurious statement, it fails even to      identify a single broad category of statements. It lists four      broad categories that could allude to virtually every word      the President said before the grand jury and says, in effect,      take your pick. If you think he said something, anything,      that was not true, then vote to convict. Article II, which      lumps together seven alleged acts of obstruction, does the      same.       Manager McCollum treated the decision Senators must make on      Article I like a choice diners would make from a Chinese      take-out menu: chose some from column A and, if you like,      some from column B. He explained that Senators could vote to      remove the President if ``you conclude he committed the      crimes that he is alleged to have committed--not every one of      them necessarily, but certainly a good quantity, and there      are a whole bunch of them that have been charged.''       The Senate has made clear that it expects precision in      articles of impeachment. In the last two impeachments, of      Judges Hastings and Nixon, the House tacked on an omnibus or      ``catchall'' charge that included all the others. I and other      Senators expressed concern with this blunderbuss approach.      During the Hastings proceedings, I specifically asked whether      the catchall Article could be interpreted as requiring a      finding of guilt as to all the allegations in order to      convict. By asking the question, I hoped to avoid the      constitutional problem that I just described, of conviction      based on less than a two-thirds vote. The Presiding Officer      ruled that a Senator would be within his right to interpret      the Article as I proposed, but expressed the view that a      Senator could vote guilty based on any one of the alleged      acts of misconduct. Ultimately, the Senate rejected the      omnibus Articles against Judges Hastings and Nixon, while      convicting them of more specific charges of perjury.       Articles of impeachment that contain multiple allegations      are troubling in several respects. First, they make it      virtually impossible for the impeached person to prepare an      adequate defense. Second, they permit the House to impeach,      and the Senate to convict, based on less than the majority or      super majority vote required by the Constitution. Third, they      allow individual Members to avoid accountability to the      American people, who may never know exactly which charges      their representatives regarded as proven and warranting      removal from office.       President Kennedy, in Profiles in Courage, described the      omnibus Article against President Andrew Johnson as a      ``deliberately obscure conglomeration of all the charges in      the preceding Articles, which had been designed . . . to      furnish a common ground for those who favored conviction but      were unwilling to identify themselves on the basic issues.''      The House Managers in the Johnson case called for the first      vote to be on that deliberately obscure Article because it      was thought to be the easiest way to get a conviction.      Today's Managers are hoping that this tactic works better in      1999 than it did in 1868, when President Johnson was      acquitted.       But impeachment is not a shell game. Deliberate obfuscation      trivializes what should be a grave and solemn process.       In 1989, after the Senate rejected the omnibus Article      against Judge Nixon, then Minority Leader Bob Dole and others      urged the House to stop bunching up its allegations and, from      there on out, to charge each act of wrongdoing in a separate      article. The House has unfortunately chosen to ignore this      plea in this matter of historic importance, contrary to      fundamental notions of fairness, proper notice, and justice.                          V. THE SENATE'S DUTY       The Senate does not sit as an impeachment court in a      vacuum. The fairness of the process by which the Articles      reached the Senate, and the specificity and care with which      the Articles are drafted to identify the charges fairly to      the respondent, are significant considerations in deciding      whether to vote for conviction or acquittal. Senators are not      merely serving as petit jurors who will be instructed on the      law by a judge and are asked to find facts. Senators have a      greater role and a greater responsibility in this trial. The      Senate is the court in this case, as the Chief Justice      properly observed. Our job is to do justice and be fair in      this matter and to protect the Constitution.       In casting our final votes on the Articles we should be      clear about the questions that our votes answer and equally      clear about the questions not before us. The question is not      whether Bill Clinton has suffered, for surely he has as a      result of his conduct, nor whether he has suffered enough.      The question is not even whether Bill Clinton should be      punished and sent to jail on a criminal charge, for the      Constitution does not confer that authority on this court of      impeachment.       This vote only and necessarily requires addressing the      following questions: has the conduct charged in each Article      been proven to my satisfaction; and, if so, does the charged      conduct amount to a high crime or high misdemeanor warranting      the President's conviction and removal from the office to      which he was elected by the American people in 1996. I will      address each of these questions in turn.     A. Standard of Proof       In this impeachment trial, the President starts out with      fewer rights than any criminal defendant in any court in this      country. He starts out with no clear rules of evidence,      conviction based on a mere two-thirds vote, rather than a      unanimous verdict required for any criminal conviction, and      no higher court of appeal. This makes the obligation imposed      by our oath to make this process fair and impartial that much      more important.       Fulfilling our duty in the impeachment trial involves      evaluating the evidence presented by the Managers and the      President to determine whether the allegations have been      proven. Juries in legal cases are asked to evaluate evidence      presented according to a specific ``standard of proof.'' The      Constitution is silent on the standard of proof to be applied      in impeachment trials, and the Senate has refused to bind      itself to a single standard for all impeachments. As a      result, each Senator may follow the burden of proof he or she      believes is appropriate to determine whether the House's      charges have been adequately proven.       The fact that each Senator may evaluate the evidence under      any standard of proof of their choice presents a remarkable      challenge to the Managers and to the President's counsel. One      commentator has noted that, ``this practice can often work .      . . to the disadvantage of all the participants in an      impeachment trial by precluding them from knowing in advance      what standard the Senate will actually apply.''       The standard of proof in criminal proceedings is ``beyond a      reasonable doubt'' and in civil proceedings is generally ``a      preponderance of the evidence.'' An impeachment trial is      neither a civil or criminal proceeding, leading some      commentators to suggest that ``a hybrid of the criminal and      civil burdens of proof may be desirable. . . . Too lenient a      proof standard would allow the Senate to impose the serious      punishments for impeachment `even though substantial doubt of      guilt remained.' Too rigid a standard might allow an official      to remain in office even though the entire Senate was      convinced he or she had committed an impeachable offense.''       The fact that the Senate has adopted no uniform standard of      proof for each Member to follow is not for lack of attention.      The Senate considered the standard of proof question when      impeachment proceedings against President Nixon were      contemplated, but adopted none. Thereafter, a member of the      Watergate impeachment inquiry staff, now a professor of law,      concluded that the standard of proof in impeachment trials      will vary with the seriousness of the charges:       If a president were charged with conduct amounting to      treason, for example, it seems highly unlikely that a senator      would insist on proof of treason beyond a reasonable doubt      before he would vote for the president's removal from office.      . . . On the other hand, a greater quantum of proof might be      required for less flagrant wrongdoing.       More recently, in 1986, Judge Harry Claiborne moved to      establish ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' as the standard of      proof at his impeachment trial. The Senate rejected that      motion by a 17 to 75 vote. I joined those Members voting      against adoption of a uniform standard of proof because I      believe, as the Presiding Officer made clear at the time,      that in fulfilling his or her oath each Senator is free to      apply any standard of proof, including reasonable doubt.       The charges here stem from alleged efforts by the President      to conceal a personal inappropriate relationship. While the      relationship itself may be fair game for public rebuke and      censure, only when questions were raised about whether his      conduct crossed the     line into criminal activity did this matter become the      subject of an impeachment inquiry. Indeed, Manager McCollum      argued that the President must not be convicted and removed      from office except upon a finding that he committed a crime.      Fairness dictates that we use the exacting standard of proof      that is used--and that is constitutionally mandated--in      criminal trials.       I note that Majority Leader Trent Lott reached the same      conclusion 25 years ago, as a young Member of the House      Judiciary Committee considering articles of impeachment      against President Nixon. He joined other Republican Members      in writing:       ``Because of the fundamental similarity between an      impeachment trial and an ordinary criminal trial . . . the      standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is appropriate in      both proceedings. Moreover, the gravity of an impeachment      trial and its potentially drastic consequences are additional      reasons for requiring a rigorous standard of proof. This is      especially true in the case of a presidential impeachment. .      . . The removal of a President by impeachment in mid-term . .      . should not be too easy of accomplishment, for it      contravenes the will of the electorate. In providing for a      fixed four-year term, not subject to interim votes of No      Confidence, the Framers indicated their preference for      stability in the executive. That stability should not be      jeopardized except on the strongest possible proof of      presidential wrongdoing.''       Were the President accused of treason or serious public      corruption, the best interests of the Nation might well      demand a somewhat lower standard. He is not, however, accused      of such crimes. We hundred Senators are stand-ins for over a      quarter billion Americans. President Clinton has been twice      elected to his office, and we should only undo that choice      based on the charges before us on proof tested against the      highest standard. Under the circumstances, in evaluating the      evidence that could result in the impeachment and removal of      the President of the United States, I will use the highest      standard of proof used in any court of law in this country,      that is, proof beyond a reasonable doubt.     B. The Charges Have Not Been Proven       I do not believe that the Managers proved their case beyond      a reasonable doubt. To reach their conclusions, they had to      tease inculpatory inferences from exculpatory evidence and      generally view the record in the most sinister light      possible. Having taken an oath to do impartial justice, my      vote must be based on the evidence in the record, not on      speculation and surmise.       1. Article I       The record does not come close to supporting the      allegations in Article I. Perjury is a complex charge,      requiring more than just lying or even lying under oath. To      constitute perjury, a lie must be both material and willful.      Lying under oath about trivial or inconsequential matters,      even if willful, is not a crime. Lying under oath as a result      of confusion, mistake or faulty memory, even if about      material matters, is also not a crime. In addition, there is      no crime of perjury where a witness's answers are literally      true, even if unresponsive, misleading or false by negative      implication.       The American people saw President Clinton's grand jury      testimony when the videotape was made public by the House      Judiciary Committee. We saw him admit that:       He had engaged in wrongful conduct;       He had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky on numerous occasions;       His inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky lasted      over a two-year period;       Many of their encounters involved inappropriate intimate      contact; and       He had given her a number of gifts.       Given these admissions, the Managers had a heavy burden to      prove that the President testified falsely about any material      matter.       Perhaps for this reason, the Managers repackaged the three      alleged falsehoods identified by the Special Prosecutor in      their Senate presentation. In their Reply Brief, the Managers      claimed that the President perjured himself no less than 48      times during his grand jury appearance. They hoped that the      sheer number of allegations would overcome the essential      triviality of each individual charge. It does not.       In this regard, the most remarkable charge leveled by the      Managers is that the President's prepared statement, in which      he made his many admissions, was itself perjurious. The      President said that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky      ``began as a friendship''; Ms. Lewinsky disagreed, although      she allowed for the possibility that the President had a      different perception of how the relationship had evolved.  The President said that the inappropriate intimate contacts occurred in early 1996 and 1997; Ms. Lewinsky claimed the contacts began on November 15, 1995. The President described being alone with Ms. Lewinsky only on ``certain occasions,'' and described their telephone conversations as ``occasional''; there is nothing in the record to the contrary. Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky used the same term to describe these events, since a few dozen meetings or telephone conversations over a two-year period may appropriately be described as ``occasional''.       Such allegations trivialize the serious business in which      we are now engaged. Can anyone really believe that the      President should be removed from office because of a six-week      discrepancy as to when his admittedly inappropriate affair      began? Or because of general statements that are allegedly      contrary to specific numbers? Or because he did not inform      the grand jury that the relationship began with a crude      sexual overture by Ms. Lewinsky, as she herself was compelled      to describe in humiliating detail, at the whim of the Special      Prosecutor's inquisitors and for no legitimate investigatory      purpose?       Another set of statements that the Managers consider      perjurious relate to the President's state of mind. The      Managers claim, without support, that the President did not      genuinely believe, for example, that Ms. Lewinsky could file      a truthful affidavit that might relieve her of having to      testify in the Jones case. Such unsupported speculation about      what was in the President's mind is not, as the President's      counsel stated, ``the stuff or fuel of a perjury      prosecution.''       Asked to identify which of the President's statements were      of particular importance to the perjury charge, Manager Rogan      pointed to the President's explanations for his attorney      Robert Bennett's statement, during the Jones deposition, that      Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit showed there ``is'' no sex of any      kind. Never mind that, in general, a person cannot be held      criminally liable for false statements or representations by      the person's counsel to a judge or magistrate.       Manager Rogan first took issue with the President's      argument that the statement at issue was technically accurate      because his intimate contact with Ms. Lewinsky had been over      for many months. While the President has been derided for      legal hairsplitting over ``what the meaning of `is' is,'' no      amount of derision can transform this sort of argumentative      testimony into a perjurious statement.       The President also testified that he had not paid much      attention to what his attorney was saying and, indeed, did      not focus on it until months after the deposition, when he      read the transcript in preparation for his grand jury      appearance. The Managers assert that the President was paying      attention, and they base this on the President's blank stare      at the time in question. How can we possibly know, from that,      what was going on in his mind?       Appreciating the weakness of their assertion, the Managers      obtained an affidavit from Barry W. Ward, law clerk to the      presiding judge in the Jones suit, and submitted it with      their motion to expand the record. Mr. Ward's affidavit      states that when he attended the deposition of President      Clinton in that case, he ``observed President Clinton looking      directly at Mr. Bennett while this statement was being      made.'' The Managers used this statement to argue in their      motion brief, at p. 21, that ``Mr. Ward's declaration proves      that Mr. Ward saw President Clinton listening attentively      while the exchange between Mr. Bennett and the presiding      Judge occurred.'' According to a Legal Times report on      February 1, 1999, Mr. Ward ``vigorously disputes that      interpretation.'' Contrary to the Managers' assertion, Mr.      Ward stated in a subsequent interview that, ``I have no idea      if he was paying attention. He could have been thinking about      policy initiatives, for all I know.''       The only explanation for the misleading characterization of      Mr. Ward's affidavit in the Managers' motion brief is the      same one offered by Senator Bumpers to explain yet another      unsupported inference asserted by the Managers. He said, ``I      am a trial lawyer and I will tell you what it is: it is      wanting to win too badly.''       As a former prosecutor, one of the questions I have asked      myself is whether, based on these facts, criminal charges of      perjury or obstruction of justice would have been brought      against any person other than the President of the United      States. If William Jefferson Clinton were Billy Blythe or      Bill Jones, would any prosecutor in the country have      successfully brought such charges? Experienced prosecutors,      Republican and Democratic, testified before the House      Judiciary Committee that no prosecutor would have proceeded      based on the record compiled by Mr. Starr. I agree and note      that during the course of these Senate proceedings, the case      has only gotten weaker.     2. Article II       The same is true of Article II, which charges the President      with obstruction of justice. The Managers repeatedly urged      Senators to look at ``the big picture,'' view the evidence as      a whole, and not to get ``hung up'' on the details. This is      lawyer-speak for, ``my case does withstand scrutiny.''       To begin with, the principal witnesses to the President's      alleged scheme to obstruct justice testified that there was      no such scheme. Monica Lewinsky has clearly and consistently      maintained that no one ever asked or encouraged her to lie,      and that she was never promised a job for her silence. Betty      Currie, the President's secretary, and Vernon Jordan, a      distinguished attorney, also exonerated the President of any      wrongdoing or any conspiracy with them to obstruct justice.      For example, Ms. Currie testified that the President did not      ask her on December 28, 1997, or at any time, to obtain and      hide gifts he had given Ms. Lewinsky, and Mr. Jordan      testified that his involvement in Ms. Lewinsky's job search      was unrelated to any participation by Ms. Lewinsky in the      now-settled Jones case. The Managers argue that such      exculpatory testimony ``may well take on a sinister, or even      criminal connotation when observed in the context of the      whole plot,'' but I fail to see why exculpatory testimony      cannot be viewed for what it is: exculpatory.       The Managers do their best to transmogrify other      exculpatory testimony into evidence of criminality. For      example, Ms. Lewinsky testified that the President declined      to review her affidavit before she signed it and did not      discuss the content of the affidavit with her ``at all,      ever.'' Manager Rogan cited this as evidence of obstruction      on the theory that the President would have reviewed the      affidavit if he really believed it could be truthful. In case      we rejected this theory, Manager McCollum speculated that the      President had reviewed 15 prior drafts of the affidavit--     speculation at odds with Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that she      did not show the President her affidavit in final or draft      form. But neither Mr. Rogan's theory nor Mr. McCollum's      speculation can overcome or obscure the fundamentally      exculpatory nature of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony on this point.      Indeed, if the President had reviewed or discussed Ms.      Lewinsky's affidavit, the Managers would doubtless have      trumpeted the incident as proof positive of obstruction.       Unable to conjure inculpatory evidence out of the      President's refusal to review Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, the      Managers invited the Senate to infer guilt from the ``fact''      that it was the President, not Ms. Lewinsky, who benefitted      from the filing of her affidavit. Manager Bryant went      further, arguing that Ms. Lewinsky ``had no motivation, no      reason whatsoever'' to want to avoid testifying in the Jones      case. But when Manager Bryant questioned Ms. Lewinsky on this      point, she corrected him:       ``Q. [Y]ou didn't file the affidavit for your best      interest, did you?       ``A. Uh, actually, I did.       ``Q. To avoid testifying.       ``A. Yes.''       This testimony should have come as no surprise, since most      people would want to avoid the time, expense, and      embarrassment of being dragged into a civil lawsuit to      testify about their private affairs. Moreover, Ms. Lewinsky      had already made clear that she had sought to conceal her      relationship with the President in a vain attempt to avoid      being ``humiliated in front of the entire world.'' On her own      initiative, she devised code names for use when communicating      with the President's secretary; deleted correspondence from      her computer and urged Linda Tripp to do the same; and      composed false and misleading ``talking points'' for Ms.      Tripp to use in the Jones case. In fact, Ms. Lewinsky was      admittedly ``so desperate'' for Linda Tripp not to reveal      anything about the relationship that she ``used anything and      anybody that [she] could think of as leverage with her.''       Equally unavailing was the Managers' insistence that the      President must have known Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit would be      false because no truthful affidavit could have saved her from      having to testify. Both the President and Ms. Lewinsky      testified that, in their view, it was possible to craft a      truthful affidavit that might have accomplished this      objective. The Managers have never explained why we should      not credit this unrebutted testimony.       The Managers have stretched the facts in other ways as      well, most notably with respect to the timing of Ms.      Lewinsky's job search. In their Trial Brief, in their opening      presentations, and in their charts, the Managers posited that      Mr. Jordan intensified his efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job      on December 11, 1997, only after, and because, the judge in      the Jones case ordered the President to answer far-ranging      questions about other women. The same theory appeared at page      11 of the Majority Report prepared for the House of      Representatives.       The President's counsel, in their opening presentations to      the Senate, made clear beyond any doubt that Mr. Jordan met      with Ms. Lewinsky before the judge issued her ruling, and      that the meeting had been scheduled several days before that.      Without acknowledging their error, the Managers retreated to      the argument that Mr. Jordan's assistance on December 11 was      triggered not by Judge Wright's order, but rather by the      appearance of Ms. Lewinsky's name on the witness list six      days earlier. But the Managers themselves refuted this      argument in their Trial Brief, which states that there was      ``still no urgency to help Ms. Lewinsky'' after the witness      list arrived on December 5. Moreover, although Manager      Hutchinson later insinuated that Mr. Jordan and the President      discussed Ms. Lewinsky's job search during their meeting on      December 7, the Managers' Trial Brief acknowledges that the      December 7 meeting was ``unrelated'' to Ms. Lewinsky.       More generally, the Managers failed to show any connection      between Ms. Lewinsky's status as an affiant and possible      deponent in the Jones case and her New York job search. Every      witness to testify on this point, including the President,      Ms. Lewinsky, and Mr. Jordan, agreed that those events were      unrelated. Beyond this, the record is clear that Ms. Lewinsky      first mentioned the possibility of moving to New York in      early July 1997; that people other than Mr. Jordan tried to      help Ms. Lewinsky get a job at the United Nations in early      October 1997; and that Ms. Lewinsky notified her employer      that she would be leaving her job and moving to New York in      November 1997--all well before her name surfaced on the Jones      witness list.       The Managers have also stretched and distorted the evidence      regarding the box of gifts that Ms. Currie retrieved from Ms.      Lewinsky on or about December 28, 1997. The Managers have      argued that the Senate ``may reasonably presume'' that Ms.      Currie retrieved the gifts, which had been subpoenaed by the      Jones attorneys, at the behest of the President. In making      this argument, the Managers ask us to disregard Ms.      Lewinsky's testimony that it was her idea to give the gifts      to Ms. Currie; the President's testimony that he never told      Ms. Currie to retrieve the gifts; Ms. Currie's testimony that      it was Ms. Lewinsky, not the President, who asked her to      retrieve the gifts; and the fact that the President gave Ms.      Lewinsky additional gifts on the very morning that he is      alleged to have asked for them back. They also ask us to      ignore Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that she decided on her own      to protect her own privacy by turning over only ``innocuous''      gifts to the Jones lawyers. Finally, they ask us to ignore      exculpatory information concealed by Mr. Starr and revealed      to the Senate for the first time in Ms. Lewinsky's deposition      that the President's statement, ``Well, you have to turn over      whatever you have,'' sounded familiar to her.       The Managers have made much of a conversation between Ms.      Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan on December 31, 1997, that touched      upon certain notes, or possibly drafts of notes, Ms. Lewinsky      wrote to the President. According to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan      suggested ``something th[e] effect'' of, ``check to make sure      they are not there,'' which Ms. Lewinsky interpreted to mean,      ``get rid of whatever is there.'' Mr. Jordan recalled having      discussed the notes with Ms. Lewinsky, but denied having told      her to destroy them. Did Ms. Lewinsky misunderstand Mr.      Jordan, or is one witness lying? The Senate need not decide,      since by either account, the President was not a party to any      conversation about notes and, indeed, neither the notes nor      the December 31 conversation between Ms. Lewinsky and Mr.      Jordan are mentioned in the two Articles of Impeachment      approved by the House.       Perhaps the longest stretch by the Managers is their theory      regarding presidential aides Sidney Blumenthal, John Podesta,      and Bruce Lindsey. It simply cannot be that the target of a      grand jury investigation obstructs justice by making false or      misleading denials of wrongdoing in personal conversations      with friends and colleagues, even if he knows that they may      be compelled to testify about those conversations. Indeed,      until recently, most federal courts held that false denials      of wrongdoing--even when made under oath or to a federal      agent--could not be a basis for criminal liability.       The Managers have focused particular attention on the      President's conversation with Sidney Blumenthal on January      21, 1998, the day the Lewinsky scandal erupted. According to      Mr. Blumenthal, the President said that Ms. Lewinsky had told      him that she was called ``the stalker'' by her peers, and      that she would claim they had an affair because then she      would not be known as ``the stalker'' any more. Curiously,      Ms. Lewinsky herself, in the now-famous ``talking points''      she prepared before her relationship with the President      became public, encouraged Ms. Tripp to defuse questions about      Ms. Lewinsky by saying, ``[S]he turned out to be this huge      liar. I found out she left the W[hite] H[ouse] because she      was stalking the P[resident] or something like that.\13\''      Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged in her original proffer to Mr.      Starr that she was well aware of her reputation at the White      House and sought a detail from the Pentagon ``so people could      see Ms. L[ewinsky]'s good work and stop referring to her as      `The Stalker.''' Regardless, we can all agree that if the      President tried to conceal his own misconduct by maligning      Ms. Lewinsky, he acted shamefully. But this is a far cry from      acting criminally.       The Managers asked us to look at the ``big picture''. The      ``big picture'' with respect to Ms. Lewinsky is that she had      no intention of revealing her relationship with the      President, regardless of whether he helped her find a new      job; she acted independently and in her own best interests in      filing her affidavit in the Jones case; she originated and      carried out her plan to hide evidence from the Jones lawyers;      and Linda Tripp rather than Bill Clinton was her principal      advisor and ultimate betrayer. In fact, the only crimes shown      to have possibly occurred are not high crimes but those for      which Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp have received immunity from      prosecution from Mr. Starr.       What remains when you sweep aside the cobwebs of      unsupported speculation and conspiracy theory? To my mind,      the case on obstruction boils down to the charge that the      President, in the wake of his deposition in the Jones case,      ``coached'' his secretary about what to say if asked about      Ms. Lewinsky. The President has argued that Ms. Currie was      not then a witness in the Jones case and was not likely to be      one given the approaching deadline for completing discovery.      Moreover, he did not know that Mr. Starr had initiated an      investigation. In fact, once he learned that Mr. Starr was      investigating and that Ms. Currie might be a witness, the      President told Ms. Currie, ``Don't worry about me. Just      relax, go in there and tell the truth.''       I was seriously troubled by the President's counsel's      initial suggestion that Ms. Currie was never subpoenaed in      the Jones case. Still, Mr. Ruff's candid correction and      apology to the Senate stands in stark contrast to the      Managers' refusal to correct their own misleading      representations.       In the end, reasonable minds may differ over why the      President spoke to Ms. Currie     as he did in mid-January 1998. His explanation--that he was      ``trying to think of the best defense we could construct in      the face of what I thought was going to be a media onslaught      \14\''--is not implausible. Using a trusted employee as a      sounding board to test responses that might later be made      public is also not implausible nor criminal. The President      also had a legitimate interest in determining whether Ms.      Currie was the source of the Jones lawyers' apparent      knowledge regarding Ms. Lewinsky. In the end, in light of the      plausible and innocent explanations for these conversations,      I do not accept as proven beyond a reasonable doubt the      Managers' conclusion that they were criminal ``coaching''      sessions. I cannot vote to overturn a national election based      on the ambiguous record of this discrete episode.       Back on March 8th of last year, one of my Republican      colleagues on the Judiciary Committee stated his view that no      impeachment proceeding should be brought unless there was      ``an open-and-shut case'' because ``Americans cannot stand      the trauma of an impeachment matter unless it is cut-and-     dried.'' Even more clearly, the country cannot tolerate a      President's being removed from office based on the shifting      patchwork of circumstantial evidence and surmise that the      Managers have concocted.     C. There Was No Need to Call Witnesses       Witnesses would not fill the holes in the Managers' case.       The Managers only became interested in hearing from      witnesses once they faced trouble obtaining a conviction in      the Senate. They had an opportunity to interview witnesses      when this matter was still before the House. But the House      Judiciary Committee called no fact witnesses. The House of      Representatives called no witnesses at all. Rather, the House      Republicans voted out these Articles based on what they      were told by Special Prosecutor Starr.       They took the position that witnesses were not necessary.      For example, in November 1998, Manager Gekas stated that      ``[b]ringing in witnesses to rehash testimony that's already      concretely in the record would be a waste of time and serve      no purpose at all.'' Similarly, on December 19, 1998, during      the floor debate on the articles, Manager Hyde stated:       ``No fact witnesses, I have heard that repeated again and      again. Look, we had 60,000 pages of testimony from the grand      jury, from depositions, from statements under oath. That is      testimony that we can believe and accept. We chose to believe      it and accept it. Why reinterview Betty Currie to take      another statement when we already had her statement? Why      interview Monica Lewinsky when we had her statement under      oath, and with a grant of immunity that if she lied she would      forfeit?''       Having chosen to proceed in the House without witnesses,      the Managers were in no position to demand that the Senate      hear witnesses. A Senate impeachment trial is not a make-up      exam for an incomplete inquiry by the House.       In attempting to explain his inconsistent positions on      witnesses, Manager Hyde said, ``we were operating under time      constraints which were self-imposed but I promised my      colleagues to finish it before the end of the year. I didn't      want it to drag out.'' But self-imposed time constraints do      not begin to explain why Mr. Hyde's Committee declined to      call a single fact witness. The Committee did hold two day-     long hearings. It heard from a panel of convicted felons who      testified, to nobody's surprise, that perjury is a crime. And      it heard from the prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, who had no      first-hand knowledge of any facts in the case, and had not      even spoken with anyone who had. Those two days could have      been spent hearing fact witnesses and surely they would have      been, if the Committee majority thought for one moment that      fact witnesses would have any new and incriminating evidence      to share.       Mr. Hyde's second justification for failing to call      witnesses in the House was grounded in his mistaken view of      that body's role in the impeachment process. According to Mr.      Hyde, ``[t]he threshold in the House was for impeachment,      which is to seek a trial in the Senate. . . . All we could do      was present evidence sufficient to convince our colleagues      that there ought to be a trial over here in the Senate.'' I      have already explained the fallacy of this position. When      these Articles of Impeachment fail, as I believe they must, I      hope it will send a clear message to the House of      Representatives not to do a slapdash, partisan job on      something as momentous and wrenching for the nation as a      presidential impeachment.       Contrary to the suggestions of some Managers, there is no      authority for the notion that the Senate must hear witnesses.      It is true, as one Manager noted, that the Senate heard      witnesses during the impeachment trial of President Johnson,      notwithstanding the House's failure to do so. As most      historians agree, however, the Johnson impeachment was an      illegitimate attempt by the Reconstruction Republicans to      unseat a President whose policies they disliked. It was      hardly a model of procedural correctness.       More recently, in the 1980's, the Senate removed three      impeached federal judges without hearing any witnesses on the      Senate floor. Indeed, in the impeachment trial of Judge      Claiborne in 1986, a majority of the Senate approved a motion      by then-Majority Leader Dole not to hear any live testimony.      Instead, in each case, the Senate reviewed a written record      of testimony prepared by a special committee of Senators. The      Senate did this over the objections of the judges being      removed.       If the President is willing to forego the opportunity to      cross-examine the witnesses being relied upon by the      Managers, that eliminates the most pressing need for further      discovery in this matter. After all, Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie      and other witnesses were interviewed multiple times by the      Special Prosecutor's lawyers and investigators and then      testified repeatedly before the grand jury. That is about as      one sided as it gets--no cross examination, no opportunity to      compare early statements with the way things are reconfigured      and re-expressed after numerous preparation sessions with Mr.      Starr's office.       These witnesses testified under threat of prosecution by      Mr. Starr. Ms. Lewinsky is still under a very clear threat of      prosecution, even though she has a limited grant of immunity.      This Special Prosecutor has shown every willingness to      threaten and prosecute even those who have played minor,      tangential roles in his investigations of the President, such      as Julie Hiatt Steele, and those who have already been      relentlessly pursued in serial prosecutions, such as Webster      Hubbell and Susan McDougal.       Thus, if the President has not initiated efforts to obtain      more discovery and witnesses and is willing to have the      matter decided on the current Senate record, the Managers      carried a heavy burden to justify extending these proceedings      further and requiring the reexamination of people who have      already testified.       During his opening remarks, Manager McCollum said, ``I      don't know what the witnesses will say, but I assume if they      are consistent, they'll say the same that's in here,''      referring to the voluminous record before the Senate.      Nevertheless, the majority in the Senate acceded to the      Managers' request to conduct depositions, which only      confirmed that subjecting the witnesses to further      examination would not provide any new revelations.       In fact, during the deposition of Ms. Lewinsky, Manager      Bryant conceded, ``Obviously, you testified extensively in      the grand jury, so you're going to obviously repeat things      today. We're doing the depositions for the Senators to      view.'' Likewise, during Mr. Jordan's deposition, Manager      Hutchinson acknowledged the witness's five prior grand jury      appearances and conceded, ``I know that probably about every      question that could be asked has been asked, but there are a      number of reasons I want to go over additional questions with      you, and some of them will be repetitious of what's been      asked before.''       There was no reason to protract this process further merely      to hear more redundant testimony live on the floor of the      Senate, in light of the President's agreement to forfeit this      opportunity to examine the witnesses.     D. Removal Is Not Warranted       The question each Senator must address is whether the      conduct charged in the Articles meets the constitutional      standard of high crime and misdemeanor warranting conviction      and removal. The Managers, the President's counsel and, in      particular, former Senator Dale Bumpers have provided us with      erudite history lessons on the misconduct the Framers meant      to cover by this standard.       We have heard debate whether this standard covers only      conduct performed in the President's public capacity or also      covers private conduct. A strong case can be made that the      Framers never intended that a President be subject to      impeachment and removal for private conduct--no matter how      egregious. Instead, they purposely limited the ground for      impeachment to offenses against the state or grave abuses of      official power.       But this argument presents the proverbial ``slippery      slope.'' Does this mean that a President may not be removed      for murder? The Framers may very well have responded ``no.''      In fact, during the impeachment trial of Chief Justice Samuel      Chase, the presiding officer was then Vice-President Aaron      Burr, who at the same time was under indictment in both New      Jersey and New York for the murder of Alexander Hamilton in a      duel in 1804. As Chief Justice Rehnquist notes in Grand      Inquests, ``This fact caused one contemporary wag to remark      that whereas in most courts the murderer was arraigned before      the judge, in this court the judge was arraigned before the      murderer!'' Nonetheless, Burr was not the subject of the      impeachment trial, Chief Justice Chase was.       No matter how the Framers would treat serious private      misconduct, I do not hesitate to conclude that heinous      crimes, such as murder, would warrant the remedy of removal.      As Professor Charles Black explained:       ``Many common crimes--willful murder, for example--though      not subversive of government or political order, might be so      serious as to make a president simply unviable as a national      leader; I cannot think that a president who had committed      murder could not be removed by impeachment. But the      underlying reason remains much the same; such crimes would so      stain a president as to make his continuance in office      dangerous to public order.''       The House Judiciary Committee in 1974 summed up the thorny      issue of how to evaluate the constitutional standard for      impeachable and removable conduct as follows: ``Not all      presidential misconduct is sufficient to constitute grounds      for impeachment. There is a further requirement--     substantiality.''       Professor Black also addressed the ``substantiality'' of      the misconduct necessary to meet the constitutional standard      for impeachment and removal, with the following illustration:       ``Suppose a president transported a woman across a state      line or even (so the Mann Act reads) from one point to      another within the District of Columbia, for what is quaintly      called an `immoral purpose.' Or suppose a president did not      immediately report to the nearest policeman that he had      discovered that one of his aides was a practicing      homosexual--thereby committing `misprision of a felony.' Or      suppose the president actively assisted a young White House      intern in concealing the latter's possession of three ounces      of marijuana--thus himself becoming guilty of `obstruction of      justice.' . . . Would it not be preposterous to think that      any of this is what the Framers meant when they referred to      `Treason, Bribery, and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'      or that any sensible constitutional plan would make a      president removable on such grounds?''       In my view, the charges that the President committed      perjury and obstructed justice to conceal an illicit      relationship with Monica Lewinsky not only fail as a matter      of proof, but to the extent they raise legitimate questions      about his conduct they fail the test of substantiality. As      one Vermonter recently wrote to the editor of the Burlington      Free Press, ``If there ever was a situation in which the      phrase making a mountain out of a mole hill is apt, it is the      impeachment trial to date.''       The Managers tried to address the criticism that the      conduct underlying the Articles is so insubstantial as to      leave the American public scratching their heads. Manager      Canady conceded that no President ``should be impeached and      removed from office for trivial or insubstantial offenses. .      . . A President should not be impeached and removed from      office for a mistake or judgement. He should not be impeached      and removed from office for a momentary lapse.'' Similarly,      Manager Graham acknowledged ``absolutely'' that reasonable      people could disagree about whether the President should be      removed, even were the charges proven. Manager Graham further      opined during questioning by Senators that:       ``I would not want my President removed for any criminal      wrongdoing. I would want my President removed only when there      was a clear case that points to the right decision for the      future of the country. . . I would not want my President      removed for trivial offenses, and that is the heart of the      matter here.''       My decision on this matter should not be misinterpreted to      mean that I countenance perjury or obstruction of justice, or      that I do not appreciate the need for enforcement of our laws      prohibiting such conduct for the functioning of our judicial      system. If committed, these are serious crimes. Nevertheless,      as Manager Graham recognized, reasonable people can and do      disagree on the ultimate questions in this trial.       I do not agree with the Managers that they have proven      these crimes were committed or that the conduct at issue here      is sufficiently heinous to warrant impeachment and removal of      the President. Chairman Henry Hyde recognized that ``one      hardly exhausts moral imagination by labeling every untruth      and every deception an outrage.''       The American people understand this point instinctively. In      my home State of Vermont, for instance, the majority of      people are overwhelmingly opposed to the removal of this      President from office. They were against it in August 1998,      when the House posted Mr. Starr's salacious referral on the      Internet. They were against it in November 1998, when Mr.      Starr appeared before the House Judiciary Committee to try to      breath some life back into his case for impeachment. They      were against it in December 1998, when the House Republicans      made even shriller pitches for impeachment to the American      people. And judging from the calls and mail I have received,      Vermonters are more certain than ever that they want Bill      Clinton to serve out his term.       Of course, we must not be led by the polls. The Framers      wanted impeachments to be tried in the Senate, not in the      court of public opinion. This is not a referendum. Still,      whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant the President's      removal turns at least in part on whether it makes him unfit      to govern, and on that question, the voice of the governed      should be heard.       The Managers have eloquently expressed their concern about      the ``kind of message'' it would send to America should the      Senate refuse to convict and remove the President on the      Articles. Chairman Hyde expressed his view that the message      would be that ``charges of perjury, obstruction of justice      are summarily dismissed--disregarded, ignored, brushed off''      and that there is a double standard for the President.       With all due respect for the Managers' belief on this      score, I disagree. First, our assessment of whether the      President's personal misconduct meets the constitutional      standard for impeachment, conviction and removal should not      be misconstrued to reflect our views on the seriousness of      perjury or obstruction of justice. Professor Tribe, in his      testimony last November before a House Judiciary subcommittee      confronted this issue directly, stating:       ``It is always possible to argue, when confronted by      serious crime, that the system would crumble if everyone      followed the wrongdoer's example. If everyone took President      Richard Nixon's allegedly false filing of tax returns under      oath, including backdating documents, as a model to emulate,      the nation's tax system, and thus its defenses, would      crumble. Yet there was no realistic basis to suppose that the      Nixon example would start any such stampede, and the simple      proposition that, if all did as Nixon had done, the      consequences would be catastrophic did not mislead the House      Judiciary Committee into treating the President's alleged tax      evasion as an impeachable offense: By a vote of 26-12, the      Committee soundly declined to treat it as such.''       Second, the Managers are also wrong that Senate acquittal      of the President would essentially set-up a ``double-     standard'' and put the President above the law. The Managers      ignore the fact that the Constitution itself establishes a      purposely high and difficult standard for the Senate to      remove a duly elected head of a co-equal branch of      government. In a court of law, not a Senate court of      impeachment, the President, in his personal capacity, stands      subject to the same standard as any American.              VI. PRIOR JUDICIAL IMPEACHMENTS FOR PERJURY       Just ten years ago, the Senate voted to convict two Federal      judges on charges of perjury. The Managers read those      precedents to mean that perjury, if proved, is always an      impeachable offense--that Presidents ought not be held to a      lower standard of impeachability than judges. While the      failure of proof in this case obviates the need to resolve      the precedential effect, if any, that judicial impeachments      may have on the impeachment of a President, the Managers'      simplistic, ``one-size-fits-all'' approach is unsound.       Perjury is not included in the impeachment section of      Article II of the Constitution, even though, as Manager Buyer      noted, the Framers were familiar with the crime. Treason is      the defining crime in the Constitution--it is a crime against      and undermining the very existence of the Government. Bribery      is also expressly included--no officer of the United States      can continue if he is corrupted by accepting a bribe to do      something other than faithfully execute his public duties.      Perjury may, if proved, provide a basis for impeachment, but      only if it is determined to be within ``other high Crimes or      Misdemeanors.''       In the recent judicial impeachments, the lies at issue were      aimed at concealing gross abuses of official power. Judge      Alcee Hastings lied to conceal his participation in a      conspiracy to fix cases in his own court. Judge Walter Nixon      lied to conceal his corrupt efforts to influence a state      prosecutor to drop a case. Significantly, Judge Nixon had      been convicted by a Federal jury and was serving a 5-year      prison sentence at the time he was impeached and removed; he      simply could not continue to function as a Federal judge and      perform his duties.       House Managers have also referred to the impeachment of a      third judge, Judge Harry Claiborne, but he was impeached for      filing a false tax return and not perjury per se. In any      event, as with Judge Nixon, Judge Claiborne had been      convicted after a jury trial and was serving a federal prison      term when he was impeached.       By contrast, President Clinton is not accused of lying to      conceal public misconduct. He is accused of lying to conceal      the ``nature and details'' of an extramarital affair--an      affair that he admitted had occurred.       Beyond this, there are very basic differences in terms and      functions between Federal judges and the President. Judges      are appointed for life. Presidents are elected for fixed      terms and accountable in political terms. A President can be      subject to review by the people if he runs for reelection.      Moreover, removing an appointed Federal judge, while      extremely serious, implicates none of the momentous, anti-     democratic consequences of removing an elected President.       Another difference between Federal judges and the President      is that, under the Constitution, only the former ``hold their      Offices during good Behaviour.'' The proposition, however,      that this clause creates a different constitutional standard      for removal of judges than for removal of the President or      other civil officers is dangerous. Such an interpretation      would invite attacks on the independence of the federal      judiciary and undermine the balance among the three co-equal      branches of our federal government. Indeed, Alexander      Hamilton opined in Federalist No. 79 that impeachment was the      only provision for removal ``which we find in our own      Constitution in respect to our own judges.''       The past few years have seen unprecedented attacks on      controversial decisions by Federal judges. Should such      decisions be deemed malfeasance by the party in control of      Congress, then impeachment proceedings against judges who      render unpopular decisions could provide a platform for      endless political posturing. More importantly, this would      chill the independent operation of our Federal judiciary.       As Professor Michael Gerhardt has explained, the good      behavior clause does not mean that Federal judges may be      impeached on the basis of a lower standard than the      President, but it does suggest that they may be impeached      ``on a basis that takes account of their special duties or      functions.'' A judge who lies under oath is uniquely unfit to      continue in an office that requires him to administer oaths      and sit in judgment. It is perfectly appropriate for the      Senate when sitting as a court of impeachment to take into     account the type of duties that the impeached official is      called upon to perform and whether the charges, if proved,      clearly impair the official's ability to perform those      duties. The outcome of this analysis may very well differ      depending on the job of the impeached official.                  VII. ``FINDINGS OF FACT'' FALLACIES       As the impeachment trial wore on, without any prospect of a      conviction and removal, a popular Republican exit strategy      was to force a preliminary vote on so-called ``findings of      fact'' that the President committed perjury and obstructed      justice, to be followed by a second vote on removal. I      opposed this initiative because, in my view, it reflected a      basic misunderstanding of the Senate's constitutional      function when sitting as a court of impeachment.       The Senate's constitutional role is to determine whether to      convict the President of an impeachable offense and remove      him from office. This is a unitary question, requiring a      unitary answer. In recognition thereof, the Senate has rules      prohibiting dividing articles of impeachment.       A presidential impeachment trial is not an appropriate      forum for ``finding'' that a public official has committed a      crime. Crime and punishment are issues expressly reserved by      the Constitution to our criminal courts, where an accused is      entitled to due process rights far in excess of the minimal      procedural protections being accorded the President in the      Senate trial. In the current case there are also additional      complicating factors since the Senate made up its procedures      as it went along and the specific charges against the      President have constantly shifted.       Impeachment is not about punishing the officeholder but      about protecting the public. Senator George Edmunds of      Vermont explained in 1868 that ``[p]unishment by impeachment      does not exist under our Constitution. . . . [The accused]      can only be removed from the office he fills and prevented      from holding office, not as punishment, but as a means merely      of protection to the community . . . .'' Our focus must be on      whether the conduct with which the House has charged      President Clinton has been proven and warrants his removal      from office to protect the public.       Branding the President is not the function of impeachment.      On the contrary, a congressional finding of guilt for      criminal conduct would be an illegitimate exercise in shaming      the President and an abuse of the impeachment process in      support of a future criminal prosecution, which recent leaks      from prosecutor Starr's office confirm he is considering.       A preliminary vote on guilt in the form of ``findings of      fact'' would set the dangerous precedent that a Senate      impeachment trial could be used for the purpose of      criticizing conduct that the constitutionally-required number      of Senators did not believe was impeachable. The last      protection against impeachment by an opposing party with      majority control of Congress would be eviscerated. This would      trivialize the constitutional impeachment process and invite      future illegitimate impeachments.       ``Findings of fact'' that the President committed the acts      charged in the Articles would be tantamount to conviction on      the impeachment Articles themselves and more accurately      described as ``findings of guilt'' without the remedy      prescribed by the Constitution. As a matter of constitutional      law and Senate practice, such ``findings'' cannot and should      not be separated from the vote on removal. Article II,      section 4 of the Constitution provides that, upon conviction      by the Senate, the President ``shall be removed from      Office.'' By making removal mandatory upon conviction, the      Constitution precludes the Senate from taking the      politically-expedient, oxymoronic route of convicting without      removing.       Proponents of the Republican proposals pointed to      eighteenth century precedents long ago repudiated. In the      first three judicial impeachment trials that ended in      conviction, the Senate, having voted to convict, took a      separate vote on removal from office. But in each case, the      first vote required a two-thirds supermajority, as specified      by the Constitution, not a simple majority as is now      proposed. Moreover, the Senate rejected this early precedent      in 1936; since then, it has been the understanding of the      Senate that removal follows automatically from conviction.      The lack of solid precedent for ``findings of fact'' speaks      volumes.       This unprecedented exit strategy was opposed by Republicans      and Democrats who did not want to circumvent the Constitution      merely to find a convenient end to this impeachment trial.      Former Judge Robert Bork termed these proposals      ``preposterous readings of the Constitution as well as      utterly impractical.'' Former Reagan Attorney General Edwin      Meese cautioned that the Senate ``should not flirt with      unconstitutional action, especially where conviction and      removal of the President are at stake.''       Robert Frost said that the best way out is always through.      In the end, the Senate's best way out was to fulfill its      proper role in the impeachment process by voting on the      Articles.             VIII. EFFECT ON CHILDREN AND NATIONAL SECURITY       My consideration of the Articles would be incomplete      without addressing one final point raised by the House      Managers about the effect of our decision. They have      cautioned that should this President be acquitted, the      consequences would be dire for our children, military morale,      and the functioning of our judicial system. I reject these      doomsday scenarios and believe that the precedent set by      conviction without proof and removal without constitutional      justification would be far more dangerous for our Republic.       For example, when he was asked whether acquitting the      President would endanger the stability of our government,      Manager Hyde responded that it would, because it would set a      bad example for our children. I was surprised by this answer.      This is hardly the sort of danger that the Framers of the      Constitution were concerned with when they met in      Philadelphia in 1787. They had just paid a great price to      liberate themselves from a tyrant. They wanted to ensure that      their new Chief Executive could not become a tyrant. They      wanted to ensure that he could be removed if he posed a      threat to the democratic system of government that they had      fought so hard to establish. They were not trying to ensure      that the President would be a good role model for the      nation's children.       More importantly, as a father and grandfather, I work hard      to be a role model for my children and grandchild. They do      not need the President to serve that role. They do not have      to look to the Congress to impeach and remove this President      to know the difference between right and wrong.       I trust the parents of America to raise their children, to      explain what the President did was wrong, and to point out      the humiliation and other consequences he has brought on      himself and his presidency for an entire year and for as long      as history books are written. I do not believe that the      Constitution calls upon us to remove a duly elected President      for symbolic purposes.       The Managers have also struggled to raise the specter that      a vote of acquittal on the Articles would risk our national      security by undermining the morale of our military, who would      appear to be held to a double standard. I have more faith in      our military. If the Managers' position were correct then we      would have seen ill-effects from President Bush's pardon of      former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who had been      indicted on several counts, including for lying before a      grand jury. But we did not.       In fact, at that time, Manager Hyde applauded the decision      to pardon Mr. Weinberger, saying, ``I'm glad the president      had the chutzpah to do it.'' Far from censuring this accused      perjurer or deploring the bad example he had set, Mr. Hyde      denounced the Independent Counsel who had brought this      ``political'' prosecution and stated: ``I just wish [us] out      of this mess, this six years and this $30-40 million that has      been spent [by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh]. It's      endless and it is a bottomless pit for money, with no      accountability.''       The fact that the Constitution sets a high standard for      removal of a President has no bearing on the standard of      conduct applicable to military service. In addition, it does      not place the President above the law. Indeed, all of us in      Congress have special immunity under the speech and debate      clause. That has never been argued to place us above the law      nor undermine military morale.     IX. DELIBERATIONS ON DISPOSITIVE TRIAL MOTIONS SHOULD BE OPEN       Accustomed as we and the American people are to having our      proceedings in the Senate open to the public and subject to      press coverage, the most striking prescription in the ``Rules      of Procedure and Practice in the Senate when Sitting on      Impeachment Trials'' has been the closed deliberations      required on any preliminary question or motion, and now on      the final question whether the Articles of Impeachment should      be sustained or rejected.       The requirement of closed deliberation, more than any other      rule, reflects the age in which the rules were originally      adopted in 1868. Even in 1868, not everyone favored secrecy.      During the trial of President Johnson, the senior Senator      from Vermont, George F. Edmunds, moved to have the closed      deliberations on the Articles transcribed and officially      reported ``in order that the world might know, without      diminution or exaggeration, the reasons and views upon which      we proceed to our judgment.'' The motion was tabled.       In the 130 years that have passed since that time, the      Senate has seen the advent of television in the Senate      Chamber, instant communication, distribution of Senate      documents over the Internet, the addition of 46 Senators      representing 23 additional States, and the direct election of      Senators by the people in our States.       Opening deliberations would help further the dual purposes      of our rules to promote fairness and political accountability      in the impeachment process. I supported the motion by      Senators Harkin, Wellstone and others to suspend this rule      requiring closed deliberations and to open our deliberations      on Senator Byrd's motion to dismiss and at other points      earlier in this trial. We were unsuccessful. Now that the      Senate has approached final deliberations on the Articles of      Impeachment, I had hoped that this secrecy rule would be      suspended so that the Senate's deliberations would be open      and the American people could see them. In a matter of this      historic importance, the American people should be able to      witness their Senators' deliberations.       Some have indicated objection to opening our final      deliberations because petit juries in courts of law conduct      their deliberations in     secret. Analogies to juries in courts of law are misplaced. I      was privileged to serve as a prosecutor for eight years      before I was elected to the Senate. As a prosecutor, I      represented the people of Vermont in court and before juries      on numerous occasions. I fully appreciate the traditions and      importance of allowing jurors to deliberate and make their      decisions privately, without intrusion or pressure from the      parties, the judge or the public. The sanctity of the jury      deliberation room ensures the integrity and fairness of our      judicial system.       The Senate sitting as an impeachment court is unlike any      jury in any civil or criminal case. A jury in a court of law      is chosen specifically because the jurors have no connection      or relation to the parties or their lawyers and no      familiarity with the allegations. Keeping the deliberations      of regular juries secret ensures that as they reach their      final decision, they are free from outside influences or      pressure.       As the Chief Justice made clear on the third day of the      impeachment trial, the Senate is more than a jury; it is a      court. Courts are called upon to explain the reasons for      decisions. Furthermore, to the extent the Senate is called      upon to evaluate the evidence as is a jury, we stand in      different shoes than any juror in a court of law. We all know      many of the people who have been witnesses in this matter; we      all know the Managers--indeed, one Senator is a brother of      one of the Managers--and we were familiar with the underlying      allegations in this case before the Managers ever began their      presentation.       Because we are a different sort of jury, we shoulder a      heavier burden in explaining the reasons for the decisions we      make here. I appreciate why Senators would want to have some      aspects of our deliberations in closed session: to avoid      embarrassment to and protect the privacy of persons who may      be discussed. Yet, on the critical decisions we are now being      called upon to make on our votes on the Articles themselves,      allowing our deliberations to be open to the public helps      assure the American people that the decisions we make are for      the right reasons.       In 1974, when the Senate was preparing itself for the      anticipated impeachment trial of former President Richard      Nixon, the Committee on Rules and Administration discussed      the issue of allowing television coverage of the Senate      trial. Such coverage did not become routine in the Senate      until later in 1986. In urging such coverage of the possible      impeachment trial of President Nixon, Senator Metcalf (D-MT),      explained:       ``Given the fact that the party not in control of the White      House is the majority party in the Senate, the need for      broadcast media access is even more compelling. Charges of a      `kangaroo court,' or a `lynch mob proceeding' must not be      given an opportunity to gain any credence whatsoever.      Americans must be able to see for themselves what is      occurring. An impeachment trial must not be perceived by the      public as a mysterious process, filtered through the      perceptions of third parties. The procedure whereby the      individual elected to the most powerful office in the world      can be lawfully removed must command the highest possible      level of acceptance from the electorate.''       Opening deliberation would ensure complete and accurate      public understanding of the proceedings and the reasons for      the decisions we make here. Opening our deliberations on our      votes on the Articles would tell the American people why each      of us voted the way we did.       The last time this issue was actually taken up and voted on      by the Senate was more than a century ago in 1876, during the      impeachment trial of Secretary of War William Belknap.      Without debate or deliberation, the Senate refused then to      open the deliberations of the Senate to the public. That was      before Senators were elected directly by the people of their      State, that was before the Freedom of Information Act      confirmed the right of the people to see how government      decisions are made. Keeping closed our deliberations is      wholly inconsistent with the progress we have made over the      last century to make our government more accountable to the      people.       Constitutional scholar Michael Gerhardt noted that ``the      Senate is ideally suited for balancing the tasks of making      policy and finding facts (as required in impeachment trials)      with political accountability.'' Public access to the reasons      each Senator gives for his vote on the Articles is vital for      the political accountability that is the hallmark of our      role.       I likewise have urged the Senate to adjust these 130-year-     old rules to allow the Senate's votes on the Articles of      Impeachment to be recorded for history by news photographers.      This is a momentous official and public event in the annals      of the Senate and in the history of the nation. This is a      moment of history that should be documented for both its      contemporary and its lasting significance.       Open deliberation ensures complete accountability to the      American people. Charles Black wrote that presidential      impeachment ``unseats the person the people have deliberately      chosen for the office.'' /22/ The American people must be      able to judge if their elected representatives have chosen      for or against conviction for reasons they understand, even      if they disagree. To bar the American people from observing      the deliberations that result in these important decisions is      unfair and undemocratic.       The Senate should have suspended the rules so that our      deliberations on the final question of whether to convict the      President of these Article of Impeachment were held in open      session. After this impeachment trial is over, I urge the      Senate to re-examine the rule on closed deliberations in      impeachment trials and revise the rule to reflect the open      and accountable government that is now the pride and hallmark      of our democracy.                             X. CONCLUSION       The House Managers have warned that should the President be      acquitted we will set a dangerous precedent and damage the      ``rule of law.'' I strongly disagree. Instead, we will have      set the following important precedent for the future: that      partisan impeachment drives are doomed to failure.       It is up to the Senate, now, to restore sanity to this      process, exercise judgment, do justice and act in the      interests of the nation. We all knew before the trial began      that history will judge us on whether this case was resolved      in a way that serves the good of the country, not the      political ends of any party. I commend my colleagues in the      Senate and in particular Majority Leader Lott and Minority      Leader Daschle for working hard to maintain bipartisanship      and fairness in our proceedings.       In all the references to the first presidential impeachment      trial, a little-known historical fact has been overlooked.      After the unsuccessful effort to remove him from office,      former President Johnson returned to serve this country as a      United States Senator. I look forward to the day when the      Senate has concluded the impeachment of President Clinton and      we can close our work as an impeachment court and turn to the      other important work we face as Senators.                               footnotes     1.
