Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate and honor a young student from Alaska who has achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in her community. Kari Wise of Anchorage has just been named one of Alaska's top honorees in The 2001 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on the most impressive student volunteers in each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  Ms. Wise is being recognized for developing a program designed to help middle school students lead healthy and positive lives as they begin high school. Her program, named ``View on Your Future Is All About YOU,'' helped young students realize destructive behavior is not the answer for dealing with difficult life experiences.  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are less involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that we encourage the selfless contributions this young woman has made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Ms. Wise are inspiring all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.  The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program brought this young role model to our attention. This program was created by The Prudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress upon all young volunteers that their contributions are critically important and highly valued. Over the past six years, the program has become the nation's largest youth effort based on community service, with an estimated 100,000 youngsters participating since its inception.  We are extremely proud that Ms. Wise has been singled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. I applaud Ms. Wise for her initiative in seeking to make her community a better place to live, and for the positive impact she has had on the lives of others. Clearly, she has demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that deserves our sincere admiration and respect. Her actions show that young Americans can, and do, play an important role in our communities.                          ____________________
