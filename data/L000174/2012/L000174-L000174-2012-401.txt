President, I commend the majority leader for pressing forward to obtain a vote on the nomination of Jesse Furman, finally bringing to an end the 5-month Republican filibuster of this nomination. It should not have taken five months and the filing of a cloture petition to secure a vote on this superbly qualified, consensus nominee. When the Judiciary Committee voted on this nomination last September, it had the support of every Democrat and ever Republican on the Committee. Yesterday, I spoke, again, of the dangers posed by this Republican filibuster of a consensus Federal district court nominee. I am glad Senate Republicans have backed away from their misguided effort.
