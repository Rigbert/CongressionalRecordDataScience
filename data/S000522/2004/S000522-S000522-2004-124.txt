Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the chief sponsor of this very important resolution, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).  Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I appreciate the work of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in expediting this and also the majority leader's office.  Madam Speaker, I am honored to rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 4608, legislation that would name the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Peoria, Illinois, after Bob Michel, the former Republican leader of the House of Representatives.                              {time}  1715  This year, as we mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day, we as a Nation are taking the time to reflect on those members of the greatest generation who served our country during World War II. Bob Michel is one of those heroes. As a member of the 39th Infantry, he served in England, France, Belgium and Germany. He fought from the beaches of Normandy to the Battle of the Bulge, where he was wounded by machine gun fire. His service earned him the Purple Heart, two Bronze Stars and four Battle Stars.  After the war, Bob Michel continued his service to our country and to our community, first as a congressional staffer, then as a Member of this House for 38 distinguished years.  He served 6 years as the minority whip and 15 years as the Republican leader, the longest-serving Republican leader in the history of the House of Representatives. During his career, he never forgot about those who served with him in World War II and those who served in uniform after him in peacetime and conflicts that followed.  He knows firsthand the sacrifice veterans have made for our country, so he was instrumental in gaining funding that established the VA clinic in Peoria, Illinois, in 1979, a source of care and comfort for thousands of veterans throughout central Illinois. In 2003, there were more than 42,000 visits to the Peoria clinic.  Respect for Bob Michel is certainly widespread. In 1989, President Reagan awarded the Presidential Citizens Award Medal, which recognizes individuals who performed exemplary deeds for their country and fellow citizens, to then minority leader Bob Michel.  In 1994, President Clinton honored Mr. Michel with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award. In 2003, Mr. Michel became one of the first recipients of the Congressional Distinguished Service Award presented to him by the gentleman from Illinois (Speaker Hastert), and in June of this year, Mr. Michel returned to France with the gentleman from Illinois (Speaker Hastert) and was oneof only 100 people to become a Knight of the Legion of Honor, one of the highest honors paid by the French Government to a noncitizen.  Bob Michel, a member of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, the Distinguished American Veterans and the Military Order of the Purple Heart, continues to be an example of patriotism and the exemplary public service to which we all aspire. I am honored to call him my mentor and my friend of more than 20 years, and I know many in this House, both staff and fellow Members alike, share these feelings with me.  On the top of many other accolades and honors, I can think of no better way to honor his lifetime of public service than to add his name to a facility that serves other patriots during their time of need. So I urge my colleagues today to help honor Bob Michel by designating the veterans clinic in Peoria, Illinois, as the Bob Michel Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic.  I want to particularly thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Chairman Smith), and as I said, the majority leader's office, the staff on both sides of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for so quickly taking action on this legislation, and I urge passage.
