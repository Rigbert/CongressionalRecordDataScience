 Their recent 4-0 win over Kansas Wesleyan earned the Tigers their first trip to the NAIA Baseball World Series in Lewiston, ID.  The Tigers' hard work and dedication throughout the season has paid off as they represent their school in the tournament. The players embody the principles of teamwork and their tireless efforts resulted in a successful season that has lead to this monumental and meaningful honor.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the team and coaches from Campbellsville for their performance during the regular season and for making it to the World Series. I further ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record as well as the names of the players and coaches.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             Campbellsville University Tigers Baseball Team       Head Coach Beauford Sanders, Assistant Coach Scott      Hortness, Assistant Coach Randy LeBleu, Assistant Coach Jake      McKinley, Rob Elliott, Bryan Fuller, Spencer Frantz, Jimmy      Voelker, Craig Edwards, Nick Bertolucci, Logan Smith, Zach      Townsend, Chris Curley, Curtis Payne, Colin Bryan, Alex      Ponich, Tyler Derby, Nathan Quesenberry, Jake Kutsukos,      Chance Harker, Marc Wilson, Ian Pick, Eric Mattos, Eric      Staples, Nick Smith, Alex Tolmachoff, Jon Bourassa, Brian      Chase                       [From ESPN, May 16, 2009]                 Campbellsville Gains NAIA Series Berth       Bryan Fuller told his Campbellsville University coaches he      was never going to play baseball professionally, so he was      willing to sacrifice his arm.       With much debate and reluctance, but knowing what was at      stake and what their other options were, his coaches      acquiesced.       Fuller, a senior, ended up pitching 21 shutout innings in      26 hours as Campbellsville (Ky.) advanced to the NAIA World      Series in Lewiston, Idaho, where on Friday it will face Lee      (Tenn.).       Campbellsville had fallen into the loser's bracket in its      NAIA super regional, and needed to win three straight to get      the World Series berth. Against Lindenwood on Thursday,      Fuller, who throws sidearm, pitched three scoreless innings      for the save.       With just 25 minutes between games, Campbellsville's      coaches decided to start Fuller in the next game, against      Kansas Wesleyan, which had won 26 straight. Fuller, according      to assistant coach Jake McKinley, ``is an undersized kid''      who had started only once previously in four seasons.       ``We were nearly out of pitching and he looked      comfortable,'' McKinley said. ``We told Fuller we would need      him to make his second career start and if he could give us      three or four innings, that would be great, and it was in the      biggest game in the history of our program against a team      that had won 26 straight games.''       Fuller ended up pitching a complete game as Campbellsville      snapped Kansas Wesleyan's winning streak with a 11-0 victory.       That put Campbellsville in the final. According to      McKinley, the coaches were prepared to start their No. 1      pitcher on two days' rest, but Fuller wanted the start.       ``We told him no way, because we didn't want to hurt him .      . . He just threw 12 innings the day before,'' McKinley said.      ``He told us that he was a senior that will never play pro      ball and he was going to be an accountant in just a few      weeks. He said he didn't care about his arm and told us he      will give us a chance to win.''       And he did, using just 77 pitches in his second consecutive      complete-game shutout as Campbellsville (39-10) beat Kansas      Wesleyan again 4-0, giving the Tigers their first NAIA World      Series appearance in school history.       ``We're not sure yet, but we are not opposed to using him      in any role,'' McKinley said. ``At this point, we'd be fools      not to start him.''                          ____________________
