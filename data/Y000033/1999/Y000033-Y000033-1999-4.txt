Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that until the day the House convenes for the second session of the 106th Congress, and notwithstanding any adjournment of the House, the Speaker, the majority leader, and the minority leader be authorized to accept resignations and to make appointments authorized by law or by the House.
