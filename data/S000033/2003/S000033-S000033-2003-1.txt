 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, this bill has a number of important and positive provisions. The idea that consumers will receive free credit reports is important. The provision strengthening identity theft is also very important.  But basically, the positive provisions in this bill do not outweigh the negative. And, in my view, this bill should be defeated. It should be defeated because it preempts States throughout this country from going forward with stronger consumer protections. And to my mind, States, in fact, are the laboratories of democracy; and it is a bad idea, especially from our conservative friends, who year after year have told us how bad it was for the Federal Government to have all this power, to now give power to the Federal Government and tell the State of Vermont, the State of California, that if you have specific needs dealing with consumer issues, you may not go forward. That is wrong. And for that reason alone, this legislation should be defeated, sent back, and strengthened in terms of consumer needs.  I would point out that virtually every consumer organization in America, the Consumer Federation of America, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, et cetera, oppose the preemption aspects of this legislation.  Second of all, Mr. Speaker, one of the great rip-offs that is taking place in America now deals with credit cards which, at a time of very, very low interest rates, are charging people up to 25 or 29 percent interest. And one way they do it, Mr. Speaker, is they send out notices and they say, come in and sign up: zero interest rate. What they forget to tell the consumer is that for any reason whatsoever, through a bait-and-switch scam, they can raise interest rates. So 5 years before, you were late on a student loan, you were late on an automobile payment, suddenly, you are going to be paying 15, 20 percent interest, and you do not know it.  This legislation rejected any effort to protect consumers in that way, not only outlawing this bait-and-switch scam, but even preventing strong disclosure. This legislation should be defeated, sent back, and improved.                              {time}  1815
