 Some Members on our side have not studied the amendment as much as they felt they should and have some questions about it. I would say there are two things. One is understanding completely the impact of your amendment, which obviously is a legitimate concern. The other is that kind of makes a determination whether some Members on our side would want to take some action, maybe with an amendment to the amendment. That decision has not been made. My guess is that decision is not going to be made today. That decision will be made tomorrow.
