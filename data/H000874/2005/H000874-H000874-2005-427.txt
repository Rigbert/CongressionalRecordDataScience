I will then ask about the Social Security and/or pension or combination thereof. There was some talk it might be before recess. Now we have read some comments it might not be until September. Can the leader shed some light on the majority's view when that will come forward?  Mr. DeLAY. As the gentleman knows, the Committee on Ways and Means has had a number of hearings on Social Security and retirement security in general. In addition, the Committee on Education and the Workforce passed a bill relating to a number of issues related to defined benefit pension plans before the July 4th district work period. There are additional ideas related to retirement savings building support within this House. I expect that the House will focus on these issues in the fall.
