  I understand your concern is with the H-2A part of the bill. The other part of the bill is for different States because what happens in my State is, these crews work different produce. They go from one harvest to another to another to another because the harvests are staged at different times. So the bill has two component parts to it.  Of course, we are willing to talk. We are happy to sit down and talk. But we tried to do that with you, as you know, and I thought we had a product that we agreed to.  My understanding is the Senator from Idaho would like to ask a question.
