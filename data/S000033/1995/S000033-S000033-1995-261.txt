 The multinational corporations put big ads in the newspapers saying, NAFTA is a good deal. Working people and their unions fought back against NAFTA. Environmentalists understood the terrible environmental impact that NAFTA would have. Consumer groups fought against NAFTA. But we could not defeat the enormous amount of power and money that was arrayed against us.  Since NAFTA has gone into effect, the figures that I have seen indicate that we have lost some 50,000 American jobs.  As the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio] just indicated, at a time that historically we have always had a trade surplus with Mexico, we have a terrible trade deficit internationally, but we have always had a surplus with Mexico, for the first time now, we are running a significant trade deficit.  The gentleman is right, in January the deficit was $800 million in 1 month, and it is predicted that the trade deficit will mushroom and grow. The standard of living of Mexican workers is plummeting with the devaluation of the peso.  And now, atop of all of that, American workers who have lost their jobs because of NAFTA are being asked to bail out American speculators and billionaires in Mexico because the peso was devalued and the L.A. Times appropriately I think correctly indicates that most of our bailout money is going back to Wall Street and to wealthy Mexicans.                              {time}  2100
