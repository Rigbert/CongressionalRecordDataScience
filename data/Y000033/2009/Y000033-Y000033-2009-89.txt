This project provides for the creation of a comprehensive planning process for law enforcement in the Borough and to implement immediate improvements to the Village Public Safety Officer program by recruiting and training new officers. This will help to bring up the level of law enforcement and public safety in the Borough, which is currently completely inadequate and provide Borough citizens with the same protections afforded those Americans throughout the country. The State of Alaska provides contract funds for the Village Public Safety Officer program. It is my understanding that $250,000 will be used for public safety planning process and $250,000 for Village Public Safety Officer Hiring and Training.  Requesting Member: Congressman Don Young  Bill Number: H.R. 1105  Account: Department of Commerce, NOAA--Operations, Research and Facilities  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: The Alaska Sea Otter and Steller Sea Lion Commission  Address of Requesting Entity: 6239 B Street, Suite 204, Anchorage, AK 99518  Description of Request: I have secured $300,000 for a Steller Sea Lion Comanagement, Biosampling and Outreach/Education program.

The second approach will consist of training approximately 25 coastal Alaskans on proper sample collection and technique and protocols from those sea lions harvested for subsistence. This will help fulfill the mandates created by the Marine Mammal Protection Act and help promote responsible and sustainable subsistence harvesting. It is my understanding that the money will be spent on: Personnel: $130,000, Travel: $64,000, Supplies: $15,000, Community Monitoring Contracts: $50,000, Biosamplers: $10,000 and Administrative Support: $31,000.

Bogard Road, Suite 203A, Wasilla, AK, 99654  Description of Request: I have secured $864,000 to support the work of 12 Soil and Water Conservation Districts in Alaska. Specifically, this program would allow the Alaska Association of Conservation Districts to manage statewide natural resource concerns such as invasive plants, water quality and soil erosion due to global climate change. Assuming percentages remain the same, funding would include 53.5% for salaries and personnel, 9.3% for fringe funding, 6.7% for travel funding, 4.3% for equipment, 4% for supply funding, and 16.7% for contractual funding.

Box 725, Craig, AK 99921  Description of Request: I have secured $250,000 for Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Projects in the City of Craig. The City has previously received funds form the State of Alaska's Village Safe Water Program, but because of delays in funding distribution and escalating project costs the funding received has not been able to fulfill the requirements for the approved projects. All funds appropriated will be used for the construction or replacement of waterlines, wastewater lines, lift stations, and other utilities. The total project will cost $1.2 million. However, the grantee has received $973,000 from the State of Alaska's Village Safe Water Program. The $250,000 included in this appropriation will complete the project.
