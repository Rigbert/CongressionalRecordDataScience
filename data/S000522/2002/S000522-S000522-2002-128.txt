Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4592) to name the chapel located in the national cemetery in Los Angeles, California, as the ``Bob Hope Veterans Chapel.''  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4592       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. NAME OF CHAPEL LOCATED IN THE NATIONAL CEMETERY IN                    LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.       Notwithstanding section 531 of title 38, United States      Code, the chapel located in the national cemetery located in      Los Angeles, California, shall after the date of the      enactment of this Act be known and designated as the ``Bob      Hope Veterans Chapel''. Any reference to such chapel in any      law, regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the      United States shall be considered to be a reference to the      Bob Hope Veterans Chapel.
