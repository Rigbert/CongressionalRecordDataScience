Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. John Rouse. He is celebrating his 30th anniversary as the editor of the Bowie Blade News, a hometown newspaper located in Bowie, Maryland, in the heart of my district.  The first amendment states, and I quote, ``Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.'' This first tenet of freedom in the Bill of Rights is vigorously exercised by the thousands of hometown newspapers that act as watchdogs for the American public against intrusion on its rights and property by the government and by others.  Newspapers across the country oversee elected officials' conduct and performance, reporting the facts and offering praise or criticism on their editorial pages. It is the prism by which many Americans gain their insight on just what is happening in the world, in America, and even right next door.                              {time}  1415  We lament the fact that sometimes they are wrong, as human beings are wont to do, but most times they are right. In any event, they are absolutely essential to the continuation, to the growth and the vitality of democracy.  John Rouse, Mr. Speaker, has made an extraordinary contribution to his community by fulfilling this watchdog role in Bowie, Maryland, for 30 years. After serving in Vietnam as an Air Force officer, John joined the Bowie News as editor and became the editor and general manager of the new Bowie Blade News in 1978 when the two papers merged.  John reports issues fully and fairly and often shows his keen sense of humor. He is an adept writer, a skilled editor, and very much in tune to the needs, the hopes, and the vision of the people of Bowie. John's skills earned the Bowie Blade the 1999 Best in Show award by the Maryland, Delaware and D.C. Press Association, and his walls are covered by numerous other awards he and the paper have won over the years. The paper itself has received dozens of accolades under his stewardship.  Bowie, Mr. Speaker, is a vibrant community that has grown rapidly and changed greatly over the past 30 years. The city is in many ways a microcosm of the changes that have buffeted this country over the past few decades, from increased suburbanization to greater diversity. It certainly is no easy task to keep one's hand on the pulse of such a community, but that is exactly what John Rouse has been able to do for 30-plus years. He has kept himself constantly connected with the issues that are important to the city of Bowie and to its people.  John has snapped and growled at me more than once. I know that my colleagues can empathize with that in dealing with some of their local editors. But he has been an editor that I have been always in respect of. I always appreciate that his goal is to advocate for the best interest of his city, of his county, his State, and his country. He and I have grown to be friends and to hold each other in mutual respect and esteem.  Our democracy, Mr. Speaker, cannot continue to thrive without the likes of John Rouse, without whom the electorate would have a much harder time discerning fact from fiction when it comes to their local politicians, their community leaders, and the policies that are proposed.  So today, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say thank you, thank you to John Rouse, an editor of a small paper. Unlike Katherine Graham, not known worldwide, but equally important in the strength of our democracy, equally important to the informed citizenry of his community. I want to wish him the best of luck as he continues as the editor of this great little paper.                          ____________________
