 President, the 40th anniversary of NASA is historic. It does have an impact on my State of California. I want to take a moment and wish NASA a happy birthday. I want to salute the fact that they have captured the world's imagination with missions such as the Mars Pathfinder and the Hubbell Space Telescope. Experiments and technological feats performed on Space Shuttle missions are paving the way for a permanent presence in space.  Mr. President, as I said, I join my colleagues in recognizing the many historic achievements that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has made in its forty years of service.  This is a particularly exciting period for our space program, not simply because NASA is celebrating its 40th Anniversary but more importantly because of the major advances being made in the exploration of our solar system.  As I said, in recent years, NASA has captured the world's imagination with missions such as the Mars Pathfinder and the Hubble Space Telescope. Experiments and technological feats performed on Space Shuttle missions are paving the way for a permanent presence in space.  One of the most telling signs of our changing world is that, NASA, whose original mission was national defense in the cold war with the Soviet Union, is now working with Russia to develop the first International Space Station.  I am very proud to say that some of NASA's most valuable research has been accomplished in my home State of California. In 1958, the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena built and controlled the first United States satellite sent into orbit. In the four decades that have followed, JPL has contributed to the exploration of most of the known planets in our solar system.  The full list of JPL's role in planetary exploration is far too long to address here. But I want to mention one recent accomplishment. In December of 1996, NASA launched the Mars Pathfinder, another JPL built and controlled spacecraft.  The Pathfinder successfully placed a rover on the surface of the red planet that beamed-back pictures that were viewed around the world with awe. I actually had the unique pleasure to visit JPL last year and was actually able to send commands up to the rover and then watch and see the rover move based on the command. It was rather amazing because the computer I was on actually went to a station in the desert which then beamed it directly to Mars, and so a few minutes after I pressed the command into the computer, I actually watched the rover move on the planet Mars. It was an amazing experience.  California is also home to one of NASA's premier research laboratories, the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. NASA Ames provides research in the fields of supercomputing, software development, and automated reasoning. As the lead center for Aviation Operations Systems, Ames manages the research effort in air traffic control and has the major responsibility for wind tunnel testing and simulation.  As California has been a major partner in NASA's success in the past, we will continue to lead as we move into the 21st century. NASA has developed a strategic plan that will build on its accomplishments with a renewed focus on scientific research and the application of a new cutting-edge technology. I am confident that California will continue to provide the backbone for this program.  I want to take a few moments to talk about what I believe is one of the most remarkable feats in the history of a space program filled with remarkable feats. Later this month, the Space Shuttle Discovery will be embarking on Mission STS-95. As we know, our colleague, Senator John Glenn will be making his second trip into space on this flight. While his presence will certainly be missed here in the Senate, I know my colleagues share my pride in his achievements and wish him the best on his historic return to space.  On February 20, 1962, John Glenn piloted the ``Friendship 7'' spacecraft on the U.S.'s first manned obtial mission. During the almost 5 hour flight, Senator Glenn worked on some of the first technical and medical experiments ever performed while orbiting the Earth.  Now, more than 35 years after that first flight, Senator Glenn will soon be returning to space. It is interesting to note some of the advancements that have been made since that first ground breaking flight.  The shuttle's flight will last 9 days instead of 5 hours, it will orbit the planet at 345 miles an hour rather than 16, and it will circle the Earth 144 times rather than 3. The comparison between these two flights capsulizes the advancements that have been made in the space program and it is remarkable that one man will experience both.  Senator Glenn has done more to promote our space program than perhaps any other person. Millions of people held their collective breath as he led the country into orbit of the Earth in 1962 and the world will again watch as he leads NASA into the next century.  Mr. President, it is with great pride and respect that I pay tribute to the many achievements NASA has made in its first 40 years. I know that I stand with the rest of the nation in anticipation of what will be accomplished in the next 40.                          ____________________
