 President, I ask unanimous consent that the following letter of resignation from the U.S. Air Force Academy Board of Visitors be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                                     July 8, 2015.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.     Vice President of the United States, The White House,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Vice President: I have been honored to serve as a      member of the U.S. Air Force Academy Board of Visitors for      the past four years. I have appreciated the opportunity to      represent and advise one of the finest military academies in      the world.       Serving as a member of the Board has been one of the great      honors of my career. However, due to my increasingly      demanding schedule, I regret that I must resign from my      position. I am fully confident that your next appointee will      be an outstanding person of character who embodies the values      and ideals of the U.S. Air Force.       Again, thank you for the opportunity to serve the men and      women of the Air Force Academy.           Sincerely,                                                Lindsey O. Graham,     U.S. Senator.                          ____________________
