President, Vermont is a very small State with special people. For those of us who live there we have the opportunity to get to know many within our State. One who has given his life to the people of his community and parish is Father Philip Branon and I would like my colleagues to have the opportunity to read this recent article about him that was in the Burlington Free Press on April 8, 2001.  The article follows:               Vt. Priest Celebrates 50 Years on the Job                           (By Sally Pollak)       South Hero--Philip Branon was a teen-ager when the priest      at his local church, St. Patrick in Fairfield, called him      into the rectory and suggested he consider the priesthood.       ``It must be because I was a pious child,'' the Rev. Branon      said, laughing at the thought, ``Or maybe my mother told him      to. I don't know.''       If it were his mother's idea it was a sound one, the right      choice for the sixth of 10 Branon children--a Fairfield      farmboy who still associates Sunday Mass with morning chores.       Branon, 74, will mark the 50th anniversary of his      ordination into the priesthood Wednesday. He has spent more      than half that time--30 years--serving the Catholic community      of Grand Isle County, celebrating Mass, comforting the dying,      baptizing babies. He joins one other Vermont priest, the Rev.      George Dupuis of Arlington, who is still active after half a      century.       If Branon anticipated 50 years of anything, it was nothing      more than living.       ``I'm just very grateful that I have lived for the 50      years, and that I have good health,'' Branon said. ``I also      have the wonderful privilege of being brought up in a good      family with a lot of help and warmth from my brothers and      sisters.''       Branon celebrated his first Mass on April 15, 1951,      reciting the service in Latin in St. Patrick Church, his      childhood parish. The Rev. William Tennien, the pastor who      suggested Branon's priesthood, shepherded Burlington drivers      who couldn't get through the muddy Franklin County roads to      the event.                             over the years       Since that first service, Branon has celebrated more than      17,000 Masses, an average of seven a week. He will say      once again this morning, at St. Joseph Church in Grand      Isle, one of three churches in his parish. The service      will be followed by a celebration of his priesthood.       Alice Toth, a South Hero teacher, plans to attend. She has      been a parishioner at St. Rose in South Hero, Branon's home      church, for 33 years. Toth appreciates his ``special gift''      for reaching the elderly and ill.       ``He's a very caring pastor,'' she said. ``And he's a true      Vermonter in the sense that he's really close to nature in      his sermon and his message.''       Branon's first church was St. Paul in Barton. Then Mass was      in Latin and his sermons were delivered in French and      English.       He had no choice: He was informed by the Bishop that he      would not be ordained if he didn't learn French.       He picked up sufficient French in conversation with other      students at St. John's Seminary in Boston, ``I got along well      in Barton,'' he said. ``Even though I didn't always know what      I was saying.''       Branon became the pastor at the University of Vermont's      Newman Center in 1957, and served there for 14 years. He      called it ``the best place a priest could be'' when the      changes of Vatican II were introduced.       At UVM, bringing together his two loves--family and the      Church--he asked a wood-worker from the Fairfield hills,      Frank Moran, to carve a crucifix from a piece of black cherry      that belonged to Branon's father. It remains at the chapel      today.                           Good Vermont stock       Thirty years ago, Branon moved to the Champlain Islands,      where he lives in South Hero and serves three island      churches. He has chosen to stay because he loves where he      lives, has firm roots in the community, and is not far from      family and his childhood home.       ``His contributions to the islands cannot be      overestimated,'' said Max Reader, the retired pastor of the      Congregational Church in South Hero.       ``He's down to earth.'' Reader said, ``He's quite honest      and he's very understanding. He's of good old Vermont stock      and he's just got all these good qualities that make him a      very, very fine priest.''       Branon feels that perhaps his most important contributions      are made at funerals. He estimates that he has presided over      15 to 20 during each of the last 30 years.       ``I'd rather do funerals than weddings anytime,'' he said      Thursday morning after Mass. ``At a funeral, it's all honest.      It's really and truly a teachable moment, the best chance for      a priest to talk to a number of people who don't go to      church.''       He considers the most important part of his job bringing      Communion and comfort to the elderly and ill who can't get to      church. Thursday after Mass, Branon--a slow walker and      deliberate talker--placed a bible and some bread in his Chevy      Corsica and prepared for a dozen Communion house calls.       ``It comes down to the purpose of our ministry,'' he said.      ``The purpose of the priesthood is to help people go to      heaven. When you're dealing with sick people and old people,      you're pretty apt to be dealing with people who are close to      it.       ``Over the years, you find out that sick people know      they're sick. You try to help people understand it, help them      face death.''       The deaths are not only a time for comfort and compassion,      but a chance to learn about the families who live on the      islands. ``If I had written down two or three lines about      every person I buried,'' Branon said, ``I'd have a wonderful      history of the islands.''                             Farming family       The history of the Church and his family are of great      importance to Branon. His family has been farming in      Fairfield for about 130 years, working a farm that was      started by his great-grandmother, Mary O'Neill Branon.       She was widowed in the 1860s when her blacksmith husband,      Irish immigrant Anthony Branon, was killed by the kick of a      horse. Mary Branon took her two children and walked 17 miles      from Swanton to Fairfield, driving cattle as she went.       Branon and his nine siblings--seven brothers and two      sisters--grew up on the nearby     farm settled by Mary O'Neill Branon's son, Edward. He fondly      recalls the Sunday mornings of his childhood, a satisfying      mix of chores, Mass and fox hunting.       His mother was devout, but it is his father's definition of      sin that has stayed with the priest: ``He said, `I was      brought up to figure you can't commit a sin unless you want      to,' '' Branon recalled.       And it was his father, brother of a priest and a nun, who      took the time to fall to his knees and pray before going to      the barn to care for a sick horse.       These stories of family and faith nourish Branon as he      approaches 75, as he makes his rounds to comfort the elderly      and ill.       He has no plans to retire, no plans to leave South Hero.      ``I owe it to God and the people to keep going as long as I'm      worth anything,'' he said.       In his parish home, alone at night, Branon thinks of his      own mortality and finds comfort in these words: ``May the all      powerful Lord grant me a happy life and a peaceful death.''       Maybe not the exact words of the night prayers, concedes      the priest with 50 years' experience. But close enough.                                  ____                              Branon File       Who: The Rev. Phillip J.
