Madam Speaker, each year Congregation Beth Sholom of Anchorage selects a distinguished Alaskan to receive its annual ``Shining Lights'' award. The Shining Lights award has a dual purpose, in that it expresses appreciation for the honoree's contributions to the 49th State and its people, and also inspires others to emulate the honoree's good works, in the spirit of ``Tikkun Olam''--the repair of the world. This year, 2010, Congregation Beth Sholom has chosen former State Senator Arliss Sturgulewski to receive the Shining Lights Award.  I proudly commend the selection of Arliss Sturgulewski as the recipient of the 2010 Shining Lights Award. I remember when Arliss was a state senator between 1978 and 1992, was the Republican candidate for Governor of Alaska in 1986 and 1990, and served as an elected member of the Anchorage Charter Commission and the Anchorage Assembly. In addition to her elective offices, Arliss has served on numerous boards and commissions, such as the Municipality of Anchorage's Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Examiners and Appeals.  A parent herself, Arliss's interest in Alaska's youth has been made manifest by her leadership as a trustee for the Anchorage YMCA, and at the University of Alaska through her service as a member of the Advisory Council for the School of Fisheries and Ocean Services, the University of Alaska Foundation, and the Anchorage Chancellor's Council. A graduate of the University of Washington, Arliss was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Alaska Anchorage.  The immeasurable contributions of Arliss Sturgulewski are an inspiration to Alaskans in all regions and walks of life. In particular, it is certain that Arliss has inspired many Alaska women to either seek public office or to become otherwise involved as political, business and community leaders, to the great benefit of Alaskans everywhere.  I would like to congratulate Arliss and Congregation Beth Sholom on the occasion of this well-deserved award.                          ____________________
