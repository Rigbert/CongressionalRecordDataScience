Pitts and his wife, Doris Pitts. Today, I ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember these two incredible people who dedicated their lives in service to our country. On Tuesday, December 30, 2008, Lt. Gen. Pitts passed away at the age of 89. Doris followed eight weeks later on March 1, 2009.  Lt. Gen. Pitts' father was a career military officer. Lt. Gen. Pitts was born at March Field Hospital, located in Riverside, California, on Thanksgiving Day 1919. When he was 10 years old, Lt. Gen. Pitts took his first airplane ride and vowed to become an Air Force pilot. In 1943, he graduated from West Point and flew 25 World War II missions against Japan in a B-29 Superfortress. In his last mission in the bomber, he was shot down off the coast of Japan but was able to parachute out of the plane and was rescued by a submarine.  After Lt. Gen. Pitt's heroic service during World War II, he was steadily promoted and earned three stars. He served as a NATO commander in Turkey, four tours at the Pentagon and also as a diplomat in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, England and Taiwan. In 1972, Lt. Gen. Pitts returned to March Air Force Base as the Commander of the 15th Air Force. His military decorations and awards include the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with an oak leaf cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross with one oak leaf cluster, Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, the Distinguished Unit Citation Emblem with one oak leaf cluster and the Purple Heart.  In 1975, Lt. Gen. Pitts retired from the Air Force and he and his wife, Doris, made Riverside their permanent home in the 1990s. He was active in the March community during his retirement, helping to keep the base open during the Base Realignment and Closure process. In honor of his efforts, March erected a stone post at the parade grounds on the base. He was also a board member of the March Field Museum.  Doris Mansfield Pitts was born in New York City on January 17, 1924. She was the only daughter of Lillian and John Mansfield, a Spanish American War veteran and newspaper executive. She attended Barnard School in New York and worked for IBM during World War II. She met her husband at West Point and they were married following the war on December 22, 1948. She served her country as a supportive military wife, joining and complimenting her husband throughout his highly successful military career. Doris relocated her family settling in more than 15 locations during their time in the Air Force. Doris was a loving wife, mother of three daughters and grandmother to four grandchildren.  On December 22, 2008, Lt. Gen. Pitts celebrated his 60th anniversary with his wife Doris. Lt. Pitts and Doris are survived by their daughters Dale, Alisha and Linda; sister Nanetta Atkinson; and four grandchildren.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men like Lt. Gen. Pitts who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. In the case of Lt. Gen. Pitts, he was blessed to have the love and strength of his wonderful wife to help him along the way. Lt. Gen. Pitts and Doris Pitts were dear friends and above all, they were patriots. They will both be sorely missed but their legacy and service to our great nation will always be remembered.                          ____________________
