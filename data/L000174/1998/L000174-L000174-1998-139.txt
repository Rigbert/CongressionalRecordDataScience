I too regret that we were limited in our ability to provide funding. Unfortunately, the funding allotted to the 150 account is inadequate to meet all our foreign policy needs. I believe the members of the subcommittee made best efforts to fund all worthy programs including the Peace Corps. There may be opportunities to review some of these levels in conference.
