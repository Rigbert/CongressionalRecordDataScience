 President, I rise today to applaud the patriotism and service of the residents of Edmonson County in my home State of Kentucky. Earlier this week, the local Bowling Green, KY, newspaper, the Daily News, published an article entitled ``Edmonson Leads U.S. in Army Recruitment.'' Edmonson County, located in the central part of the State, has the highest percentage of Army recruits in the country--quite an accomplishment, and a wonderful symbol of patriotism and sense of service that is evident not just in Edmonson County, but throughout the Commonwealth. According to the Army, Edmonson County ``produced the most enlistments for the Regular Army, Non-Prior Service'' as compared to the total national population of 15-24 year olds.  Kentucky has a proud military heritage. The Bluegrass State is home to widely recognized military installations such as Fort Knox and Fort Campbell. Our Guard and Reserve units continue to proudly serve on the front lines of the global war on terror. The people of Edmonson County are carrying on Kentucky's longstanding history of service and are proving their dedication and support as the United States continues to fight the terrorism. I am proud to represent such loyal and selfless citizens.  Mr. President, I ask that the entire Senate join me in expressing great admiration and gratitude to the people of Edmonson County, KY, for their patriotism and service. I ask unanimous consent that the full article from the Daily News be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Bowling Green Daily News, July 29, 2007]                Edmonson Leads U.S. in Army Recruitment                         (By Ameerah Cetawayo)       Edmonson County, the home of nationally known Mammoth Cave      National Park, made headlines recently for another reason--     having the highest percentage of Army recruits in the      country.       For every 1,000 young people in the county, about 11 of      them decided to join the military in 2006.       For a county of about 12,000 people, the statistics magnify      patriotic values, as well as the notion that more people from      Edmonson County are leaving for Bowling Green and surrounding      areas, according to leaders in the educational and business      community.       According to military data analyzed by the National      Priorities Project, a nonprofit research organization,      Kentucky ranked 27th in the nation for the percentage of Army      recruits.       The Army recruited 990 people from the commonwealth last      year, about a 3 percent increase from 2005, according to NPP.       Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Defense said the      Army failed to meet its goal of 8,400 recruits for June by      about 16 percent, with only 7,031 nationwide joining.       Brian Alexander, principal of Edmonson County High School,      said having options for college is one explanation for why      Edmonson County ranked high. Alexander said the latest      graduating class of a little over 100 earned $250,000 in      scholarships.       ``Our kids are looking for opportunities. Right now, the      military offers substantial financial opportunity to allow      young men and women to pursue post-secondary careers,''      Alexander said, adding that joining the military also gives      young people the opportunity to see different parts of the      world.       Take a look at Edmonson County's courthouse in Brownsville      and it's easy to see that military organizations are very      active in the area, according to Edmonson County Schools      Superintendent Patrick Waddell.       ``One of the biggest reasons we probably have ranked high      in that area is we're a very patriotic county,'' he said.      ``The different services of the military are very active in      the county. They do a lot of programs that are      extracurricular activities in the middle school and high      school.''       Waddell also said the percentage who go to college or a      technical or trade school would be about the same as other      districts.       ``Being proud of your community and proud of your county      and being proud of America, that's a very positive attribute      of Edmonson County,'' Waddell said.       Sarah Childress, executive director of the Edmonson County      Chamber of Commerce, said small-town values are alive and      well in Edmonson County.       ``I'm not saying things are different here, but it may have      something to do with the way young people have been raised,      to have that instilled in them at a young age, to want to      serve their country,'' Childress said.       The appearance of a lesser amount of opportunities in      Edmonson County may be a small factor also, she said.       ``Anyone can go to Bowling Green, Louisville and Nashville      and find a good job and commute. They can move if they      want,'' Childress said. ``We don't have a lot of industry      here.''       The biggest employer in Edmonson County is the board of      education, followed by the county's highway department and      local banks, Childress said.       ``There is something out there for everybody, and Bowling      Green is growing so much and moving even closer to southern      Edmonson County,'' he said. ``There is so much industry going      on in Bowling Green there is plenty out there for      everybody.''       Other recruiting and retention statistics for the active      and reserve components last month showed:       The Navy finished with 3,999 recruits. Its goal was 3,924.      The Marine Corps exceeded its goal by recruiting 4,113 new      Marines; its goal was 3,742. The Air Force met its goal of      2,233 recruits.       Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force met or exceeded      overall active duty retention missions.       Five of the six reserve components met or exceeded their      Reserve forces recruiting goals in June. The Air National      Guard was the only reserve component to miss its goal,      finishing at 75 percent with 779 of its goal of 1,036. The      Army National Guard recruited 5,342 soldiers surpassing its      goal of 5,338. The Army Reserve and Navy Reserve finished at      108 percent of their goals with 5,255 and 1,013 recruits,      respectively.       The Marine Corps Reserve recruited 1,078 Marines,      surpassing its goal of 986 at 109 percent. The Air Force      Reserve met its goal of 597 recruits.       Reserve forces retention numbers show Army National Guard      retention was 107 percent of the cumulative goal of 26,405,      and Air National Guard retention was 98 percent of its      cumulative goal of 8,430. Both the Army and Air Guard are      currently at 101 percent and 99 percent of their end      strength, respectively. Losses in all reserve components for      May are well within acceptable limits, according to the      DOD.--Source: U.S. Department of Defense                          ____________________
