Speaker, today our new Speaker spoke of the majesty of this House. He spoke of 208 years of history. He spoke of the light of the world, this democracy, America.  It is our Constitution that gives this democracy its grace and its reverberation around the world.  Whether you agree or disagree, no one disagrees that this issue is of constitutional magnitude. My freshmen friends who want open meetings and the elimination of ghost voting do not come to this House and say to the American public that we will give 10 minutes per side of an issue of constitutional magnitude. If we retain the majority again and require a 3/5ths vote to repeal any action taken by the previous Congress, would any of you stand still for such an act? I think not.  Reject this provision.
