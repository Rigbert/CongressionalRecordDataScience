 DeFAZIO. Well, I understand it is not the policy of this Congress or this administration to interfere in those workings of the market, but as an individual Member of Congress and someone who is concerned about humanity worldwide, I kind of would like to see us take a stand there. I mean slave labor, prison labor, child labor; it seems to me these are sort of basic things that should be allowed and should be part of your trade policy. Project your values, and, yes, this is even more radical to talk about maybe looking toward the people at home and protecting their jobs.  Now say, oh, well, you are talking about protectionism. I say no, I am just talking about leveling the playing field. Let us not have unfair competition. Let us not let American firms go south of the border and dump their pollutants out the back-door into the rivers in Mexico. Let us have them follow the same environmental laws there. Let us allow the Mexican people to organize and strike and not be bullied or even killed sometimes by their own government because they are trying to organize and help their wages. If we get level playing field, then workers all around the world will benefit, and I think these companies will ultimately do well too. They forget something:  In America, in our country, we have kind of a compact. As the middle class grew, the companies did better because they could consume the goods. They seem to have forgotten that now because with families desperate more and more to make ends meet, they are becoming less and less capable.
