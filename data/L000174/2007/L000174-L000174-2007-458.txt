President, I am pleased that today the Senate has agreed to S. Res. 146, a bipartisan resolution establishing a national American Eagle Day, on June 20, 2007, the day the bald eagle was selected as our national emblem during the Second Continental Congress in 1782. I am delighted that the bald eagle is scheduled to be ``delisted'' from the Endangered Species Act on June 20 of this year. I commend Senators Alexander and Byrd for their work on this resolution.  The bald eagle has been protected under Federal law since Congress passed the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act in 1940. This law prohibits the taking, possessing, or commerce of both bald and golden eagles. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 reinforced protection of the bald eagle. I am a longtime supporter of the Endangered Species Act, a landmark environmental law that provides crucial protection to fish and wildlife on the verge of extinction.  Vermont is actually one of the only States in the continental United States without nesting bald eagles. Senator Jeffords funded a program about three years ago where orphaned or threatened nestlings were relocated from sites between Maryland and Maine to nests in the Dead Creek State wildlife management area in Addison County, VT, along Lake Champlain.  About 25 individual birds were successfully raised and released from nests there. While eagles usually return to nest in the general area where they were nestlings, it can take up to 4 years. Vermont fish and wildlife staff are closely monitoring the effort to see if Vermont will be successful in joining other states as a home to the bald eagle.  I support the passage of this resolution, which would allow all of us to celebrate the successful recovery of the bald eagle, and to remember the freedoms and ideals that the eagle represents as a symbol of our country.                          ____________________
