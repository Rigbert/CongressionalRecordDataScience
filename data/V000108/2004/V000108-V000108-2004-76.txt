Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the many accomplishments of Peoples Bank throughout its 94 years of service in the Northwest Indiana community. To commemorate this special occasion, Peoples Bank will be holding an anniversary celebration on Saturday, January 10, 2004, at the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana.  Peoples Bank was established in 1910, and was organized to meet the needs of consumers. Peoples Bank was originally known as The First Polish National Building and Loan Association. During that time, it was the main hub for church and social activities in East Chicago, Indiana. Over several decades, the association's name changed numerous times, and in 1989 it was entitled Peoples Bank.  Peoples Bank was the first savings and loan association to ever receive a federal charter in East Chicago after the Great Depression. In the 1950s, the bank played an integral role in assisting former servicemen to build or purchase homes through G.I. Loans. At this time, Peoples Bank expanded its access to the Northwest Indiana community by moving into a multi-office operation. The Woodmar section of Hammond was chosen as the second office location along Indianapolis Boulevard.  It was during the 1960s that Peoples Bank added another branch location in Merrillville. Due to the success of these initial offices, additional branches were established in the area including Dyer, Munster, Schererville, and a second Merrillville office. In the year 2000, Peoples Bank opened its eighth branch location in Hobart.  Peoples Bank's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. David Bochnowski, has served as the leader for the organization since 1981, after serving on the board since 1977. Through his guidance, along with all the hard work of the staff, Peoples Bank has continued to be an active force in providing superior customer service and assistance to all of Northwest Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Peoples Bank on their 94th anniversary. Their many great accomplishments and hard work throughout the years is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
