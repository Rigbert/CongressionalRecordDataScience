President, I am pleased to rise today, recognizing the fifth anniversary of the American Legacy Foundation, an organization dedicated to educating Americans on the dangers of tobacco use.  In 1964, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service officially recognized that cigarette smokingcauses cancer and other serious diseases. However, 40 years later, tobacco use remains the Nation's leading preventable cause of death. Tragically, tobacco use continues to affect the lives of millions of Americans, particularly plaguing our Nation's young people. Each year, smoking kills more than 440,000 people in the United States, and millions more suffer from serious tobacco-related illnesses.  Established in 1999 under the Master Settlement Agreement, the American Legacy Foundation has developed national programs that address the health effects of tobacco use. Tobacco prevention programs play a vital role in decreasing tobacco use among youth, and the Legacy Foundation's innovative antismoking campaigns have had a significant impact in reducing tobacco use, especially among our Nation's youth. As a result of their continuous dedication, millions of Americans are living healthier lives.  Unfortunately, the future of the American Legacy Foundation is in question. This year the foundation received its last payment from the Master Settlement Agreement. Because of this dramatic reduction of resources, all of the successes of the last 5 years are in jeopardy.  I am pleased to stand here, recognizing the achievements of the American Legacy Foundation. I know that my fellow colleagues will join with me in applauding the efforts of the Legacy Foundation and congratulating them on their fifth anniversary. I hope that they will also join with me in pledging continued support for this life-saving cause. Only with such concerted action can we avert millions of premature deaths and prevent future generations of young people from falling victim to the tobacco epidemic.                          ____________________
