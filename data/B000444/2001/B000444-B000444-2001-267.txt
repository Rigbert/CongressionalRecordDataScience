 President, substance abuse is one of our Nation's most pervasive problems. Addiction is a disease that does not discriminate based on age, gender, socio-economic status, race or creed. And while we tend to stereotype drug abuse as an urban problem, the steadily growing number of heroin and methamphetamine addicts in rural villages and suburban towns shows that is simply not the case.  We have nearly 15 million drug users in this country, four million of whom are hard-core addicts. We all know someone--a family member, neighbor, colleague or friend--who has become addicted to drugs or alcohol. And we are all affected by the undeniable correlation between substance abuse and crime--an overwhelming 80 percent of the two million men and women behind bars today have a history of drug and alcohol abuse or addiction or were arrested for a drug-related crime.  All of this comes at a hefty price. Drug abuse and addiction cost this Nation $110 billion in law enforcement and other criminal justice expenses, medical bills, lost earnings and other costs each year. Illegal drugs are responsible for thousands of deaths each year and for the spread of a number of communicable diseases, including AIDS and Hepatitis C. And a study by The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, CASA, shows that seven out of ten cases of child abuse and neglect are caused or exacerbated by substance abuse and addiction.  Another CASA study released last week revealed that for each dollar that States spend on substance-abuse related programs, 96 cents goes to dealing with the consequences of substance abuse and only four cents to preventing and treating it. Investing more in prevention and treatment is cost-effective because it will decrease much of the street crime, child abuse, domestic violence, and other social ills that can result from substance abuse.  The bill I am introducing today with Senators Hatch, Leahy, DeWine and Thurmond authorizes more than $900 million a year for prevention and treatment programs to reduce the criminal justice, health care, and human costs associated with substance abuse.  We know that if someone gets through age 21 without smoking, abusing alcohol, or using drugs, they are unlikely ever to have a substance abuse problem. That is why prevention programs for kids are vital. This bill provides $200 million a year in grants to drug prevention programs like those run by the Boys and Girls Clubs and by law enforcement through the DARE program to get the message out to kids that drugs can ruin their lives.  While there is good news that overall drug use has stabilized among students, there is also bad news--use of Ecstasy by high school seniors has increased more than 66 percent. Prevention programs funded by this Act will get the message out to kids that drugs like Ecstasy are incredibly dangerous--even if their friends or a cover story in the New York Times Magazine might make it seem like it is ``no big deal.'' Studies show that Ecstasy can damage regions of the brain responsible for thought and memory. If that isn't a big deal, I don't know what is.  This bill also authorizes additional funding for drug treatment, which is desperately needed. Every year since 1989, I have published my own drug report, each of which has advocated a three-prong approach to address the drug problem--prevention, treatment and enforcement. I have always urged more money for treatment because it always gets the short end of the stick.  Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease. And as with other chronic relapsing diseases--such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma--there is no cure, although a number of treatments can effectively control the disease. According to an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in October, the rate of adherence to the treatment program and the relapse rate are similar for drug addiction and other chronic diseases--meaning that treatment for addiction works just as well as treatment for other chronic relapsing diseases.  Unfortunately, only two million of the estimated five million people who need drug treatment are receiving it. The Drug Abuse Education, Prevention and Treatment Act takes steps to close this ``treatment gap'' by targeting drug treatment to rural and economically depressed areas, funding adolescent treatment and residential treatment centers for women with children, and increasing funding for the National Institute on Drug Abuse--whose brilliant scientists conduct 85 percent of the world's research on drug abuse--to conduct clinical trials on new treatments for addiction.  The bill also reauthorizes two key programs created in the 1994 Biden Crime Law that fund prison-based drug treatment in the state and federal systems.  Providing treatment to criminal offenders is not ``soft''; it is smart crime prevention policy as the Key and Crest programs in my home state of Delaware have shown. If we do not treat addicted offenders before they are released, they will return to our streets with the same addiction problem that got them in trouble in the first place, and they are likely to re-offend. This is not my opinion; it is fact. More than 80 percent of inmates with five or more prior convictions have been habitual drug users, compared to approximately 40 percent of first-time offenders. Re-authorizing prison-based treatment programs is a good investment and an important crime prevention initiative.  This legislation would also re-authorize the drug court program, a program I have championed and introduced legislation to reauthorize. The Federal Government has funded drug courts since 1994 as a cost-effective, innovative way to deal with non-violent offenders who need drug treatment. Rather than just churning people through the revolving door of the criminal justice system, drug courts help these folks get their acts together so they won't be back. When they graduate from drug court programs they are clean and sober and more prepared to participate in society. In order to graduate, they are required to finish high school or obtain a GED, hold down a job, and keep up with financial obligations, including drug-court fees and child-support payments.  Drug courts have been proven effective at keeping offenders with little previous treatment history in treatment, providing closer supervision than other community programs to which the offenders could be assigned, reducing crime and being cost-effective.  According to the Department of Justice, drug courts save at least $5,000 per offender each year in prison costs alone. That says nothing of the savings associated with future crime prevention and freeing scarce prison beds for violent criminals. But most important, more than 500 drug-free babies have been born to female drug court participants, a sizable victory for society and the budget alike.  This Act also includes my ``Offender Reentry and Community Safety Act of 2001,'' which creates demonstration programs to oversee the reintegration of high-risk, high-need offenders into society upon release. These individuals have served their prison sentences, but they pose the greatest risk of re-offending because they lack the education, job skills, stable family or living arrangements, and the substance abuse treatment and other mental and medical health services they need to successfully re-integrate into society.  According to the Department of Justice, 1.25 million offenders are now living in prisons and another 600,000 offenders are incarcerated in local jails. A record number of those inmates--nearly 590,000--will return to communities this year. Historically, two-thirds of returning prisoners have been re-arrested for new crimes within three years.  The safety threat posed by this number of prisoner returns has been exacerbated by the fact that states and communities can't possibly properly supervise all their returning offenders. In fact, parole systems have been abolished in thirteen States, and policy shifts toward more determinate sentencing have reduced the courts' authority to impose supervisory conditions on offenders returning to their communities.  The demonstration reentry programs created by this bill would help supervise these people when they are released from jail and make sure they get the mental health, substance abuse and other services they need so that they won't go back to a life of crime and can be productive members of our society.  I believe that the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention and Treatment Act is a good piece of legislation. Strong treatment and prevention programs are a vital part of a comprehensive drug strategy. Forestalling drug abuse and treating it when it occurs is sensible policy in terms of saving money, preventing crime and sparing lives. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
