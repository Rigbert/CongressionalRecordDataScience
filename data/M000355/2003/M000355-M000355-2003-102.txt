 I think what is clearly happening here is the Michigan Senators want to pick circuit judges in a Republican administration.  I remind everyone, the two Michigan Senators are Democrats. My recollection is that the Senator from Kentucky and I may get to recommend judges for the circuit court but we don't get to pick them in a Republican administration, so why should any Democrat Senator expect they would get to pick circuit judges in a Republican administration?
