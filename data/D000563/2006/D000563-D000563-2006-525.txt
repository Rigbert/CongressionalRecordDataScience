I am glad this day has finally come. This matter has been on the calendar for over a year.  For over a year, millions of Americans have been wondering when the Senate will take this up. Finally, it has been scheduled. A lot of people outside this Chamber had a lot to do with it being scheduled. First Lady Nancy Reagan stood up and spoke up when she saw the late President suffering from Alzheimer's. Her voice has made a difference. I salute her for that. Christopher and Dana Reeve, both gone now, in their lifetime, the dedication and energy they put on this issue made all the difference in the world.
