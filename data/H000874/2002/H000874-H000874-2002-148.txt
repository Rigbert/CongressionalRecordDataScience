Speaker, I call upon Members of the House to have self-respect for this institution and for our rules and for our process. This is called a self-executing rule. It is an unfair rule.  Let me read from the chairman of the Committee on Rules, the predecessor to the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier). He said, ``The guiding principles will be openness and fairness. The Rules Committee will no longer rig the procedure to contrive a predetermined outcome. From now on, the Committee on Rules will clear the stage for debate, and let the House work its will.''  This is a self-executing rule. It executes fairness. It executes good process. It executes bipartisanship. It executes comity. It executes trust. It executes opportunity for partnership on this critical issue.
