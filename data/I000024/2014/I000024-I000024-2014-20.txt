President, it is my honor to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Marine Cpl Thomas A. Blair of Wagoner, OK who lost his life on March 24, 2003, from injuries sustained during a lengthy battle with insurgents while serving his Nation in Nasiriyah, Iraq.  The son of Alfred Jr. and Nancy Hinton Blair, Tommy was born July 7, 1978, in Wagoner, OK. After graduating from Broken Arrow High School, he entered the Marine Corps in 1997 and was assigned to the 2nd Low Altitude Air Defense Battalion, Marine Air Control Group-28, 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, Cherry Point, NC.  Tommy was posthumously awarded the Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal for helping pull nine wounded marines into an armored vehicle before it was hit by at least four enemy rocket-propelled grenades and then a missile fired from an American attack plane. He was among 18 marines killed that day in fighting around Nasiriyah.  Tommy was laid to rest in Ozark Memorial Park Cemetery in Joplin, MO, and is survived by his father Alfred Jr., mother Nancy, and brother Alfred III.  ``He was a young man that would give the shirt off his back if someone needed it,'' recalled his older brother, Marine SSG Alfred Blair, III. ``He lived life to the fullest and enjoyed every minute of every day. In his first letter home to our mom, he said he was doing what he had been trained to do and was proud to be doing it for his country.''  Today we remember Marine CPL Thomas A. Blair, the first known native Oklahoman to lose his life in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                         Captain John J. Boria  Mr. President, I also pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Air Force Capt. John J. Boria of Broken Arrow, OK, who died on September 6, 2004, after injuries sustained in a all-terrain vehicle accident while serving his nation in Doha, Qatar.  Javy, as he was known by his family and friends was born on August 12, 1975. After graduating from Union High School in Tulsa, OK, in 1993, I nominated this bright young man to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy. He spent a year at the Academy's Prep School before entering the U.S. Air Force Academy, where he graduated in 1998. Upon completing flight training, he was assigned as an instructor and KC-135 pilot at the 911th Refueling Squadron at Grand Forks Air Force Base, ND, and was deployed to Qatar to work in the Combined Air Operations Center in June 2004.  Funeral services were held on September 14, 2004, at Broken Arrow Assembly of God Church, with internment at the U.S. Air Force Academy Cemetery in Colorado Springs, CO. Javy is survived by his parents John and Wanda and brother Joe.  His favorite Bible verse in John 15 states, depending on the translation, that ``no greater love has a man than he lay down his life for his friends,'' his mother said. When discussing becoming an organ donor with his mother during his junior year at the Academy, Javy said, ``I want to be a donor too. If I die and part of me could be used, it could give somebody else a chance to live the life that I won't have.''  Today we remember Air Force Capt. John J. Boria, a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                 Chief Warrant Officer Travis W. Grogan  Mr. President, I now pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Army CWO Travis W. Grogan, who died on November 27, 2004, after the aircraft he was a passenger in crashed in Bamian, Afghanistan.  Born an only child on January 12, 1973, Travis grew up just outside Oklahoma City, OK, and graduated from Moore High School. Descending from a long line of servicemen, with relatives who served in Korea, World War I, and the Civil War, he initially enlisted in the Navy, where he served for 9 years as a search-and-rescue swimmer. Later, he became interested in flying and transferred to the Army to become a helicopter pilot with the 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, Light, Schofield Barracks, HI. He had been in Afghanistan since April 2004.  ``He died for our freedoms here in America,'' Barbara Grogan said of her only son. ``This was important to him, and it should be important to everyone in America. Our freedoms are worth fighting for.''  Travis is survived by his wife Tracy; daughter Ashley; son Austin; parents, Barbara and Lewis; and grandmother, Wilma North.  Funeral services were held on December 9, 2004, at the First Baptist Church in Moore, OK, with burial conducted at Ft Sill National Cemetery in Elgin, OK.  ``He knew why he was in Afghanistan. He was very proud of being able to serve his country,'' said his grandmother. ``If they had found him wounded, he would have said, Doctor me up; I'm going back'.''  Today we remember Army CWO Travis W. Grogan, a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                      Specialist Jared D. Hartley  Mr. President, it is my honor also to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Army SPC Jared D. Hartley, of Newkirk, OK, who died on July 15, 2005, of injuries sustained after an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle in Taji, Iraq.  Jared was born January 2, 1983, and enlisted in June 2002. After basic training he was assigned to 125th Forward Support Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, based at Fort Riley, KS.  Jared was a 2002 graduate of Newkirk High School, where he played football and basketball. He joined the Army shortly after graduating high school and deployed for a 13-month tour in Iraq. ``When he came back, he was going to get out of the military, but they told him they needed him,'' his brother Alex Hartley said. ``He said, `No problem, I'll stay in as long as you need me'.'' He returned for his second tour in March.  Alex said his brother was committed to the military's mission in Iraq and pleased with the positive response he received from the Iraqi people. ``He said people he talked to were glad they were there. Protecting our country and helping people--he felt good about his mission.''  Jared was buried at Newkirk Cemetery and is survived by his parents, Doug and Kathie, and his brother Alex.  Today we remember Army SPC Jared D. Hartley, a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                  Lieutenant Colonel Daniel E. Holland  Mr. President, I wish to remember the life and sacrifice of Army LTC Daniel E. Holland, of San Antonio, TX, who died on May 8, 2006, of injuries sustained when his vehicle encountered an improvised explosive device while he served his Nation in Baghdad, Iraq. Daniel was a veterinarian assigned to South Plains District Veterinary Command at Ft Hood, TX, attached to the 352nd Civil Affairs Command at Fort Bragg, NC.  Daniel was born in Munich, Germany, on April 5, 1963, the youngest of 10 children. His father retired from military service in Marlow, OK, where Daniel graduated from high school in 1981. Selected to give the commencement address at his high school graduation, he went on to attend Oklahoma State University on an ROTC scholarship, transferring after 3 years into OSU's College of Veterinary Medicine. His dreams were realized when he was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army in 1984. He and Sheryl Patton were married in August 1985 in Stillwater, OK.  Burial services with full military honors were held at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery on May 31, 2006.  Daniel is survived by his wife Sheryl; son Garrett; daughter Rachel; parents, Col (Ret.) and Mrs. Herbert S. Holland, Jr.; parents-in-law, Bancker and Lana Cade; brothers and sisters (and their spouses), Col (Ret.) Robert F. Holland (Carol), Mark M. Holland (Josie), Patricia Nixon (Thomas), David W. Holland (MaryAnn), Mary K. Ralya (Steven), Maj (Ret.) John R. Holland (Rita), Claire Nieswiadomy (Michael), Catherine Ochoa (Joseph), and Elizabeth Blute (Peter); sister-in-law, Kellie Robinson; and many beloved nieces and nephews.  Today we remember Army LTC Daniel E. Holland, a man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                  Private First Class Daniel R. Parker  Mr. President, it is my honor also to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Army PFC Daniel R. Parker, who died on August 12, 2003 from injuries sustained when he was thrown from his vehicle after the driver swerved to avoid an oncoming vehicle while serving his Nation in Mosul, Iraq.  Dan was born August 17, 1984, in Oklahoma City and later moved to Lake Elsinore, CA. An active member of ROTC in high school in Lake Elsinore, CA, he followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, enlisting in the Army at the age of 17, just 2 weeks after graduating from Lake Elsinore High School. His first assignment after completing training at Ft Sill, OK was B Battery, 2nd Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault, Fort Campbell, KY.  Deploying for the first time in March 2003, Dan was part of the team sent to the villa where two sons of Saddam Hussein were hiding on July 23, 2003. After the gunfight that killed Odai and Qusai Hussein, Dan's photo was taken by media and he was on the cover of the Los Angeles Times standing in front of the building, holding his gun.  Dan was laid to rest in Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, CA, and is survived by his parents, Billy and Sherri Parker; three brothers, Dustin, Dalton, and Dallas; and a sister, Danielle.  Just before Dan deployed, his father drove to Nashville, TN, to spend time with him. ``We drove around Nashville, went out to Opryland, drove down Music Row. I told him no one has a guarantee on the number of years you got. We don't know what the number is, but the important thing is every day you do what you're supposed to do,'' said his father.  ``Not one time, ever, did I think that he wasn't going to walk through that door back home, but that's OK. I'm not disappointed in the 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years that he didn't have. I'm excited about the 18 he did have. He was able to touch so many people's lives,'' Billy Parker said.  Today we remember Army PFC Daniel R. Parker, a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                  Private First Class Joshua F. Powers  Mr. President, I wish to remember the life and sacrifice of Army PFC Joshua F. Powers, of Skiatook, OK who died on February 24, 2006, of noncombat related injuries while serving his nation in Baghdad, Iraq.  As the youngest of three boys, Joshua was born February 11, 1985 and enlisted in July 2005. After basic training he was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, KY. He had been in Iraq for just over two weeks.  Josh was buried at Osage Garden Cemetery, Skiatook, OK where Army personnel honored him with a 21-gun salute and played ``Taps''. He is survived by his mother Patricia; father Ernest; and brothers Michael and Jonathan.  At the funeral service, an elder at Sperry's Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, C.H. Whiteman, said Joshua was doing what he thought was right. ``If it weren't for young men like him, we couldn't enjoy the kind of life we have in America,'' he said.  Today we remember Army PFC Joshua F. Powers, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                      Specialist Bryan L. Quinton  Mr. President, I also wish to remember the life and sacrifice of Army SPC Bryan L. Quinton, of Sand Springs, OK, who died on May 4, 2006, of injuries sustained when a rocket propelled grenade struck near his vehicle while he served his nation in Baghdad, Iraq.  Born June 29, 1981 to Timothy and Kristi Quinton in Tulsa, OK, Bryan enlisted in the United States Army on January 15, 2004 and completed basic training and advanced individual training at Fort Leonard Wood, MO. He served in Alpha Company, 2nd Engineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division, Camp Giant, Korea before being reassigned to Bravo Company, 5th Engineer Battalion, Ft Leonard Wood, MO.  On the day he died, Bryan, like he had done so many times before, insisted on being in the ``point''--the lead vehicle in a 12-vehicle convoy checking for bombs. ``Let me make it safe for everyone else,'' he was quoted as saying. No one would travel those highways until he and his comrades gave the ``all-clear signal,'' said BG Todd Semonite, commander of the engineer school at Fort Leonard Wood, MO. Everyone looked to him for their own personal safety.  Funeral services were held on May 17, 2006 at First United Methodist Church in Sapulpa, OK. The road leading into the Green Hill Memorial Gardens Cemetery was bordered on both sides by scores of American flags, snapping in the breeze. Nearly 100 motorcyclists, many of them veterans from previous wars, stood at attention along the flag-lined road as the funeral procession glided past them. As eight Army pallbearers pulled the silver-colored casket from the hearse, a bagpiper in the distance softly played ``Amazing Grace.'' His wife Cyndi was given the folded flag that draped the coffin as her husband was honored by a 21-gun salute and the playing of taps.  Bryan is survived by his wife Cyndi; daughter Pyper; son Connor; parents Tim and Kristy Quinton; brother Garth; brother Brent and his wife Alison; nephew Clay Quinton; grandmother Barbara Weaver; and grandfather Grady Quinton.  ``My heart died when my husband did, but I know he would want us to think about all the crazy stunts he pulled and all the laughter,'' Cyndi said. ``God, you are very lucky to have him! Heaven, just get ready to laugh!''  Today we remember Army SPC Bryan L. Quinton, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                      Specialist Stephen M. Scott  Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Army SPC Stephen M. Scott of Lawton, OK, who died on August 23, 2003 from non-combat injuries sustained while serving his nation near Fallujah, Iraq.  Born in San Antonio, Stephen moved several times before settling in Lawton, OK. He met his wife Marie in a psychology class before graduating from Eisenhower High School in Lawton and the couple married on July 4, 2002.  Stephen joined the Oklahoma National Guard in 2001 and he and Marie chose to go on active duty a year later. Stephen was a cook assigned to 2nd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and Marie worked community relations for the 14th Public Affairs Detachment in Fort Carson, CO. He deployed to Iraq in June 2002. While she was aware of the risk involved in her husband's deployment, Marie never thought her office would be handling a news release announcing his death.  ``Especially not Stephen,'' she said. ``He was amazing. I'm so sad, but sometimes I can't help but smile. He was so goofy he would make you laugh. He was very spiritual. He was very strong. We had a lot of plans.''  Today we remember Army SPC Stephen M. Scott, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                     Sergeant Danton K. Seitsinger  Mr. President, it is my honor also to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Army SGT Danton K. Seitsinger of Oklahoma City, OK, who died on January 29, 2004 when a weapons cache detonated west of Ghanzi, Afghanistan.  Kyle was born on October 4, 1974 and graduated from Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, MO, in May 1993. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps on December 7, 1993 and spent his 6 years guarding U.S. embassies in Brasilia, Moscow and the consulate in Rio de Janeiro. After separating from the Marine Corps in 2000, he attended Oklahoma Christian University and enlisted with the 486th Civil Affairs Battalion, Army Reserve, Broken Arrow, OK.  While at Oklahoma Christian University, Kyle worked for the student newspaper, serving as an editor for 2 years. In 2002, he was selected as one of 16 student journalists to participate in the Summer Institute in Journalism sponsored by the Coalition of Christian Colleges and Universities. His assignments included interviews with the Colombian president as well as U.S. Representatives Ernest Istook and J.C. Watts. In 2003, Kyle spent 6 months in Costa Rica in a program designed to immerse the learner in the Spanish language. While serving in Brasilia, he ``adopted'' two young poor girls and urged his family to send them gifts. He wasted no time, rising early to explore the many cities he visited. It is as though he knew he needed a faster pace to complete his life.  Just 12 months short of his graduation with a dual major in journalism and Spanish, Kyle was called to active duty in November 2003 and deployed to Afghanistan.  Kyle is survived by his father Dan; mother Jo; and two sisters, Karla Seitsinger and Penny Owen Cockerell. He is buried in Headrick Cemetery in Headrick, OK.  Today we remember Army SGT Danton K. Seitsinger, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                     Staff Sergeant Steven W. White  Mr. President, I wish to remember the life and sacrifice of Army SSG Steven W. White of Lawton, OK who died on August 13, 2003 from injuries sustained when his M113 armored personnel carrier hit an anti-tank mine while he served his nation in Tikrit, Iraq.

Steven was laid to rest in Haven of Memories Cemetery in Canton, TX. He is survived by his wife Laniece and four children ranging in age from 12 years to 16 months.  ``He would always want to come home and visit with classmates and see his family,'' said his wife. ``He was a simple man. It didn't take much to please him.''  Today we remember Army SSG Steven W. White, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                    Lance Corporal Hatak Keyu Yearby  Mr. President, I also remember the life and sacrifice of Marine Corps LCPL Hatak Keyu Yearby, of Overbrook, OK who died on May 14, 2006, of injuries sustained from an improvised explosive device while serving his nation in Al Anbar province of Iraq. Hatak was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, III Marine Expeditionary Force, Marine Corps Base Kaneohe Bay, HI.  Hatak was born on March 11, 1985 in Overbrook, OK and graduated from Marietta High School in 2003 where he was remembered as a quiet, well-mannered young man who was a good student and person. A proud native American, he grew up attending powwows, where he performed and competed as a traditional Choctaw dancer. Good at his craft, he earned second place at the Trail of Tears Powwow in September 2003 and second-place at the Citizen Potawatomi Nation Intertribal Powwow in October 2004. Wearing two long braids much of his life, he woke one morning and told his mother he had to cut his hair because of a dream. He then joined the Marines in May 2005, married Lindsey Michelle in February 2006 and went to Iraq the following month.  About 1,000 people attended a funeral service meant to celebrate the life of the 21-year-old newlywed. Burial services were conducted at the Yearby Family Cemetery in Overbrook. OK.  Hatak is survived by his wife Lindsey; his parents, Justin and Mary Yearby; and two sisters, Shema Yearby and Samarrah Bell.  Today we remember Marine Corps LCPL Hatak Keyu Yearby, a youngman who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                          ____________________
