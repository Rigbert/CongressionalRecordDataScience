I was going to ask a question of the Senator. First of all, I realize that the Senator from Colorado and I both are among the strongest supporters of our national defense. The Center for Security Policy has us both rated as 100 percent. That is not an issue on the table. We both feel that way.  My problem is, No. 1, they have made the specific statement that it is not going to cost any more to have some supervision over the CAP because the time they spend trying to look into these things without the authority to do it is more time consuming than if they had the legal authority that we are trying to give them with our defense authorization bill. If you just take the money in the examples I used on the trip to Nassau and all of that, I think you would have to agree that the money would be better spent on spare parts than it would be on some of the double-dipping in which they have engaged.  I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Alabama.
