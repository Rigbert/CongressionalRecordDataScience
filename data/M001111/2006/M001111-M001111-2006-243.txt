 President, let me just add that I support the recommendation that Senator Stevens has just made, and if we are able to work that agreement out, I think that would be good.  I do want to amplify something quickly that I stated earlier in the debate, and it was repeated by my colleague from Alaska, and that is that DHS came to this decision without adequate consultation with other impacted Federal agencies. If there is any confusion over that question, I would like to put in the Record and ask unanimous consent to insert a letter from the Honorable Jeff Shane, Under Secretary of Transportation, to the Honorable Stewart Baker, the Assistant Secretary of Policy at DHS.
