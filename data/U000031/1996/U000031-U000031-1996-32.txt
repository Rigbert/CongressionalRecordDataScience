Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join with me in congratulating the Kalamazoo Central High School Mock Trial Team. They defeated 37 other teams to earn the National High School Mock Trial Championship held recently in Pittsburgh, PA.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating students Andrew Fink, Joelle Renstrom, Linnaea Eberts, Ursula McTaggart, Aida Hussen, Ghislaine Storr, Jordan Klepper, Aash Bhatt Sonya Datta-Sandhu, Nichk Dybek, and Coach Sherry Myers, Assistant Coach Keith Platte, and Legal Coach Kurt McCamman.  These students worked hard in preparation for this important event. Their many hours of commitment, practice and dedication stand as an inspiration to us all. I am confident that we will continue to hear great things about these students. We are counting on them to provide this Nation with the leadership that will carry us into the next century.  This accomplishment not only says a lot about the student, it also speaks well for the Kalamazoo Public School System and the many quality people there that are truly making a difference.  Again, Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Kalamazoo Central High School Mock Trial Team, winner of this year's national championship.                          ____________________
