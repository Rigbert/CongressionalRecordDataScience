Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2413 updates the Computer Security Act of 1987 to improve computer security for Federal civilian agencies and the private sector. The Computer Security Act of 1987 gave authority over computer and communications security standards and Federal civilian agencies to NIST. The Computer Security Enhancement Act of 2000 strengthens that authority and directs funds to implement practices and procedures which will ensure that the Federal standards-setting process remains open to public input and analysis. When implemented, the bill will provide guidance and assistance on protection of electronic information to Federal civilian agencies.  Since 1993, the General Accounting Office has issued over 35 reports describing serious information security weaknesses at major Federal agencies. In 1999, the GAO reported that during the previous 2 years serious information security control weaknesses had been reported for most of the Federal agencies. Recently, the GAO gave the Federal Government an overall grade of D minus for its computer security efforts. Specifically, hearings held by the Committee on Science earlier this year identified information security leaks at the Department of Energy and the Federal Aviation Administration that threaten our Nation's safety, security, and economic well-being.  Much has changed in the years since the Computer Security Act of 1987 was enacted. The proliferation of networked systems, the Internet, and Web access are just a few of the dramatic advances in information technology that have occurred.                              {time}  1400  The Computer Security Enhancement Act of 2000 addresses these changes, promotes the use of commercially available products, and encourages an open exchange of information between NIST and the private sector, all of which will help facilitate better security for Federal systems.  Finally, the legislation is technology neutral and is careful not to advocate any specific computer security or electronic authentication technology.  Mr. Speaker, while no single piece of legislation can fully protect our Federal civilian computer security systems, H.R. 2413 is a necessary step in the right direction. It has been unanimously supported by the Committee on Science and includes a number of provisions offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Gordon); the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella), chair of the Subcommittee on Technology; the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Barcia), ranking member of that subcommittee; and the gentleman from California (Mr. Kuykendall), a member of the Cyber Security Leadership Team of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert).  I urge all my colleagues to support swift passage of this bill today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
