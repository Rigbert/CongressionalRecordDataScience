Speaker, it is with great respect that I take this time to congratulate Lake County Parks and Recreation, as the organization celebrates its 50th anniversary. For half a century, the parks department has enhanced the lives of the residents and visitors of Northwest Indiana. In recognition of this milestone, the organization will be celebrating with numerous programs and events throughout 2018.   On June 1, 1968, Lake County Parks and Recreation was created by the Lake County Council. Back then, the department was working with nothing more than a dirt road running through two-hundred acres of land. However, the group's leaders, members, and volunteers had a vision for Lake County Parks and Recreation to provide a place for residents and guests to enjoy nature, host family gatherings, ride their bikes, accommodate children's activities, and conserve land.   Throughout the years, Lake County Parks and Recreation has surpassed its goals and exceeded its expectations, and it continues to progress. Today, Lake County maintains eleven parks and has preserved thousands of acres of open space, natural areas, historic sites, and trails. Due to the hard work and dedication of its numerous employees, volunteers, and elected officials, the department has exceeded all expectations. With over one million people visiting the park sites yearly, the organization truly adds to the quality of life in Northwest Indiana.   Lake County Parks and Recreation is recognized by the State of Indiana as being a progressive department. The organization provides numerous innovative educational and cultural programs for children and adults. Inaddition, through its efforts to restore and manage forested properties, wetlands, and prairies, the department holds storm waters, improves water and air quality, protects endangered species, and helps to maintain natural habitats. Lake County Parks and Recreation has won numerous awards and accolades for its great works, and it is certainly worthy of each and every honor.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Lake County Parks and Recreation on its 50th anniversary. For the past fifty years, the leadership, employees, and volunteers of the department have enhanced the lives of countless individuals through their unwavering commitment to the community of Northwest Indiana, and they are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
