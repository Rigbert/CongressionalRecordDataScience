As the new chairman of the Interior and Environment Subcommittee, I could not be more pleased that we are on the verge of passing the first Interior spending bill since fiscal year 2012. The Interior division of the omnibus is well balanced and reflects what can be achieved when all sides work together to find common ground.  I especially want to thank my friend and subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Moran, for his support. I hope passage of this bill is a sign of good things to come and look forward to working with Mr. Moran as we move forward on the 2015 Interior bill. I am sorry to learn that he will be leaving Congress at the end of this year, but I am happy to have the opportunity to work with him in the coming months.  I also want to thank Chairman Rogers for his incredible support and leadership and for his role in bringing this omnibus bill forward and restoring order to the appropriations process.  I also want to thank our wonderful staff who worked so hard during the holidays, virtually every day, including Christmas Day, to bring this bill forward. It is a good bill, and I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support it.
