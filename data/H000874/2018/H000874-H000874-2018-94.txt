Speaker, we will close now.  Neither of the questions that I posed were answered. And certainly the fact that there are 240 votes on this floor was not disputed, by the majority leader, for the Hurd-Aguilar, which addresses security at the border. By the way, cosponsored by Mr. Hurd, a Member of the majority leader's party. A Member from Texas who knows about the border and who, I presume, wants to keep it secure. The bill he has cosponsored has at least 240 votes on this floor.  This is the most closed Congress in which I have served, the most closed rules. That is a fact. And apparently it is closed to the majority, who want to move ahead on a bill and just have the opportunity to vote on it and to give the Speaker the opportunity to put something on the floor and have the House consider it, and have Ms. Roybal-Allard and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, Republican from Florida, have a bill on the floor and have it considered, and have Mr. Goodlatte, who did, in fact, have his bill on the floor, and it lost.  So, Mr. Speaker, I regret that I don't know what there is going to be next week, because we need to take action. And we need to take action not by compromising with one side of the aisle and seeing only capitulation by some. We do need compromise, we do need action, and we need action that can pass the Senate.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
