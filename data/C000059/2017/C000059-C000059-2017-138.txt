Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Riverside County Supervisor John J. Benoit, who passed away in California on Monday, December 26, 2016. John served the people of Riverside County in many ways throughout his life and he will be deeply missed.  John started his career in public service at the Corona Police Department. From there, he embarked on 29 years of service with the California Highway Patrol, which culminated with his promotion to commander of the CHP's Indio Station. After serving in law enforcement, John became increasingly active in his community. He was elected to the Desert Sands School Board before being elected to the California State Assembly in 2002. John ultimately served three terms in the Assembly during which time he passed significant legislation, including ``Aryanna's Law'' to enhance the protection of children in daycare centers. In 2009, John was appointed to the Riverside County Board of Supervisors to carry out the remaining term of his friend, Supervisor Roy Wilson, who had passed away. Throughout his life, John was a dedicated, effective and passionate advocate for the Coachella Valley and Riverside County.  As a member of the Coachella Valley community, John served in many service organizations, including as past president of both the United Way of the Desert and Indio Rotary. John was an avid pilot, who often flew himself and other legislators up to Sacramento when the Assembly was in session. John and his wife, Sheryl, were married in 1978, and later celebrated the births of their daughter, Sarah, and son, Ben.  I had the distinct privilege of knowing John for many years. I was proud to call him my friend and I will deeply miss him. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Benoit family, his friends, as well as his staff and colleagues. Although John may be gone, the many life-changing contributions he made here in Riverside County will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
