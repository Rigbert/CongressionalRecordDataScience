President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Bob Stiller, president and chief executive officer, and the 600 employees of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters on their selection as the Nation's top corporate citizen by Business Ethics Magazine. In the best traditions of Vermont, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is about more than making a profit--they are about fostering a strong commitment to corporate social responsibility.  Through the company's support of organizations like the Rainforest Alliance, a non profit dedicated to protecting ecosystems, and Coffee Kids, an international nonprofit seeking to improve the quality of life for children and families in coffee-growing communities, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters has been a pioneer in the fair trade coffee movement. The company has also taken its socially responsible mission into the halls of our government, when, in 2002, Green Mountain formed a joint alliance with the U.S. Agency for International Development aimed at improving the livelihoods for those in improvised coffee growing regions.  Green Mountain has maintained these strong corporate ethics while continuing to build a robust earnings record. In 2005, the company reported revenue of $161.5 million, with net income of $9 million, a 15-percent increase over the year prior. And in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, Green Mountain's fair trade coffee represented 26-percent of total sales, an increase of 68-percent compared to the same period last year.  I commend this outstanding Vermont company and ask unanimous consent that the Business Ethics article naming Green Mountain Coffee Roasters as the Nation's top corporate citizen be printed in the Record, along with a recent editorial from the Burlington Free Press.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From Business Ethics Magazine, Spring 2006]100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2006--Celebrating Companies that excel                at serving a Variety of Stakeholders Well       ``We take them coffee picking, and they do some hand      sorting of beans in the hot sun,'' says Winston Rost, Green      Mountain Coffee Roaster's director of coffee appreciation,      describing the annual trip he leads of a dozen employees,      visiting coffee-growing cooperatives in Vera Cruz and Oaxaca,      Mexico. With a newfound appreciation for how hard the work      is, some roasters say they'll never spill another bean again,      Rost adds. This kind of attention to the human element of      business offers a hint at why Green Mountain Coffee of      Waterbury, Vt., is No. 1 this year on the list of the 100      Best Corporate Citizens.       Since its founding in 1981, the company has been socially      and environmentally active, ``but it wasn't all that      extensive or organized at first,'' recalls CEO Bob Stiller.      Green Mountain upped the ante in 1989 when it formed an      environmental committee and created a rainforest nut coffee      to support the Rainforest Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to      protecting ecosystems. The company has grown increasingly      active in the countries where coffee is grown and has been a      pioneer in the fair trade movement, which pays coffee growers      stable, fair prices. But the biggest change came in the early      1990s when the company began sending its employees on trips      to see where the coffee is grown. Many employees ``said it      changed their lives,'' Stiller adds.       Green Mountain, with 600 employees, saw 2005 revenue of      $161.5 million with net income of $9 million, a 15 percent      increase over the year prior. Since 1988, it has donated more      than $500,000 to Coffee Kids, an international nonprofit      seeking to improve the quality of life for children and      families in coffee-growing communities. Through the Coffee      Kids program, the company supports a micro-lending facility      in Huatusco, Mexico and a sustainable sanitation system in      Cosaulan, Mexico. It also has provided financial support to      the FomCafe cooperative's quality control training program,      which helps farmers earn higher profits for coffee.       In 2006 Green Mountain will release its first corporate      responsibility report. ``We are focusing on measurement so we      can understand the economic and social impact of the company      and create indices so we can better focus those efforts,''      Stiller says. ``Just the process of getting all that      information in one place is valuable,'' notes Michael Dupee,      vice president of corporate social responsibility. ``It makes      you think about and gain insight into what's working and      what's not, so even if you never published anything, it's      worthwhile.''       In 2004 the company expanded from one executive in social      responsibility to three. Besides Dupee's position, there is a      director of sustainable coffee and a vice president of      environmental affairs. Some 45 percent of Green Mountain's      coffee is purchased farmer-direct, which cuts out the share      middle men take. And 20 percent of coffee sold is certified      fair trade, which incorporates principles of environmental      sustainability and respect for cultural identity, while      guaranteeing growers minimums of $1.26 per pound when      commodity prices might be far lower. Consumer interest in      fair trade is growing, Stiller says, ``because through their      purchases they are wanting to make a difference in the lives      of growers.''       Efforts like these have earned Green Mountain a spot in the      top 10 on Business Ethics' list for four years running. Its      meticulous attention to corporate social responsibility      conveys well what the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list is      about. The best-managed firms today--in this era when      societal expectations of business are rising--can no longer      focus solely on stockholder return. Companies that aim to      prosper over the long term also emphasize good jobs for      employees, environmental sustainability, healthy community      relations, and great products for customers.       Seeking to put numerical ratings on service to these      various stakeholder groups, the 100 Best Corporate Citizens      list uses data provided by KLD Research & Analytics of      Boston. It employs statistical analysis to identify those      major public U.S. companies that excel at serving a variety      of stakeholders well, using eight measures of service:      stockholders, community, governance, diversity, employees,      environment, human rights, and product.                                  ____            [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 29, 2006]               Waterbury Coffee Firm Deserves High Praise       Vermont should take pride in the accomplishments of Green      Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc., the Waterbury company named      the nation's top corporate citizen by Business Ethics      magazine.       For this company, which employs 600 people, the human      dimension clearly matters. Employees, the local community and      coffee workers in far-away places have benefited from Green      Mountain Coffee's refreshing divergence from the standard of      bottom-line business.       In its annual ``100 Best Corporate Citizens,'' Business      Ethics magazine praised Green Mountain Coffee for its      corporate social responsibility, in particular its commitment      to fair trade, a Free Press story said. Fair trade ensures      coffee growers are paid fairly with a guaranteed minimum      price. Sales of the company's fair trade coffee have done      extremely well, especially with a lucrative deal signed last      fall with McDonald's restaurants in the Northeast.       Not only are the company's ethics admirable, Green Mountain      also makes money--a winning combination that other businesses      should heed for long-term success.       Within the organization, employees receive a firsthand      education on the product they handle. Every year, a group of      U.S. workers travel to coffee-growing areas in Mexico to      experience the hard labor of picking and sorting beans.      According to the magazine's Web site, the annual trips have      given these employees a real appreciation of the work done in      Mexico. It can be a life-changing experience.       The magazine, which has compiled the corporate citizens'      list for seven years, has included Green Mountain Coffee in      four of those years, including a second place last year.      Chittenden Corp. was the only other Vermont business on the      list, coming in at 26th place. The bank also deserves      recognition.       To compile the list, eight measures of service are      considered by Business Ethics: stockholders, community,      governance, diversity, employees, environment, human rights,      and the product, the magazine's Web site said.       There are many companies in Vermont that take their social      responsibilities seriously. In 1990, Vermont Businesses for      Social Responsibility was created by a group of      businesspeople who shared the belief that companies have a      duty to their employees, the environment and their      communities as well as to their stockholders. Last month, the      organization named Green Mountain Power of Colchester its      ``Large Company Leader of the Year'' for the company's      socially responsible approach to business. It's an impressive      award, and a rare one for a utility.       With companies like Green Mountain Coffee, Chittenden      Corp., and Green Mountain Power in our midst, the bar has      been set high for other companies in the state and across the      country. Bravo to them for leading the way.                          ____________________
