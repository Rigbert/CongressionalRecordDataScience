Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.R. 1058.  Today, this day, April 15, is the due date for Americans to file their tax returns. On this day, it is important for the House to consider a taxpayer bill of rights.  This legislation would ensure that Internal Revenue Service employees are familiar with the rights guaranteed to taxpayers under the Internal Revenue Code. These include the right to be informed, the right to be heard, the right to privacy, the right to appeal, and the right to a fair and just system.  Mr. Speaker, we must do all we can to protect taxpayers' rights. In addition to passing this act, Congress must ensure that the agency has the resources it needs to properly serve American taxpayers. This year, American taxpayers finally felt the shock of the billion-dollar cuts to the agency's budget. Taxpayers seeking assistance waited in lines for hours. Few could reach a live person when they called the help hotlines, and according to press reports--to written reports, television, newspapers, and magazines--in New York, the Internal Revenue Service office even ran out of paper to print extra tax forms after taxpayers waited in long lines for hours. That is not right. That is not fair. That is not just.  The Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act takes an important step in the right direction. It is timely and it is just. I hope that we can come together to make sure that our constituents are receiving the services and the protections they deserve.  Again, I thank the gentleman from Illinois and my Republican colleague--the chairman--and others for bringing this bill to the floor today.  I reserve the balance of my time.
