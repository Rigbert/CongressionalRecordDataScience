 President, today I rise to recognize 35 Kentucky veterans who recently came to Washington, DC to visit the memorial they helped to inspire. A few weeks ago, this group of distinguished men and women were able to visit our Nation's Capital, some for the first time, because of the Honor Flight Program.  The Bluegrass Honor Flight chapter has brought over 600 veterans from Kentucky to Washington, DC, providing these brave patriots the opportunity to see firsthand the memorial built in their honor. The program provides transportation, lodging and food for these veterans, who otherwise may not have been able to visit the Capital or the monuments they inspired.  These brave individuals answered the call to duty by stepping up when their Nation needed them most. The sacrifices they made were extraordinary. With unyielding commitment to our great Nation, these men and women bravely served and defended the freedom and rights that we cherish. The courage shown by America's veterans will be long appreciated and never forgotten. And after their years of service, I am proud to be able to honor them today.  I would ask that my colleagues join me in honoring these Kentucky veterans:  Dewey Abrams, Charles Adams, Geneva Andress, Algernon Rowland, Jim Booher, Ralph Brewer, George Capito, Paul Chandler, Donald Cooper, Roland Davis, Miram Dewart, Cecil Dunn, Charles Wilson, Harris Gibboney, George Hauck, Joe Hutchins, Gerald Kincaid, Robert Koegel, Anne Laing, John Fultz, William Malcolm, Edward Martin, Cecil McGee, Frank Milburn, Howell Moore, Kenneth Oster, Obie Owens, Reverend Thomas Pittman, John Krabbenhoft, Dewitt Rowland, Elmer Susemichel, Donald Thom, Roger Tyler, William Warde and Richard Zapp.                          ____________________
