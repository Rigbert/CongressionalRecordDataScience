Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's proposition. I understand the administration has increased somewhat the monies for international peacekeeping, but the monies are critically needed, and although I did not have the opportunity, unfortunately, because I was late getting to the floor, to hear all of the comments of my distinguished friend, the gentleman from Illinois, I think we all agree that the United States' interests, our strategic interests, are served by fully participating in the U.N. peacekeeping process.  It is my understanding that there is not an American soldier right now involved in U.N. peacekeeping efforts outside of Kosovo, which is an OSCE, essentially, with U.N. participation. The fact of the matter, though, is I think we are foolish if we do not fund our fair share. One could argue about fair share, but in my view, we are certainly at this level, at this level, paying a share that is less than some other countries on a per capita basis.
