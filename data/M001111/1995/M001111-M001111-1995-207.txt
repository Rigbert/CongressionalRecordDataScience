 President. I thank my colleagues who have been here on the floor this morning working very hard to bring this nomination to a vote.  I remind everyone that the clock is ticking on the health of all Americans. Our Nation has been without a Surgeon General for 6 months.  I see this vote very clearly today: We are not voting on the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster today. We are voting on the opportunity for Members to vote on that nomination. A ``no'' vote will send a very clear message to women across this country. It denies women the opportunity to have a Surgeon General who specializes in women's health care.  A ``no'' vote denies teenagers across the Nation a spokesperson who can give them hope and opportunity and who believes in them.  A ``no'' vote sends a message to all Americans that public service is not something they should get involved in.  A ``no'' vote denies this country the service of not one man, but many future leaders.  A ``yes'' vote says this body is fair and will allow the vote of Dr. Foster to come before this body.
