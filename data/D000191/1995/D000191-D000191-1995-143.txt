Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I have to admit that I have seen some alternatives around the world that do intrigue me. If we are going to go to this broad of an exemption from secondary treatment, for instance in Hong Kong, I was there and on the ferry early one morning, and I noticed how they deal with it, they do not require secondary; in many cases they do not require primary treatment. They are a little oversubscribed to their sewer system. They have nifty boats that go around the harbor with nets in the front and they scoop up everything that floats, and if it does not float, it is not a problem. So I guess [[Page H4807]] you know if we cannot support the Pallone amendment, we can say we are headed in that direction. We can buy some of the nifty little boats from Hong Kong with the nets on the front and drive them around the beachfront areas in the morning before people go in for that swim, and you know if you cannot see it, it is not a problem.                              {time}  1115
