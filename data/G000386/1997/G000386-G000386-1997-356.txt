 President, today is the first day in which the Senate will entertain legislation for the 105th Congress. I rise today to compliment various tax bills introduced by my colleagues for myself. Some of this legislation is in the leadership package. Other legislation has been introduced separately by other Senators. All of this legislation will reduce taxes on Americans trying to live the American Dream. I applaud these efforts. In fact, I have had a hand in writing or cosponsoring much of it in the 104th Congress. With this new Congress, we must break down the barriers that stand in the way of the next generation's shot at the American Dream. Our future depends on it.  The initiatives I support include, reinstating the income tax deduction for interest on student loans, reducing the capital gains tax, expanding individual retirement accounts, extending the employer provided education assistance programs, and finally, reducing the estate taxes. Collectively, these tax bills will provide necessary relief for all taxpayers. Hard working families and individuals deserve nothing less from their Federal Government.                    student loan interest deduction  The leadership package includes legislation that includes my provisions from the 104th Congress to reinstate the tax deduction for interest on student loans. It would allow an ``above the line'' deduction for up to $2,500 in qualified interest. This means that students or their families will not have to itemize their income tax deductions to benefit from the deduction.  In 1986, the income tax deduction for interest on student loans was repealed. I believed then, as I believe now, that the repeal was a major mistake. Education is an investment both for students and the Nation. In exchange for hard work the student gets a tax deduction to make education affordable. In exchange for the student's commitment, the Nation gets a new taxpayer and sometimes a better citizen.  I commend the leader for selecting this initiative, and I welcome the opportunity to work with him to expand it.                      capital gains tax reduction  Senator Hatch introduced legislation to reduce the income tax on capital gains. It is substantially similar to legislation passed by the last Congress but vetoed by the President. Since the President has since committed himself to capital gains relief, I am encouraged about the prospects for enactment of our provision authored by Senator Hatch. The President has suggested much more narrow relief targeted at residential real estate. However, our broad-based cut is better for the small businesses, family farms, and individual taxpayers.  This morning, in testimony to the Senate Budget Committee, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said that the ideal capital gains tax rate is zero percent. Our bill would cut it in half. The President must consider our provision. Reducing the capital gains tax rate by 50% for taxpayers across the board, is essential to help grow the economy.                              super ira's  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Roth, has, once again introduced his legislation to expand the number of people who can invest in individual retirement accounts. This legislation is vital given the dismal rate of savings by Americans. Americans want to save money. The problem is that our current system of taxes does not allow it. The Super IRA provision will give taxpayers a better vehicle to save more for retirement. Since the miracle of compound interest means that saving sooner saves more, we must take up this bill as soon as possible.                 employer provided education assistance  Finance Chairman Roth was joined by Finance Ranking Minority Member Moynihan in legislation to make permanent the income tax exclusion for employer provided education assistance. I am a proud cosponsor of this bill. This provision is set to expire. Congress must step up to the plate and, finally, permanently extend it. Last time, over my objections, we failed to extend the provision for graduate assistance. All students must be eligible for this assistance program.                          estate tax reduction  The leadership package includes legislation to reduce the estate tax burden of all Americans. It is included as part of S. 2. Reducing, the estate tax is something that we almost accomplished in the last Congress. We need to take it up right away in this Congress. Historically, the estate tax was initiated as a temporary tax on the super wealthy during times of war. Later, it became a permanent part of the tax system, but still applied only to the rich. Over time, the effects of inflation have taken their toll. Now, we have middle income taxpayers hit with an estate tax burden intended for the wealthy. In my State of Iowa, we have a problem unique to us and other farm States. Some taxpayers have a double tax identity. They are cash poor because they have just enough cash-flow off of the farm to make ends meet. However, they are land rich because their family farm has appreciated during the period that they were family farmers. The estate tax ignores the fact that the farm is as much their family home as it is a business. The estate tax also ignores that they are middle income people at best, and were not intended to even pay the estate tax when it first came into being.  The leadership package is a good start. It cuts the estate tax for all taxpayers, including small businesses and farmers. Congress must find a way to improve the estate tax crisis in my State of Iowa, and other States. I look forward to continuing my work with the leader to accomplish an estate tax reduction.          alterative minimum tax on farmer deferred contracts  Finally, I want to make quick reference to tax repeal legislation that will be introducing tomorrow for myself and over 50 other original sponsors. Senators Dorgan, Gorton, Baucus, and I have campaigned to eliminate an IRS imposed tax on farmers and ranchers who sell crops or livestock on deferred contracts. Congress did not intend this tax. Only the IRS intends this tax. The broad bipartisan support that we have gathered tells me that Congress is going to repeal it. We will have more on this initiative tomorrow.                          ____________________
