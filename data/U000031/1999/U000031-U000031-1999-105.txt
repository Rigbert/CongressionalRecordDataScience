Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to a wonderful young woman, Evelyn Prince, who was tragically taken from us last week. Many of us here in the House of Representatives had the opportunity to meet Evelyn when she served with great pride and enthusiasm as a Congressional Page. I was honored to say she was ``our page'' from back home in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  The head of the Kalamazoo Close Up Program, Gerhard Fuerst, where Evelyn served as President from 1997-1999, described her simply as a ``sheer joy.'' He encouraged her to continue setting and meeting her own great expectations of herself, including participation in the Page program. He shared with me recently an article she wrote upon returning from Washington, DC. In the article, Evelyn encourages and challenges fellow students, as she so loved to do, to get involved in ``observing the inner works of government'' and to ``have fun while learning!''  After she completed the Page program, Evelyn traveled to Wolfsburg, Germany. There she was staying with a family as an exchange student as part of the Youth for Understanding program. It is there, too, that she met with the harsh fate of an automobile accident she did not survive.  Evelyn is remembered today as a talented and spirited 17-year-old. She was a dedicated student, earning straight-As and looking forward to attending college next year. But while she was focused on excelling at school, it is as a loyal friend and loving daughter and sister that she will be so sorely missed.  Evelyn's family shared her sense of adventure and her dreams for the future. Their lives were enriched immeasurably by her presence and are undoubtedly altered immeasurably by her absence. With a young person as talented, exuberant and ambitious the sky was the limit. Sadly, we will never know how far she could have soared with a long life. But we thank God for the contributions she made, the people she inspired and the happiness she created in her all too short life. I close with a poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay:My candle burns at both ends: It will not last the night;But, ah, my foes, and oh, my friends,It gives a lovely light.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues here in Congress to join me in extending our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Evelyn Prince. All members of the Congressional family send our thoughts and prayers especially to Evelyn's parents, DeeAnn and Charles ``Skip'' Prince, and her sister Lauren.  Evelyn was indeed a rising star whose lovely light still shines on the many people she touched.                          ____________________
