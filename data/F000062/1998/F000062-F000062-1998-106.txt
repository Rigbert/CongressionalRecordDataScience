 President, I wish to ask a question of the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from New Mexico, and the ranking member of the subcommittee, the Senator from Nevada; is it the understanding of the chairman and ranking member that there are enough funds available in the Solar and Renewable Resources Technologies/Biofuels Energy Systems account to continue the feasibility study and project development of a biomass ethanol plant in Plumas County, California?
