 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a native Louisville business that is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year, Louisville Plate Glass, and the company's owner, my good friend, Bill Stone. Louisville Plate Glass specializes in custom glass products such as laminated and insulated glass and was founded in 1911. The company is among an elite group of Louisville firms that have survived 100 years of business success.  Louisville Plate Glass has been hit hard by the struggling economy and faltering housing market that we are all familiar with, due to its close attachment to the real estate industry. Owner Bill Stone, 75, reclaimed ownership of the business in 2009 in order to ensure the business stays afloat. At the time, Bill was a partner in parent company United Glass Corp. when it announced its plans to sell Louisville Plate Glass to consolidate the company's business into other holdings outside the State.  Bill's pride took control however, and he decided to trade in a portion of his shares in United Glass Corp. to independently reacquire Louisville Plate Glass. ``It's not about money,'' Bill said. ``It's about pride now. It's about making it a success again.'' Bill says he is taking a ``survive-and-advance'' strategy with the business until the real estate market picks up again, and he rarely takes a salary from the company to further help company profits.  Louisville Plate Glass has recently had major projects at William Paterson University in Wayne, N.J., and also an outlet mall in New Hampshire, and Bill is optimistic that the real-estate industry will pick up soon and the business will grow. The company is also responsible for work on other notable projects in my hometown of Louisville, including Churchill Downs, the Humana Building, Louisville Slugger Field, Preston Pointe, and the University of Louisville Medical Faculty Building.  Bill is currently flirting with the idea of adding a tempering plant to grow the business. He says there is a ``50-50'' chance that he will invest in the new plant, which would add 20 employees and would bring in-house the production of safety and architectural glass work that is currently outsourced. The new plant would require several million dollars in investment, and Bill says his decision will be based upon whether he can secure State or local funding for the project.  ``I take a great deal of pride in this business,'' says Bill, as he is determined to protect the 30 employees currently working at the company's headquarters on West Broadway. For anyone who is concerned with surviving the current down economy in similar fashion, Bill has three suggestions: always keep a strong balance sheet with cash reserves even when times are good, build the best product and provide the best service and the money will follow, and finally, answer every client phone call and customers will take notice.  Mr. President, I would ask all of my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Louisville Plate Glass as it celebrates its 100th anniversary. Owner Bill Stone's wisdom and effective business practices will, I hope, provide the company with great opportunities for success moving forward. Louisville Plate Glass is an inspiration to the businesses of Louisville and the people of Kentucky, and it is my hope the company will continue to prosper in the years to come. The Louisville publication, Business First, recently published an article recognizing the company's accomplishments over the past 100 years. I ask unanimous consent that the full article appear in the Record as follows.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From Business First, Aug. 26, 2011]    Louisville Plate Glass Strives to Survive as It Marks Its 100th                               Anniversary                             (By Ed Green)       Louisville Plate Glass Co. owner Bill Stone admits that he      should be celebrating a major milestone.       His business, which traces its roots to 1911, is among an      elite group of Louisville firms to last 100 years.       Stone, a longtime Louisville businessman, recognizes the      achievement and said he is proud the firm has lasted this      long. But he's not exactly jumping for joy. Louisville Plate      Glass produces custom glass products, designing and      assembling products such as insulated and laminated glass.       Its business is closely attached to the commercial real      estate industry, so the company has seen declining business      in recent years as real-estate development and construction      practically halted, he said.                            Back In Business       That's one reason Stone, 75, took back ownership of the      business in 2009 from Louisville-based United Glass Corp., a      partnership in which he was involved.       Now, he said, he is working to get the business back on its      feet and protect the about 30 jobs remaining at the company's      headquarters and plant on West Broadway.       ``In our 100th year, we're taking a licking but keep on      ticking,'' Stone said.       He declined to say whether the business remains profitable      but said sales are in the ``mid-seven figures'' range and      about 40 percent of the record levels set in 2007.       Employment has dropped from its peak of about 50, but none      of the job cuts has come from layoffs.       Stone, who has been taking a salary from the business only      rarely, said he doesn't want to sound like the situation is      dire. But the last few years have been tough, he said.       ``I feel a great deal of pride in the business,'' he said,      adding that he could have retired with the money he earned      from the business and other investments.       Instead, in 2009, he traded in a portion of his shares in      United Glass, a company he helped found that owned several      glass businesses, to re-acquire Louisville Plate. He declined      to disclose the value of the sale, which was a cashless      transaction, he said.       Stone's decision, he said, came after his partners said      they were considering closing Louisville Plate Glass and      consolidating its business into other holdings outside the      state.       The partners sold the other United Glass assets earlier      this year to Florida-based private-equity firm Sun Capital      Partners Inc. for an undisclosed amount, and Stone now is      involved only in Louisville Plate Glass, he said.       Officials with United Glass could not be reached for      comment.       Stone said he is taking a ``survive-and-advance'' strategy      with his business until commercial real estate picks up.       ``It's not about money,'' he said. ``It's about pride now.      It's about making it a success again.''                   Business Starting to Pick Up Again       Stone said that although there is no clear end in sight to      the recession's impact on the real estate industry, he is      optimistic that business will return.       The company recently had major projects at William Paterson      University in Wayne, N.J., and at an outlet mall in New      Hampshire.       Stone said much of the work in the past couple of years has      come from the public sector, but he is starting to see more      plans coming together for private commercial real estate      projects.       There also is a lot of interest in improving the efficiency      of windows, which is one of the company's niches.       And Louisville Plate Glass has started selling fire-rated      glass that acts as a barrier to heat and is required in many      large buildings, such as schools, hospitals and public      institutions.                         Opportunity for Growth       Stone has not decided whether he will invest in growth but      said the chances are about ``50-50'' that he will add a      tempering plant to his Louisville operation.       The project would require an investment of several million      dollars and would add about 15 to 20 employees.       The plant would bring in-house the work, which creates      safety and architectural glass through heat treatments. The      company currently outsources the tempering work.       Stone said his decision likely will be based on whether he      can secure state or local incentives for the project. He      added that he has not yet sought help.       ``I just haven't decided if, at this point in my career, I      want to make that kind of investment.''                            Notable Projects       The following local structures have used Louisville Plate      Glass Co.'s products:       Churchill Downs       Fleur de Lis condominiums       The Green Building       The Humana Building       Louisville Slugger Field       Preston Pointe       University of Louisville Medical Faculty Building           Three Tips to Help Make it Through the Tough Times       Bill Stone offered these suggestions for how small      companies can survive when business is off and profits are      down.       1. Don't take all the profit out of a business when times      are good. Make sure the business keeps a strong balance sheet      with cash reserves. ``Almost every mistake can be traced to      instant-gratification desires,'' Stone said.       2. ``It sounds trite, but build the best product and      provide the best service, and the money will follow,'' he      said, adding that young businesses often are too focused on      the bottom line.       3. Answer all phone calls, letters and other forms of      communication promptly, and clients will take note. ``Do not      screen calls,'' he said, adding that staff at his office      never asks callers who they are. Instead, he said, he takes      all calls if he is available.                          ____________________
