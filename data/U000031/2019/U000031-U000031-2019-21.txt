Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Rush, the distinguished chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, as well as Mr. Pallone and Mr. Walden, for bringing this bill to the floor.  As the use of digital technology expands across the Federal Government and the private economy, there is a growing demand for energy to power our data centers, which are at the very center of this digital economy. With this growing energy demand comes, in fact, the growing need to identify areas to use energy more efficiently.  Introduced by Ms. Eshoo and cosponsored by a number of Energy and Commerce Committee members on both sides of the aisle, Mr. Kinzinger, Mr. Welch, and Mr. Tonko, H.R. 1420 updates an important provision of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to increase stakeholder involvement in the work to identify metrics and the best practices to improve the energy efficiency of data centers.  It also updates provisions to better track Federal programs to increase energy efficiency across the Federal Government's information technology. This is a practical update to an important program that no one should oppose.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1420, and I yield back the balance of my time.
