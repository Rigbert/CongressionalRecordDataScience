 When I looked at this, I thought of it as an innovation desert because I was looking for some new, fresh ideas. We have seen some of them from Senator Cantwell's State, and I think the Senator from Washington makes a veryimportant point with that poster because the reality is that this is a cap. This is a limit on what States are going to get. As I touched on in my comments, I think what is going to happen is this cap is not going to be enough money for the needs. I think this is going to slash the help for nursing home care under Medicaid, which pays two-thirds of the bill, and I think the nursing home care under this flawed TrumpCare proposal is going to get nickeled and dimed.  My colleague from Washington is right. I tried to read section by section, and we have read it several times. But we wanted to make sure to look--to my colleague's point--for innovation, and this proposal is an innovation desert.
