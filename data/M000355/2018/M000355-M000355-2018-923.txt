  On July 24, 1998, U.S. Capitol Police Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of American democracy. By doing their duty, these heroes helped cut short an act of brutal violence that could have claimed many more lives. That same week, Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson lay in honor in the Capitol Rotunda, and an entire Nation paid its respects.  I imagine 20 years have not made this senseless violence any easier to bear for the families these men left behind or for their brothers and sisters in the Capitol Police. Yet, as we remember their bravery, a triumphant example endures of selfless service and fearless heroism--of two men who embodied the values that keep this building and our Nation standing safe and sound.  Today, we honor Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut. We renew our condolences to their families. We recognize the depth of our gratitude for them and for everyone who puts on the uniform and steps into harm's way every single day.                          ____________________
