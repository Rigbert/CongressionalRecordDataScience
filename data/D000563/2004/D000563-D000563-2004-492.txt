 I can tell you, having spoken to people who have given their lives to the intelligence community, and risked their lives for America on a regular basis, they were angry and demoralized by this leak from the White House.  I think in order to get the proper answers to the important questions about the role of the intelligence community, we should try to make it as nonpartisan as possible, try to bring in the professionals who are viewed by both political parties as people of respect and people who ask the right questions, so the intelligence community will come forward with honest and objective answers.  The bottom line is not who wins this political battle in the hearts and minds of the American people. The bottom line is, who will win in terms of America's national security and defense. We need sound and solid intelligence now more than ever. The President's admission last week that there was a failure of intelligence leading up to the invasion of Iraq has really called on all of us to rise above party.  I think the Senator from California and the Senator from South Dakota are moving in the right direction toward an independent, bipartisan, and nonpartisan approach. I hope we do get this done quickly.
