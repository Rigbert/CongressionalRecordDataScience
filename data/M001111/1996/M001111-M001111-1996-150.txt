 President, I am pleased to be joining Senator Burns, Senator Leahy, Senator Dole, Senator Pressler and others in cosponsoring the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era Act of 1996. The strong bipartisan support for this bill emphasizes how important our national encryption policies are becoming and reflects Congress' growing awareness of the issues surrounding the production and sale of encrypted software and hardware. I commend Senator Burns and Senator Leahy for their efforts in putting this legislation together.  As many of my colleagues know, the Department of Commerce recently released a report stating there are tremendous international growth opportunities for software exporters in the next five to 10 years. Unfortunately, the Department of Commerce also acknowledged most U.S. companies don't pursue international sales because our export control laws are too cost prohibitive.  Rather than dissuading international sales, our national policies should be encouraging American companies to enter the global marketplace. American software producers are losing tens of billions of dollars in lost sales due to outdated export controls. I recognize there are legitimate national security concerns underpinning the Export Administration Act. However, these archaic laws are no longer relevant to the post-cold-war world in which we now live. Today's national export controls should target those items that really need to be controlled in order to maintain national security. Simply, they should make better sense; it doesn't make sense to tell U.S. software producers they can't export a product that is already widely available on the world market.  Senator Burns' bill makes sure our innovative private sector producers lead the way in developing acceptable encryption technology, and it makes sure government mandates and national export control policies do not hamper private sector developments.  Mr. President, I introduced the Commercial Export Administration Act in the 103rd Congress, and I am pleased Senator Burns is incorporating the spirit of my language in his bill. My language reduced regulatory red tape and made it easier to export generally available mass-marketed commercial software. Washington state is home to some of the most innovative software producers in the world, and they are eager to export their goods. Unfortunately, our export controls keep Washington state's companies from penetrating the world market.  Some of my colleagues may not know that Washington state's small and mid-sized high-tech companies provided more than 98,000 jobs in 1995.  Mr. President, I mention this because our bill will increase exports and enable our high-tech companies to grow further. Higher growth means more jobs--plain and simple. A recent study revealed U.S. software and hardware exporters lost $60 billion in potential 1995 sales, and the study estimates a loss of 200,000 jobs in the industry by the year 2000. Given the increase in international competition, we can no longer afford to hold U.S. companies back from potential world sales.  This legislation is badly needed, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Burns and me in supporting this bill.                          ____________________
