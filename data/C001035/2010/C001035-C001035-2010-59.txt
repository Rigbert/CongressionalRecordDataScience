President, I rise today to speak on the amendment that Senator Murray and I have been working on together that would expand the Financial Stability Oversight Council established in S. 3217 to include as nonvoting members a State insurance commissioner, a State banking supervisor, and a State securities commissioner. Concomitantly, I seek to remove the independent voting member position having insurance expertise, as that would create a duplicative position.  It is critically important that the Council incorporate State regulators. State banking, insurance, and securities regulators are on the front lines of financial regulation and therefore have information and perspectives that are necessary components of an effective regulatory structure. State regulators could act as ``first responders'' to the Council, in that they see trends developing at the State level. They could serve as an early warning system, identifying practices and risk-related trends that are substantial contributing factors to systemic risk.  I ask for unanimous consent that the joint letter from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and the North American Securities Administrators Association supporting this amendment be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           National Association of                                      Insurance Commissioners,                                                     May 13, 2010.     Hon. Patty Murray,     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Murray and Collins: The Conference of State      Bank Supervisors (CSBS), the National Association of      Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and the North American      Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) are writing in      support of your amendments providing for non-voting      membership for state banking, insurance and securities      regulators on the Financial Stability Oversight Council      (FSOC).       Including state regulators on the FSOC is both necessary      and appropriate. State banking, insurance, and securities      regulators are on the front lines of financial regulation and      bring information and perspectives that are necessary      components of an effective regulatory structure. In all      financial sectors, state regulators gather and act upon large      amounts of information from industry participants and from      investors. State regulators would bring to the FSOC the      insights of a team of ``first responders'' who see trends      developing at the state level, which have the potential to      impact the larger financial system. Consequently, they serve      as an early warning system identifying practices and risk-     related trends that are substantial contributing factors to      systemic risk.       Matters of financial stability and systemic risk have far-     reaching implications and benefit from a diversity of      regulatory perspectives. By including state regulators in the      FSOC, your amendments create a more comprehensive and      efficient approach that will benefit from access to all      relevant information regarding the accumulation of risk in      our financial system.       Thank you for your efforts and we look forward to working      with you to secure passage of your amendments.           Sincerely,     Joseph A. Smith, Jr.,       Commissioner of Banks, North Carolina, Chairman, Conference      of State Bank Supervisors.     Denise Voigt Crawford,       Texas Securities Commissioner, NASAA President.     Jane Cline;       West Virginia Insurance Commissioner, NAIC President.
