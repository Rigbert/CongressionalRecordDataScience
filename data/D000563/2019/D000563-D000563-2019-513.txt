President, I was necessarily absent from votes number 128 and number 129 due to the birth of my granddaughter, Josephine Emily Durbin. Had I been present, I would have voted yea to waive the Budget Act with respect to the emergency spending to help the States and Territories impacted by storms and other natural disasters. I would have voted yea on passage of H.R. 2157, as amended by the Shelby-Leahy substitute amendment, as well.                          ____________________
