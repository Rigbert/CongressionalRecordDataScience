Mr. Speaker, it is time to put your House in order, because, quite frankly, your House is a mess. You need to clean it up.  Republicans control the House. They control the Senate. Republicans make the rules. But what Republicans cannot seem to make--is policy. They cannot govern. They cannot lead.  We do not have a problem because Republicans cannot agree with Democrats. We do not have a problem because Congress cannot agree with the President. We have a problem because Republicans cannot agree among themselves. We have a problem because Republican leaders cannot lead.  So now we have this resolution--to do nothing. It is a do-nothing proposal. Mr. Speaker, this is not even leadership by default. It is a default of leadership.  The President has set his priorities. The message is clear. Send him a clean bill, and he will sign it. But he will not be blackmailed. The President will not give in to your extreme proposals.  We Democrats have set our priorities. All Democrats agree--do not cut education. Do not attack Medicare. Do not destroy the environment. Do not cut taxes for the rich--and raise taxes on millions of working families.  Because the Republicans cannot lead, this President will. Thank you, Mr. President, for leading. Thank you for saying no to the Republicans' mean-spirited, extreme proposal. Thank you for standing up for our working families, our parents, our children, and our grandchildren. Thank you for doing what the Republicans will not do. Thank you for leading. Thank you for doing what is right, what is fair, and what is just.
