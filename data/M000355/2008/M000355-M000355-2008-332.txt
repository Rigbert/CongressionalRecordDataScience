 President, my prayers go out to the families of those killed in Burma in this past weekend's natural disaster. Initial estimates reported the cyclone killed more than 22,000 people and tens of thousands more are missing.  Yesterday, First Lady Laura Bush announced that the United States is prepared to provide assistance and supplies to Burma, but at this time the Government has not accepted our offer.  I urge the Burmese Government to move quickly and accept the offer of the American people and act in the best interests of the population.                          ____________________
