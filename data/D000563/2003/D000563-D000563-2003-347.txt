President, today, my colleague Senator Hatch and I are again introducing legislation that would provide immigration relief to undocumented students of good moral character who want to pursue a better life for themselves and their families. It would benefit the American economy by unleashing the potential of these students, who have grown up in the U.S. and graduated from high school or obtained an equivalent degree. The DREAM Act is a bipartisan bill which has broad support in the Hispanic, religious and immigrant communities.  Each year, approximately 50-60,000 undocumented children, including honors students and valedictorians, graduate from our nation's high schools or receive an equivalent degree. Many of these students were brought to the U.S. by their parents at an age when they were too young to appreciate the legal consequences of their actions. Despite long-term residency in the U.S. and a demonstrated commitment to obtaining an education, these students have no avenue for adjusting their immigration status and it is very difficult for them to attend college or work. Instead, they face possible deportation.  Although these young people are entitled to a free public education at the primary and secondary level, Federal law strongly discourages states from extending in-state college tuition rates to them. Additionally, they cannot legally work, are ineligible for federal tuition assistance, and have great difficulty obtaining private loans.  These roadblocks to higher education hurt our society because we are deprived of future leaders, and the increased tax revenues and economic growth they would produce. Young people with great potential and ambitions are limited to the employment options available to those without a college degree. In fact, many of these students do not even finish high school, further limiting their options and ability to contribute to our economy, because they drop out of school once they realize that they will be unable to attend college.  The DREAM Act would provide meaningful relief to many of these students. It would repeal a provision of federal law that makes it prohibitively expensive for states to grant post-secondary benefits, such as in-state tuition rates, to undocumented children. The bill would also provide an earned adjustment mechanism by which young people who are long-term U.S. residents may become lawful permanent residents.  Approving this bill would give accomplished young people the opportunity to pursue the American dream. I urge my colleagues to support it.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):  S. 1546. A bill to provide small businesses certain protection from litigation excesses and to limit the product liability of non-manufacturer product sellers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today Senator Lieberman and I introduced the ``Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2003,'' which aims to restore common sense to the way our civil litigation system treats small businesses. Small businesses form the backbone of America's economy. But in our legal system, small businesses are often forced to defend themselves in court for actions they did not commit and pay damages for harms they did not cause. These businesses also frequently find themselves faced with extraordinarily high punitive damages awards. These unfortunate realitiesthreaten the very existence of many small businesses, and when American small businesses go under, our economy is harmed as new products are not developed, produced, or sold, and employers cannot retain employees or hire new ones.  Small businesses--those with 25 or fewer full-time employees--employ almost 60 percent of the American workforce. Because the majority of small business owners earn less than $50,000 a year, they often lack the resources to fight unfair lawsuits which could put them out of business. When faced with such a lawsuit, many of these entrepreneurs must either risk a lengthy battle in court, in which they may be subjected to large damage awards, or settle the dispute out of court for a significant amount. Either way, our current system jeopardizes the livelihood and futures of small business owners and their employees.  The Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2003 would remedy these ills with three common-sense solutions, all of which protect our nation's entrepreneurs from unfair lawsuits and excessive damage awards. First, it would allow a punitive damages award against a small business only upon clear and convincing evidence, rather than upon a simple preponderance of the evidence, and it would set reasonable limits on the size of punitive damages awards--the lesser of $250,000 or three times compensatory damages.  Second, our bill would restore basic fairness to the law by eliminating joint and several liability for small businesses for non-economic damages, such as pain and suffering, so a small defendant is not forced to pay for harms it did not cause. Under the current joint and several liability rules, if a small business is found liable with other defendants, the small business may be forced to pay a disproportionate amount of the damages if it has ``deep pockets'' relative to the other responsible parties. For example, a small business that was found responsible for only 10 percent of the harm in a case may have to pay half, two-thirds or even all of the damages. This legislation would prevent this unfair situation, but it would not change a small business's joint and several liability for economic damages, such as medical expenses and lost wages; because a small business could still be responsible for all economic damages, regardless of its degree of fault, plaintiffs will still be able to recover all of their out of pocket costs. By protecting small businesses from having to pay non-economic damages for which they are not responsible, though, the Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2003 partially relieves a potentially unfair situation.  Third, our bill addresses some of the iniquities facing non-manufacturing product sellers. Currently, a person who has nothing to do with a defective and harmful product other than simply selling it can be sued with the manufacturer. Under the reforms in the Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2003, however, a product seller can only be held liable for harms caused by his own negligence, intentional wrongdoing, or breach of his own warranty.  This bill would provide much needed protection and relief to small business owners, workers, and consumers. By making our legal system reasonable and fair to small businesses, we will remove one of the greatest barriers to starting and maintaining a small business: the threat of crippling, excessive, and unfair lawsuits. That means increased competition, better and more affordable goods, and more jobs at a time when America could use them all. The Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2003 is a win for all Americans, and it is my hope that the Senate will pass this bipartisan bill. Finally, I would ask unanimous consent that letters in support of this legislation from the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Association of Wholesale-Distributors, the Motorcycle Industry Council, and the Small Business Legal Reform Coalition be printed in the Record.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 31, 2003.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the Small Business      Legal Reform Coalition, we are writing to thank you for      sponsoring the Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2003,      and to express our strong support for its passage. We commend      you for your efforts to restore common sense to our civil      justice system--one that takes a particularly heavy toll on      the smallest of America's businesses.       The frequency and high cost of litigation is a matter of      growing concern to small businesses across the country.      Today's civil justice system presents a significant      disincentive to business start-ups and continued operations.      If sued, business owners know they have to choose between a      long and costly trial or an expensive settlement. Business      owners across the nation risk losing their livelihood, their      employees and their future every time they are confronted      with an unnecessary lawsuit.       The Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2003 would make      two reforms that have topped the small business community's      agenda for years: cap punitive damages and abolish joint      liability for non-economic damages for those with fewer than      25 employees. These reforms have been among the      recommendations of the White House Conference on Small      Business since the early 1980s--and the time has come to      protect the smallest of small businesses from excessive      damage awards and frivolous suits.       This legislation would also hold non-manufacturing product      sellers liable in product liability cases when their own      wrongful conduct is responsible for the harm and thus reduce      the exposure of innocent product sellers, lessors and renters      to lawsuits when they are simply present in a product's chain      of distribution or solely due to product ownership. Should      the manufacturer be judgment-proof, the product seller would      be responsible for any damage award, ensuring that deserving      claimants recover fully for their injuries.       In the end, we believe that enactment of the Small Business      Liability Reform Act of 2003 will inject more fairness into      the legal system and reduce unnecessary litigation and legal      costs. We also believe that it protects the rights of those      with legitimate claims. We thank you again for your support      of these common sense reforms and look forward to working      with you to ensure the success of this important legislation.

Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the over 300 members      of the Motorcycle Industry Council (MIC), I want to express      our strong support for the ``Small Business Liability Reform      Act of 2003'' and extend sincere thanks for your sponsorship      of this important legislation. MIC is a nonprofit national      trade association that represents manufacturers and      distributors of motorcycles, motorcycle parts and      accessories, and members of allied trades. A large number of      our member companies are small businesses.       This Act, which would cap punitive damages and abolish      joint liability for non-economic damages for businesses with      fewer than 25 employees, is a common sense approach to      sustaining the health of America's small businesses. It would      hold non-manufacturing product sellers liable in product      liability cases when they own wrongful conduct is responsible      for the harm and thus reduce the exposure of innocent product      sellers to lawsuits when they are simply present in a      product's chain of distribution. Should the manufacturer be      judgment-proof, the product seller would be responsible for      any damage award, ensuring that deserving claimants recover      fully for their injuries.       The frequency and high cost of litigation is a matter of      great concern to the business community. Few companies have      been left unmarked by the steep increases in product      liability insurance costs or the crises in the availability      of product liability insurance. The impact on small      businesses is especially burdensome. the current civil      justice system puts small business owners across the country      in jeopardy of losing their livelihood, their employees and      their futures when faced with involvement in lawsuits through      no fault of their own. This Act would serve to help protect      these businesses from excessive damage awards and the costs      of defending against frivolous suits.       Sensible reform brings predictability to the product      liability process, stabilizes product liability insurance      rates and reduces the overall costs related to product      liability litigation imposed on manufacturers, sellers, and      ultimately, consumers. This legislation is an important step      in alleviating the devastating effects that the current      system can have on small businesses and their millions of      employees, which continuing to ensure that businesses remain      accountable for negligence and intentional wrongdoing and      that consumers have full access to the court system for      redress.       Again, thank you for your sponsorship of this legislation      which is so important to our small business member companies.           Sincerely,                                              Kathy R. Van Kleeck,     Vice President, Government Relations.                                  ____                                              National Association                                   of Wholesaler-Distributors,                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2003.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Hon. Joe Lieberman,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators McConnell and Lieberman: I write on behalf of      the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors (NAW) to      express our strong support for the ``Small Business Liability      Reform Act of 2003.''       For nearly two decades, NAW has vigorously advocated      Federal civil justice reform legislation to curb unnecessary      lawsuits and the wasteful legal costs they generate. Title I      of the bill (Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection), which      proposes modest restraints in the application of joint      liability and punitive damages with regard to small business      defendants, takes a major step in that direction.       So, too, does the product seller liability standard      proposed in Title II (Product Seller Fair Treatment).      Currently in a majority of states, non-manufacturing product      sellers such as wholesaler-distributors and retailers may be      sued for product-related injuries on the same basis as the      product manufacturer. Consequently, product sellers are      routinely joined in product liability lawsuits regardless of      fault. Despite the fact that product sellers are rarely      ultimately responsible for the damages awarded to successful      claimants, they do have to mount their defense and pay the      legal costs attendant to it. This unnecessary litigation      drives up costs that must be passed along and absorbed by      consumers in the form of higher prices, and serves the      interests of no one.       By providing that non-manufacturing product sellers will be      liable for product-related injuries that are caused by their      own negligence, intentional misconduct, beeches of their own      express warranties, and when the liable manufacturer is      unreachable by judicial process, Title II of the bill      corrects this serious flaw in our product liability system.      This standard of liability is balanced and fair. It      appropriately reflects the different roles of manufacturers,      wholesaler-distributors and other non-manufacturing product      sellers in the chain of production and distribution, promotes      product safety by laying responsibility for harm at the      doorstep of the culpable party, and ensures that those who      are harmed through no fault of their own by defective,      unreasonably dangerous products are fully compensated for      their injuries.       Thank you for your leadership in sponsoring this important      legislation. I look forward to working with you toward its      prompt enactment.           Sincerely,                                           James A. Anderson, Jr.,     Vice President--Government Relations.                                  ____                                               National Federation                                      of Independent Business,                                     Washington DC, July 30, 2003.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the 600,000 members of      the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I      would like to express our strong support for the Small      business Liability Reform Act of 2003.

TITLE III--EFFECTIVE DATESec. 301. Effective date.            TITLE I--SMALL BUSINESS LAWSUIT ABUSE PROTECTION     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the United States civil justice system is inefficient,      unpredictable, unfair, costly, and impedes competitiveness in      the marketplace for goods, services, business, and employees;       (2) the defects in the United States civil justice system      have a direct and undesirable effect on interstate commerce      by decreasing the availability of goods and services in      commerce;       (3) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and      fairness to the legal system;       (4) the spiralling costs of litigation and the magnitude      and unpredictability of punitive damage awards and      noneconomic damage awards have continued unabated for at      least the past 30 years;       (5) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized      that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the      award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate      interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence      of unlawful conduct;       (6) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly      excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some      circumstances for a party to be held responsible under the      doctrine of joint and several liability for damages that      party did not cause;       (7) as a result of joint and several liability, entities      including small businesses are often brought into litigation      despite the fact that their conduct may have little or      nothing to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to      the lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust      costs due to the possibility or result of unfair and      disproportionate damage awards;       (8) the costs imposed by the civil justice system on small      businesses are particularly acute, since small businesses      often lack the resources to bear those costs and to challenge      unwarranted lawsuits;       (9) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation      costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing      insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their      activities;       (10) liability reform for small businesses will promote the      free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate      commerce, and decrease litigiousness; and       (11) legislation to address these concerns is an      appropriate exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses      3, 9, and 18 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of      the United States, and the 14th amendment to the Constitution      of the United States.

(b) Limitation on Amount.--In any civil action against a      small business, punitive damages awarded against a small      business shall not exceed the lesser of--       (1) three times the total amount awarded to the claimant      for economic and noneconomic losses; or       (2) $250,000,     except that the court may make this subsection inapplicable      if the court finds that the plaintiff established by clear      and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with      specific intent to cause the type of harm for which the      action was brought.

SEC. 106. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.

(b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This      title does not apply to any action in a State court against a      small business in which all parties are citizens of the      State, if the State enacts a statute--       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;       (2) declaring the election of such State that this title      does not apply as of a date certain to such actions in the      State; and       (3) containing no other provision.                TITLE II--PRODUCT SELLER FAIR TREATMENT     SEC. 201. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) although damage awards in product liability actions may      encourage the production of safer products, they may also      have a direct effect on interstate commerce and consumers of      the United States by increasing the cost of, and decreasing      the availability of, products;       (2) some of the rules of law governing product liability      actions are inconsistent within and among the States,      resulting in differences in State laws that may be      inequitable with respect to plaintiffs and defendants and may      impose burdens on interstate commerce;       (3) product liability awards may jeopardize the financial      well-being of individuals and industries, particularly the      small businesses of the United States;       (4) because the product liability laws of a State may have      adverse effects on consumers and businesses in many other      States, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to enact      national, uniform product liability laws that preempt State      laws; and       (5) under clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United      States Constitution, it is the constitutional role of the      Federal Government to remove barriers to interstate commerce.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title, based on the      powers of the United States under clause 3 of section 8 of      article I of the United States Constitution, are to promote      the free flow of goods and services and lessen the burdens on      interstate commerce, by--       (1) establishing certain uniform legal principles of      product liability that provide a fair balance among the      interests of all parties in the chain of production,      distribution, and use of products; and       (2) reducing the unacceptable costs and delays in product      liability actions caused by excessive litigation that harms      both plaintiffs and defendants.
