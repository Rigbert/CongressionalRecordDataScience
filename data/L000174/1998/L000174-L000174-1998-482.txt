President, I know that the Senate will, very soon, go to a vote on another judge. It is March. For those who are keeping track, that makes the sixth judge confirmed this year in the third month. Let me see, three into six, as I recall, goes twice. So that's two judges a month. I don't want to strain the capabilities of the U.S. Senate, but there are 85 vacancies. There are 85 vacancies and now, in March, we will confirm the sixth Federal judge.  Justice denied is justice lost.  We are not seeing our responsibility to the Federal judiciary. As long as the Senate maintains a stall on the confirmation of Federal judges, we are not being responsible, we are not even upholding our oath of office. I commend the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee for getting another judge here to be confirmed. I ask the Senate to remember that we have responsibilities to the Constitution, and we have a responsibility to the integrity and independence of the third branch of Government. We are not fulfilling it.  Mr. President, I am going to withhold the rest of my time because the distinguished chairman is not here.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be allowed to withhold its time.
