Chairman, I wanted to thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Our intention is to close any loopholes that may exist on submarine patenting, even though that issue is a rather curious one to be raised by the committee, because in the last 20 years between 1971 and 1993, out of 2.3 million patent applications, only 627 have been classified as submarine patents; and at least a third of those were U.S. Government military secrets. So I find it interesting that the gentlewoman spent a great deal of her time talking about submarine patents.  Our intention is to close any loopholes that might be there, and that is why the language is in our amendment.  Let me also say that our concern is profoundly small inventors, small business, and university-based inventors. If the proposal in the base bill that early publication is so good for the small inventor and small business, why have those inventors and businesses not published before the grant of the patent up to now? By current law they have that right. So our intention is to protect the small inventor. Please help us do that.
