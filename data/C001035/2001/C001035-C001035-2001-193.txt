President, I will briefly explain. The Senator from Kentucky pointed out that in drafting the amendment, we inadvertently deleted the requirement that there be a disclaimer that the ad is paid for by the candidate's authorized committee. We did not in any way intend to remove that disclaimer requirement.  The legislation I sent to the desk makes it clear that the candidate's ad has to include the statement that the ad was paid for by the candidate's authorized committee.  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for pointing out that error and allowing us to correct it.
