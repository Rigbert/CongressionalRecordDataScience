 Referring to the modified regulation, Mr. Lloyd states as follows:       I believe the action taken by the Air Resources Board is a      win/win situation. We achieved our emission reduction goal.      The adopted regulation, based on an industry proposal, will      reduce costs, simplify compliance and avoid job losses.  So the Air Resources Board took the industry's proposal, the industry association of which Briggs & Stratton is a member. That is why this thing is so unfair.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this letter from Mr. Lloyd to the Senator from Missouri be printed in the Record following my statement.
