Mr. Chairman, I, again, urge passage of the amendment, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work.  This is a mom-and-pop operation. If I thought it was going to do anything wrong--it has been mined for 100 years. They came in, they had a guy in a wheelchair, and they made him walk to his mine because you couldn't use a mechanized vehicle. Now, that is not good personnel.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).  The amendment was agreed to.               Amendment No. 45 Offered by Mr. Westerman  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 45 printed in House Report 115-297.
