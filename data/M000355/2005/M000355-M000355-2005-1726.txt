 President, in his recent State of the Union address, President Bush stated:     the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way      toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way toward      democracy in the Middle East.  In light of the President's statement, I would like to submit for the Record an op-ed by Jackson Diehl that appeared in today's Washington Post titled ``Egypt's Gamble.''  In this piece, Mr. Diehl notes with concern that the Egyptian Government appears to be acting under the assumption that, despite the President's strong statement on the need for democratic reforms in the country, the United States will still turn a blind eye to the recent heavy-handed actions taken by the Egyptian authorities toward prodemocracy activists. Mr. Diehl's piece notes:     The U.S. Embassy in Cairo is urging caution; it argues that      an overly aggressive U.S. reaction [to the crackdown] would      play into the hands of Egyptian ``hardliners.''  Mr. President, I am deeply troubled about these reports, if they are true.  President Bush's statement of policy with respect to Egypt could not be more clear. Nonetheless, it appears that there are those in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the State Department who are attempting to return to ``business as usual'' with respect to U.S. policy toward Egypt. I would like to go on record as reiterating my strong support for the need for Egypt to reform its political and economic institutions, and I look forward to working with Secretary Rice to ensure that the President's vision of democracy in the region is not diluted at lower levels of the Department through bureaucratic inertia and intransigence.  I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2005]                             Egypt's Gamble                           (By Jackson Diehl)       The appearance of Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul      Gheit and intelligence chief Omar Suleiman in Washington this      week should bring to a head a bold attempt by their country's      strongman, Hosni Mubarak, to neuter President Bush's campaign      for democracy in the Middle East within weeks of his      inaugural address.       Mubarak's brazen gambit was encapsulated by two events on      successive days last week. On Tuesday he played host in Sharm      el-Sheikh as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and      Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared a cease-fire. On      Wednesday his police in Cairo arrested the deputy leader of      the new, liberal democratic Tomorrow political party and      banned its newspaper from publishing its first issue--even      though 10 days before the Bush administration had strongly      objected to the arrest of the party's chairman, Ayman Nour.       Mubarak is betting that Gheit and Suleiman will be greeted      at the State Department and White House as close      collaborators in a budding Israeli-Palestinian detente, not      as representatives of a government engaged in an expanding      crackdown on its secular and democratic opposition. If so,      the 76-year-old president will feel secure in continuing a      campaign aimed at crushing what has been mounting opposition      among the Egyptian political and business elite to his plan      to extend his quarter-century in office by six years through      a rigged referendum this fall. His son, Gamal, waits in the      wings to succeed him.       Bush, who in his State of the Union speech called on Egypt      to ``show the way'' toward democracy in the Middle East, will      look feckless and foolish if a regime so deeply dependent on      U.S. military and economic aid stages another fraudulent      election while jailing the very politicians who support his      vision. But Mubarak is betting that this U.S president, like      those who preceded him, won't seriously confront him or      threaten his economic lifeline at a sensitive moment in the      ``peace process.''       He may or may not be right. Some officials tell me that the      Egyptians will get a cool, if not cold, reception in      Washington and will be told that the jailing of Nour and his      deputy, Moussa Mustafa, is unacceptable. Bush, one source      said, is ``furious'' about the arrests. A U.S. diplomatic      letter has been drafted, but not yet dispatched, to other      members of the Group of Eight industrial nations; it      describes Mubarak's political crackdown in harsh terms and      suggests that G-8 participation in an early March meeting in      Egypt with the Arab League should be reconsidered.       One official I spoke to pointed out that Condoleezza Rice      is due to pay her first visit as secretary of state to the      Arab Middle East for the Arab League meeting. If Nour is not      freed, the official predicted, Rice may cancel the trip:      ``She is not going to sit there like a potted plant while the      Egyptians do this.'' But Rice hasn't addressed the issue, and      there is no consensus inside the administration on such a      tough response. Predictably, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo is      urging caution; it argues that an overly aggressive U.S.      reaction would play into the hands of Egyptian ``hard-     liners.'' Such limp logic, of course, is exactly what the      chief hard-liner--Mubarak--is counting on.       Whatever comes of the Nour affair, the State Department has      launched a committee to review policy toward Egypt. That will      give democracy advocates at State and the White House a      platform for arguing that relations with Cairo should be      fundamentally shifted in the coming year. They can count on      support in Congress, where key Republicans, such as Sen.      Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have grown increasingly      impatient with Mubarak's refusal to liberalize.       Few believe that Mubarak can now be stopped from granting      himself another term as president. But proponents of change      will argue that Bush must at least push Mubarak to make a      major concession to his moderate opposition. This is not a      matter of the United States dictating reform: Nour, a new      coalition of political groups and even some officials in the      ruling party have been pressing for a constitutional rewrite      that would make future elections democratic and limit the      president's power and tenure. They also want lifted the      ``emergency laws'' that Mubarak has used to suppress      political activity. Bush need only embrace this homegrown      agenda.       The old autocrat probably won't yield unless his annual      dose of $1.2 billion in U.S. aid is put at stake. Critics      have been arguing for years that that huge subsidy, which      dates to the Cold War, buys the United States little but      greater enmity from the millions of Arabs who loathe the      region's corrupt autocracies and blame the United States for      propping them up.       The fact is, Mubarak has far more to lose than Bush from a      rupture in U.S.-Egyptian relations. By contrast, if the      dictator sails to reelection with the apparent consent of      Washington, it is Bush who will be the big loser.                          ____________________[Pages S1399-S1400]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                 EGYPT  Mr. McCONNELL.
