Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information.  I would ask the majority leader if he knows which days we will be considering bankruptcy and which day we will be considering the estate tax bill? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. We do not know at this point, and we will certainly advise the gentleman when we have that. The problem is because of this shortened week, we have committees that are marking up next week that had planned to mark up this week, and we have to try to work out the schedule so that we can make it as convenient for those markups as possible.
