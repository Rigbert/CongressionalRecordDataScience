  Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Lott I offer this amendment, which is a rather simple and direct amendment. It concerns the proliferation of adult video programming that is easily accessible for children to view. It is a commonsense amendment and it is simple. It would require multichannel video programmers, such as cable operators, to fully scramble or otherwise block sexually explicit adult programming unless a subscriber specifically requests such programming.  The full blocking requirement would apply to those channels primarily dedicated to adult sexually oriented programming, such as the Playboy and Spice channels. Until these channels are fully blocked, cable operators would have to restrict their broadcasts to certain times of the day when children are least likely to view it, such as at night.  Last year I learned that in many households across America, adult programming was being broadcast around-the-clock on certain primarily sexually orientated channels, with only partial audio and video scrambling.  This issue first came to my attention when a local city councilman in Poway, CA, a suburb of San Diego, wrote to me about the problem in his community. He said that in San Diego County, partially scrambled video pornography--replete with unscrambled and sexually explicit audio--was being automatically transmitted to more than 320,000 cable television subscribers.  Unfortunately, many subscribers and parents were unaware of these transmissions until they or their children accidentally discovered the programming. In San Diego County, for example, the partially scrambled pornography signal was broadcast only one channel away from a network broadcasting cartoons and was easily accessible for children to view.  Parents would come home after work only to find their children sitting in front of the television watching or listening to the adult's-only channel, a channel that many parents did not even know existed. In Poway, the city councilman's young son learned about the adult's-only channel at school, where the easily accessible programming was a hot topic among children.  This is not an isolated program.Until just a few months ago, the local cable company here in Washington also automatically transmitted partially scrambled video pornography--replete with unscrambled and sexually explicit audio--to all of its subscribers.  To their credit, some local cable companies are taking voluntary steps to address this problem. For example, in San Diego, one local cable company restricted the times when such programming was broadcast. In Washington, the local cable company eventually fully blocked the programming so both the video and audio portions of the signal are now undistinguishable.  However, numerous other cable services across the country are still transmitting similar adult video and audio programming that is not sufficiently scrambled, with many subscribers and parents unaware of its contents. And, with the emerging information superhighway and other forms of video programming now or soon to be available, such sexually elicit adult programming will be even more prevalent.  The problem is that there are no uniform laws or regulations that govern such sexually explicit adult programming on cable television. Currently, adult programming varies from community to community, as does the amount and effectiveness of scrambling on each local cable system. Right now, it is up to the local cable operator to regulate itself. This is like the fox guarding the hen house.  Following complaints from myself and other officials--and the threat of legislation--the National Cable Television Association recognized that this was indeed a problem and adopted voluntary guidelines that local cable operators can follow. The California Cable Television Association also adopted similar guidelines.  However, the voluntary guidelines simply recommend that local cable operators ``block the audio and video portions of unwanted sexually-oriented premium channels at no cost to the customer, upon request.'' While this is a somewhat commendable effort on the part of industry, I do not believe that it goes far enough.  First, the guidelines are only voluntary and simply recommended that local cable operators take action. There is no guarantee that such blocking will be provided and no enforcement mechanism.  Second, the guidelines put the burden of action on the subscriber, not the cable company, by requiring a subscriber to specifically request the blocking of indecent programming. As I stated earlier, many subscribers do not even know that such programming exists, only to discover their children watching and listening to adults-only channels.  I do not believe that sexually explicit adult programming should automatically be broadcast into a program subscriber's home. On the contrary, I believe that sexually explicit adult programming should be automatically blocked, unless a program subscriber specifically requests the programming.  The amendment I am proposing today is similar to language approved by the Commerce Committee last year as part of S. 1822 and contained in Senator Exon's bill, the Communications Decency Act of 1995. It would require that all sexually explicit adult programming be fully scrambled unless requested by a subscriber.  This amendment does not prohibit or out-right block indecent or sexually explicit programming. Anyone requesting such programming is entitled to receive it, as long as it is not obscene, which is not protected by the first amendment. The amendment, however, protects children by prohibiting sexually explicit programming to those individuals who have not specifically requested such programming.  The cable television industry, in meetings over the past year or so with my staff, have expressed their opposition to this amendment, citing technological and fiscal concerns. The bottom line, however, is that fully scrambling both the audio and video portion of a cable program is technologically feasible. In fact, several cable operators have already instituted such blocking, such as here in Washington. With regard to their fiscal concerns, I have never been given any information from the industry to document what the actual costs to cable operators would be.  This amendment gives the industry flexibility in implementing the requirement to fully scramble all sexually explicit adult programming.  Until a cable operator or other multichannel video programming distributor is in full compliance, access to such programming will be limited to protect children from the sexually explicit material. The programming will be prohibited from those times of the day--to be determined by the FCC--when a significant number of children are likely to view it, such as during the mid and late morning, afternoon, and early evening.  So, the amendment leaves it up to the local cable operator on how and when to come into full compliance. Some cable operators, for example, are already in full compliance. For those operators that are not in full compliance, children will be still be protected until the adult programming can be fully scrambled or otherwise blocked.  This amendment also does not become effective until 30 days after enactment, so cable operators will have plenty of time to either fully block the programming, or restrict access to certain times of the day.  While I realize that some cable operators may incur costs in implementing [[Page S8168]] this amendment, I believe that the price to protect children from sexually explicit programming is well worth it. In addition, as I stated above, the amendment gives the industry flexibility in coming into compliance; it lets individual cable operators decide what costs, if any, they will incur and when they will incur such costs.  It is unfortunate that this amendment is necessary. One would have hoped that cable operators and other multichannel video programming distributors would have automatically fully blocked or scrambled sexually explicit adult programming or, at a minimum, restricted the programming to certain times of the day.  But, industry has only taken baby steps to address this problem through voluntary policies that simply recommend action. The end result is that numerous cable operators across the country are still automatically broadcasting sexually explicit adult programming into households across America, regardless of whether parents want this or subscribers want it.  So I believe the provision is both necessary, timely, will be helpful, and will disadvantage no one. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that a CRS analysis of this amendment as it relates to the first amendment, which is in support of the amendment of Senator Lott and myself, and some recent court decisions, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Congressional Research Service,                                      The Library of Congress,                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 1995.     To: Hon. Dianne Feinstein, Attention: Robert Mestman.     From: American Law Division.     Subject: Indecent Programming on Cable Television.       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request      for a brief analysis of the constitutionality of your      proposal to limit ``sexually explicit adult programming or      other programming that is indecent and harmful to children on      any channel . . . primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented      programming.'' Subsection (a) of the proposal provides that      ``a multichannel video programming distributor shall fully      scramble or otherwise fully block the video and audio      portions of such channel so that one not a subscriber to such      channel or programming does not receive [such programming].''      Subsection (b) of the proposal states that, until a      distributor complies with subsection (a), it shall not      provide ``such programming during the hours of the day (as      determined by the [Federal Communications] Commission) when      children are likely to view it.''       The First Amendment prohibits Congress from abridging the      freedom of speech, and the Supreme Court has held that speech      on cable television has full First Amendment protection.\1\      ``The Government may, however, regulate the content of      constitutionally protected speech in order to promote a      compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means      to further the articulated interest.''\2\ In the case in      which this quotation appears, the Supreme Court struck down a      federal statute that banned dial-a-porn ``[b]ecause the      statute's denial of adult access to telephone messages which      are indecent but not obscene far exceeds that which is      necessary to limit the access of minors to such messages . .      . .''\3\ The Court in this case also reiterated that ``the      government may not `reduce the adult population . . . to . .      . only what is fit for children.'''\4\     Footnotes at end at article.       Subsection (a) of your proposal would apparently be      constitutional, under the reasoning of this week's decision      in Alliance for Community Media v. Federal Communications      Commission.\6\ The court of appeals in this case upheld the      constitutionality of provisions of the Cable Television      Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, Public Law      102-385, including section 10(b), 47 U.S.C. Sec. 532(j),      which requires the FCC to prescribe rules requiring cable      operators who have not voluntarily prohibited indecent      programming under Sec. 532(h) to place such programs on a      separate channel and to block the channel until the      subscriber, in writing, requests unblocking. This statute      applies only to programming on leased access channels, but      otherwise it does essentially the same thing your proposal      would do. It requires a separate channel for indecent      programming, and it requires blocking until the subscriber      requests unblocking. Your proposal would apply to ``any      channel * * * primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented      programming'' (in effect, to a separate channel), and would      require blocking to non-subscribers (in effect, until they      request the channel).\6\       The reason that the court of appeals upheld Sec. 532(j)      despite the First Amendment's prohibiting Congress from      abridging the freedom of speech is that it found that the      government has a compelling interest in protecting the      physical and psychological well-being of minors, and that the      method Congress chose in Sec. 532(j) was the least      restrictive means available to meet this compelling interest.      The same analysis apparently would find subsection (a) of      your proposal constitutional.       Subsection (b) of your proposal would give distributors an      alternative to the subsection (a): instead of blocking they      could not provide ``such programming during the hours of the      day (as determined by the Commission) when children are      likely to view it.'' To the extent that it is not      technologically feasible for distributors to comply with      subsection (a) immediately, they will be forced to comply      with subsection (b) until they are able to comply with      subsection (a). Therefore, subsection (b) should be viewed as      a requirement that must be consistent with the First      Amendment.       In Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica      Foundation, the FCC had taken action against a radio station      for broadcasting a recording of George Carlin's ``Filthy      Words'' monologue at 2 p.m., and the station had claimed      First Amendment protection.\7\ The Supreme Court upheld the      power of the FCC under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1464 ``to regulate a      radio broadcast that is indecent but not obscene.''\8\      However, the Court emphasized the narrowness of its holding:       The Commission's decision rested entirely on a nuisance      rationale under which context is all-important. The concept      requires consideration of a host of variables. The time of      day was emphasized by the Commission. . . .\9\       Furthermore, the Commission ``never intended to place an      absolute prohibition on the broadcast of this type of      language, but rather sought to channel it to times of day      when children most likely would not be exposed to it.''\10\       In 1992, Congress enacted Public Law 102-356, section 16 of      which required the FCC, within 180 days of enactment, to      promulgate regulations that prohibit broadcasting of indecent      programming on radio and television from 6 a.m. to midnight,      except for public radio and television stations that go off      the air at or before midnight, which may broadcast such      material beginning at 10 p.m.\11\ This statute was      challenged, and, in Action for Children's Television v.      Federal Communications Commission (ACT III), a three-judge      panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals declared it      unconstitutional.\12\ The full court of appeals agreed to      decide the case, but a decision has not yet been issued.       Even with this uncertainty, it is clear from the Supreme      Court's decision in Pacifica, supra, that the time in which      indecent programming is proscribed must be limited. In ACT      III, the three-judge panel held that the ban was ``not      narrowly tailored to meet constitutional standards.''\13\ It      found ``that the government did not properly weight viewers'      and listeners' First Amendment rights when balancing the      competing interests in determining the widest safe harbor      period consistent with the protection of children.''\14\      Furthermore, the government did not demonstrate that its      ``interest in shielding children from indecent broadcasts      automatically outweigh the child's own First Amendment rights      . . . .''\15\ The court directed the FCC to ``redetermin[e],      after a full and fair bearing, . . . the times at which      indecent material may be broadcast . . . .''\16\       Similarly, in a previous decision by a three-judge panel on      a 6 a.m. to midnight ban on indecent programming, the D.C.      Circuit held ``that the FCC failed to adduce evidence or      cause, particularly in view of the first amendment interest      involved, sufficient to support its hours restraint.''\17\      The court of appeals considered the evidence that the FCC had      cited to justify its action against the nighttime      broadcasters, and found it ``insubstantial,'' and found the      FCC's findings ``more ritual than real.''\18\ The court of      appeals concluded ``that, in view of the curtailment of      broadcaster freedom and adult listener choice that channeling      entails, the Commission failed to consider fairly and fully      what time lines should be drawn.''\19\       Assuming that the full court of appeals applies these      principles, it appears that the phrase in subsection (b) of      your proposal ``during hours of the day (as determined by the      Commission) when children are likely to view it'' may be      overboard. This is because some children seem likely to be      watching television at all hours of the day (and night), and      it would apparently be unconstitutional to ban indecent      programming around the clock. To be constitutional, your      proposal might have to be changed to prohibit such      programming only during hours when the ratio of children to      adults watching television is significantly high. This,      again, is because ``the government may not `reduce the adult      population . . . to . . . only what is fit for      children.'''\20\       Please let us know if we may provide additional assistance.
