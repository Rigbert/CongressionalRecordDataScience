President, I once again express my strong support for the efforts of the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski, and the chairwoman of theBudget Committee, Senator Murray, as they work to reach agreement with their counterparts in the House of Representatives to resolve the impasse over the fiscal year 2014 budget.  Washington today is filled with naysayers. But as broken as the budget process is, and as pessimistic as many people are, I remain hopeful about the possibility of reaching a compromise that can bring us back to some semblance of the regular order everyone claims to want.  If there ever were two Senators who could find a way through the morass, it is Senator Mikulski and Senator Murray. And they should know there are a great many of us, including some on the Republican side of the aisle, who are 100 percent behind them. I encourage all Senators to read David Rogers' piece in Tuesday's edition of POLITICO, entitled ``Barbara Mikulski's fight: Protecting appropriations''. It tells the story, and in doing so, it pays tribute to Senator Mikulski.  I am not naive about the obstacles ahead, not the least of which is the shortness of time. We need a top line number from the budget conferees by the end of next week if we are to complete appropriations bills by January 15 when the current continuing resolution expires.  There is no mystery about what needs to happen. There must be compromise by both sides on two key issues--increasing revenues and decreasing spending. There will not be agreement without both. But in the absence of agreement, the operations and programs of every Federal agency will be drastically reduced by the combined effects of sequestration and a full year continuing resolution.  People will lose their jobs and programs will be cut deeply or terminated altogether. Infrastructure projects will be cancelled. The American people will pay the price in far more ways than any one of us can imagine.  I want to mention a few examples of the effects that a full year continuing resolution, at the level the House proposes, will have in lost jobs and canceled infrastructure projects in this country.  Under a full year continuing resolution, the National Science Foundation would receive $542 million less than the amount in the Senate bill. The funding included by the Senate would provide funding for 1,500 more competitive grants and support 17,000 scientists, technicians and students. Under a CR, those jobs and that research would not be possible.  The $500 million included in the Senate bill to fix thousands of deteriorating and aging bridges around the country would disappear.  Under a CR, the Federal Aviation Administration would not receive the $559 million in the Senate bill to hire air traffic controllers needed to keep the skies safe. Instead, the FAA would be faced with having to impose a hiring freeze and furlough air traffic controllers and aviation safety inspectors.  Funding for agricultural research would receive nearly $242 million less than the levels included in the Senate bill and America's standing as the world leader in food production could be in jeopardy, because we simply won't be able to compete with the $4.5 billion China spends on agricultural research annually.  The EPA's funding for clean and safe drinking water would face significant cuts, putting Americans' access to clean water at risk. It would also mean 6,500 fewer American jobs.  These are just a few examples of how another long term continuing resolution will neglect the infrastructure needs of our Nation and prevent the creation of thousands of jobs.  I hope the spirit of bipartisan cooperation that put an end to the needless shutdown will enable the budget conferees to reach agreement on a top line funding level so Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Mikulski and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rogers can help us get back to work and pass the bills needed to fund these essential services.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that David Rogers' article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From POLITICO, Nov. 11, 2013]          Barbara Mikulski's Fight: Protecting Appropriations                           (By David Rogers)       It's not quite Wendy and the Lost Boys but it's getting      close.       Indeed, a year after taking power, Chairwoman Barbara Ann      Mikulski--or BAM as she's known in staff memos--is the      mother-older sister the Senate Appropriations Committee never      knew.       The longest-serving woman ever in Congress, and the first      to lead that old male haven, the Maryland Democrat brings a      style like none before her: cajoling, prodding, empowering      her members to get out on the Senate floor and fight.      Appropriations is her neighborhood just as East Baltimore was      when Mikulski began her rise as a community organizer in the      60's. Only now it's not a 16-lane highway through Fells Point      but sequestration in January that threatens her world.       The stakes are enormous.       If no budget deal is reached in the next month, Congress      will surrender to another round of automatic cuts in January      and risk leaving the government under no better than a      stopgap funding bill through the remainder of fiscal 2014.      That would be the third such 12 month CR arrangement in four      years--a true breaking point for Appropriations but also a      tempting tool for those seeking to frustrate President Barack      Obama's second term.       In the midst of this, Mikulski can be a terror: demanding,      self-centered to a point of fault. But she enjoys an      invaluable alliance with Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman      Patty Murray (D-Wash.) who also sits on Appropriations. And      at 77, it can seem that Mikulski's whole life has prepared      her for this moment: the grocer's daughter and product of      grassroots Catholic social activism matched against the new      grassroots anti-government forces of the Tea Party.       Obama checked the box of community organizer on his way to      the top. Mikulski lived it. She can paraphrase Jesuit      scholars but also pepper her floor speeches with ``Wow'' or      ``Oh, boy.'' And her politics remain greatly influenced by      the likes of the late Monsignor Geno Baroni, a civil rights      and community organizer who was a leader of the neighborhood      revival movement of the 60's and 70's.       ``He was always cooking up a pot of social glue and      developing social capital,'' Mikulski said in a 1994 speech      honoring Baroni's memory. Nearly 20 years later that might      describe too her own approach to Appropriations.       ``A little bit different,'' she laughs of the change she      has brought. ``Absolutely'' community organizing is part of      that.       ``My worst nightmare is that we get to like January 12th      and 13th and we don't have anything,'' she told POLITICO.      ``And we go to a year-long CR with sequester kicking in on      January 15th which is government at its worst. Government on      auto pilot and cuts across-the-board in that meat axe way.''       ``I know a lot about a lot, but I want to be able to      marshal the resources of my own committee to be able to get      out there and talk,'' she said. ``The chair of the      Appropriations Committee is more like head of the Joint      Chiefs. My twelve subcommittee chairman enjoy not only a      great deal of autonomy but they really are the ones that      drill down on their respective portfolios and know it in a      very granular way . . . Who better to tell the story than      those who know it the most?''       Beginning with the shutdown in October, the Mikulski style      has been to go to the Senate floor herself but then gin up      her colleagues to follow. This proved remarkably successful      last month, and after a meeting with her Democratic members      last week, she's doing the same now--this time focused on      sequestration and the perils of surrendering to a full-year      stopgap CR.       ``She wants us to be engaged with the same energy she      has,'' said Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) ``It can be quite      effective. Instead of just her giving a speech, we follow and      say `Let me tell you specifics.' ''       ``It's a new day around here,'' said Sen. Mark Pryor (D-     Ark.). ``All the organization skills she can muster, we need      at this point.''       That organization begins with Murray. And the dynamic of      these two women--both rooted in Appropriations--is the most      intriguing of the battle ahead.       It is an alliance both new and old at once.       Mikulski took over the chairmanship of Appropriations in      December last year after the sudden death of Sen. Daniel      Inouye (D-Hawaii.) Weeks later, Murray took the gavel at      Budget, replacing North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad, the      committee's long time top Democrat and chairman who retired      at the end of the last Congress.       At one level, the 63-year-old Murray is junior to Mikulski.      At another, she has moved well ahead by taking on tasks in      the party leadership which the matriarchal Mikulski stepped      back from even as her Senate contemporary and old House mate,      Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) advanced.       For Reid, a veteran of Appropriations and now Majority      Leader, the emergence of this Mikulski-Murray alliance is a      huge asset as seen in last month's shutdown crisis.       It was popular in the press then to credit a bipartisan      coalition of women--led by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine)--with      driving the final outcome. But in fact, it was two women,      Mikulski and Murray, who took the opposite stand. And inside      the Democratic caucus, they proved pivotal for Reid in      holding firm against the Collins plan.       ``We liked the Collins effort . . . It had dignity. It had      intellectual rigor,'' Mikulski said looking back. But the      plan itself, which envisioned a CR through January 30, risked      disaster for Appropriations. It did nothing to     stop sequestration and despite Collins' best intentions, left      the door open to what Mikulski feared would be simply another      eight month CR after that.       But take away gender, this Mikulski-Murray alliance is      really a return to past practice for the Senate.       For most of its history, under Republicans or Democrats,      the Senate Budget Committee has been led by chairs bred in      Appropriations. Think back to Sens. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.),      Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) or Judd Gregg (R-     N.H.).       In this context, the long tenure of Conrad, a product of      the Senate Finance Committee, was more the exception than the      rule--now restored by the arrival of Murray.       ``She actually understands what we do and what we need to      do to do our job,'' Mikulski said.       The flip side of this coin is that Mikulski must also help      Murray do her job on Budget. Time and again through Senate      history, budget resolution votes have been decided by      Appropriations members falling in line--or crossing the      aisle--in the name of moving ahead. If Murray gets a deal      with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.),      Mikulski's support will be needed to sell it to the Senate.       Two very different pressure points are available to her.       First are the Republicans with whom Mikulski has worked on      Appropriations and have their own vested interests in a      budget deal. Second are Democratic liberals where Mikulski      can provide political cover on tough votes given her      progressive credentials and history alongside the late Sen.      Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).       Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on      Appropriations, was still a Democrat in the House in the 80's      when he and Mikulski served together on the Energy and      Commerce Committee. They came over together to the Senate in      1986 and are their own Mutt-and-Jeff pair, taking alternative      turns running the Commerce, Justice and Science subcommittee.       ``We've got a history,'' Shelby said. ``We both would like      a [topline] number being appropriators. When I was down at      the White House with the president, I told him the reason      we're here mainly is because we've had an appropriations      breakdown.''       Given Republican politics, Mikulski knows that Shelby can't      be as outspoken as she is for a budget deal. But she was      worked to enlist him and House Appropriations Committee      Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) to keep the pressure on for a      swift conclusion to the budget talks.       ``I asked him if he would encourage the timeline of sooner      rather than later,'' Mikulski said of Shelby. In the same      vein, she signed onto a recent letter with Rogers that urged      negotiators to have an answer by Thanksgiving--leaving time      for Appropriations to have an omnibus bill in place by early      January.       ``What [Rogers] and I share is sequester,'' Mikulski said.      ``If we go to sequester, we're cooked.''       But Ryan will want Democratic pain to get to a deal. And      the day may come when Mikulski has to choose between more      chaos for her committee or a compromise that entails savings      from sensitive areas like Medicare or federal workers.       ``I've got to see what's exhausted before I go down that      road,'' she says, quickly ducking any commitment. ``Do you      mean to tell me there is not one loophole [Republicans] are      willing to close?       ``I'm convinced that Patty can still have room for a deal .      . . I don't want to speculate on the array of things that she      has to take to the table. It's premature.''       Kennedy's memory is important here. Mikulski has no      pretensions of having the same status as her late friend. But      their history is rich, and just as Kennedy could be a swing      vote for the left, she may also have to play that role.       At the 1980 Democratic convention--having lost the      nomination battle to President Jimmy Carter--Kennedy tapped      Mikulski, then a young congresswoman, to introduce him before      his ``Dream Shall Never Die'' speech.       ``You know what: I kept the dress,'' Mikulski said. ``I      told him I would keep it until he was president. It became a      standard joke. I told him I looked at it longingly.''       ``And he said `Because you would like to see me as      president?''' Mikulski said. ``And I said, `No cause I want      to be able to fit into the damn thing.' ''
