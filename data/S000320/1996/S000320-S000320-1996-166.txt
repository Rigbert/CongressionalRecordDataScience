 President, I again acknowledge the hard work and the leadership that the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey, has brought here. He is absolutely right. When we are dealing with something as complicated as the Internal Revenue Service modernization and taxes in general, it is going to take, I believe, as he does, a bipartisan effort to do this. If we can bring something out of this commission that we will listen to and do something about here that will modernize the IRS, that will help the taxpayers understand the system, will help the taxpayers keep more of their money without a lot of cumbersome involvement, we will be doing part of our job here today.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments to H.R. 3756 be considered and agreed to en bloc, provided that no points of order be waived thereon and that the measure, as amended, be considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment, with the exception of the following amendments: Page 2, line 18; page 16, line 16 through page 17, line 2; page 80, line 20 through page 81, line 4; that portion of the amendment on page 129, line 20 through page 130, line 18.
