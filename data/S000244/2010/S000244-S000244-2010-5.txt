Speaker, first, congratulations on setting history today by presiding over the House of Representatives. I promise you that there will be no points of order from the Republican side while you're in the chair.  I also rise to support House Resolution 1504, which celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  It is important to acknowledge the achievements the disability community and its allies have accomplished in the past two decades. This anniversary represents another positive step taken in ensuring that all Americans are included in our communities and places of work.  It has been a long road to guarantee that our fellow Americans find equal protection under the law. Upon the signing of the ADA, President George H.W. Bush said, ``Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.'' Through bipartisan efforts, the societal barriers that for far too long kept disabled Americans from fully participating in our communities did indeed crumble with the passing of one of the most effective civil rights laws ever.  Because of this monumental piece of legislation, our country has been able to capitalize on the talents of millions of Americans with disabilities in the workplace. The ADA has protected the rights of children and students who once encountered educational discrimination and barriers. The accessibility of buildings, public transportation, and sidewalks has made our society more inclusive. The achievements of the ADA and the thousands of advocates who fought tirelessly for its passage represent the country's endless commitment to empower all American citizens with disabilities with the capacity to fully participate in his or her community.  In response to several Supreme Court decisions that restricted ADA coverage for individuals with diabetes, epilepsy and cancer, to name a few, in 2008 Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Amendment Act.                              {time}  1440  This legislation broadened the definition of ``disabled'' and brought more people with disabilities under the umbrella of protection and reaffirmed Congress' promise to integrate people with disabilities.  Furthermore, it's important to recognize the change in societal attitudes towards people with disabilities as a result of the ADA. Since its passage, more and more Americans enjoy increased educational and employment opportunities. These opportunities have produced higher graduation rates and higher employment rates.  Because of the ADA, the disabled are no longer confined to isolation. We now see our fellow Americans with disabilities in our restaurants, movie theatres, sporting events, schools, and places of work. As of today, this Congress will see a fellow Congressman from Rhode Island and quadriplegic, Mr. Langevin, preside over the House.  Because of changes made to the Speaker's rostrum, this House now joins the ranks of thousands of buildings across the Nation that have made architectural changes which serve to increase accessibility for people with disabilities. This is a proud moment for this Congress and reflects the progress that has been made in the past two decades.  The ADA, along with passage of the ADA Amendments Act, reminds us that this progress has been made over the last 20 years, as well as the continued effort that must be made to advocate for people with disabilities who still experience discrimination.  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing House Resolution 1504.
