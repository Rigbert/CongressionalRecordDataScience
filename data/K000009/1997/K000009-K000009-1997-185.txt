Chairman, I really appreciate this opportunity because I know that the folks that have worked on H.R. 400 have tried very hard, and frankly it is a work in progress, and as we work harder, it gets better all the time.  I just wanted to summarize and say on this amendment we really have made a legitimate effort to protect the interests of the small inventor, the small business, the university inventors, the university community that is not satisfied with the base bill. We would ask for colleagues' consideration, and I would just end by saying that on the reexamination provisions of the base bill, recognize that this is going to cause a heavier burden on inventors to defend their patents because it gives the right to anyone in the world to submit a request to invalidate a U.S. patent at any time in its 17-year life. On this one, the big money will win as these patent fights go. Please support the Kaptur amendment. Please defend small business, the small inventor and the university community where so many of our new ideas come from.
