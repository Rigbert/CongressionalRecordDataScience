 Colombia is the source country for 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in this Nation. It is the source country of 70 percent of the heroin consumed in this Nation. It is a country under siege. It is a country where one-third of the geographic area is controlled by narcoterrorists, and it happens to have a government that is willing to stand up and say: We want to do something about it. United States, help us in a multilateral effort do something about it.  This Senate is saying it does not have time to consider the request. It is in our national interest to consider the request. It is in our national interest to have debate on the request. It is in our national interest to appropriate the dollars for this request.  I end by summarizing something Mr. Friedman said in the New York Times:       If we give the Colombian majority the aid it needs to fight      the drug Mafia, there is a chance--and it's no sure thing --     that it will     be able to forge a domestic peace. If we don't --and this is      a sure thing--the problem will only get worse, it will spew      instability across this region, and the only rain forest your      kids will ever see is the Rainforest Cafe.  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.
