 The subject for today is whether it would be inappropriate at 10:20 a.m. on a Tuesday for the minority to have four or five amendments of its choosing, sometime during the course of the week.  It is great that some amendments have been accepted by Members on my side. I am happy about that. The majority picked the ones they were willing to accept and accepted them. I think that is great.  But what about the rest of the Members of the minority, who are not suggesting that we would drop unusual amendments or amendments on an entirely different subject--four or five amendments during the course of the week, with relatively short time agreements, related to the subject of energy.  It strikes me that is simply not unacceptable. We have had eight votes on amendments of our choosing since last July--eight. This is not the way to run the Senate.  The minority represents a lot of Americans, millions and millions of Americans. We are entitled to have our ideas debated and voted on in the Senate as well, ones that we want to vote on, not ones that the majority leader picks for us.  That is the point. We don't think what we are asking is in any way unreasonable. It is certainly consistent with the traditions of the Senate, particularly since we have only had 8 votes on amendments of our choosing in the last 7 or 8 months. I mean, goodness gracious. There is a way to finish this bill. It does enjoy broad bipartisan support.  The majority leader mentioned the President. I don't know that his name has come up in connection with this. We are simply asking for the opportunity to debate and vote on important energy amendments on an energy bill during the pendency of the week. That is all we are asking.  I wish to go on. I understand later the majority leader is going to do some procedural matters, so let me go on and make my opening statement.                                 Energy  Later today we expect the President to talk about the weather at the White House. Presumably, he will use the platform to renew his call for a national energy tax, and I am sure he will get loud cheers from liberal elites, from the kinds of people who leave a giant carbon footprint and then lecture everybody else about low-flow toilets.  But the vast majority of middle-class Kentuckians I represent actually have to worry about paying utility bills, putting food on table, and finding a job in this terrible economy. They are less interested in just doing something on energy. They want to do the smart thing.  What they want are practical solutions to the problems and stresses they are dealing with every single day. That is what we should be focusing on this week because this debate shouldn't be about alleviating the guilt complexes of the liberal elite. It should be about actually achieving the best outcome for the environment, for energy security and, most importantly, for the people we were sent here to represent.  One thing that seems clear is this. Even if we were to enact the kinds of national energy regulations the President seems to want so badly, it would be unlikely to meaningfully impact global emissions anyway unless other major industrial nations do the same. That means getting countries such as China and India on board.  The President knows that. The President also knows that much of the pain of imposing such regulations would be borne by our own middle class.  That is why this discussion has become so cynical, and it is part of the reason the President's own party couldn't even pass a national energy tax when it had complete control of Washington's Congress back in 2009 and 2010. If the American people weren't willing to go along with considerable domestic pain for negligible global gain then, it is foolish to think they would assent to a bad idea now.  Remember, even the President's own party in the Senate wouldn't bring up the President's proposal for a national energy tax despite their overnight speeches and complaints about everyone else.  Of course, none of this has stopped the President from trying to get his way anyway. That is why we have seen this administration's attempt to do an end run around the legislative process to try to impose a similar agenda through executive fiat.  It needs to be stopped. The President's regulations are hurting people, often people who are already struggling and vulnerable--the very people the President claims he wants to help.  Our constituents are being hurt because of a cynical political agenda, because of a war on coal and other sources off American energy that the far left like and the Democratic Party is simply demanding.  The middle class doesn't even have a meaningful say in this discussion because the President has decided the Congress the people elect doesn't really matter anymore. Republicans are trying to change that this week.  We have asked the majority leader to allow votes on energy amendments that would let our constituents have a say for once. My constituents in Kentucky should be able to weigh in on an EPA rule that would negatively impact existing and future coal plants. Kentuckians deserve a real say on ongoing regulatory efforts to tie up mining permits and the red tape that is stifling the creation of good jobs in coal country.  Our constituents should finally be truly heard on the Keystone Pipeline they overwhelmingly support. The American people deserve a real debate on how we can best tap our own extraordinary natural resources to achieve energy independence at home and how we can help our allies overseas through increased exports of American energy.  These are the proposals we should be voting on this very week, proposals that can help our economy, boost the middle class and jobs while strengthening our national security and lessening our dependence on foreign sources of energy.  But we can't move forward if the Democrats who run the Senate keep trying to protect the President at the expense of serving their constituents. We know they are getting pressure from the White House to shut down a real debate on energy. One of the President's aides yesterday made it clear that it will be leaning on Democratic Senators to ``get the right outcome.''  In other words, this is to do the White House's political bidding and to once again ensure that struggling middle-class Americans get the short end of the stick from the Democrats here in Washington.  The American middle class is hurting, absolutely hurting. By a 2 to 1 margin Americans say the country's economic conditions are poor. Only about one-quarter say there are enough jobs available where they live, and they have been suffering from years of spiking electricity prices that would only get worse if the President's agenda were fully realized.  These are the people who deserve our attention. They are the ones who are struggling, not the far left, not the activists who yell the loudest and appear to care the least about who their ideas actually hurt, and not the President's political fixtures in the White House. These are not the people on whom we should be focusing.  It is time--way past time--to start paying attention to the people who actually sent us to the Senate. They deserve a robust debate about how to develop policies that can actually lead to lower utility bills that can put coal families back to work, that can help create well-paying jobs, that can help increase energy security, and that can help prevent energy from being used as a tool of war and oppression by global adversaries.  That is why we were sent to the Senate to debate these kinds of things.  If Democrats have good ideas on energy too, this is the time to share theirs.  What is wrong with having amendments from both sides on this bill. We want to hear everybody's serious ideas.  The American people have waited 7 long years, as I said earlier, for a serious energy debate in the Democratic-run Senate--7 years. It is about time they got it, and this is the perfect week to do it.  I yield the floor.
