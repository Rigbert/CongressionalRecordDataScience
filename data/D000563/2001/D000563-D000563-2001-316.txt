First, we are saying to employees of small businesses that you are not going to receive the protection of others with health insurance. Secondly, even though the cost is less than 1 percent a year to give these added protections, we are not going to ask the small businesses to accept this, even in the face of an increase in premiums, which the Senator from Colorado tells us was 38 percent over 3 years.  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.
