President, I especially thank my colleague from Minnesota. I know he will have some important things to say, too.  Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Grassley amendment. While this vote is nonbinding, as the Senator has said, I believe it does give the Senate the opportunity to make a very important statement on our commitment to our farmers and ranchers. We have had a rather spirited and I think a rather good debate in these past few days in regard to the many challenges that face farm country. I think this amendment is very clear. It simply lays out the issues Congress must address before we finish this session. Time is certainly drawing near.
