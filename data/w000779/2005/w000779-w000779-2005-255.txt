President, I rise in strong support of the proposal offered by Senators Craig and Kennedy. I see Senator Kennedy on the floor and Senator Craig on the floor. Their work is a testament to their persistence and the staying power of a handful of agricultural workers and employers who have been willing to set aside ideology and partisanship to hammer out a major overhaul of our law in this area.
