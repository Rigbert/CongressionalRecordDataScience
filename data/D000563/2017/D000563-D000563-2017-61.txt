President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2148       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Terrorism      Prevention Act of 2017''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) White supremacists and other right-wing extremists are      the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the      United States.       (2) A 2009 report from the Extremism and Radicalization      Branch of the Department of Homeland Security concluded      ``that lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing      violent right-wing extremist ideology are the most dangerous      domestic terrorism threat in the United States''.       (3) An unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin      from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department      of Homeland Security found that ``white supremacist extremism      poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,'' and that      white supremacists ``were responsible for 49 homicides in 26      attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic      extremist movement''.       (4) According to the New America Foundation, since      September 11, 2001, 76 Americans have died in terrorist      attacks by domestic extremists in the United States. 89      percent were killed by far-right-wing extremists.       (5) The fatal attacks described in paragraph (4) include--       (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh gurdwara in      Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a white supremacist shot and      killed 6 members of the gurdwara;       (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish community      center and a Jewish assisted living facility in Overland      Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3      civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager;       (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which      2 supporters of the far right-wing ``patriot'' movement shot      and killed 2 police officers and a civilian;       (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME      Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a white      supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the church;       (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned      Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which an      anti-abortion extremist shot and killed a police officer and      2 civilians;       (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man      in New York City, allegedly committed by a white supremacist      who reportedly traveled to New York ``for the purpose of      killing black men'';       (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, in which      a white supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men and injured a      third after the men defended 2 young women whom the      individual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate speech; and       (H) the August 12, 2017, attack in Charlottesville,      Virginia, in which a white supremacist allegedly killed 1 and      injured 19 after driving his car through a crowd of      individuals protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and of which      Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does meet the      definition of domestic terrorism in our statute.''.       (6) The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism found      that right-wing extremists were responsible for 150 terrorist      acts, attempted acts, and plots and conspiracies that took      place in the United States between 1993 and 2017. These      attacks resulted in the deaths of 255 people and injured more      than 600.       (7) According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in 2015,      for the first time in 5 years, the number of hate groups in      the United States rose by 14 percent. The increase included a      more than twofold rise in the number of Ku Klux Klan      chapters. The number of anti-government militias and      ``patriot'' groups also grew by 14 percent in 2015.       (8) In November 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation      released its annual hate crime incident report, which found      that in 2016, hate crimes increased by almost 5 percent,      including a 19 percent rise in hate crimes against American      Muslims. Similarly, the previous year's report found that in      2015, hate crimes increased by 6 percent. Much of that      increase came from a 66 percent rise in attacks on American      Muslims. In both reports, race-based crimes were most      numerous; more than 50 percent of those hate crimes targeted      African Americans.       (9) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had      expressed anti-Muslim views was     charged with murder for allegedly killing 6 people and      injuring 19 in a shooting rampage at a mosque in Quebec City,      Canada. It was the first-ever mass shooting at a mosque in      North America, and Prime Minister Trudeau labeled it a      terrorist attack.       (10) Between January and July 2017, news reports found 63      incidents in which American mosques were targeted by threats,      vandalism, or arson.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
