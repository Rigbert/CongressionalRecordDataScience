The result is still going to be the same as an up-or-down vote would be.  Madam President, the Senator from Utah has virtually a blood oath from the Republicans to vote against anything that might try to protect Social Security, children, or anything else in this proposed constitutional amendment. So he would have the votes, I assume, to win. But I hope the American public will not think this is a procedural thing. This is very much a vote on the merits on any motion to table that the Senator from Utah might make to defeat an amendment.  He does have an absolute right, as any of us do, to move to table at some appropriate time. I hope he will allow enough time, of course, for debate, but he does have that right. But the vote on that motion to table should be viewed as if it were a vote on the merits.  I further ask the distinguished Senator from Utah how much longer he will take.
