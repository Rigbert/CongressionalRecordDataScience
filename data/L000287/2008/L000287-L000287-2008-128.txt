Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6307, the Fostering Connections to Success Act of 2008.  First, let me thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Weller) for their leadership and bipartisanship in crafting this effort to assist children and families in our Nation's child welfare system.  Madam Speaker, young people in the child welfare system have done nothing wrong. They are victims of abuse and neglect. H.R. 6307 will provide Federal support for kinship care, increase adoption incentives, and provide assistance for foster youth up to age 21. This bill opens the door by addressing many issues facing children in foster care and those who care for them.  I am particularly proud that our Subcommittee Chairman, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) shared the words of my constituent, Mr. Anthony Reeves, a former foster care youth about the importance of making these changes. I am honored to have another outstanding young woman and former foster care youth from Georgia,Ms. Brittany Scott, interning in my congressional office this summer. When you see their passion and determination to commit, work, and act to change the lives of their friends, siblings, and the Nation's way of serving those most in need, you know we must take action.  This legislation is good; it is right. But we can do better, and we must do better. Across the country, case workers lack proper training and are overworked and underpaid. Foster children are expelled from the system at 18 with little to no support. Kinship care providers and adoptive parents lack support when caring for foster children. And when programs are in place they are often fragile because of lack of funding. We need to help those on the front lines.  One of the major components of Mr. McDermott's broader child welfare reform bill that I support is revising the so-called ``look back'' provision. Using an outdated 1996 Federal standard to determine poverty levels is a major reason that children are denied Title IV-E assistance in Georgia. Currently, only half of the abused and neglected children in foster care across the country are eligible for Title IV-E funding.  States continue to lack the funding needed to adequately improve services to youth in the child welfare system. States also face drastic cuts to the social services they provide as a result of the Deficit Reduction Act. These are just some of the many challenges that face our Nation's child welfare systems. We cannot afford to ignore them any longer.  We need to look across the board at new and diverse ways to make the process work better. We must come together and do what is right for America's foster care youth. Again, I applaud my Ways and Means colleagues for this strong bipartisan effort. I look forward to continuing to work with them on improving services, support, and assistance for those most in need.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 6307.                          ____________________
