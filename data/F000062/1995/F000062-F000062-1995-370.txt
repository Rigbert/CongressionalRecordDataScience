 President, I rise in support of the Senator from New Jersey in this legislation to rescind the appropriation for the Civilian Marksmanship Program. I do so for a number of reasons, and I want to briefly cite them.  At a time when our Government and this body is cutting virtually every program that benefits people all across the board, I think the Civilian Marksmanship Program is one program that is truly expendable and can be rescinded. As was pointed out, the military has said this program is not necessary. The General Accounting Office in 1990 found the program unnecessary and not related to the military mission.  In March 1994, the Department of Defense testified before the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations that the Civilian Marksmanship Program was not related to our Nation's military readiness and had no effect on our national security objectives.  About a week ago, Mr. President, I had a group gathered of major law enforcement organizations to talk about the intended repeal of the assault weapons legislation, and the head of a Federal law enforcement organization handed me a copy of the National Rifle Association's letter, a 6-page direct-mail piece that went out, and said to me this was received by one of our law enforcement people who was, frankly, amazed that this kind of rhetoric could appear on an NRA direct-mail piece.  I took a look at it, and I was astonished by what I saw. Since that time, a number of Members of the Senate have commented in the Chamber on their concern about this piece. It was [[Page S6171]] thought that the National Rifle Association might agree that it was hyper hyperbole and that it seemed to have a purpose to incite people to take action against the Federal Government, and it made statements which were in effect libelous; they were untrue; they were slanderous; statements like it did not matter to those of us who support the assault weapons ban that it gave ``jack-booted Government thugs more power to take away our constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill us.''  Mr. President, I have had a lot of things said about me but never that. That is untrue. It is a lie. It is patently false and it is said for one reason and one reason only, and that is to incite people.  Then it goes on to say, ``President Clinton's army of antigun Government agents continue to intimidate and harass law-abiding citizens. In Clinton's administration, if you have a badge, you have the Government's go ahead to harass, to intimidate, and to even murder law-abiding citizens.''  On its face, that is slanderous and in writing it is libelous. It is factually untrue. It is said but for one reason and one reason only. And that is to incite and develop hatred against the Federal Government and the very people who carry out the intent of the laws that we in this body and the other body pass and are signed by the President and become the law of the land. I do not think this body can condone this kind of rhetoric.  Now, is this connected with the Civilian Marksmanship Program? Not directly. Not directly. But indirectly it is, because the NRA effectively participates in this program--it is estimated by some to the extent of $1 million out of the $2.5 million appropriation.  Moreover, given the association's refusal to recant this letter, a letter which is blatantly political and inciting, certainly not one of a nonpolitical organization, should Federal funds benefit a political organization of this type? I would come down and say no, Federal moneys should not go to benefit an organization that openly admits it plays a major political role in the election and in the unelection of Members of Congress and members of other local bodies.  I believe letters of this kind really defeat its purpose as a so-called nonpolitical organization.  In addition, I am disturbed about recent reports, such as the ABC ``PrimeTime Live'' episode and a Boston Globe article, that describe how militia members brag that they have received ammunition, surplus weaponry, and training on Army bases through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.  I do not know whether this is true or not. I have no way on my own of verifying it, but the fact is they did brag that this was the case.  In fact, my staff was recently told by the Department of Defense about a recent incident where a military security patrol monitoring an Army rifle range saw that club members were using the range and wearing Michigan militia patches. These club members were asked to leave the range, which is located at Camp Grayling, MI, on April 27.  As DOD staff admit, there is nothing in the regulations of this program to prevent militia members from joining civilian marksmanship clubs and receiving ammunition, weaponry, and access to military training facilities, because--and I stress this--the program does not check members for their membership in other organizations or limit the number of adults that can join.  So in light of these reports, which suggest this possibility to train, supply, or subsidize anti-Government extremist militias, and the letter which seems to indicate to me, and I think to other reasonable readers of the letter, that the National Rifle Association is willing to go a step further to raise the level of the rhetoric, to increase the hostility, one can certainly question the wisdom of Federal dollars going to provide weapons and bullets and training to groups who may--and I say may and I say might--use these weapons and use that training against the very people that this body empowers to carry out our laws.  So I believe the time has come to take definitive, direct action and, by that action, to send a message that we will not, in fact, tolerate this. That is why I am cosponsoring this legislation, and I hope this body will be receptive to its passage.                                 ______      By
