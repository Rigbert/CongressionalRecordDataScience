 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned under the provisions of H. Con. Res. 529 until 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, December 7, 2004. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and there then be a period of morning business until the hour of 12:30 with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
