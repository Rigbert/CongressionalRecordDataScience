 President, today I wish to publicly congratulate Ms. Madeleine Cooper Taylor on her recent appointment as a member of the city council of Memphis, TN. Last Tuesday, she was appointed unanimously by the council to serve the remaining term of council member TaJuan Stout Mitchell.  Ms. Taylor has worked as a program coordinator for the Memphis branch of the NAACP since 1991 and is a lifelong Memphian.  Now, I am not normally in the habit of coming to the Senate floor to congratulate a new city council member, especially one who is not from my home State of Delaware. But this is no normal circumstance. Madeleine Cooper Taylor is the mother of Reagan Taylor, an attorney and presidential management fellow whom I have been fortunate enough to have on my staff for the past 6 months.  During her rotation on my Judiciary Committee staff, Reagan has made an invaluable contribution to legal and drug policy for our country. Thanks to her efforts, we have succeeded in reauthorizing the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and our fight against the scourge of methamphetamine has been bolstered. And even though she is scheduled to rotate out of my office at the end of this month, as we speak she is hard at work improving security for our State and local courts and better utilizing DNA as a powerful tool in solving horrendous crimes.  While Reagan tirelessly works to make our communities safer through her efforts on the Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, Councilwoman Taylor stated in one of her first public statements after her appointment that she is concerned about crime in her community. As the old saying goes, the apple does not fall far from the tree.  It has been my pleasure to have Reagan Taylor on my staff over these past months, and it is my distinct honor to congratulate Madeleine Cooper Taylor on her new public office. I wish them both the best of luck in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
