The fact of the matter is, we are conflicted as well on the policy of making sure the Bosnians have arms. We have had significant discussions about U.S. involvement in doing that, U.S. trainers doing that. We have a conflict on the floor on that. If you are a Bosnian leader dedicated to the protection of your country, you seek aid where you can get it. None of us on this floor is an apologist for Iran. We do want Bosnia to survive.
