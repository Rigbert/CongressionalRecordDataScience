 President, I agree with what my colleague from Maryland has said. SAFETEA is the culmination of many years of work by the committees of jurisdiction, who held dozens of hearings with transportation stakeholders to share ideas on how to respond to our nation's transportation needs. I believe that SAFETEA made some very important improvements to our previous transportation law and struck a good balance between the various modes, and I hope to see those changes reflected in this appropriations legislation when it emerges from the conference committee.
