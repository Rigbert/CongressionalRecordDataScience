The fact is, the highest incidence of spoiled ballots in Presidential elections in America is on punchcard systems. It makes the point of the Senator from Iowa.  Look at the last Presidential election, what a handful of votes would have meant in one State or another, and to have a report that over 300,000 more votes should have been recorded in that Presidential election that were lost to punchcards. This bill, which is supposed to be about election modernization and election reform, turns a blind eye to the voting system used by one out of every three Americans. I do not think that is consistent. I do not think you can say it is an incontrovertible constitutional right and ignore one out of three voters when it comes to saving them from a mistake.
