President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator Dodd, Senator Hutchinson, Senator Wellstone, Senator Murkowski, Senator Torricelli, Senator Dorgan, Senator Lieberman and Senator Moynihan, to introduce the Organ Procurement Organization Certification Act of 2000 to improve the performance evaluation and certification process that the Health Care Financing Administration currently uses for organ procurement organizations.  Our nation's 60 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) play a critical role in procuring and placing organs and are therefore key to our efforts to increase the number and quality of organs available for transplant.
