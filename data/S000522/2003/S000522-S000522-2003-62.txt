Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 1516) to provide for the establishment by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of five additional cemeteries in the National Cemetery System.  The Clerk read as follows:       Senate amendments:       Page 2, line 8, strike out ``five'' and insert ``six.''       Page 2, after line 18, insert: (6) The Sarasota County,      Florida, area.       Page 3, line 17, strike out ``five'' and insert ``six''.       Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to provide for the      establishment by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of      additional cemeteries in the National Cemetery      Administration.''
