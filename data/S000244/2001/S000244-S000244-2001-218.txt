 Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is an extremely constructive amendment. The gentleman from Virginia offered it during Judiciary Committee consideration and withdrew it because of jurisdictional concerns. I would hope that the House would adopt this amendment because I believe it would put additional information on the table to help further clarify this very contentious debate.
