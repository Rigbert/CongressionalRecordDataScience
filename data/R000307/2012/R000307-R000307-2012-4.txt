President, I rise to urge the Senate to fully investigate the circumstances regarding the attack upon our U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the torture and killing of our Ambassador, the deaths of three American patriots and the following attacks and deaths involving marines in Afghanistan.  Americans are watching a conflagration of an estimated one-half million jihadists in over 30 countries, burning portraits of our President, American flags, and threatening attacks upon our consulates and embassies while shouting ``Death to America.'' No, Mr. President and my colleagues, the war against terrorism is not over. We find out now, 10 days later, that al-Qaida was involved in the planned attack in Benghazi, and dangerous protests continue in Pakistan and throughout the Muslim world.  This morning, the Commandant of our Marine Corps informed the Capitol Hill marines there are 153 marine units at the ready to protect U.S. consulates and embassies at the direction of the State Department.
