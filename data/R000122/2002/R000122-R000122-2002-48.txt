What I would suggest is, because of the highly technical nature of the whole program, often we do not know what questions to ask at times. As a result, with this reporting requirement, I think we will fulfill our constitutional obligation.  I guess I would respond, finally, by saying there is a saying from a famous poet from New England, Robert Frost: ``Good fences make good neighbors.'' Perhaps if we look at this as a good fence, we will be better neighbors with our friends in MDA.
