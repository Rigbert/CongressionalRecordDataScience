 I bet the Senator will be cited by Senator Byrd who is an encyclopedia of statistics. I am sure this is the first time we have had a bilingual speech in the Senate.  I say to my colleagues, the Senator could not have picked a more important topic upon which to first speak on the Senate floor. We are grateful he is here. We listened carefully to every word, and we thank you for what you are doing for the nominee.
