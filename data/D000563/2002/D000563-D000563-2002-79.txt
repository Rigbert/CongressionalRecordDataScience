President, I rise today, joined by my colleague from Ohio, Senator George Voinovich, to introduce the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Interstate Supervision Act of 2002, to enhance the authority of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia.  The Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, CSOSA, was established by Congress as part of the District of Columbia Revitalization Act of 1997. CSOSA combines under one helm the previously disparate local functions of pretrial services, parole, adult probation, and post-conviction offender supervision. Following three years of operation as a trusteeship, CSOSA was certified as an independent Federal agency within the executive branch on August 4, 2000.  CSOSA, with 950 employees, an annual budget of $132 million, and responsibility for monitoring 21,000 pretrial release defendants annually, 8,000 at any one time, and 15,338 post-conviction offenders on probation or parole, is directed by Paul A. Quander, Jr., who was confirmed by the Senate on July 25, 2002.  The legislation we introduce today aims to clarify CSOSA's authority to provide for supervision of offenders from other jurisdictions who chose to live in the District of Columbia and to arrange with other States for supervision of District of Columbia probationers who seek residence in other jurisdictions, including authority to enter into a new Interstate Compact.  Among the functions CSOSA absorbed after it was established were the supervision of probationers and parolees from other jurisdictions once their transfer to the District of Columbia was approved. Although not explicitly stated in the law, CSOSA also performs the related function of arranging for the supervision of District of Columbia Code offenders on probation and parole who seek to move from the District of Columbia to reside in other States. Our legislation would add that specific duty to CSOSA's statutory responsibilities.  The movement of adult parolees and probationers across State lines is currently controlled by an interstate compact dating back to 1937, which has all 50 States and territories as signatories. A new agreement, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, has been drafted to improve accountability, coordination, and enforcement mechanisms among the participating states. As of June 19, 35 States had signed on to the new compact. The District has not done so, primarily because the City itself no longer performs the functions since Congress created CSOSA to do so.  Our legislation would provide CSOSA with clear authority to enter into this new compact or any other agreements for interstate supervision with any States which may not become signatories to the new compact. Because a new Compact Commission is now being formed and scheduled to meet in November to begin developing the procedural rules for the new Compact, our legislation will enable CSOSA to actively participate in that process.  For this reason, we urge our colleagues to support this bill and vote for enactment this year. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3044       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Court Services and Offender      Supervision Agency Interstate Supervision Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. INTERSTATE SUPERVISION.       Section 11233(b)(2) of the National Capital Revitalization      and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 (sec. 24-     133(b)(2), D.C. Official Code) is amended--       (1) by amending subparagraph (G) to read as follows:       ``(G) arrange for the supervision of District of Columbia      offenders on parole, probation, and supervised release who      seek to reside in jurisdictions outside the District of      Columbia;'';       (2) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (H)      and inserting a semicolon; and       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:       ``(I) arrange for the supervision of offenders on parole,      probation, and supervised release from jurisdictions outside      the District of Columbia who seek to reside in the District      of Columbia; and       ``(J) have the authority to enter into agreements,      including the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender      Supervision, with any State or group of States in accordance      with the Agency's responsibilities under subparagraphs (G)      and (I).''.
