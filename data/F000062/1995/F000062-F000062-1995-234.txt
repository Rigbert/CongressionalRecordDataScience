 President, this amendment will set aside $5 million for the conversion of surplus Defense Department helicopters for counter-drug activities. This funding is needed to upgrade these helicopters with new radio and avionics equipment, search lights, upgraded landing gear and other improvements.  There is currently a program at DOD that provides surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies for counter-drug purposes. However, no funding is currently available to convert the military equipment for use by local law enforcement. Localities simply do not have the funds necessary to implement this important program.  This funding is critical to allow local law enforcement agencies to respond to increased drug trafficking. For example, in Sacramento, there have been several large arrests made of drug transporting thousands of pounds of marijuana and heroin. The city plans to use the surplus helicopters for interdiction of traffickers through their area.  This $5 million appropriation will make a huge difference in the ability of localities to utilize these surplus helicopters. I thank my colleagues for their support in adopting this very important amendment.
