Presdient, I am pleased that the Senate today will pass the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act Amendments of 2008. The Senate unanimously passed a similar bill last year. This is a small, but important, piece of legislation and has bipartisan support. This updated version was introduced to address concerns of the Navy, and gives the Department of Defense full assurance that Government and defense designs will not be subject to unwarranted restrictions. I thank the cosponsors of the Senate's bill--Senator Cornyn, Senator Kohl, and Senator Whitehouse--for all their hard work and contributions.  In 1998, Congress passed the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act to recognize the significant time, effort, and innovation that figure into ship design. Recent action in the courts has made it clear that in order to be effective, this law needs to be clarified and refined. This bill does exactly that, and no more, by clarifying the definition of ``hull'' and ``deck.'' This ensures that the intellectual property rights of vessel hull designers will be protected.  I am pleased the Senate will adopt this measure today, and I look forward to the President signing it into law.
