President, today I am introducing a bill to designate segments of Oregon's Molalla River as Wild and Scenic. I am pleased to be joined in the Senate in introducing this legislation with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley. This legislation is also being introduced today by Representative Schrader in the House of Representatives. He has been a champion for protecting the river. My colleagues previously joined me in the effort to protect this Oregon gem by introducing this bill in the last Congress. The Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act will amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and designate an approximately 15.1 mile segment of the Molalla River and an approximately 6.2 mile segment of Table Rock Fork Molalla River as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.  The Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act would protect a popular Oregon destination that provides abundant recreational activities that help fuel the recreation economy that is so important to the communities along the river. The scenic beauty of the Molalla River provides a backdrop for hiking, mountain biking, camping, and horseback riding, while the waters of the river are a popular destination for fishing, kayaking, and whitewater rafting enthusiasts. My bill would not only preserve this area as a recreation destination, but would also protect the river habitat of the Chinook salmon and Steelhead trout, along with the wildlife habitat surrounding the river, home to the northern spotted owl, the pileated woodpecker, golden and bald eagles, deer, elk, the pacific giant salamander, and many others.  The Molalla River is not only an important habitat for wildlife and a popular northwest recreation destination, but it is also the source of clean drinking water for the towns of Molalla and Canby, Oregon. Protecting the approximately 21.3 miles of the Molalla River will provide the residents of these Oregon towns with the assurance that they will continue to receive clean drinking water, and will provide all the people of the Pacific Northwest and beyond the knowledge that this important natural resource will be preserved for continued enjoyment for years to come.  I would like to reiterate my continued appreciation for the Molalla River Alliance--a coalition of more than 45 organizations that recognize that this river is a jewel and have set out to protect it. Michael Moody, the President of this Alliance, made sure that irrigators, city councilors, the mayor, businesses and environmentalists all came together on this. These are the kind of collaborative home grown solutions that Oregonians are best at. I look forward to working with Senator Merkley, Representative Schrader, and the bill's supporters to advance this legislation to the President's desk.                                 ______                                       By
