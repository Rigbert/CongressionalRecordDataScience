President, I rise to commend the chairman and ranking member for their efforts on an issue that is important to workers in Illinois, as well as those in New York and other states. Specifically, I refer to their efforts and leadership in addressing the need to modify tariffs on wool fabrics used in the men's suit industry. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of S. 218 introduced by Senator Moynihan at the beginning of this year, and have worked with both Senators from New York and many other colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on this issue.  Because of a loophole in NAFTA, Canadian suitmakers have become our largest source of imported suits at the expense of tens of thousands of American workers who have seen their plants close. I am a supporter of NAFTA--I voted for it and I believe it is good trade policy for our country. However, as part of NAFTA, concessions were made by our U.S. negotiators to allow Canada to bring Canadian manufactured suits in to the United States, duty-free. Canada proceeded by removing its tariffs on imported wool fabrics, setting up a situation where its manufacturers could import the same fine wool fabrics American manufacturers import, manufacture a suit in Canada, and export that suit to the United States, without paying a single tariff. Our U.S. manufacturers are forced to pay over 30 percent in tariffs for this same fine wool fabric. All our manufacturers ask for from us is to provide a level playing field on which they can compete.  This has been a difficult issue to resolve because of the various stakeholders involved. However, unless the final trade bill offers some relief for this industry, more Americans will lose their jobs as a result of our own U.S. trade policies.  The pending amendment will allow this issue to be resolved in conference, and I commend both our majority and minority committee leaders for their efforts.
