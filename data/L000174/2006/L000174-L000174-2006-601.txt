I have said from the outset that Democratic Senators could not pass a good immigration bill on our own. With fewer than 50 Democratic Senators, we will need the support of Republican Senators if the Senate is to make progress on this important matter today.  With all the dramatic stagecraft of the last few days, and the protestations from the other side of the aisle, it may seem surprising, but the truth is that by invoking cloture on this bill we move to consideration of germane amendments. If the Kyl amendment is germane and pending, it would be in line for a vote. So much for all the bluster and false claims of Democratic obstruction we have heard. If Republicans want to move forward on this debate and get one step closer to a vote on tough but fair immigration reform, they should support cloture. For the past few days, I have offered and our leadership has offered to take up a number of bipartisan amendments for debate and votes that would have easily won the support of the Senate. It was Senator Kyl who objected to that progress.  Late last night, the Republican leader came to the floor to file a motion that would require the Senate to send the immigration bill back to the committee. He immediately acted to ``fill the tree'' with a series of amendments and filed an immediate cloture motion. So before any of us even saw the amendment, the Republican leader made sure to stop every other Senator from offering any amendment. How ironic, after all the posturing by Republicans over the last 2 days about the rights of Senators to offer amendments and be heard, the majority party has returned full force to its standard practices. That is too bad, especially on a matter this important and on which we began with such a high level of demonstrated bipartisanship.
