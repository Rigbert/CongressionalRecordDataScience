 President, I rise today to introduce the National Child Protection Improvement Act of 2001.  Today, 87 million of our children are involved in provided by child and youth organizations which depend heavily on volunteers to deliver their services. Millions more adults are also served by public and private voluntary organizations. Organizations across the country, like the Boys and Girls Clubs, often rely solely on volunteers to make these safe havens for kids a place where they can learn. The Boys and Girls Clubs and others don't just provide services to kids, their work reverberates throughout our communities, as the after-school programs they provide help keep kids out of trouble. This is juvenile crime prevention at its best, and I salute the volunteers who help make these programs work.  Unfortunately, some of these volunteers come to their jobs with less than the best of intentions. According to the National Mentoring Partnership, incidents of child sexual abuse in child care settings, foster homes and schools ranges from 1 to 7 percent. Volunteer organizations have tried to weed out bad apples, and today most conduct background checks on applicants who seek to work with children. Unfortunately, these checks can often take months to complete, can be expensive, and many organizations do not have access to the FBI's national fingerprintdatabase. These time delays and scope limitations are dangerous: a prospective volunteer could pass a name-based background check in one state, only to have a past felony committed in another jurisdiction go undetected.  Today I am introducing a bill designed to solve some of these problems. The National Child Protection Improvement Act of 2001 creates a new, FBI national center to conduct criminal history fingerprint checks at the request of volunteer organizations. Funds are authorized so that volunteer organizations could have the national checks performed at no cost to them, the Federal government ought to be supporting those groups who seek to safeguard our kids, and this is a modest investment that deserves to be made. Other child-serving organizations who sought the services of the new national center would have checks conducted at a minimal cost. My bill envisions as many as 10 million background checks conducted per year at this center, enough to prevent felons and other dangerous members of society from getting anywhere near our kids. States perform many of these checks today, so to help them do their jobs better my bill authorizes $5 million per year to hire personnel and improve fingerprint technology so that they can update information in national databases.  All of us understand the positive impact that volunteer organizations are making. Now we need to give these groups the tools and resources they need to ensure absolute safety for the children they serve.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1868       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``National Child Protection      Improvement Act''.     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL CENTER ON VOLUNTEER AND                    PROVIDER SCREENING.       The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974      (42 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the      following:    ``TITLE VI--NATIONAL CENTER ON VOLUNTEER AND PROVIDER SCREENING     ``SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.       ``This title may be cited as the `National Child Protection      Improvement Act'.     ``SEC. 602. FINDINGS.       ``Congress finds the following:       ``(1) More than 87,000,000 children are involved each year      in activities provided by child and youth organizations which      depend heavily on volunteers to deliver their services.       ``(2) Millions more adults, both the elderly and      individuals with disabilities, are served by public and      private voluntary organizations.       ``(3) The vast majority of activities provided to children,      the elderly, and individuals with disabilities by public and      private nonprofit agencies and organizations result in the      delivery of much needed services in safe environments that      could not be provided without the assistance of virtually      millions of volunteers, but abuses do occur.       ``(4) Estimates of the incidence of child sexual abuse in      child care settings, foster care homes, and schools, range      from 1 to 7 percent.       ``(5) Abuse traumatizes the victims and shakes public trust      in care providers and organizations serving vulnerable      populations.       ``(6) Congress has acted to address concerns about this      type of abuse through the National Child Protection Act of      1993 and the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994 to set forth a      framework for screening through criminal record checks of      care providers, including volunteers who work with children,      the elderly, and individuals with disabilities.      Unfortunately, problems regarding the safety of these      vulnerable groups still remain.       ``(7) While State screening is sometimes adequate to      conduct volunteer background checks, more extensive national      criminal history checks using fingerprints or other means of      positive identification are often advisable, as a prospective      volunteer or nonvolunteer provider may have lived in more      than one State.       ``(8) The high cost of fingerprint background checks is      unaffordable for organizations that use a large number of      volunteers and, if passed on to volunteers, often discourages      their participation.       ``(9) The current system of retrieving national criminal      background information on volunteers through an authorized      agency of the State is cumbersome and often requires months      before vital results are returned.       ``(10) In order to protect children, volunteer agencies      must currently depend on a convoluted, disconnected, and      sometimes duplicative series of checks that leave children at      risk.       ``(11) A national volunteer and provider screening center      is needed to protect vulnerable groups by providing      effective, efficient national criminal history background      checks of volunteer providers at no-cost, and at minimal-cost      for employed care providers.     ``SEC. 603.
