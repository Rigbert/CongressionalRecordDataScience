Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to the family of Bob Matsui. Bob was my friend for 13 years. Even though we sat on opposite sides of the aisle we shared a bond as fellow Californians, and he always had my utmost respect.  In this House Bob always strove to do the best for his district, his State, and his country. He entered Congress with a distinguished class in 1978 and made a lasting impression. His 26 years here were an example of how a man can be an effective promoter of his party and the consummate gentleman at the same time. Even in the most partisan of positions, chairman of his party's Congressional Campaign Committee, Bob took the high road and set an example for us to follow. He was a man of unparalleled integrity, compassion, intelligence and dedication.  I will miss Bob Matsui. I know that the people of California, the United States, and the Members of this body share my sentiments.
