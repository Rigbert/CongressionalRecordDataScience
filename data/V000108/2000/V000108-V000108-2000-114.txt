Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Croatian Sons Lodge Number 170 of the Croatian Fraternal Union on the festive occasion of its 93rd Anniversary and Golden Member banquet on Sunday, April 30, 2000.  This year, the Croatian Fraternal Union will hold their gala event at the Croatian Center in Merrillville, Indiana. Traditionally, the anniversary celebration entails a formal recognition of the Union's Golden Members, those who have achieved fifty years of membership. This year's honorees who have attained fifty yearsof membership include: Helen Marie Benich, Norma Jean Gibson, Rose Marie Gobbie, Matilda Kardos, Edward A. Pishkur, Joan Skonie, Katherine Vild, Stanley Warshol, and Sylvia T. Wilk.  These loyal and dedicated individuals share this prestigious honor with approximately 300 additional Lodge members who have previously attained this important designation.  This memorable day will begin with the Reverend Father Benedict Benakovich officiating a morning mass at Saint Joseph the Worker Catholic Church in Gary, Indiana. The festivities will be culturally enriched by the performance of several Croatian musical groups. The Croatian Glee Club, ``Preradovic,'' directed by Brother Dennis Barunica, and the Hoosier Hrvarti Adult Tamburitza Orchestra, directed by JerrY Banina, will both perform at this gala event. The Croatian Strings Tamburitzans and Junior Dancers directed by Dennis Barunica, and the Adult Kolo group, under the direction of Elizabeth Kyriakides, will provide additional entertainment for those in attendance. A formal dinner banquet will conclude the day's festivities at 3:30 in the afternoon.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Lodge President Betty Morgavan, and all the other members of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge Number 170, for their loyalty and radiant display of passion for their ethnicity. The Croatian community has played a key role in enriching the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana. It is my hope that this year will bring renewed prosperity for all members of the Croatian community and their families.                          ____________________
