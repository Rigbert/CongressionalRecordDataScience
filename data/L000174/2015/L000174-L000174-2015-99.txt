President, although we are still a year and a half from the next presidential election, our perpetual campaign cycle already seems to be in full swing. Among the many troubling trends we are seeing is the rise of ``independent'' super PACs that support candidates. These super PACs are supposed to operate completely independent from the candidates' campaigns, but no one believes this to be true. It is the worst kept secret in America.  A July 6, 2015, article in the Washington Post entitled ``It's bold, but legal: How campaigns and their super PAC backers work together'' documents just how easily these super PACs and campaigns coordinate their messages and skirt the rules. As the author notes:       For the first time, nearly every top presidential hopeful      has a personalized super PAC that can raise unlimited sums      and is run by close associates or former aides. Many also are      being boosted by nonprofits, which do not have to disclose      their donors.       The boldness of the candidates has elevated the importance      of wealthy donors to even greater heights than in the last      White House contest, when super PACs and nonprofits reported      spending more than $1 billion on federal races. Although they      are not supposed to coordinate directly with their      independent allies, candidates are finding creative ways to      work in concert with them.  Five years ago, in Citizens United v. FEC, five justices on the Supreme Court departed from principles of judicial restraint and decided to overturn an act of Congress under the broadest grounds possible. In so doing, they overruled a century of practice and decades of doctrine. The Court declared that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend endlessly to finance and influence our elections. This precedent then led to another court decision--SpeechNow.org v. FEC--in the D.C. Circuit that resulted in the creation of the super PAC. Super PACs are supposed to be independent expenditure-only committees, and may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited sums to advocate for or against political candidates. But nobody believes that they truly act independently.  That is why I am introducing the Stop Super PAC-Candidate Coordination Act today. This bill would end the sham practice of presidential candidates boldly and shamelessly exploiting our campaign finance laws by coordinating with allegedly independent super PACs.  First, the bill codifies a definition of what constitutes ``coordination'' based on Supreme Court case law to make it more difficult for coordination to occur. Second, it prohibits outside groups from skirting the coordination provisions by stating that they cannot simply create a ``firewall'' and claim that the there is an independent division that is making independent expenditures. Third, it prevents single-candidate super PACs from acting as an arm of the candidates' campaign. It does this by including factors of when a super PAC should be deemed a ``coordinated spender.'' Once the super PAC falls into this category, the super PACs expenditures are then considered to be ``coordinated expenditures'' and the super PAC is subject to Federal contribution limits and prohibitions. Under existing law, coordinated expenditures are defined as also being in-kind contributions and are subject to the PAC contribution limit of $5,000 per year.  The penalty for any person who knowingly violates the coordination provisions of this act is a civil fine that is three times the amount of the coordinated expenditures involved in excess of the applicable contribution limit. The act also imposes joint and several liability on any director, manager, or officer of an outside spending group for any unpaid penalties by the group violating the coordination rules.  Lastly, the bill prohibits candidates and their agents from raising money for super PACs by prohibiting the raising of funds for any super PAC or political committee that is not subject to Federal contribution limits and reporting requirements. This bill would provide real rules and put into place some regulations that would make it more difficult for these super PACs to coordinate with candidates.  The issue of how our politics are paid for is an issue that is important to the American people, and it is also important to Vermonters. We have always remained steadfast in our belief that our democracy should not be for sale, and that the size of your bank account should not determine whether or not the government responds to your views or needs.  This bill I introduce today is an incremental measure that would help eliminate the sham of single-candidate super PACs and provide some real rules to a process in which the American public is becoming more cynical about every day. I hope that my fellow Senators from both sides of the aisle will support this modest measure.  I understand why Vermonters are outraged by the devastating effects of Citizens United and its progeny. In recent years I have held several hearings to highlight the damage that Citizens United has done to our political process. Last summer, I led the charge in the Senate Judiciary Committee to consider a constitutional amendment to restore the ability of lawmakers at both the Federal and State levels to rein in the influence that billionaires and corporations now have on our elections. The amendment would also have made clear that corporations are not people. Although Senate Democrats were able to vote the constitutional amendment out of the Judiciary Committee, Senate Republicans filibustered the amendment on the floor and refused to allow it an up-or-down vote. I will continue to do all I can to reverse the devastating effects of Citizens United and its subsequent decisions. This bill is one step towards addressing one of the problems that has resulted from those decisions.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article referenced above be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, July 6, 2015] It's Bold, But Legal: How Campaigns and Their Super PAC Backers Work                                 Together                            (By Matea Gold)       The 2016 presidential contenders are stretching the      latitude they have to work with their independent allies more      than candidates in recent elections ever dared, taking      advantage of a narrowly drawn rule that separates campaigns      from outside groups.       For the first time, nearly every top presidential hopeful      has a personalized super PAC that can raise unlimited sums      and is run by close associates or former aides. Many also are      being boosted by non-profits, which do not have to disclose      their donors.       The boldness of the candidates has elevated the importance      of wealthy donors to even greater heights than in the last      White House contest, when super PACs and nonprofits reported      spending more than $1 billion on federal races. Although they      are not supposed to coordinate directly with their      independent allies, candidates are finding creative ways to      work in concert with them.       Before former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) announced his      bid in mid-June, the Right to Rise super PAC filmed footage      of him that the group plans to use in ads. Hillary Rodham      Clinton's campaign is collaborating directly with Correct the      Record, a super PAC providing the Democratic hopeful's team      with opposition research.       Top advisers to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) have been      positioned at two big-money groups as they await his      presidential announcement next week. GOP candidate Carly      Fiorina has gone even further, outsourcing core functions      such as rapid response and event preparation to her allied      super PAC, the aptly named--CARLY for America.       The 2016 contenders and their big-money backers VIEW      GRAPHIC. The widespread cooperation--which many campaign      finance-experts say stretches the legal boundaries--indicates      that candidates and their advisers have little fear that they      will face serious scrutiny from law enforcement, despite the      Justice Department's successful prosecution this year of a      Virginia campaign operative for illegal coordination.       One main reason: Under Federal Election Commission rules,      there is no wall dividing candidates and independent groups.      In practice, it's more like a one-way mirror--with a      telephone on each side for occasional calls.       ``The rules of affiliation are just about as porous as they      can be, and it amounts to a joke that there's no coordination      between these individual super PACs and the candidates,''      said Rep. David E. Price (D-N.C.), who has sponsored      legislation that would put stricter limits in place.       A close reading of FEC regulations reveals that campaigns      can do more than just publicly signal their needs to      independent groups, a practice that flourished in the 2014      midterms.       Operatives on both sides can talk to one another directly,      as long as they do not discuss candidate strategy. According      to an FEC rule, an independent group also can confer with a      campaign until this fall about ``issue ads'' featuring a      candidate. Some election-law lawyers think that a super PAC      could share its entire paid media plan, as long as the      candidate's team does not respond.       But those who defend the current system say that broader      rules could infringe on rights to free speech.       Right to Rise, a super PAC run by Mike Murphy, filmed      footage with then-undeclared candidate Jeb Bush to be used in      later commercials. (NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images) ``Every      discussion you have cannot trigger illegal coordination,''      said Lee E. Goodman, a Republican appointee to the FEC.       ``I understand some people look at relationships between      candidates and independent spenders and sense that those      relationships are too cozy,'' he added. ``Yet the courts have      said that you cannot prohibit friendships and knowledge of      each other.''       But many experts say that the limited-coordination rules      are emblematic of an outdated, incoherent and often      contradictory campaign finance framework.       ``We're at this transitional point where the way money is      raised and spent and the costs of campaigns have changed so      dramatically,'' said Bob Bauer, a prominent campaign finance      lawyer who served as White House counsel for President Obama.      ``The problem isn't that the law isn't being enforced--the      problem is that we need to rethink the whole thing from the      ground up.''       Political strategists on both sides of the aisle agree,      saying that navigating the complex legal thickets is      increasingly difficult.       ``If you talk to three lawyers, you are likely to get three      different answers,'' said Phil Cox, executive director of      America Leads, a super PAC supporting Chris Christie, the      Republican governor of New Jersey. ``The system makes no      sense. It's crying out for reform. We need to put the power      back in the hands of the candidates and their campaigns, not      the outside groups.''       At the moment, though, an overhaul of campaign finance has      little bipartisan support in Congress. And members of the      long-polarized FEC appear more divided than ever. A      discussion at a recent public meeting about stricter      regulations devolved into hostile barbs.       The public is left with the sense that no one is following      the rules, said Ellen L. Weintraub, one of the Democrats on      the FEC.       ``There is this basic notion that super PACs are supposed      to be separate from the candidates,'' she said. ``They look      at what's going on, and they say: `This doesn't look      separate. Where are the lines?' ''       A sweeping boundary was drawn by the Supreme Court in its      seminal 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision, which said that      political activity by outside groups must be done ``totally      independently'' of candidates and parties. A similar standard      was set in the 2002--McCain-Feingold Act, which said that      independent expenditures cannot be made ``in cooperation,      consultation, or concert'' with a candidate.       But in practice, defining coordination has not been easy.      The FEC wrestled mightily with where to draw the lines,      issuing regulations that were challenged repeatedly in the      courts.       A set of FEC rules approved in 2010 prohibits a campaign      from coordinating with an independent group on a paid      communication. The agency laid out specific tests to      determine whether a campaign has illegally shared internal      strategy used to guide an independent group's advertising.       But the rules do not ban coordination in general--much less      conversations between each side.       Bobby Burchfield, a Republican campaign finance lawyer,      said that the clarity of current regulation helps avoid the      kind of intrusive investigations into groups, such as the      Christian Coalition, that the FEC once pursued. ``That had      the effect of suppressing and chilling political activity,''      he said.       Now, there's plenty of room to maneuver. Although a      campaign cannot share private strategy with a super PAC, it      can give a campaign information about its plans, as long the      group is not sharing something of value that could be      considered a contribution.       The FEC also has given candidates its blessing to appear at      super PAC fundraisers, as long as they do not solicit more      than $5,000--a decision that came in response to a query from      two Democratic super PACs in 2011.       Taken together, critics say, the narrow rules offer far too      many opportunities for candidates and their well-funded      outside allies to work in agreement.       The FEC ``couldn't imagine how bold people would be,'' said      Larry Noble, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center,      which supports tougher restrictions.       Right to Rise, the super PAC run by longtime Bush adviser      Mike Murphy, is set to serve as a massive external ad      operation bolstering the former governor's campaign. Murphy      told donors in a recent conference call that before Bush      announced his candidacy, the super PAC filmed footage of him      that the group plans to use in digital and TV spots,      according to an account in BuzzFeed.       ``One of the new ideas that, you know, the governor had--     he's such an innovator--is we're going to be the first super      PAC to really be able to do just positive advertising,''      Murphy said.       Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for Right to Rise, said that      Murphy was referring to ``Governor Bush's historical      preference for positive advertising, which was consistent in      his previous elections and is no secret.''       Clinton's campaign is working closely with Correct the      Record, a liberal rapid-response group that refashioned      itself as a super PAC this year. The group says it can      coordinate directly with the campaign under a 2006 FEC rule      that made content posted free online off-limits to      regulation.       Correct the Record has more than 20 staffers and plans to      disseminate much of its research on its Web site and through      social media.       Any nonpublic information of value that it shares with the      Clinton staff will be purchased, according to a campaign      official.       Already, partisan critics have pounced, filing complaints      with the FEC alleging that the pro-Bush and pro-Clinton super      PACs are engaged in illegal coordination.       But if the agency launches an investigation, it would be a      first. Since 2010, the FEC has yet to open an investigation      into alleged illegal super PAC coordination, closing 29 such      complaints. In 28 of those cases, the agency's general      counsel did not recommend pursuing the matters, according to      Goodman of the FEC.       ``We could capture all of this stuff if we had real      rules,'' said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime advocate of      reducing the influence of big money on politics. ``For all      practical purposes, there are no prohibitions against      coordination.''                                 ______                                       By
