 President, I am surprised that there are so many wise Members of this Senate who know exactly how the prescription drug bill is going to work when it doesn't even start until January 1, 2006. We took language in Democratic proposals on this subject and put them in a bipartisan bill so that there was a consensus of what ought to be done. Now they want to strike them out.  The chief actuary and OMB says this will not save money. It will not increase competition because we have competition written into this by the plans competing against each other. Don't strike that out.
