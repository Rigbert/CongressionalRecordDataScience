 President, on Friday, May 8, I had the honor of paying tribute to a dear friend, John Heyburn, who passed away on April 29 after a long illness.  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I gave during the celebration of his life at St. Francis in the Fields Episcopal Church in Harrods Creek, KY, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             [May 8, 2015]               Leader McConnell's Eulogy of John Heyburn       We lost John just a few days ago, but it's been a long      goodbye.       And so Martha, as we celebrate John this morning, we honor      you too.       Because through it all, you were his most faithful      companion, his fiercest advocate, and a cherished lifeline to      those of us who loved him dearly.       And we're grateful.       Scripture tells us that heaven is a city. And I like to      think that even in life John     would have appreciated the comparison. He loved this city and      all that it meant to him--the connection it gave him to      family and the father he so admired--the opportunity it gave      him to help so many others over the years as a mentor, a      friend, a neighbor, and as a wise and patient jurist.       John just loved being with people--and we loved being with      him. He was a man who was full of life and vigor and a      boundless curiosity about the world around him and the people      who filled it.       Above all, though, he was good.       They say that politics is a contact sport, which is true. I      confess I enjoy it. But it's also true that politics carries      temptations for all us who are involved in it. Most of us      struggle with those temptations, and some occasionally cross      the line. Not John.       John Heyburn had as much integrity as anyone I have ever      known. As a young man, he dreamed of being a politician. But      what he really wanted, I think, was to play a part in shaping      events--to leave a mark on his country, his city, his      community . . . to live not just for himself but for others.       Like so many other great men, he found his heart's ambition      in an unexpected place: in the courtroom he came to love, in      his marriage with Martha, and in the sons he cherished. And      in these last few years, he showed his greatness in another      unexpected way. It was in his heroic struggle against a      terrible illness that he inspired us most with his optimism      and his athlete's spirit. He let us accompany him on the      journey, and we we're the better for it.       To borrow the words of another U.S. Senator, John taught us      how to live and he taught us how to die.       We will miss his hearty laugh, his kind eyes, his      thoughtful presence. But as we say our final goodbye to this      good man, we are comforted by the thought that he is now in      the heavenly city, where we are told that every tear will be      wiped away, full of vigor and new life.       And we are consoled to think that John Heyburn has finally      heard those words he longed to hear: ``Well done, good and      faithful servant, enter your master's joy.''                          ____________________
