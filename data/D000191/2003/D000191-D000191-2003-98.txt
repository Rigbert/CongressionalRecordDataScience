We find our Nation sunk in the hole of a $500 billion trade deficit, and Congress is going to get out the shovels and dig a little deeper.  Mr. Speaker, 251,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost so far this year, exported from the United States; 53,000 jobs in May alone. We have a record 136.1 trade deficit for the first 3 months on a track to $550 billion trade deficit this year.  Our trade policies are failing our workers and our Nation and our future. And the response of this administration and this Congress is a collective yawn and a vote to continue down the same disastrous path. It is pathetic.                          ____________________
