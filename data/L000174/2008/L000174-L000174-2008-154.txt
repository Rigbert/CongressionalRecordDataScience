President, if the Senator will yield for a moment, when the Senator from Pennsylvania is finished, I know Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow wished to speak very briefly. If that was the case, I hope that maybe within the next 10 minutes or so, or that by 6:30, or at 6:30, that perhaps what we can do is this: Let's say at 6:30, if the Senator from Pennsylvania would agree that we might vote at 6:30, then under the previous unanimous consent, if Judge White is confirmed, assuming she is, but if she is under the unanimous consent, then the regular order would be to go to the other two nominees from Michigan. It would be my intent--unless somebody objected--it would be my intent to do those by voice vote. That, of course, is contingent upon her being confirmed under the unanimous consent agreement that I have been shown. Would that be acceptable?
