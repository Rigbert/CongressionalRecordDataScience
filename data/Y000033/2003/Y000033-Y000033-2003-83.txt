Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits any funds from the Homeland Security appropriation from being used to approve a security plan that permits the transporting of unscreened or uninspected cargo on passenger planes.  Air cargo is a potential area of vulnerability in our aviation security system.  In the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, Congress moved to ensure that all checked baggage was screened for explosives. But carry-on baggage and air cargo is still not screened for bombs, at least not the plastic explosives that terrorists tend to use. However, carry-on baggage is screened by x-ray, and air cargo is screened by the ``known shipper program.'' In both areas, we could do better and I appreciate the efforts of the gentleman from Massachusetts to do so.  I am concerned that this amendment could be misinterpreted as requiring that all air cargo be put through an explosive detection system or be opened and physically inspected. If the plain language of the amendment required that, I would oppose it. That is clearly impractical, if not impossible. Currently, there are no machines large enough and quick enough to screen all air cargo in this way. And physical inspection is so cumbersome that it would grind our economy to a halt. This would be a particular problem in my State of Alaska, where the people are especially dependent on air cargo for obtaining necessary goods and service.  However, the amendment simply prohibits any funds from being spent to approve an airline security plan unless that plan provides that air cargo will be screened. Such screening is currently being done through the known shipper program and I would expect that to continue. Over time, new technology may enable us to improve air cargo screening and I would support the use of such technology as long as it would not impede the flow of air commerce.
