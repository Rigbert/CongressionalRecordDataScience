President, if the Senator will yield, as the chairman of the Readiness Committee, we have approved this, and we appreciate very much the way that the Senator from North Carolina has been willing to go into the planning phase so that we will have a chance to go into this project in an orderly fashion. And the funding should not be a problem, because it will be used with existing funds from the National Guard.  I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from North Carolina.
