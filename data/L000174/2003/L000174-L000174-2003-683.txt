President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator Mark Dayton and Senator Larry Craig in introducing the bipartisan Milk Import Tariff Equity Act. Our bill will prevent importers of dairy products from circumventing U.S. trade laws.  Although I opposed it at the time, during the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations, the United States agreed to allow a substantial increase in dairy product imports into this country. Tariff rate quotas were established to allow imports of most dairy products to rise from an average of 2 percent of domestic consumption to as much as five percent. At least initially, these controls appeared to be effective. But foreign competitors have found ways to circumvent these quotas by adjusting the protein content of nonfat dry milk so that it is classifiedby the U.S. Customs Service as milk protein concentrate, MPC. While nonfat dry milk imports are strictly regulated, there are no quotas on MPCs and duties are low.  A recent GAO study requested by Congress determined that MPC imports surged by more than 600 percent over a six year period. MPC imports lower prices for U.S. dairy farmers by displacing sales of nonfat dry milk. According to the GAO study, some exporters are blending previously processed dairy proteins, such as casein, whey and nonfat dry milk into MPC solely for the purpose of avoiding the U.S. tariff rate quota for nonfat dry milk. This practice, specifically cited in the GAO report, circumvents statutory U.S. trade provisions designed to regulate imports of nonfat dry milk powder.  It is time to close this loophole. Under our bill, MPCs would be regulated in the same manner as all other dairy products: by imposing tariff-rate quotas on MPC imports. This legislation also closes a similar loophole that exists for casein used in the production of food or feed, while continuing to allow unrestricted access for imports of casein used in the manufacture of glues and for other industrial purposes.  Most Americans probably don't realize it, because retail fluid milk prices have hardly changed, but dairy farmers in Vermont and across this Nation are really struggling. Farm-gate milk prices have fallen more than 30 percent over the past 18 months and are now at the lowest levels in 25 years. Even the most efficient producers are unable to make a profit at these prices. Prices are low in part due to these imports. Others will argue that MPC imports represent just a small fraction of U.S. milk production. But when you are dealing with a perishable commodity like milk, even a slight increase in supply can have a dramatic effect on prices.  Closing the MPC loophole is one of the most important steps we can take to help our nation's dairy farmers. I commend Senators Dayton and Craig for their leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
