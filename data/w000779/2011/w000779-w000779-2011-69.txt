President, biomass energy development is not only a great economic opportunity for Oregon, it is an essential piece of the forest health puzzle. Biomass energy helps create a market and a way to pay for forest thinning and hazardous fuels programs. It is also a way for keeping local timber and wood products mills in business at a time when the industry, like manyin the U.S. is going through hard times. Biomass also provides an important renewable energy option for the Nation as a substitute for coal and other fossil fuels. Every region of the country has biomass energy opportunities even if the exact nature of the biomass that would be used varies from region to region. Today, I am joining my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and a bipartisan group of Senators, in introducing legislation to make sure that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency can, and will, issue regulations under the Clean Air Act and the Solid Waste Disposal Act that ensure that the owners of these mills and biomass energy plants can continue to invest in them and maintain and create the jobs that are so badly needed.  Pending Environmental Protection Agency regulations governing boilers and incinerators will make it very difficult for biomass energy to be used in the U.S. To its credit, EPA recognizes this fact and has repeatedly proposed to rewrite those regulations to address the concerns of biomass energy users, the forest products industry, and other industries. The legislation being introduced today is aimed at making sure that EPA can collect the necessary data and reissue its regulations in an orderly process that preserves biomass energy as a national energy option and allows economically hard pressed timber and forest products mills to remain in operation.  On December 7, 2010, EPA, which was under court order to issue new Clean Air Act regulations for boilers and incinerators, filed a request with the Federal Court overseeing the boiler emissions rules asking for a delay in the court-ordered deadline for issuing the rules by 15 months so that EPA could reevaluate its own proposed rules and address the problems raised by the forest products industry and others. However, the Federal judge hearing the case rejected EPA's request and gave EPA just a month to fix the rule. In February 2011, EPA met that deadline, but continuing to recognize the flaws in its regulations, it immediately triggered an administrative process known as reconsideration to allow affected industries to provide more information and for the agency to revise its regulations. In May, EPA agreed with industry comments that the rule needed to be reviewed and it agreed to stay, or delay, the implementation of the existing Clean Air Act rules for boilers and incinerators. Unfortunately, EPA did not issue a stay of a related rule which defines which materials can be burned in those boilers and which need to be burned in incinerators. EPA has now proposed a schedule, which it confirmed in letters to me and several other Senators, to consider additional comments by industry and others and develop new Clean Air Act rules.  Unfortunately, this is not the end of the story. Stays can be lifted by the courts. This legislation would statutorily affirm the EPA's stay of the Clean Air Act rules. And it would affirm EPA's proposal to issue new regulations by a date certain. That date would be 15 months from the date of enactment, the same period of time EPA claimed was necessary to draft a new rule. The goal here, which I believe EPA shares, is to issue Clean Air Act regulations that make sense, not to do away with Clean Air Act regulations for boilers and incinerators.  On the other hand, by not agreeing to make changes to the ``what's a fuel and what's not'' rule, EPA has made it very likely that many widely used boiler fuels can no longer be used, like wood scrap from door and window mills. And some results of the rule make little practical sense. For example, scrap tires that are picked up at a tire shop can continue to be burned as a fuel. Scrap tires that are picked up at a landfill cannot. EPA has indicated that it will try to develop regulatory guidance to help industry navigate the regulatory confusion it has created.  I appreciate the fact that EPA recognizes that there is a problem with the fuel-or-waste rule and that they are offering to try to fix it by issuing regulatory guidance. However, I am not convinced that EPA can fix the problems with the rule by just by issuing guidance. This legislation will direct EPA to establish new rules on what materials can be burned as boiler fuel, and which cannot, and give EPA clear statutory direction on what can be included. This direction limits allowable fuels to a specific list so that there are no surprises or backdoor exceptions. EPA can add to the list only after notice and comment so the public knows what, if any, additions are being made.  This process for defining which fuels can be burned in a boiler and which cannot is very important to me. While it makes sense to continue to allow many materials that the wood products industry and others have used as boiler fuels for generations, I do not think that it's appropriate to simply decide that any fuel that was used in a boiler in the past should be grandfathered in. The provisions in this bill defining what materials can be burned in a boiler ensure that will not be the case. This was a major issue in litigation surrounding earlier versions of these rules and I do not think it is wise to ignore this fact. Congress has the opportunity to try to address the legitimate concerns about what is being burned in these boilers and it should.  Finally, the bill would extend the normal 3 year period for boilers to come into compliance to 5 years. It is my hope that once there a final regulations and industry knows what it has to do that it will not take that long. However, there some 2000 boilers in the U.S. that would all have to upgrade or replace their units all at the same time and coincident with similar rules going into effect for electric utility company boilers. This extra time will mean that there will be no excuse for not meeting the final standards.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                U.S. Environmental                                            Protection Agency,                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2011.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: I appreciate the opportunity to meet      with you on June 16, 2011, regarding the Environmental      Protection Agency's (EPA) Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials      (NHSM) rule, the Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology      (MACT) rule, and the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste      Incinerators (CISWI) rule. Thank you for your constructive      engagement on these priority issues. We are currently      exploring various pathways under existing authority to      address your concerns.       As you know, the Boiler MACT and CISWI standards are      currently subject to an administrative stay. Today, as part      of a filing with the United States Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit, the EPA announced the intended      schedule for reconsideration of the boilers and CISWI rules.      To ensure that the agency's standards are based on the best      available data and that the public is given ample opportunity      to provide additional input and information, the agency      intends to propose the reconsideration rule by the end of      October 2011 and issue a final rule by the end of April 2012.      This is the best approach to establish technically and      legally sound standards that will bring significant health      benefits to the American public.       We believe that this stay and the reconsideration period      will provide ample time to administratively address the      issues raised by various stakeholders on these corresponding      rules.       The NHSM rule, which we discussed in our meeting, aims to      ensure that the burning of solid waste is subject to      appropriate emission controls required under the Clean Air      Act and that exposure to harmful pollutants is minimized. We      understand that biomass derivatives have long been used for      energy purposes in the wood products industry and we believe      our rule allows such use to continue without being subject to      the CISWI standards, provided that criteria, referred to as      ``legitimacy'' criteria, are met.       Since promulgation of our rule, questions have arisen about      how these criteria will be applied and our goal has been to      ensure that the flexibility provided by the rule is in fact      realized. To that end, we have held several meetings with      industry representatives to discuss and understand their      concerns and to review newly available data. In addition, on      June 21, 2011, my Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and      Emergency Response, Mathy Stanislaus, met with      representatives of several industries that use biomass      derivatives and other non-hazardous secondary materials as      fuel to ensure that they understand the significant      flexibility already afforded by the rule, and to discuss the      EPA's concepts for further clarifying that flexibility.       As part of that discussion, Mr. Stanislaus explained that      one of the options that EPA is considering is issuing      clarifying guidance regarding the Agency's legitimacy      criteria. Such guidance is a useful tool that is often used      under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to      address these types of issues. The guidance could provide a      clear guidepost for comparing traditional fuels with      secondary materials. It potentially could clarify that      certain nonhazardous secondary materials would not be      considered     solid waste when combusted and that the units combusting      those materials can continue to be used as fuels without      having to meet the CISWI standards. Mr. Stanislaus requested      that the industry representatives provide the Agency with      supporting data on traditional fuels that could further      inform the development of such guidance, and asked for      feedback on the approach he outlined. In addition to this      approach, the Agency is also exploring other options.       We recognize that stakeholders have also raised other      issues with the NHSM rule. We are continuing to evaluate      those issues expeditiously.       I believe we have made significant progress in addressing      the concerns raised by the industry. I will continue to watch      the issue closely and keep you informed. My goal is to bring      these issues to closure as soon as possible.           Sincerely,                                                  Lisa P. Jackson,     Administrator.                                  ____         U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Solid            Waste and Emergency Response,                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2011.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you again for the constructive      dialogue regarding issues relating to EPA's Non-Hazardous      Secondary Materials (NHSM) rule, the Boiler Maximum      Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule and the Commercial      and Industrial Solid Waste Incinerator (CISWI) rule. In the      Administrator's letter of June 27, 2011 she indicated that      the agency is exploring various pathways to address your      specific concerns regarding implementation of the NHSM rule.      EPA is committed to issuing guidance to assist industry in      applying the legitimacy criteria, and had requested that      industry representatives provide the agency with supporting      data to further inform the development of such guidance.       We received additional information from industry and based      on this information and further discussions, we have      developed the enclosed concept paper for the development of      guidance. The paper identifies approaches to the guidance      that EPA continues to evaluate for determining whether      concentrations of contaminants in the NHSM are ``comparable''      to concentrations of those same contaminants in traditional      fuels. These comparisons are important in ensuring that NHSM      are being legitimately recycled and are not solid wastes, as      well as recognizing the varied uses of such secondary      materials as product fuels.       We are optimistic about our ability to develop guidance      that meaningfully addresses the industry concerns and we are      giving it the highest priority within the agency. We intend      to complete internal development of draft guidance based on      the concept paper by August 31, 2011. In addition, we      continue to evaluate all available options available to      address the issues raised.       Please be assured that EPA will continue to keep you      informed of our progress in addressing the issues involved      with the NHSM rule, as well as the related Clean Air Act      rulemakings. If you or your staff have any questions      regarding the enclosed concept paper, please contact me or      your staff may call Carolyn Levine in EPA's Office of      Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at (202) 564-     1859.           Sincerely,                                                 Mathy Stanislaus,     Assistant Administrator.                          ____________________
