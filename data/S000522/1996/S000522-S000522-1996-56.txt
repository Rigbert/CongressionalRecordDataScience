Mr. Chairman, every year Planned Parenthood counsels, refers or performs over 230,000 abortions, an absolutely staggering number of children who die. Taxpayers subsidize the counseling and the referring as part of title X.  Every year tens of thousands of teenage moms, many of them frightened and extremely impressionable, walk into Planned Parenthood and other title X clinics carrying perfectly healthy babies only to leave that clinic having had their babies shredded and ripped apart by powerful suction machines or killed by chemical poison. In many of these cases the parents have no idea this is happening.  The bottom line in this legislation and the amendment, which is really a sense of the Congress offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey], is that our current policy trusts strangers more than they do the parents. There is a bypass in the legislation offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook], that if there is a dysfunctional family, there is a way of getting around it. But I think we need to put our trust, invest our hopes more into the parents and stop looking for the government bureaucrats and so-called counselors, strangers, to take care of our daughters.
