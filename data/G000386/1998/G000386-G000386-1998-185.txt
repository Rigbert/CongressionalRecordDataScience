 President, I rise today to recognize an organization that has served the U.S. Senate well for 20 years. The organization I want to talk about is the Employee Benefit Research Institute or EBRI, as we call it. EBRI is observing its 20th anniversary today, September 14. Created with the help of a handful of employee benefit consultants and actuaries in 1978 who wanted to fill the void that existed relating to data about employee benefits, EBRI has increased its membership to include representatives from pension funds to Fortune 500 companies, labor unions, and trade associations.  With this broad representation, EBRI has the ability to influence policymakers and elected officials throughout the country. But EBRI uses its influence wisely. EBRI does not lobby Members of Congress or other governmental agencies. Rather, its mission is to provide objective, nonpartial information on the issues of economic security and employee benefits. EBRI does its job very, very well.  As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I can personally attest to the value of EBRI's work and the expertise of its staff. Last year, the CEO of EBRI, Dallas Salisbury moderated a panel forum consisting of 6 experts who discussed the role of employment in retirement income. This forum led to a Senate hearing on the issue of the implications of raising the retirement age, as well as a number of articles in newspapers and magazines on the need to consider whether older Americans have sufficient opportunities to stay employed.  More recently, EBRI was actively involved with its educational partner, the American Savings Education Council (ASEC), in the planning of the first National Summit on Retirement Savings. This Summit was part of an initiative I introduced in the Senate called the Savings Are Vital to Everyone's Retirement or SAVER Act. The Summit attracted international attention and has put the Department of Labor, ASEC, and state and local governments on a course toward enhancing the awareness of Americans about the need to save for retirement and how to go about it.  I know my colleagues value the work of EBRI just as much I do. In the years ahead, I am sure we will continue to rely heavily on the research and the publications produced by EBRI. The issues EBRI concerns itself with--employee benefits and income security--are receiving more national attention than ever before. EBRI's contributions as an objective provider of information will help make the job of ensuring Americans have health and income security in retirement easier to achieve.                          ____________________
