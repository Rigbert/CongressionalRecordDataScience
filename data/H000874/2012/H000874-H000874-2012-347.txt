Speaker, on March 31 my state of Maryland lost a giant in the realm of higher education. Dr. Thomas E. Florestano, who served for fifteen years as President of Anne Arundel Community College, sadly passed away at age 79.  The son of Italian immigrants, Tom was born in Annapolis and graduated from St. Mary's High School in 1952. He matriculated into the University of Maryland but paused his studies to serve in the U.S. Army as a military police officer in Korea and West Germany. Honorably discharged as a sergeant four years later, Tom returned to the University and earned a bachelor's degree in education in 1958.  While an undergraduate, Tom met his future wife of 52 years, Patricia Sherer. Together, they dedicated their careers to improving access to higher education for Maryland students, with Patricia teaching at the University of Baltimore and currently serving as chairwoman of the Board of Regents for the University System of Maryland.  After graduating, Tom worked as an education advisor at the Army Education Center in Fort Meade. Two years later, he joined the University of Maryland as assistant dean of student life and director of student activities. During this period, Tom earned his master's degree in education and later obtained his Ph.D., both from the University of Maryland.  Tom turned his attention to community college administration in 1970, when he took a job as dean of evening and community education and summer school at Prince George's Community College. After nine years there, Tom was appointed President of Anne Arundel Community College.  He took over during a time when the college was facing significant challenges, including tensions between faculty and administration as well as declining enrollment and budget shortfalls. Tom oversaw a program of revitalization that tripled enrollment, instituted new degree programs, expanded the campus, and turned deficits into sound finances by the time he retired in 1994. The legacy of his leadership of Anne Arundel Community College has been its transformation into the third-largest community college in Maryland. Even more so, Tom put the ``community'' back in ``community college.''  All of us who knew Tom recognized him as one who looked at a challenge and saw an opportunity and who looked at a student and saw a future. Those futures were what he worked so hard to make possible for thousands of Maryland students.  Tom will be greatly missed by the Maryland education community and by all of us who called him a friend. I join in celebrating his life and offering my condolences to Patricia, their son Tom Jr., daughter Leslie, son-in-law Kevin, and their extended family.                          ____________________
