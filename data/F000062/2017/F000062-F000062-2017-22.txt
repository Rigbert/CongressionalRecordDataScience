 Hatch, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Harris, Mr. Roberts, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Franken, Ms. Hassan, Ms. Hirono, and Mr. Kaine) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 267       Whereas investment in the education and training of the      United States workforce is crucial to the ability of the      United States to compete in the global economy;       Whereas collaboration among local educational agencies,      community colleges, Governors, local governments, local      businesses, employment service providers, and workforce      development boards provides for long-term, sustainable, and      successful workforce development across traditional sectors      and emerging industries;       Whereas, as of September 2017, middle-skill jobs, which      require more than a high school diploma but not a 4-year      degree, comprise 53 percent of the labor market, but only 43      percent of United States workers are trained at that level,      creating a discrepancy that may limit growth in changing      industries such as health care, manufacturing, and      information technology;       Whereas, in 2014, Congress reauthorized the Workforce      Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) with      overwhelming bipartisan support in recognition of the need to      strengthen the focus of the United States on the skills      necessary to fill jobs in local and regional industries;       Whereas the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29      U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) supports employment, training, and      support services for individuals with barriers to employment,      including individuals--       (1) who are out of work;       (2) displaced by outsourcing;       (3) looking to learn new skills; and       (4) with disabilities;       Whereas the more than 550 workforce development boards and      2,500 American Job Centers are a driving force behind growing      regional economies by providing training, resources, and      assistance to workers who aim to compete in the 21st century      economy;       Whereas ongoing State and local implementation of the      Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et      seq.) provides unprecedented opportunities to develop the      skills of United States workers through access to effective      workforce education and training, including the development      and delivery of proven strategies such as sector      partnerships, career pathways, integrated education and      training, work-based learning models, and paid internships;       Whereas, in 2015, programs authorized under the Workforce      Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.)--       (1) served nearly 7,000,000 young people and adults;       (2) exceeded employment targets across all programs; and       (3) helped more than 1,500,000 individuals, including      English language learners, take classes to gain skills and      credentials to help the individuals succeed in the labor      market;       Whereas State programs established under the Wagner-Peyser      Act (29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.)--       (1) served nearly 14,000,000 unemployed workers through      American Job Centers in 2015; and       (2) are an integral part of the workforce development      system;       Whereas workforce development programs will play a critical      role in addressing the expected 2,000,000 unfilled      manufacturing jobs over the next decade;       Whereas community colleges and other workforce development      training providers across the United States are well-     situated--       (1) to train the next generation of United States workers;      and       (2) to address the educational challenges created by      emerging industries and technological advancements;       Whereas participation in a career and technical education      (referred to in this preamble as ``CTE'') program decreases      the risk of students dropping out of high school, and all 50      States and the District of Columbia report higher graduation      rates for CTE students, as compared to other students;       Whereas community and technical colleges operate as open      access institutions serving millions of students annually at      a comparatively low cost;       Whereas the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education      Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.) supports the development      and implementation of high-quality CTE programs that--       (1) combine rigorous academic content with occupational      skills; and       (2) served 11,900,000 high school and college students from      2015 to 2016;       Whereas there are nearly 500,000 registered apprentices in      the United States, and there is growing and bipartisan      support for expanding earn-and-learn strategies to help      current and future workers gain skills and work experience;       Whereas federally supported workforce system and partner      programs--       (1) have helped the United States rebuild the economy and      provide increased economic opportunities; and       (2) provide a pathway into jobs that support families while      ensuring that United States businesses find the skilled      workforce needed to compete in the global economy; and       Whereas workforce development is crucial to sustaining      economic security for United States workers: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates September 2017 as ``National Workforce      Development Month'';       (2) supports Federal initiatives to promote workforce      development; and       (3) acknowledges that workforce development plays a crucial      role in supporting workers and growing the economy.
