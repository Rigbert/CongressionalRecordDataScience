  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman that preceded me in the well is correct. We should all celebrate Veterans' Day. In fact, we should celebrate Veterans' Day and honor Veterans' Day every day in this Chamber. But I do remember on the night that the war began in Iraq, we passed a resolution supporting the troops and an hour later we passed a budget that cut $2 billion out of the veterans budget.  I do remember that the President proposed doubling the prescription drug fee for veterans. I do remember that our veterans, the Democrats have offered a proposal to stop taxing disabled veterans, the disabled veterans tax. The President has threatened to veto any legislation which contains that.  So although the gentleman can rattle off those great statistics, that is not the experience of the veterans in my district. They are waiting longer to get minimal service. Fewer of them can get service. They have now established a new Category 8 of veterans who cannot get service even if they have served with valor in combat.  It is one thing to get up here and spout statistics and that, but the reality is can your veterans get the service they need that we promised when they need it; and the answer is for many, no.                          ____________________
