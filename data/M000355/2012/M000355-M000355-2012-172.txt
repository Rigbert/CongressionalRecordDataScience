 President, today I wish to recognize Mr. John Bowling of Laurel County, KY. ``Big John Bowling,'' as he is affectionately called by friends and family, not only served Laurel County as jailer during the 1970s, but has also lived a life of kindness and integrity. His legacy to Kentucky exceeds his public service because not only was he a compassionate jailer, he also built a loving home for his family that welcomed all members of the Laurel County community.  John Bowling met his wife, Imogene, at a church dinner. After commenting on the quality of a macaroni salad at the dinner, his pastor introduced him to Imogene. At that time Imogene was married, but later, in 1964, her husband was tragically killed in a car crash and Imogene was left with three children aged 7, 4, and 2 years old. Imogene began working at Hoskins Grocery where, 5 years later, she and Mr. Bowling became reacquainted.  The couple began dating and they brought Imogene's children along on every date. After 6 years, the couple married. In their first year of marriage, Imogene had another daughter, Tammy Jo. The four children loved their parents and considered John to be an excellent father. Mr. Bowling truly cared for the children, which he showed by ensuring chaperones came along on all of their dates which were only at church.  The family continued to grow when Imogene was approached to take in Toni, a 21-year-old who did not have a palette in her mouth, had limited hearing in one ear, and no hearing canal in the other ear. Though Toni could only communicate through sign language, she quickly became part of the Bowling family.  Crediting faith in God for their success in blending a harmonious family, John Bowling created a home atmosphere that was accepting of anyone who crossed his home's threshold. From adopting his wife's children, to taking in Toni, to allowing relatives and family friends to stay with the family, Big John made his home one of love.  It is an honor today to pay tribute to my fellow Kentuckian, John Bowling. Mr. Bowling not only made a family and lovingly raised his children, but also opened up his home for those in need of a place of refuge and comfort. He is an example of what it means to live by the Golden Rule. The Laurel County community is better off today because of the impact ``Big John Bowling'' has made and the compassionate way in which he treated others.  At this time I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. John Bowling for his service to Laurel County, KY. An article from the Sentinel Echo: Silver Edition magazine, published in Laurel County, recently highlighted this humble man's invaluable contributions to his family and community. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [The Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Spring 2012]                  Jailer by Vocation, Father at Heart                           (By Nita Johnson)       Though known more commonly as ``Big John Bowling,'' a      former and extremely popular county jailer, John Bowling is      also remembered as an excellent father.       He was renowned for his kindness and humanity while serving      as Laurel County Jailer during the 1970s, traits he showed to      both jail employees and inmates and he also displayed to his      wife and children at home.       Although only one of the five children he raised with his      wife, Imogene, was his biological child, Bowling's other      children recall him as being a loving father to them.       Bowling met Imogene at a church dinner at Piney Grove      Holiness Church on Ky. 363 on an invitation from then-pastor      Bobby Medley. Bowling and Medley were good friends, and      Imogene, who was married at that time, and Medley's wife were      good friends, though Bowling and Imogene had never met. When      Bowling sampled some macaroni salad at the dinner that      Sunday, he was impressed.       ``He said he told Bobby that he didn't know who made that      macaroni salad, but if she was single, he was going to marry      her,'' said his daughter, Joyce Parker. ``So Bobby introduced      John to Mom.''       That meeting was one of the highlights of Imogene's life.      In 1964, her husband was killed in a car crash, leaving her      with three children--ages 7, 4, and 2--to raise alone. She      had no job, no car, no driver's license, and was herself very      ill.       ``The day after the funeral, she went to Good Samaritan      Hospital,'' Parker explained. ``She was in and out of the      hospital five times for 10 days with bleeding ulcers.''       ``She'd been eating vanilla wafers and drinking skim      milk,'' added Barbara Wells, another daughter.       ``She was actually healed from the ulcers,'' Parker said.      ``She came home to spend some time with us and went to a      revival. The preacher went to her and told her she needed      healing. When she went back to the doctor, she didn't have      the ulcers.''       Once back in good health, Imogene set out to obtain a job.      She got her driver's license, bought a car, and began working      at Warner's store in London around 1966. She later worked at      Hoskins Grocery on Ky. 363, where she met John again when he      came into the store one day.       The couple began dating, with Imogene insisting on taking      the children with her on dates, even though other family      members offered to keep the children.       ``When she and John dated, she wouldn't go without us,''      Wells said. ``John had a truck with a camper on it and we'd      ride in the back and look through the window into the      front.''       Their union came six years later. The family consisted of      Imogene's children, Barbara, Joyce, and Gerald, as well as      Imogene's mother, who had lived with them since Imogene's      husband died. Eleven months after their marriage, John and      Imogene became the parents of Tammy Jo.       ``John was always good to us,'' Parker said. ``He hauled      trucks from GM dealers and he got us all a new watch so we      loved him.''       ``He never spanked us,'' Wells added. ``I guess that's why      we never resented him. Mom did all the discipline.''       ``The kids were never much trouble,'' Bowling said. ``They      were always good kids.''       Wells, the eldest of the brood, said rules were very strict      at the Bowling household, however.       ``We had curfews and rules. We had chaperones on our dates,      which was only going to church,'' she said. ``There was an      old lady that lived near us and, when I had a date, she      chaperoned us. Then later on, Joyce and Gerald chaperoned.''       ``Then I chaperoned when Joyce dated,'' chimed in Tammy Jo.       Children were always welcome at the Bowling household, with      nieces and nephews from both sides of the family often living      with the family. Imogene also took in disabled adults and      elderly persons, as she was certified to keep as many as      three at one time.       Then the family extended again with the arrival of Toni,      who has now lived with the Bowling family for 38 years.       ``She was an orphan and was born with deformities,''      Imogene said. ``Her father wanted to just leave her at the      hospital (in Philadelphia) but her mother wouldn't do it. She      remarried and had another child and died. The stepfather kept      (Toni) around until the baby was big enough that he could      take care of her and he took her to a mental health office.       ``They called me and asked if I could take her,'' Imogene      continued. ``She cried every day, all day, for three weeks      and I told them I couldn't keep her. Then she started doing      better. She's been with us since she was 21 years old.''       Toni, who lacked a palette in her mouth and had only 20      percent hearing in one ear and no hearing canal in the other      ear, can speak only partially and uses sign language to      communicate. But she is as much a part of the Bowling family      as the other four children, all of whom express their love      for one another.       While many question the success of blended families, the      Bowling family credits their faith in God and religious      background for their own success. They also credit the      demeanor of their parents.       ``John was not a typical stepfather,'' Parker said. ``He      took care of us, always worked hard and my parents never      raised their voices.''       ``I think one key to blended families is that Mom did the      discipline,'' Wells said. ``My husband, Mark, has three      stepdaughters and he never spanked them. I did the      discipline. I think that is one reason that our family      worked. We didn't have that jealousy or resentment or saying      that he wasn't the real dad.''       Whatever the secret of successfully blended families may      be, the Bowlings and their children all agree that staying in      church was a key factor. Now approaching their 43rd      anniversary in June, the couple continues to stay close to      their children, always showing their love and support for one      another and celebrating the true meaning of family.                          ____________________
