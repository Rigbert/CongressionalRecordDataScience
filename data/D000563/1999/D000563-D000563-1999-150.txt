President, I rise today to offer this amendment regarding childhood asthma. For the next 15 minutes imagine breathing through a tiny straw the size of a coffee stirrer, never getting enough air. Now imagine suffering through this process three to six times a day. This is asthma.  Today, asthma is considered the worst chronic health problem plaguing this nation's children, affecting nearly 15 million Americans. That figure includes more than 700,000 Illinoisans, of whom 213,000 are children under the age of 18. Illinois has the nation's highest asthma-related death rate for African-American males, and Chicago has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.  During a recent visit to Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, I met a wonderful little boy whose life is a daily fight against asthma. He told me he can't always participate in gym class or even join his friends on the playground. Fortunately, Nicholas is receiving the medical attention necessary to manage his asthma. Yet for millions of children, this is not the case. Their asthma goes undiagnosed and untreated, making trips to the emergency room as common as trips to the grocery store.  In an effort to help the millions of children who live every day with undiagnosed or untreated asthma, I am offering this amendment with my colleague Sen. Mike DeWine. It would provide $50 million in grants through the Center for Disease Control, for community-based organizations including hospitals, community health centers, school-based programs, foster care programs, childhood nutrition programs to support asthma screening, treatment, education and prevention programs.  Despite the best efforts of the health community, childhood asthma is becoming more common, more deadly and more expensive. In the past 20 years, childhood asthma cases have increased by 160 percent and asthma-related deaths have tripled despite improved treatments.  Chicago has the dubious distinction of having the second highest rate of childhood asthma in the country. Only New York City has higher rates. According to a study published by the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, of inner-city school children in Chicago, researchers found that the prevalence of diagnosed asthma was 10.8 per cent, or twice the 5.8 per cent the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates in that age group nationally. The study also found that most of the children with diagnosed asthma were receiving medical care, but it may not be consistent with what asthma care guidelines recommend. Researchers questioned parents of kindergartners and found 10.8 per cent of the children had been found to have asthma. The researchers estimated an additional 6 to 7 percent had undiagnosed asthma. By comparison, the nationwide asthma rate for children 5 to 14 is 7.4 per cent. Moreover, many of the asthma cases were severe: 42 per cent had trouble sleeping once or twice a week because of wheezing, and 87 per cent had emergency room visits during the previous year.  Asthma disproportionately attacks many of society's most vulnerable those least able to fight back, children and minorities. A recent New York Times article described a study in the Brooklyn area where it was found that a staggering 38 per cent of homeless children suffer from asthma.  Some of the factors known to contribute to asthma such as poor living circumstances, exposure to cockroach feces, stress, exposure to dampness and mold are all experienced by homeless children. They are also experienced by children living in poor housing or exposed to urban violence. There are other factors such as exposure to second hand smoke and smog that also exacerbate or trigger asthma attacks.  For minorities, asthma is particularly deadly. The Asthma death rate for African-Americans is more than twice as high as it is for other segments of the population. Illinois has the highest asthma-related death rate in the country for African-American males. The death rate is 3 times higher than the asthma-related death rate for whites in Illinois. Nationwide, the childhood asthma-related death rate in 1993, was 3 to 4 times higher for African Americans compared to Caucasian Americans. The hospitalization rate for asthma is almost three times as high among African-American children under the age of 5 compared to their white counterparts The increased disparity between death rates compared to prevalence rates has been partially explained by decreased access to health care services for minority children.  Even though asthma rates are particularly high for children in poverty,they are also rising substantially for suburban children. Overall, the rates are increasing. Every one of us knows of a child whether our own, a relative's or a friend's who suffers from asthma.  Asthma-related death rates have tripled in the last two decades. My state of Illinois has the highest asthma-related deaths in the country for African American men.  The effects of asthma on society are widespread. Many of you may be surprised to learn that asthma is the single most common reason for school absenteeism. Parents miss work while caring for children with asthma. Beyond those days missed at school and parents missing work, there is the huge emotional stress suffered by asthmatic children. It is a very frightening event for a small child to be unable to breathe. A recent US News article quoted an 8-yr old Virginian farm girl, Madison Benner who described her experience with asthma. She said ``It feels like something was standing on my chest when I have an asthma attack.'' This little girl had drawn a picture of a floppy-eared, big footed elephant crushing a frowning girl into her bed.  In many urban centers, over 60 per cent of childhood admissions to the emergency room are for asthma. There are 1.8 million emergency room visits each year for asthma. Yet the emergency room is hardly a place where a child and the child's parents can be educated in managing their asthma. In 1994, 466,000 Americans were hospitalized with asthma, up from 386,000 in 1979.  Asthma is one of the most common and costly diseases in the US. In contrast to most other chronic diseases, the health burden of asthma is increasing rapidly. The financial burden of asthma was $6.2 billion in 1990 and is estimated to increase to more than $15 billion in 2000.  Most children who have asthma develop it in their first year, but it often goes undiagnosed or as the study I mentioned earlier, the children may not receive the best treatment. The National Institutes of Health is home to the National Asthma Education and Prevention board. This is a large group of experts from all across the fields involved in health care and asthma. They have developed guidelines on both treating asthma and educating children and their parents in prevention. It is very important that when we spend money on developing such guidelines that they actually get out to communities so that they can take advantage of this research.  CDC has been working in collaboration with NIH to make sure that health professionals and others get the most up to date information. My amendment could further help this effort by providing grantees with this information.  We do have treatments that work for most people. Early diagnosis, treatment and management are key to preventing serious illness and death. There are several wonderful models for success already available to some communities. Take for example the ``breathmobile'' program in Los Angeles that was started 2 years ago. This program provides a van that is equipped with medical personnel, asthma education materials, and asthma treatment supplies. It goes out to areas that are known to have a high incidence of childhood asthma and screens children in those areas. This ``Breathmobile'' program has reduced trips to the emergency room by 17 per cent in the first year of operation. This program is being expanded to sites in Phoenix, Atlanta, and Baltimore. I hope that we can be as successful in Illinois and other parts of the country. Children in these Breathmobile programs are also enrolled in the Children's Health Program if they are income eligible. We have all heard of how slow enrollment in the children's health program has been and anything that we can do to speed enrollment up is vitally important.  In West Virginia, a Medicaid ``disease management'' program which seeks to coordinate children with asthma's care so that they get the very best care has been found to be very cost effective. It has reduced trips to the emergency room by 30 per cent.  In Illinois, the Mobile CARE Foundation is setting up a program in Chicago based on the Los Angeles initiative. In addition, the American Association of Chest Physicians has joined with other groups to form the Chicago Asthma Consortium to provide asthma screening and treatment. Efforts like these need our amendment. This Childhood Asthma Amendment would expand these programs to help ensure that no child goes undiagnosed and every asthmatic child gets the treatment he or she needs.  I am offering this amendment here today with my colleague from Ohio, so that we can expand these programs to other areas of the country. It is a very simple amendment. It adds $10 million to the Centers for Disease Control's appropriations for local community grants to screen children for asthma and if they are found to have it, to provide them with treatment and education into how to manage their asthma.  CDC has current authority to carry out such programs and as the Bill Report already notes on page 93 of the report: ``The Committee is pleased with the work that CDC has done to address the increasing prevalence of asthma. However the increase in asthma among children, particularly among inner-city minorities, remains alarming. The Committee urges CDC to expand its outreach aimed at increasing public awareness of asthma control and prevention strategies, particularly among at risk minority populations in under-served communities.'' I couldn't agree more. We do need to do more in this area.  No child should die from asthma. We need to make sure that people understand the signs of asthma and that all asthmatic children have access to treatment and information on how to lessen their exposure to things that trigger asthma attacks.  My amendment responses to the alarming increase in childhood asthma cases and asthma-related deaths. It would provide funds to community and state organizations that serve areas with the largest number of children who are at risk of developing asthma and areas with the highest asthma-related death rates. The grantees could use the funds to develop programs to best meet the needs of their residents. The funds could be targeted to those communities where there are the highest number of children with asthma or where there is the highest number of asthma-related deaths.  This amendment is a small step toward addressing this the single greatest chronic health illness of children today. $10 million is a pretty small sum. I am glad that this amendment has been accepted.  The Amendment is supported by the American Lung Association, the National Association for Children's Hospitals and Research Institutions, the Academy of Pediatrics, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and others who support children's health.  I thank my colleagues on behalf of the 5 million children who suffer from asthma today in America for accepting this amendment that can make some progress to combat this the most preventable childhood illness.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to support the Durbin-DeWine pediatric asthma amendment. This amendment would appropriate $10 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to award grants to local communities for screening, treatment, and education relating to childhood asthma.  On May 5th of this year, the Allergy and Asthma Network's Mothers of Asthmatics organized an asthma awareness day to educate everyone about asthma. As most of you probably know, asthma is a chronic lung disease caused by inflammation of the lower airways. During an asthma attack, these airways narrow--making it difficult and sometimes impossible to breathe. Fortunately, we have the ``tools'' to handle asthma attacks once they occur. The most common way, of course, is to use an asthma inhaler that millions of us use every day. We also know a lot about how to prevent asthma attacks in the first place--through drug therapy and by avoiding many well-known asthma triggers.  With asthma prevalence rates--and asthma death rates--on the rise, especially in inner-city populations, it is important for us to raise national awareness, so we can educate families on how to detect, treat, and manage asthma symptoms. Of the more than 15 million Americans who suffer from asthma, over five million are children. The American Lung Association estimates that in my home state of Ohio, 212,895 children under the age of 18 suffer from asthma. That's about two percent of the entire population in Ohio. Asthma is the most common chronic illness affecting children and is the leading cause of missed school days due to chronic illness.  Asthma is hitting the youngest the hardest. Nationwide, the most substantial prevalence rate increase for asthma occurred among children 4 years-old and younger. Hospitalization rates due to asthma were also highest in this young age group, rising 74 percent between 1979 and 1992. These increases in hospitalization rates are especially affecting the inner city populations, where asthma triggers, like air pollutants, are more concentrated.  An August 29 Akron Beacon Journal article cites statistics from the CDC that show the ratio of children under age four with asthma increased from one in forty-five in 1980 to one in seventeen in 1994. Every year, more than 5,000 Americans die from this disease--these are PREVENTABLE deaths. A July 27 New York Times article described the results of a study performed by a team at the Center for Children's Health and the Environment at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. This study found that hospitalization rates were as much as 21 times higher in poor, minority areas than in the hardest-hit areas of wealthier communities. The article quotes Dr. Claudio, an assistant professor in the division of neuropathology at Mount Sinai, who said, ``The outcomes in the poor Latino and African-American areas, especially among children, are tragic.'' This Mount Sinai report cited previous studies that suggest that poor African-American and Latino children are suffering at higher rates because the poor often rely on care in emergency rooms, where doctors have little time to educate families on how to control the disease and where there is little follow-up care. Without receiving adequate care and medication, the asthma victims eventually suffer such severe attacks that they need immediate hospitalization.  Those are some of the reasons why I joined my colleague, Senator Durbin, in introducing S.805, the ``Children's Asthma Relief Act.'' This bill will help ensure that children with asthma receive the care they need to live normal lives. It provides grants that will be used to develop and expand asthma services to children, equip mobile health care clinics that provide diagnosis and asthma-related health care services, educate families on asthma management, and identify and enroll uninsured children who are eligible for, but not receiving, health coverage under Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program. By requiring coordination with current children's health programs, this bill will help us identify children--in programs such as supplemental nutrition programs, Maternal and Child Health Programs, child welfare and foster care and adoption assistance programs--who are asthmatic, but might otherwise remain undiagnosed and untreated.  By increasing local asthma surveillance activities through legislation, such as S.805, and by better educating the public on the importance of asthma awareness and management through events like Asthma Awareness Day, we can help reverse the distressing increase in hospitalization rates and mortality rates due to asthma. As a person with asthma, and as the father of 3 children with asthma, I know first-hand how important diagnosis, treatment, and management are to ensuring that this manageable disease will not prevent children and adults from carrying on normal lives. We can make a big difference.  Asthma is a serious health concern that simply must be addressed.  I commend my colleague, Senator Frist, for the outstanding children's health hearing that his Public Health Subcommittee held on September 16. A very articulate 13-year old named Robert Jackson from South Euclid, OH, testified at that hearing. He described how important early diagnosis and treatment plans are for children who suffer from asthma. According to Robert, doctors at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland explained to him how he could avoid asthma ``triggers''--like cigarette smoke and strong odors like bleach--to avoid having serious asthma attacks. By learning how to manage his asthma through an asthma treatment plan, Robert now plays sports, attends school regularly, and maintains a newspaper route.  At a time when States, like Ohio, finally are passing laws that allow students to take their asthma inhalers to school, we need to provide the federal public health dollars to the CDC for childhood asthma screening, treatment, and education. The states gradually are realizing the severity of this disease and the need for children to access their inhalers to manage their asthma. It is now time for the Federal Government to help local communities stem the rising prevalence of the worst chronic health problem affecting children.  I commend my colleagues for supporting this very important amendment as it will help the nearly 5 million children who have been diagnosed with asthma, as well as those children who suffer from asthma, but remain undiagnosed and--sadly--untreated.
