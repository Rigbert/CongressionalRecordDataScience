Speaker, I have had the honor of serving with the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek) on the Committee on Appropriations for many years now. We saw the parade of Members from both sides of the aisle, all sorts of ideologies, come and give the gentlewoman a hug. They gave her a hug not for her, although she appreciated it; they gave her a hug for themselves. She is an historic leader of this House, an historic leader of her State, and a great American. She loves this country, and the great news is her country loves her.  The gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek) is a person of great depth, of great intellect, of great ability, who is as humble an individual as I know, as effective an individual as I know.  And, Carrie, all of us will miss you in the day-to-day operations of this body. But as the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) indicated, we know that you are not going. We think you are probably going to be coming here regularly to visit family. Who knows?  But we certainly want to say to the gentlewoman that we thank her. We thank her for being her, for being our friend, for being such a great Member of this House. She has brought honor to this House, she has brought humanity to this House, and she has brought great service to her district.                          ____________________
