 Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I had an amendment that I am going to withdraw because I appreciate the work done by the chairman and ranking member on this issue. But I think when we talk about health care, it is important to raise the point about an aspect of health care that is not getting the attention that it needs, and that I would hope that in conference committee the chairman and the ranking member could help us address it. Mr. Chairman, that deals with the crisis in dental care in the United States of America.  I am more than aware of the overall crisis in health care. I strongly support a national health care program that would guarantee health care to every man, woman, and child. I think that we need to make fundamental changes in our health care system. But having said that, it is imperative to talk about something that is very rarely talked about. And that is all over the United States of America, we have children, we have adults, we have senior citizens, who simply cannot gain access to a dental office and get their teeth adequately dealt with.  I held a hearing in Montpelier, Vermont several months ago; and I wasstunned to learn in my own city of Burlington we have low-income children who have teeth rotting in their mouths who cannot gain access to a dental office.  There are many reasons for the dental crisis. Number one, we do not have enough dentists in this country; and many of our dentists are getting old and are retiring. And we are not bringing enough younger people into the dental profession. Second of all, the kind of reimbursement rates we have for dental care on the Medicaid are inadequate. Thirdly, the dental clinics all over this country are not giving adequate support to dentistry.                              {time}  1500  So, Mr. Chairman, if I may ask the chairman of the committee, my friend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), if he could give me some assurance that in conference committee we can pay more attention than we have to the dental crisis which exists among low-income people in this country.
