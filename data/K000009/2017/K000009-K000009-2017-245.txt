Speaker, I rise today with great pleasure and enthusiasm to congratulate St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church in Toledo on the church's 100th anniversary. The history of this amazing congregation begins in the home of Mrs. Mamie Porter on Howard Street in Toledo, where, on July 12, 1917, the families of Westly Davis, Robert Christian and Sally McElya met for their first worship service.  During the course of the next year, the congregation grew which resulted in the formal organization of the church, which they named St. Paul. From the start, the church was a community anchor.  Over the years that followed, there were numerous challenges and difficulties that the small congregation overcame, including worshipping in several locations, until finding a home at 654 Hamilton for many years. The current location of St. Paul's, 1502 N. Detroit Avenue, was purchased in 1958 from the United Brethren Church and has been the congregation's home since that time.  There have been a number of shepherds of the St. Paul congregation. Rev. Joseph Smith served as a visionary and dedicated leader of the congregation from 1928 until his death in 1969. To date he is the longest serving Pastor.  On October 25, 1969, Rev. John H. McKissick assumed the leadership of St. Paul. Inspired by the guidance of Rev. and Mrs. McKissick, the church initiated a Watch Care Program, a Department of Evangelism and an Annual Week-End Youth Seminar. A Credit Union was also established as a benefit for the members.  After 16 years of dedicated service Rev. McKissick retired on December 31, 1985, however, he remained as Interim until the search for a new pastor was concluded.  From 1986 to 2003, the following Pastors served the congregation of St. Paul: Dr. Irece T. Bradley, Rev. Julius Minor (Interim), Rev. Floyd Smith and Rev. James R. Glover.  During this timeframe new programs and ministries were established, such as: Moments in Mission, Christian Education, The Sharing Place, Tiny Tot Worship and the Mass Choir.  Rev. James H. Willis, Sr. was elected as Pastor on October 19, 2003. He has exemplified enthusiasm and an unwavering commitment to the spiritual growth of the church. Some of the ministries established during his tenure include: Noon Day Prayer and Bible Study, Young Adult Ministry, Young Adult Monthly Faith Friday, Young Adult Praise Dance Ministry and Young Adult Usher Board. A Youth Minister was appointed in 2016.  St. Paul has modernized its ministry by providing a live stream of Sunday morning worship service, establishing a text alert notification system and installing a projector unit in the sanctuary.  The St. Paul Church Family is blessed to still have 28 ``Pioneers'' who have maintained membership for over 50 years, and most of them still remain actively engaged in church activities.  St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church is a magnificent example of all that a spiritual home should be, rendering indelible service to the Toledo community for the past 100 years. Living the Gospel, St. Paul's congregation looks back on a century of spreading the Word and sharing Christ's message of Love while looking forward to a future of spiritual service.  Romans 10:17 tells us, ``Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.'' I am pleased to join our community in recognizing the milestone centennial celebration of St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church.                          ____________________
