Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Dr. Robert Haddon who passed away in California on Thursday, April 21, 2016. Dr. Haddon was a renowned authority in nanotechnology research and a professor at the University of California, Riverside, and he will be deeply missed.  Raised in Longford, Tasmania, an island state of Australia, Dr. Haddon obtained his undergraduate degree in chemistry in 1966 at the Melbourne University, Australia. Dr. Haddon then moved to the United States where he would obtain his Ph.D. in Chemistry in 1971 at Pennsylvania State University. After obtaining his Ph.D., Dr. Haddon joined AT&T (Lucent) Bell Laboratories where he worked on materials research as a Distinguished Member of the Technical Staff in the Materials Chemistry Research Department. In 2000, Dr. Haddon joined UC Riverside to launch andserve as the director of the university's new Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering.  Dr. Haddon was best known for the prediction and discovery of superconductivity in alkali-metal-doped carbon-60, for his preparation and characterization of a stable crystal of phenalenyl radicals, and for his pioneering research in nanotechnology. His research has earned a number of distinctions in his field, including the James C. McGroddy Prize for New Materials, American Physical Society (2008), and being named Person of the Year by Superconductor Week in 1991. Dr. Haddon was also named a Fellow by the Royal Australian Chemical Institute (1998), American Physical Society (1996), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1993).  Dr. Haddon's dedication to his work and improving our understanding of an exciting field of research, are a testament to a legacy that will continue long after his passing. I was proud to call Dr. Haddon my friend and I will miss him. I extend my condolences to Dr. Haddon's family and friends; although Dr. Haddon may be gone, the many incredible contributions he made to nanotechnology will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
