 President, I have just been handed two very timely additions to this debate: an editorial in today's Wall Street Journal entitled ``Muzzling Campaign Speech'' and a letter dated today from the American Civil Liberties Union noting in some detail their many objections to the McCain-Feingold bill.  I would note for the benefit of those who persist in mischaracterizing the proposed spending limits as ``voluntary'' that the first point in the ACLU letter is the emphatic assertion that they, in fact, are not. The bill would severely handicap a noncomplying candidate relative to a complying candidate so there really would be no choice other than to comply. At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the ACLU letter and the Wall Street Journal article be printed in the Record. For the benefit of colleagues who have not yet read the editorial I would note that the closing sentence captures the essence of the bill before us today: ``The Senate should vote down the McCain-Feingold bill before it does to American democracy what Clinton-Care would have done to medicine.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 25, 1996]                        Muzzling Campaign Speech       Some 20 years after Congress first restricted campaign      speech, the Senate will vote today on a campaign finance      proposal that suggests the way to correct the problems those      misguided ``reforms'' have created is with more restrictions.      We don't think so.       To the government goo-goos, led by Common Cause, money is      the root of all evil in politics and should be pulled out      regardless of the cost or the Constitution. They have      convinced GPO Senator John McCain and Democrat Russ Feingold      to propose a bill that would pass out subsidies for low-cost      mail and television advertising to candidates who abide by      ``voluntary'' spending limits. This is public financing under      another guise. Subsidizing the mailing of more campaign      literature alone could cost $100 million, money the Postal      Service would have to recover by raising rates for other      customers.       Having created a permanent entitlement to cut-rate campaign      ads, the goo-goos would then ban contributions from political      action committees. Advocacy organizations from Emily's List      on the left to the Christian Coalition on the right would see      their activities scrutinized by the Federal Election      Commission, which lately has seen one after another of its      edicts struck down by the courts.       In 1976 the Supreme Court ruled in Buckley v. Valeo that      political contributions and spending are the equivalent of      political speech. Giving the FEC more control over politics      will limit speech. The McCain-Feingold bill would cede      authority to the FEC over any ``expression of support for or      opposition to a specific candidate'' and permit it to block      such expression with an injunction if the agency believes      there is a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . . . is      about to occur.'' The prospect of this enhanced federal power      had driven groups as disparate as the American Civil      Liberties Union and the American Nurses' Association to      oppose the bill.       The desire to police politics better by making the federal      government a meaner watchdog with a longer leash is based on      flawed premises. The first is that the influence of money in      politics is excessive and out of control. In fact, House and      Senate races, which unlike Presidential races don't rely      partly on public financing, saw about $700 million spent on      them in 1994. As George Will has pointed out, that's about      half of what Americans spend on yogurt every year.       What is excessive in politics is not the money spent, but      the amount of political power that government in our time has      to direct economic outcomes and regulate behavior. Given that      Congress can either put whole industries at risk or hand them      a subsidized bonanza, what's surprising is that more money      isn't spent trying to influence the people running for      Congress. The reformers, especially inside the Beltway, give      the clear impression that the government is so indisputably      virtuous in its every mandate that private parties should bow      before it, rather than spend money to defend themselves, an      effort almost always seen by the Beltway as the work of non-     virtuous ``special interests.''       The second mistaken premise behind campaign reform is that      the country is clamoring for it. We're told, for instance,      that 1992 Perot voters will have the heads of elected      officials on a platter if they don't crack down on campaign      cash. But there is little evidence of that. A Tarrance Group      survey in April found that just one voter out of a thousand      identifies campaign reform as the country's most pressing      problem. Voters are justifiably skeptical of political      reforms proposed by incumbent politicians.       This is not to say that nothing can be done. We are      attracted by the realistic ideas of Larry Sabato and Glenn      Simpson in their new book ``Dirty Little Secrets.'' They      conclude that individual limits on campaign contributions,      which haven't been indexed for inflation in 22 years, should      be raised and a regime of full disclosure on all political      spending should be created. That will let the voters both      hear from candidates other than incumbents and let them weigh      the relative influence of everyone participating in the      process.       The current effort at campaign finance reform has a lot in      common with the failed Clinton health-care plan, which sought      to ``fix'' the problems created by government involvement in      health care by having the government micromanage the entire      health care sector. The Senate should vote down the McCain-     Feingold bill before it does to American democracy what      ClintonCare would have done to medicine.                                                                    ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                      New York, NY, June 25, 1996.       Dear Senator:       The American Civil Liberties Union had the privilege of      testifying before the Senate Rules Committee on February 1,      1996 and at that time we elucidated our objections to the      ``reform'' proposals set forth in the Feingold-McCain bill,      S. 1219. Throughout the current Senate debate, our opposition      has been repeatedly referenced. Rather than reiterate all of      our objections in detail in this letter, I encourage you to      read the testimony prepared on our behalf by Professor Joel      Gora, of the Brooklyn Law School.       Congress is endeavoring to reform current campaign finance      laws and regulations in an effort to reduce the perceived      adverse impact of monetary contributions on federal      elections. The call for reform is also punctuated     by cries of corruption. If there is corruption then Congress      does have the obligation to correct systemic problems, and to      ensure that the Federal Election Commission is exercising      fair and consistent enforcement of the existing laws. But      influence is not synonymous with corruption, and labeling      certain monetary contributions as such perpetuates notions of      corruption that have not been, in our view, adequately borne      out by the hearings before the Senate Rules Committee.       While rooting out corruption is a worthwhile objective, S.      1219 goes much further than merely attempting to eliminate      perceived corruption. Current proposals before the Senate      dramatically change the rules concerning financing of federal      campaigns in ways that do greater harm to civic participation      in the federal electoral process than good. Most importantly      S. 1219 directly violates First Amendment guarantees of      freedom of speech and freedom of association.       Some of our specific objections to the Feingold-McCain (S.      1219) and similar proposals include:       The bill's ``voluntary'' expenditure limits are coercive      and violate First Amendment principles. The bill requires the      receipt of public subsidies to be conditioned by a      surrendering of the constitutional right to unlimited      campaign expenditures. The bill grants postage and      broadcasting discounts only those candidates that      ``volunteer'' for spending limits. The bill raises an      individual's contribution limit from $1,000 to $2,000 for      those candidates that agree to spending limitations and      therefore fiscally punishes those candidates who wish to      maintain their constitutional right of unlimited spending.       The bill's ban of Political Action Committees are a      violation of freedom of association and is therefore      unconstitutional. Such a provision would result in a      restriction in protected speech for any group the Federal      Election Committee deemed a ``political committee.'' All      relevant constitutional precedent, including Buckley v. Valeo      424 U.S. 1, 57 (1976) and FEC v. National Conservative      Political Action Committee 470 U.S. 480 (1985), clearly      suggest that the Supreme Court would overturn such a ban.       The limitation on out-of-state contributions is      constitutionally suspect and is disturbingly insular. In-     state limitations potentially deny underfinanced, lesser-     known insurgent candidates of the kind of out-of-state      support they may need. As long as citizens in the affected      district are the ones who select the candidate, how the      candidate is financed is a less compelling concern. After      all, Congress is our national legislature, and although its      representatives are elected from separate districts and      states, the issues it debates and votes on are of concern to      citizens from all over the nation.       The bill's disclosure requirements and regulations on      ``soft money'' do not take into consideration the      constitutional divide between candidate-focused expenditures      and contributions, which are subject to some regulation, and      all other non-partisan, political and issue-oriented speech,      which are not. This restriction does not live up to the      ``most compelling government interest'' standard in regards      to electoral advocacy as required by the Supreme Court in      Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 14-15, 78-80. This restriction      also does not satisfy the minimum scrutiny of a      ``compelling'' state interest in the regulation of political      parties as required by the Supreme Court in Tashjian v.      Republican Party, 479 U.S. 208 (1986).       The bill's new provisions governing the right to make      independent expenditures unconstitutionally invades the      absolutely protected area of issue advocacy. By broadening      the definition of ``express advocacy'' the bill would      encompass the kind of essential issue advocacy which Buckley      has held to be completely immune from government regulation      and control.       The bill so broadly defines ``coordination'' that virtually      an individual who has had any interaction with a candidate or      any campaign officials, in person or otherwise, is barred      from making an independent expenditure. A disaffected      campaign worker or volunteer for example, who leaves the      campaign because he or she thinks a candidate has acted      improperly, is barred from making independent expenditures      against the candidate, for, ironically, they will be deemed a      contribution.       The bill gives unacceptable new powers of political      censorship to the Federal Election Commission. The FEC would      be permitted to go to court and seek an injunction on the      allegation of a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . .      . is about to occur.'' This is fraught with First Amendment      peril because individuals and groups will face ``gag orders''      until a determination of wrongdoing is made.       This bill serves the purpose of unfairly protecting      incumbency by further limiting the overall amount of speech      allowed during a campaign. A limitation in the quantity of      speech makes the incumbent's name recognition and ability to      create free press and media attention all the more valuable.       This bill unfairly hinders access to the political process      of independent and third party candidates by limiting access      to public financing and avenues for receiving private      donations.       Constitutionally acceptable campaign finance reform      proposals could include the following elements:       Uncoerced public financing that include the following      provisions: Floors or foundations upon which candidates can      build their campaigns, not ceilings to limit them, the      availability of public financing to all legally qualified      candidates who have demonstrated an objective measure of      support, the availability of matching funds without      unconstitutional conditions attached, institution of the      frank to all legally qualified federal candidates.       Raise individual contribution limits. This will serve to      decrease reliance on PAC sources of support.       Modest tax credits of up to $500 for private political      contributions.       Public access and timely disclosure of large contributions.      This is the most appropriate way to deal with problems of      undue influence on elected officials.       Thank you for your consideration of our views.           Sincerely,                                                  Laura W. Murphy,                                                         Director.
