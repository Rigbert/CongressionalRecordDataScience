Speaker, what a difference a week makes. Last week the Republican leadership was cruising toward an early adjournment after the Congress had worked only 107 days despite the fact the Congress' work was not yet done. They had hoped to roll it all into one giant bill that none of us would have been allowed to read or understand under a special rule, and vote on it, and leave town, and go home and spend their special interest money to get reelected.  Well, things have changed. Here we are, Day 111. Pretty heavy lifting for this Republican led Congress. We have now worked 111 days in Congress with our $137,000 salary. Of course the average American working for $40,000 or so has worked 202 days so far this year, and they have had to finish their job day in, day out, every day of the year before they go home to their families. But this Congress has not.  But there is a change of heart in the Republican leadership. Maybe? No, not really. They have not decided to address the major work left undone, not at all. They are held here against their will.  They still refuse to address health maintenance organization insurance industry reform, patient provider rights so people can have a right of appeal when they are denied tests they need to restore their health, and when their doctors order tests to restore their health and is denied by the insurance industry. They will not touch that with a 10-foot pole because of the tens of millions of dollars flowing in from that industry to help their reelections.  Teen tobacco prevention? That has dropped off the charts, too, because the tobacco industry is providing one heck of a lot of money for their reelections. Social Security? The only time they addressed Social Security was to attack the trust fund to attempt to give it away by calling it a surplus and spend it as tax cuts.  Now, held in D.C. against their will, they have discovered something. The people of America would like to see an investment in the public education, in the investment of their kids, in the education of their kids.  Let me say the Speaker earlier, the President has just come recently to this; he just discovered education. The President proposed back in January smaller class size, 100,000 new teachers and a major reconstruction program for the one-third of our schools that are falling apart and the other one-third that are obsolescent. They are the ones who did not discover it until this week, until they had to discover it. There has not been a single hearing held by the Republican led Congress on the issue of 100,000 new teachers, smaller class size or the crumbling state of our schools and federal assistance for them. They had ample time. We took three votes, three votes in this Chamber on school vouchers, taking our tax dollars and transferring them to private religious institutions. That is their agenda: do not help the public schools, help the private schools, help the religious schools despite what the Constitution might say.  They have spent a lot of time trying to eliminate the Department of Education that administers the Head Start program and the student loan programs. They have attempted to cut, and we blocked, school lunches for small children. They have enacted or tried to enact tax cuts for wealthy taxpayers to send their kids to private schools, again abandoning the public system, eliminating the summer jobs program for kids, eliminating the school to work opportunities for high school students, eliminating the in-school interest subsidy for student loans, and I heard someone over here wax eloquent about what they have done to lower the interest rate on loans. Yes, a tiny, tiny, tiny bit, but you were really drug kicking and screaming to that, too, because the banks did not want to give up anything on these loans where they never lose a penny that are guaranteed by the Federal Government. They cannot even be discharged in bankruptcy. They still want outrageous rates of interest. So finally the Republicans paid them off. The banks are still going to get thehigh rate of interest, the taxpayers are going to pay it, and the students will get a tiny, tiny cut, less than 1 percent.  Oh, that is a great deal, that is a great way to do this. Get rid of the banks, give the loans directly to the kids through the schools. You could give another 600,000 students loans next year at a much lower rate of interest. They have tried to eliminate the Safe and Drug-free School Program and after school programs. That is quite a record. But they have become born again on the issue of public education. Now they say what they really want to do is fight over how the money they did not want to spend on public education is spent because we have held them here against their will. Because they want to bolt out of town without finishing their work, we have managed to get another $1.1 billion commitment for education. They are saying, well, they are really concerned about how that money might be spent. They want it to be spent under something called title VI. Title VI, the first 16 percent goes to administration. Republicans like that. And the other 84 percent can go to anything, does not go to teachers, smaller class size. It is not even necessary to be invested in rebuilding our schools.  They can spin and spin and spin as much as they want as they wax eloquent about the importance of public schools. They are a billion point one late and 4 days late.                          ____________________
