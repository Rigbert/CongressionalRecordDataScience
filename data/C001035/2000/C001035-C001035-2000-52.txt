President, it is absolutely critical that Congress take action this year to address some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which has been exacerbated by a host of ill-conceived new regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton administration.  The combination of regulatory overkill and budget cutbacks is jeopardizing access to critical home health services for millions of our Nation's most frail and vulnerable senior citizens.  Tonight, the Senator from Wisconsin and I are taking the opportunity to talk about this very important issue. The Senator from Wisconsin has been a real leader in helping to restore the cuts and to fight the onerous regulatory requirements imposed by the administration which have affected home health care services across the Nation.  I also want to recognize that there have been many other Senators who have been involved in this fight. I am going to put a list of the cosponsors to the legislation that I have introduced into the Record.  I ask unanimous consent a list of cosponsors, which exceeds 50 Senators, be printed in the Record, reflecting the contributions many of our colleagues have made to this fight.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         Cosponsors of S. 2365       Spencer Abraham, Wayne Allard, John Ashcroft, Max Baucus,      Robert F. Bennett, Jeff Bingaman, Christopher S. Bond,      Barbara Boxer, Sam Brownback, Conrad R. Burns.       Lincoln D.
