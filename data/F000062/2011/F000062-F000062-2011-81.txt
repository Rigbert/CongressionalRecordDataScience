 President, I rise as chairman of the Intelligence Committee to speak against amendment 753 to this appropriations bill. In sum, this amendment will require members of al-Qaida to be prosecuted only by military commissions. It will cripple executive authority and flexibility to go after terrorists. Of all things in this area where we should be agreed and the President should have maximum flexibility, it is with the disposition of people who commit acts of terror in this country. I feel very strongly about this.  The military commission system has been in effect since 2006. It has had six convictions. By comparison, terrorists have been tried by previous administrations, including the Bush administration, in article III courts, and more than 400 of them have been convicted and are serving time in Federal prisons.  One case may be brought up where somebody disagrees with a verdict. You can disagree with a Federal jury, but you cannot disagree with the record of conviction and the strong sentences imposed. I will go into this in a little more detail in a few minutes.  Just to say again, I have never seen a time when Congress has tried so much to constrain the power of the president and our professionals in law enforcement in their efforts to defeat terrorism.  As has been the policy of Republican and Democratic Presidents, the decision about how to prosecute a suspected terrorist should be based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests, not politics.  Some of the most well-known terrorists of the past decade--``Shoe Bomber'' Richard Reid, ``Blind Sheik'' Omar Abdel Rahman and the ``20th Hijacker'' Zacarias Moussaoui--are serving life sentences after being tried in Article III criminal courts.  Prosecuting terrorists in military commissions makes sense in some cases, but requiring it for all AI-Qaeda terrorists in each and every case is not in the national security of the U.S.  In fact, that would severely limit our ability to handle some of the biggest threats.  To understand why this proposed amendment would be such bad policy, consider the two recent cases where al-Qaida tried to use operatives to attack our Homeland, but we captured and arrested the terrorists instead.  First, Najibullah Zazi, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., was arrested in September 2009 as part of an al-Qaida conspiracy to carry out suicide bombings on the New York City subway system.  Then on Christmas 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to detonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear while on board Northwest Airlines Flight 253 before it landed in Detroit, Michigan. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula--AQAP--claimed responsibility for the attempted attack and said that Abdulmutallab had trained with and been tasked to carry out the plot for AQAP.  In both cases, the FBI arrested each Al Qaeda operative in the midst of the unfolding terrorist plot, and was able to obtain useful intelligence through interrogation.  Most recently the DEA and the FBI, through shared intelligence, were able to interrupt an Iranian plot to kill the Saudi Ambassador right here in Washington, DC. That man will be tried in Federal court. That man was successfully interrogated by the FBI. That man spilled his guts to the FBI, as they say in the vernacular.  Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty last week to all counts of an eight-count criminal indictment charging him for his role in the attempted Christmas Day 2009 bombing of Northwest Airlines flight 253. He cooperated, provided intelligence, and will probably spend the rest of his life behind bars when he is sentenced in January.  By comparison, two of six of the individuals convicted in military commissions are already out of prison living freely in their home countries of Yemen and Australia. Consider all of the following relatively light sentences handed down by military commissions since 9/11:  Bin Laden's driver, Salim Hamdan--acquitted of conspiracy and only convicted of material support for terrorism--received a five-month sentenceand was sent back to his home in Yemen to serve the time before being released in January 2009.  Australian David Hicks--the first person convicted in a military commission when he entered into a plea agreement on material support for terrorism charges in March 2007--was given a 9-month sentence, which he mostly served back at home in Australia.  Omar Khadr pleaded guilty in a military commission in exchange for an 8-year sentence, but he will likely be transferred to a Canadian prison after 1 year.  Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al-Qosi pleaded guilty to conspiracy and material support to terrorism in July 2010. In August 2010, a jury delivered a 14-year sentence, but the final sentence handed down in February 2011 was 2 years pursuant to his plea agreement.  Noor Uthman Muhammed pleaded guilty to conspiracy and material support to terrorism in February 2011. A jury delivered a 14-year sentence, but the final sentence will be less than 3 years pursuant to his plea agreement. These are military commission trials.  Ali Hamza al-Bahlul received a life sentence after he boycotted the entire military commission process and was convicted of soliciting murder and material support for terrorism without mounting a defense.  In the Zazi case, what the Senator from New Hampshire was suggesting would actually require the government to split up co-defendants even where they would otherwise be prosecuted as part of the same conspiracy.  For example, Zazi's alleged co-conspirators Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin would be prosecuted on terrorist charges in criminal court, but Zazi himself would have to be transferred to a military commission.  Splitting up co-conspirators into two different detention and prosecution systems might prevent prosecutors from achieving the guilty pleas and likely long prison sentences that will be secured in the Zazi conspiracy case. Prosecutors have already obtained convictions against six individuals, including Zazi and Ahmedzay, who face life in Federal prison without parole.  Importantly, we have heard from intelligence officials and others that a mandatory military commission policy will reduce our allies' willingness to extradite terror suspects to the United States for interrogation or prosecution, or even provide evidence about suspected terrorists if they will be shipped off to military commissions in all cases.  You might say why would our allies do that? I will tell you why: Because our allies--who know about the past five years and know about the opposition to military commissions in their countries--are very reluctant to give evidence to a judicial process that does not adhere to the rule of law as much as our tried and tested Federal court system does.  Take the 9/11 commission report, which recommends the following on page 380:       [t]he United States should engage its friends to develop a      common coalition approach toward the detention and humane      treatment of captured terrorists.  If Congress rejects the views of our allies and mandates military commission prosecutions for al-Qaida terrorists, it will also be a rejection of a recommendation from the 9/11 commission. Moreover, we will be undermining international law enforcement cooperation and dangerous terrorists could be set free as a result.  Every single suspected terrorist captured on American soil, before and after September 11, has been taken into custody by law enforcement--not the U.S. military. This should never change. If somebody commits an act on our soil, they should be prosecuted in an article III court. This doesn't mean that we are soft on terrorism in any way, but it does mean that terrorists should be brought to justice, forced to stand trial and given a very serious sentence.  As John Brennan, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, stated in a March speech:       Terrorists arrested inside the United States will, as      always, be processed exclusively through our criminal justice      system. As they should be. The alternative would be      inconsistent with our values and our adherence to the rule of      law. Our military does not patrol our streets or enforce our      law in this country. Nor should it.  I could not agree more.  In summary, amendment No. 753, authored by the Senator from New Hampshire, will severely and seriously undermine our ability to incapacitate dangerous individuals and protect the American people. I believe this is something we cannot afford and I hope this body will do everything it can to protect the executive branch's flexibility.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the Department of Justice, dated March of 2010 which describes the more than 400 terrorist convictions in article III courts.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2010.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,     Vice Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Feinstein and Vice Chairman Bond: I am      writing in response to requests by a number of Members of the      Committee for information about statistics maintained by the      Department of Justice relating to prosecution of terrorism      and terrorism-related crimes, as well as the incarceration of      terrorists by the Bureau of Prisons.       The Counterterrorism Section of the National Security      Division (NSD) (and its predecessor section in the Criminal      Division) has maintained a chart of international terrorism      and terrorism-related prosecutions since September 11, 2001.      A copy of that chart, which currently includes just over 400      defendants, and a brief introduction describing its contents,      is enclosed with this letter. This chart was initially      developed and has since been maintained and regularly updated      on a rolling basis by career federal prosecutors. The bulk of      the data included in the chart was generated, and relates to      prosecutions that occurred, during the prior Administration.      In fact, the data was cited publicly by the prior      Administration on repeated occasions, including:       In a book entitled ``Preserving Life & Liberty: The Record      of the U.S. Department of Justice 2001-2005,'' released in      February 2005, the Department said, ``Altogether, the      Department has brought charges against 375 individuals in      terrorism-related investigations, and has convicted 195 to      date.''       In its February 2008 budget request for Fiscal Year 2009,      the Department of Justice said, ``Since 2001, the Department      has increased its capacity to investigate terrorism and has      identified, disrupted, and dismantled terrorist cells      operating in the United States. These efforts have resulted      in the securing of 319 convictions or guilty pleas in      terrorism or terrorism-related cases arising from      investigations conducted primarily after September 11, 2001,      and zero terrorist attacks on American soil by foreign      nationals from 2003 through 2007.''       Please note that the chart includes only convictions from      September 11, 2001 to March 18, 2010. It does not include      defendants whose convictions remain under seal, nor does it      include defendants who have been charged with a terrorism or      terrorism-related offense but have not been convicted either      at trial or by guilty plea. Finally, it does not include      convictions related solely to domestic terrorism.       The NSD chart includes the defendant's name, district,      charging date, charges brought, classification category,      conviction date, and conviction charges, as well as the      sentence and the date it was imposed, if the defendant has      been sentenced. As the introduction to the NSD chart      explains, the data includes convictions resulting from      investigations of terrorist acts planned or committed outside      the territorial jurisdiction of the United States over which      Federal criminal jurisdiction exists and those within the      United States involving international terrorists and      terrorist groups. NSD further divides these cases into two      categories. The first includes violations of federal statutes      that are directly related to international terrorism and that      are utilized regularly in international terrorism matters,      such as terrorist acts abroad against U.S. nationals and      providing material support to a foreign terrorist      organization. There have been more than 150 defendants      classified in this category since September 11, 2001. The      second category includes a variety of other statutes (like      fraud, firearms offenses, false statements, or obstruction of      justice) where the investigation involved an identified link      to international terrorism. There have been more than 240      individuals charged in such cases since September 11, 2001.      Examples of the international terrorism nexus identified in      some of these cases have also been provided for your review.       Prosecuting terror-related targets using these latter      offenses is often an effective method--and sometimes the only      available method--of deterring and disrupting potential      terrorist planning and support activities. Indeed, one of the      great strengths of the criminal justice system is the broad      range of offenses that are available to arrest and convict      individuals believed to be linked to terrorism, even if a      terrorism offense cannot be established. Of course, an      aggressive and     wide-ranging terrorism investigation will net individuals      with varying degrees of culpability and involvement in      terrorist activity, as the NSD chart reflects. Arresting and      convicting both major and minor operatives, supporters, and      facilitators can have crippling effects on terrorists'      ability to carry out their plans.       You will also note that the sentences obtained in these      cases range from a few months to life. Life sentences have      been imposed by our courts in 12 international terrorism or      terrorism-related cases since 9/11, and sentences of more      than 10 years have been imposed in an additional 59 cases,      including 25 cases in which the sentence exceeded 20 years.      We believe the long sentences often imposed by our courts in      these cases reflect the gravity of the threat posed by these      individuals to our nation. However, it is important to note      that while a long sentence is an important measure of success      in a terrorism-related prosecution, it is not the only      measure. Convicting an individual of an available offense and      incarcerating him even for a relatively short period of time      may be an effective way to disrupt ongoing terrorist      activity, deter future activity, collect important      intelligence, secure valuable cooperation, or facilitate      rapid deportation of an individual.       This vital work continues. In the past year, thanks to the      hard work of dedicated career professionals--FBI agents,      other federal and state law enforcement officials, and career      federal prosecutors--we have been able to disrupt terrorist      plots, convict and imprison terrorists and their supporters,      and collect intelligence we need to protect the country. We      detected and disrupted a plot to attack the subway system in      Manhattan with explosive bombs that could have killed many      Americans. We conducted successful undercover operations to      arrest individuals who separately attempted to blow up      buildings in Dallas, Texas, and Springfield, Illinois. And we      arrested individuals in Chicago who assisted in the deadly      November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai and were plotting      other attacks.       Finally, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) maintains a separate      chart that identifies inmates in BOP custody who have a      history of or nexus to international or domestic terrorism.      There are currently more than 300 individuals on this chart,      which is used to identify those inmates who may warrant      increased supervision and monitoring of their communications,      among other things. BOP's designation of these inmates may be      based upon information from a variety of sources, including      sensitive law enforcement or intelligence information that is      not publicly available, regarding the inmate's past behavior      and associations. BOP does not publicly disclose which      inmates have been designated in this fashion. The disclosure      of this information could interfere with BOP's monitoring and      law enforcement investigative efforts. Moreover, disclosure      of the identities of these inmates could pose risks to the      security of the inmates and prison staff.       Should you or your staff wish to review the BOP chart, BOP      is prepared to provide the Committee with access to the chart      under conditions designed to protect security and operational      equities.           Sincerely,                                                     Ronald Weich,                                       Assistant Attorney General.       Enclosure.   Introduction to National Security Division Statistics on Unsealed        International Terrorism and Terrorism-Related Convictions       The National Security Division's International Terrorism      and Terrorism-Related Statistics Chart tracks convictions      resulting from international terrorism investigations      conducted since September 11, 2001, including investigations      of terrorist acts planned or committed outside the      territorial jurisdiction of the United States over which      Federal criminal jurisdiction exists and those within the      United States involving international terrorists and      terrorist groups. Convictions listed on the chart involve the      use of a variety of Federal criminal statutes available to      prevent, disrupt, and punish international terrorism and      related criminal activity. The convictions are the product of      the Department's aggressive, consistent, and coordinated      national enforcement effort with respect to international      terrorism that was undertaken after the September 11, 2001      terrorist attacks.       Criminal cases arising from international terrorism      investigations are divided into two categories, according to      the requisite level of coordination and monitoring required      by the Counterterrorism Section of the National Security      Division (or its predecessor section in the Criminal      Division). This coordination and monitoring exists in      response to the expanded Federal criminal jurisdiction over      and importance of international terrorism matters and the      need to ensure coherent, consistent, and effective Federal      prosecutions related to such matters. Typically, multiple      defendants in a case are classified in the same category.       Category I cases involve violations of federal statutes      that are directly related to international terrorism and that      are utilized regularly in international terrorism matters.      These statutes prohibit, for example, terrorist acts abroad      against United States nationals, the use of weapons of mass      destruction, conspiracy to murder persons overseas, providing      material support to terrorists or foreign terrorist      organizations, receiving military style training from foreign      terrorist organizations, and bombings of public places or      government facilities. A complete list of Category I offenses      is found in Appendix A.       Category II cases include defendants charged with violating      a variety of other statutes where the investigation involved      an identified link to international terrorism. These Category      II cases include offenses such as those involving fraud,      immigration, firearms, drugs, false statements, perjury, and      obstruction of justice, as well as general conspiracy charges      under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371. Prosecuting terror-related targets      using Category II offenses and others is often an effective      method--and sometimes the only available method--of deterring      and disrupting potential terrorist planning and support      activities. This approach underscores the wide variety of      tools available in the U.S. criminal justice system for      disrupting terror activity. Examples of Category II offenses      are listed in Appendix B, and examples of Category II cases      are described in Appendix C to illustrate the kinds of      connections to international terrorism that are not apparent      from the nature of the offenses of conviction themselves.       The chart includes the defendant's name, district, charging      date, charges brought, classification category, conviction      date and conviction charges. If a convicted defendant has      been sentenced, the relevant date and sentence imposed is      included. The chart is constantly being updated with new      convictions, but currently includes only unsealed convictions      from September 11, 2001 to March 18, 2010. The chart does not      include defendants whose convictions remain under seal, nor      does it include defendants who have been charged with a      terrorism or terrorism-related offense but have not been      convicted either at trial or by guilty plea. This chart does      not include convictions related solely to domestic terrorism.      Note that the chart maintained by the National Security      Division is distinct from statistics maintained by the Bureau      of Prisons to track inmates with terrorist connections. The      chart lists more than 150 defendants classified in Category I      and more than 240 defendants classified in Category II.       The chart is organized by conviction date, with the most      recent convictions first. The earliest defendants included on      the chart were identified and detained in the course of the      nationwide investigation conducted after September 11, 2001,      and were subsequently charged with a criminal offense. Since      then, additional defendants have been added who, at the time      of charging, appeared to have a connection to international      terrorism, even if they were not charged with a terrorism      offense. The decision to add defendants to the chart is made      on a case-by-case basis by career prosecutors in the National      Security Division's Counterterrorism Section, whose primary      responsibility is investigating and prosecuting international      and domestic terrorism cases to prevent and disrupt acts of      terrorism anywhere in the world that impact on significant      United States interests and persons.

In 2008, following a jury trial in the United      States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Ibrahim      Shnewer, Dritan Duka, Shain Duka, Eljvir Duka and Serdar      Tatar were convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1117, in      connection with a plot to kill members of the U.S. military      in an armed attack on the military base at Fort Dix, New      Jersey. The defendants were also convicted of various weapons      charges. The government's evidence revealed that one member      of the group conducted surveillance at Fort Dix and Fort      Monmouth in New Jersey, Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, and      the U.S. Coast Guard in Philadelphia. The group obtained a      detailed map of Fort Dix, where they hoped to use assault      rifles to kill as many soldiers as possible. During the      trial, the jury viewed secretly recorded videotapes of the      defendants performing small-arms training at a shooting range      in the Poconos Mountains in Pennsylvania and of the      defendants watching training videos that included depictions      of American soldiers being killed and of known Islamic      radicals urging jihad against the United States.       Fawaz Damrah (citizenship fraud). In 2004, following a jury      trial in the United States District Court for the Northern      District of Ohio, Fawaz Damrah was convicted of violating 18      U.S.C. Sec. 1425 for concealing material facts in his      citizenship application. The government's evidence showed      that in his citizenship application, Damrah concealed from      the U.S. government his membership in or affiliation with the      Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a.k.a. the Islamic Jihad      Movement in Palestine; the Afghan Refugees Services, Inc.,      a.k.a. Al-Kifah Refugee Center; and the Islamic Committee for      Palestine. Damrah further concealed the fact that he had,      prior to his application for U.S. citizenship, ``incited,      assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution'' of      Jews and others by advocating violent terrorist attacks      against Jews and others. During the trial, the government's      evidence included footage of a 1991 speech in which Damrah      called Jews ``the sons of monkeys and pigs,'' and a 1989      speech in which he declared that ``terrorism and terrorism      alone is the path to liberation.''       Soliman Biheiri (false statements and passport fraud). In      2003 and 2004, following two jury trials in the United States      District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Soliman      Biheiri was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1425      and 1546 for fraudulently procuring a passport, as well as 18      U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1001 and 1015 for making false statements to      federal agents. Biheiri was the president of BMI, Inc., a New      Jersey-based investment firm. The government's evidence      showed that Biheiri had deliberately deceived federal agents      during a June 2003 interview in which he denied having      business or personal ties to Mousa Abu Marzook, a Specially      Designated Global Terrorist and a leader of Hamas. In fact,      the government's evidence showed that Biheiri had managed      funds for Marzook both before and after Marzook was      designated as a terrorist by the U.S. government in 1995.      Specifically, the government presented files seized from      Biheiri's computer showing that Marzook had invested $1      million in U.S. business ventures managed by Biheiri and his      investment firm.       Mohammad Salman Farooq Qureshi (false statements). In 2005,      following the entry of a guilty plea in the United States      District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, Qureshi      was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 for making      false statements to the FBI regarding the nature and extent      of his involvement with al-Qaeda member Wadih El Hage, and      the non-governmental organization Help Africa People. Qureshi      was interviewed by the FBI in 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2004 in      relation to terrorism crimes and during those interviews lied      about his knowledge of El Hage, Help Africa People, and other      al Qaeda members. The proffer filed in support of the plea      agreement established Qureshi's connections to and contacts      with El Hage, his contact with a subject under investigation      in Oregon, and his activities and financial support of Help      Africa People, a non-governmental organization believed to      have been used by El Hage and others to provide cover      identities and funds in connection with the 1998 attacks on      the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. By      Qureshi's admissions, at least $30,000 in Qureshi's funds      were given to El Hage in Nairobi, Kenya. El Hage is serving a      life sentence for his role in the East Africa Embassy      bombings.       Sabri Benkahla (perjury, obstruction, false statements). In      2007, following a jury trial in the United States District      Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Sabri Benkahla      was convicted on two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1623,      for perjury, one count of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503 for      obstructing justice, and one count of violating 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 1001 for making false statements to the FBI. These false      statements included denial of his involvement with an      overseas jihad training camp in 1999, as well as his asserted      lack of knowledge about individuals with whom he was in      contact. The government's evidence revealed that the grand      jury and FBI in 2004 sought to question Benkahla about his      contacts with Ibrahim Buisir of Ireland, and Manaf Kasmuri of      Malaysia, both of whom are Specially Designated Global      Terrorists, as well as those with Ahmed Abu Ali, his friend      and fellow student at the University of Medina, until both      were arrested by Saudi authorities in June 2003. Further, the      government's evidence revealed that the grand jury and FBI      sought to question Benkahla about his contacts with an      individual suspected of being Malik al-Tunisi, a facilitator      for the al-Zarqawi terrorist network in Iraq.       Akram Musa Abdallah (false statements). In 2009, following      the entry of a guilty plea in the United States District      Court for the District of Arizona, Akram Musa Abdallah was      convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 for making false      statements to the FBI. In January 2007, Abdallah knowingly      made a false material statement to special agents of the FBI      during an interview in connection with the federal      investigation and prosecution of the Holy Land Foundation for      Relief & Development (HLF) and its officers. At the time of      the interviews, Abdallah knew the HLF was a Specially      Designated Global Terrorist organization. Abdallah also knew      that when he was interviewed, the HLF and its officers were      pending trial in the United States District Court for the      Northern District of Texas, for crimes including providing      material support to a foreign terrorist organization. During      the interviews, Abdallah told FBI agents he was not involved      in fundraising activities for the HLF, when, in fact, between      approximately 1994 and 1997, Abdallah was involved in      numerous fundraising activities, including collecting      donations, organizing, facilitating and coordinating fund      raising events on behalf of the HLF in the Phoenix      metropolitan area. In July 2004, the HLF and seven of its      principals were indicted on a variety of charges stemming      from its financial support of Hamas, and in November 2008,      after a two-month trial, those defendants were convicted on      all charges.
