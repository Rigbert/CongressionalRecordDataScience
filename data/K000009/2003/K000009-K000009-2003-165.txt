Speaker, we in Toledo are proud to recognize the sesquicentennial of one of our oldest congregations, First Baptist Church. Now in suburban Greater Toledo, First Baptist Church was an anchor in central Toledo for more than a century. It is still known as ``the friendly church with the caring spirit'' and this motto characterizes its congregation. Its membership sees the church as a home and each other as a family of believers. They care for each other, our community, and our world.  During the early days of Toledo, Ohio, a hardy band of believers with a missionary zeal joined together in fellowship and formed the First Baptist Church. Right from the start, though their mission was to carry the Gospel forth into the world, the church's members have lived God's Word by example and have strived to serve our community. As Toledo grew and changed, so too did First Baptist Church. Today, its congregation can look back on a journey weathering hard times and good, tests and successes, drama and triumph. The journey continues, and First Baptist's members look forward to the future even as they celebrate their history.  In John 8:12, we are reminded of Christ's promise that ``I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.'' For 150 years, the faithful of First Baptist Church in Toledo have tried to followed our Lord's Word and live a Christ-centered life. The fruits of their labor may be seen in the continuity of their church, and its viability in our community over generations. I join with the congregation of First Baptist Church and our entire community in congratulating the church on reaching its milestone 150th anniversary. May these first 150 years be the inspiration for the next. Onward!                          ____________________
