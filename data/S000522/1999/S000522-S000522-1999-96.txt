Reclaiming my time, the word ``release'' should not appear in this document, in this Sense of the Congress, because we should not be coming down on the side of releasing someone who has been accused of a very, very serious offense in cooperation with a terrorist organization that has a despicable record in Peru. But, again, we must demand that the charges against her be properly adjudicated.  Let me remind Members that there were Americans who were held hostage in the Japanese ambassador's residence by this very group. I would urge a no vote on this, and I say that with reluctance. This is not a properly constructed amendment.
