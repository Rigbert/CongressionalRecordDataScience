Speaker, it is with sincere gratitude that I take this time to recognizethe Veterans Views radio program, broadcasting out of Hammond, Indiana. For nearly a decade, the program's hosts, past and present, have been tireless advocates for veterans residing in Indiana's First Congressional District, across the nation, and abroad. As Veterans Views approaches its 10th anniversary, I commend those involved for not only bringing veterans' issues to the forefront, but for giving those who served a voice.  From its humble beginnings on a cable access channel, before shifting to its current radio format, several local veterans who once made personal sacrifices to defend our country assembled to serve their veteran brothers and sisters in another way. Selflessly, these individuals provided an avenue by which veterans could share their collective experiences, and in doing so, forged a path of public service that has improved the lives of many veterans. Local veterans Ernie Dillon, Bill Emerson, Patrick O'Donnell, Dennis Shults, and Donald Shults combined their experiences and knowledge to create a platform where veterans in the community might seek support or assistance or discuss pertinent issues.  Currently, Veterans Views, hosted by Ernie Dillon, Patrick O'Donnell, Bill Emerson, and David Hinshaw, airs weekly on WJOB 1230 AM and also shares its message via livestream, allowing veterans throughout the country and around the world to participate. The focus of the show remains to help fellow veterans understand issues ranging from benefits and health care to finances and employment. The dedicated hosts are keenly aware of developments within the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense, while keeping up-to-date on matters that may potentially affect their audience.  Veterans Views is to be commended for its efforts to safeguard the well-being of those to whom we are indebted for the courage and sacrifice exhibited during their service. In recognition of these efforts, the program has received numerous accolades over the years, including the Excellence in Communication award, presented by the American Legion Department of Indiana in 2011, in addition to being honored by the Indiana General Assembly.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in recognizing Veterans Views and thanking all of those associated with this integral program for their service on behalf of veterans everywhere, and in particular, to those living within Indiana's First Congressional District. For their unwavering dedication to the brave men and women who have defended our nation, the hosts, producers, and sponsors of Veterans Views are worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
