 The Republican record defies their rhetoric. Remember their so-called ``prescription drug benefit'' for seniors passed in the dark of the night, no one read the bill, didn't know what was in it? It cost $700 billion because that was subsidizing the pharmaceutical and insurance industry. But now they're worried about costs that gave the seniors a doughnut hole. Now their concern is not about what they're stating; it's about their patrons in the insurance industry.  This bill has real reforms of the worst abuses of the insurance industry. It takes away their unfair antitrust community so they can no longer collude to drive up premium prices or restrict coverage. The Republicans would continue the antitrust exemption.  This bill outlaws the unfair preexisting condition restriction. The Republicans would continue that for the insurance industry.  This bill would not allow the industry to cancel your policy even though you've been paying your premiums when you get sick. It's called recision. The Republicans allow that abuse to continue.  This bill on our side outlaws the small print that limits your lifetime coverage which bankrupts families every day in America. The Republicans allow it to continue.  And that's not enough. They open up a new loophole, their so-called ``national plan.'' A company would only be regulated by the laws of the State in which it was based when it sold you a policy. If you live in Oregon but you bought a policy that was written in--oh, and by the way, they expand the definition of States to include the territories and the Mariana Islands. So if you've got a problem, call the Mariana Islands insurance commissioner. That's the Republican plan: Profits for the insurance industry.
