Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, I would ask that the following opening statements be submitted to the Record for the November 17, 2001 hearing on ``China's Censorship of the Internet and Social Media: The Human Toll and Trade Impact.''China's Censorship of the Internet and Social Media: The Human Toll and                               Trade Impact  STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW      JERSEY, CHAIRMAN, CONGRESSIONAL-EXECUTIVE COMMISSION ON CHINA       The Commission will come to order. I want to welcome all of      our distinguished witnesses to this very important hearing.      We really appreciate the attendance of all of our panelists      and guests. It's a pleasure to welcome everyone to this      important roundtable on ``China's Censorship of the Internet      and Social Media: The Human Toll and Trade Impact.'' As      recent events have shown, the issue of Internet censorship      has only grown in terms of importance and magnitude, and I      thank the Congressional-Executive Commission on China staff      for organizing a hearing on this pressing issue, and for the      tremendous scholarly work they have done not only in      presenting our annual report, which is filled with facts and      information that is actionable, but for the ongoing work that      they do to monitor the gross abuses of human rights in China.       As the Congressional-Executive Commission on China's 2011      annual human rights report demonstrates, China's leadership      has grown more assertive in its violation of rights,      disregarding the very laws and international standards that      they claim to uphold, while tightening their grip on Chinese      society. As Chinese citizens have increasingly called for      freedoms and reforms, China has only strengthened its      controls over many areas of society--particularly over the      Internet.       While China has witnessed a boom in the popularity of      social media and Internet sites, Chinese citizens that access      online sites today remain under the watchful eye of the      State. By some accounts, China has imprisoned more Internet      activists than any other country in the world, and its      Internet environment ranks among the most restrictive      globally. Chinese citizens are unable to voice a range of      criticism that Americans undoubtedly take for granted each      day: Chinese citizens that tweet about local corruption may      face the threat of abuse or harassment. Citizens that express      dissatisfaction over tainted food supplies that injure      children--the most vulnerable population of our society--may      come to hear a knock at the door. And, citizens that voice      the human desire for democracy and rights protections we      value so dearly may disappear into the official custody of      the State, where they face torture and incarceration.       For Chinese citizens, the line that can't be crossed is      unclear. While mentions of the 1989 Tiananmen protests are      surely prohibited, China's censorship remains at the whimsy      of governmental agencies that seek to limit what they      perceive to be any destabilizing commentary. In China, the      Internet provides no transparency--and citizens must weigh      their choices each time they click to send an email or press      a button or post personal views online. Who can forget Shi      Tao, who for merely posting information about what he is not      allowed to do, with regards to Tiananmen Square, garnered a      ten year prison sentence when Yahoo opened up their      personally identifiable information and gave it to the      Chinese secret police that lead to his conviction. There are      no lists of banned words. There are no registers of      prohibited topics. In China, there is no transparency. There      are only consequences, and dire ones at that.       Today, we welcome two panels that will address China's      Internet censorship from two perspectives. The witnesses will      not only provide personal accounts of how China's censorship      affects individuals and families, but also detail how China's      actions hinder the rights of U.S. businesses that seek to      compete fairly in China. These panels will expose China's      bold disregard for its own laws and its international      obligations, specifically in terms of its controls on      internet activity and expression.       In the first panel today, we will hear personal accounts of      the consequences Chinese citizens face in seeking to express      their fundamental rights of expression. We will hear from a      son and a pastor that have seen firsthand the anxious and      unforgiving hand of China's Internet police. We will hear how      the simplest calls for freedom and reforms can lead to the      separation of loved ones and partition of families.       In the second panel, we will hear how China's Internet      restrictions and controls not only hurt its citizens, but      also hurt countries seeking to better China through      international trade and cooperation. On a commercial level,      China similarly lacks the kind of transparency and fairness      that we expect in global trading partners. China has not only      failed to comply with its WTO commitments, it has exploited      our expectations to create an unlevel playing field, hurting      the competitiveness of U.S. businesses and workers alike.       We recognize that the Internet and social media can and      should be used to provide people with greater access to      honest information and to open up commercial opportunities      for businesses operating in global markets. We know that the      promise of information technology can not be achieved when it      is used by repressive governments to find, capture, convict      and so often torture ordinary citizens for voicing concerns      publicly. Information technology can not be advanced when it      involves the systemic exclusion of commercial competitors and      rampant disregard for transparency and intellectual property.       China is one of the most repressive and restrictive      countries when it comes to the control of the Internet and      the impact goes far beyond the commercial losses for U.S.      companies that want to participate in that market. There are      serious human rights implications and we have seen the damage      inflicted countless times through the arrest of bloggers and      prodemocracy activists who have used the Internet to      communicate with colleagues or disseminate views and then      have been arrested. What makes this situation even worse is      that sometimes it is U.S. companies, and my colleagues will      recall I held the first of a series of hearings where we had      Microsoft, Yahoo, Cisco, and Google before our committee--it      was my subcommittee on human rights--held up their hands and      promised to tell the whole truth and nothing but, and then      said they couldn't tell us what they were censoring and would      not tell us how they were being complicit. Harry Wu, who is      here, and has been a leader on this issue, pointed out that      Cisco has so enabled the secret police to track down people      using police net, and that the use of cyber police,      ubiquitous throughout all of China, in order to capture the      best, bravest, and smartest in China, who will bring that      country to democracy if only allowed to do so.    November 17, 2011 Testimony Before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China Hearing on ``China's Censorship of the Internet and             Social Media: The Human Toll and Trade Impact'' Gilbert B. Kaplan, Partner, King & Spalding, President, Committee To                  Support U.S. Trade Laws--Introduction       China's censorship of the Internet and its restrictions on      the free flow of information have a very significant impact      on U.S. economic and trade interests. China continues to      impose debilitating burdens on foreign Internet service      providers through its censorship regime, its blocking of      foreign websites, and its ``Great Firewall'' infrastructure,      which inhibit or prevent all together U.S. companies' ability      to do business in China, and their ability to compete with      Chinese domestic companies. China's Internet service      providers have capitalized on this discriminatory treatment      of U.S. companies and have consequently experienced great      success. Earlier this year, for example, RenRen (known as      ``China's Facebook'') filed for a U.S. public offering,      symbolizing its success to date and its plans for expansion.      Meanwhile, Facebook is blocked in China. These measures have      been ongoing for years, and have had an overwhelming adverse      impact on market share for U.S. companies perhaps to the      extent that such market share can never be recovered.       China's blocking and filtering measures, and the fog of      uncertainty surrounding what China's censors will and will      not permit, violate numerous of China's international      obligations, including provisions of the WTO General      Agreement on Trade and Services (``GATS'') and China's WTO      Protocol of Accession.       The negative impact of these violations on America's      premier Internet companies is profound. There are several      corporate victims of China's exclusionary practices. Although      there is public information identifying several large      companies that have been     blocked or restricted by the Great Firewall, including      YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, Google, and the Huffington      Post, to name a few, there are many other companies that have      been blocked from access in China that I am not able to      identify by name specifically because these companies fear      retaliation. These companies come from various sectors,      including energy, labor mediation, tourism, education, web      hosting, and advertising, among others. The fact that      these large, well-established companies and other fast-     growing U.S. firms, so successful in every other major      market in the world, are reluctant to come forward with      specific information that would form the basis of a WTO      complaint against the Chinese government is powerful      testament to 1) the importance of the Chinese Internet      market--the largest in the world--to these firms'      continued success, and 2) the risk of retaliation that      these firms face if they are seen as lending direct      support to a trade complaint against China. Moreover,      companies not yet in existence, but for which China could      represent a significant business opportunity, do not even      have a voice in the matter and perhaps never will.       I represent the First Amendment Coalition, an award-     winning, non-profit public interest organization dedicated to      advancing free speech for individuals and companies just like      those denied access to China's Internet market. 1 have been      working with them to address the issue of China's Internet      restrictiveness since 2007. The issues regarding internet      censorship and internet blockage are trade issues cognizable      under the WTO, as well as freedom of speech issues. They are      a harmful trade barrier to U.S. business which must be ended.       The First Amendment Coalition was able to persuade the      Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (``USTR'') to take      the critical step of requesting detailed information from      China on its internet restrictions under Article 111:4 of      GATS, which mandates transparency in a Member's application      of measures affecting services. OATS Article 111:4 reads as      follows.       Each Member shall publish promptly and, except in emergency      situations, at the latest by the time of their entry into      force, all relevant measures of general application which      pertain to or affect the operation of this Agreement.       USTR's request to China follows a three year effort by the      First Amendment Coalition to get the U.S. government to take      a tough stance to address China internet restrictions in      violation of international trade rules, free speech, and      human rights. The U.S. request to China under GATS Article      111:4 is highly significant not only because it is the very      first time any WTO Member has utilized that provision of the      GATS agreement, but also because it is the first time that      the U.S. government, or any country, has made a formal      submission through the WTO to China to address internet      censorship.       Contrary to GATS Article 111:4, China's measures with      respect to Internet services have not been published      promptly, and in fact, the blocking and filtering measures      have not been published at all. In this regard, we have been      unable to document written directives or specific      governmental instructions concerning China's measures      constituting the ``Great Firewall,'' but this in effect lends      support to the argument that China is not transparent in its      practices related to controlling and censoring Internet      content. Indeed, China has published few, if any, regulations      related to Internet services. The Chinese government recently      issued an official decision, currently available only in      Chinese, which appears not to contain ``any new concrete      policies but it does set the stage for future moves to rein      in parts of the Internet at the possible expense of the      commercial Internet companies.''       The historic action taken by USTR is also a significant and      important step because, in addition to promoting transparency      and free speech, it may result in China providing information      in response to U.S. questions that will assist small and      medium-sized U.S. businesses in entering the Chinese market,      which they currently are unable to do given the lack of      certain vital information involving use of the Internet. As      USTR indicated in its press release,       [a]n Internet website that can be accessed in China is      increasingly a critical element for service suppliers aiming      to reach Chinese consumers, and a number of U.S. businesses,      especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, have      expressed concerns regarding the adverse business impacts      from periodic disruptions to the availability of their      websites in China.       Small and medium-sized U.S. businesses are particularly      disadvantaged by China's Great Firewall because, unlike      bigger U.S. companies, they do not have the resources to      physically set up shop in China so they are simply excluded      from the Chinese market Some of the information requested      from China by USTR included the following:       With respect to China's rules governing website blocking:      Who is responsible for determining when a website should be      blocked? What are the criteria for blocking access? Where are      the guidelines published? Who does the actual blocking? How      can a service supplier know if their website has been      blocked? Are decisions to block appealable? Is the process      used to prevent access the same or different for foreign and      domestic content?       With respect to the State Internet Information Office      (``SIIO) established by the State Council: What are the      responsibilities and authorities of SIIO? Will SIIO handle      licenses, approval processes, and questions on filtering and      other laws?       With respect to inadvertent blocking where one site is      blocked when it shares an IP address with a website China has      deemed harmful: How does it occur? Can it be avoided? Will      Chinese authorities notify the owner of the web hosting      service so that it may ensure other sites are not      inadvertently blocked? How can companies resolve inadvertent      blocking?       With respect to the broad nature of the eleven categories      of content which Internet service providers may not      disseminate: Are there any criteria to determine when content      falls within the eleven categories? Are government requests      to filer specific terms communicated directly to Internet      information service providers? Are the same terms subject to      filtering made available to Internet information service      providers inside and outside of China?       With respect to the prevention of ``illegal information''      as that term is used in the White Paper on the Internet in      China: How is illegal information defined? Is a written      government order required for a private corporation or      relevant authority to block the transmission of illegal      information? What types of technical measures are service      suppliers expected to use to prevent transmission of the      illegal information? Are the technical measures to block      illegal information applied automatically to domestic and      foreign traffic? If not, how are they applied? Does Internet      content from outside of China go through a separate      monitoring process for illegal information than Internet      content created inside of China? If so, how do they differ?       We hope and expect that the Government of China will answer      these questions fully and promptly, fulfilling its      obligations under the WTO to maintain an open internet and      not discriminate against U.S. business.       The remainder of this submission will review in greater      detail the Internet restrictions in China, the adverse trade      impact caused by those restrictions, and how those      restrictions would appear to violate China's international      trade obligations.                    I. China's Internet Restrictions       U.S. and foreign Internet companies have faced a long      history of discriminatory treatment in China, to their      disadvantage and to the advantage of their Chinese      competitors. China has for many years maintained a policy,      popularly known as the ``Great Firewall,'' under which it has      exerted strict control over the use of the limited system of      fiber optic cables that connects networks in China to the      outside world. As we understand it, China has installed      certain hardware, known as ``tappers'' or ``network      sniffers,'' at each entry point so that when a user in China      attempts to access a good or service located on a server      outside of China, the tappers create mirror copies of the      data packets that flow back and forth between the two      servers, and the mirror copies are delivered to a set of      computers that automatically review the data packets. The      computers can be, and often are, pre-progammed to block a      particular domain name server (``DNS''), Internet Protocol      (``IP'') address, or Universal Resource Locator (``URL'')      address.       The government of China (``GOC'') also employs tens of      thousands of individuals whose sole mission is to search the      Internet for objectionable content. Their work often results      in the blocking of additional DNS, IP, and URL addresses.       Following USTR's Article 111:4 request, China defended its      Internet censorship as an effort to ``safeguard the public.''      Although the ruling Communist Party claims its monitoring and      blocking is to promote ``constructive'' websites, stop the      spread of ``harmful information,'' and develop what it calls      a healthy intemet culture, it is unclear what content is      subject to blocking and often the blocked content has nothing      resembling ``harmful information.'' Additionally, the      blocking appears motivated by other competitive or political      agendas. For example, access to the Android Marketplace was      blocked within China just after Google announced it would      help the Dalai Lama to visit South Africa virtually.                  Harm Caused By China's Restrictions       Chinese internet restrictions have disadvantaged American      businesses, to the benefit of Chinese businesses. According      to news reports, Facebook and Twitter, for example, have been      blocked in China. In their absence, copycat websites based in      China (with censored content) have been able to flourish. It      seems unlikely that Facebook and Twitter will be able to      regain the market share lost to their Chinese competitors      even if they were unblocked at some point in the future.      Chinese users have already developed a preference for certain      social media sites, and it is doubtful that they would have      an incentive to switch services. The loss of a huge potential      market for these companies indicates the extent of the harm      caused by the Chinese actions. In addition to the direct loss      of access to Chinese consumers by these companies comes the loss from all of the advertisers that would ordinarily be offering their services on the Internet pages of these social media service providers. The number of Internet users in China has exceeded 500      million, growing at double digit rates since 2008, roughly      twice the size of the U.S. market, which grew only 2.5 to      4.5 percent in the same timeframe.     China is now the largest market for Internet users and      U.S. businesses are effectively being blocked from or only      given highly restricted access to that market. U.S.      companies excluded from the Chinese market are not just      large tech companies but small and medium businesses      including ``travel sites, engineering firms and consulting      firms, which have found their sites blocked and have      complained to the trade office.'' A 2011 report by the      McKinsey Global Institute estimates that there is a ten      percent increase in productivity for small and medium      businesses from internet usage. This productivity growth      is denied U.S. companies that are blocked from providing      their services in China.       U.S. companies are subject to the strict controls that      completely disrupt their service, or at a minimum seriously      delay the transmission of information. Users of these      websites, if they actually endure the wait and do not move to      a competitor service supplier, suffer from a decrease in the      quality of service, causing commercial harm to U.S.      companies.       It would be very useful for this Commission to undertake,      directly or perhaps through an economic consulting firm, an      economic analysis of the overall harm caused to U.S.      companies by the Chinese blockage and censorship of the      internet. I think that would be one useful follow-up to this      hearing.  III. China's Internet Restrictions Violate Its International Trade                               Obligations       The Chinese Government's actions appear to constitute      various violations of WTO agreements to which China is a      party, particularly the GATS Agreement. The Chinese actions      in question, although often based on unwritten policies and      practices, would still constitute ``measures'' that can be      challenged under the World Trade Organization Dispute      Settlement procedures. In this regard, the Appellate Body and      various WTO panels have confirmed that actionable      ``measures'' subject to WTO dispute settlement include not      only written laws and regulations, but other government      actions as well. Panels have also recognized the subtleties      of government pressure on private companies as ``measures''      that may be challenged at the WTO.       In addition to USTR's current GATS Article 111:4 request,      there are more aggressive steps that the United States could      take to protect its vital economic interests. While we      believe that China currently is preparing its official      response to USTR's Article 111:4 request, if China fails to      respond or fails to respond meaningfully, the United States      would then have a readily apparent basis to initiate formal      dispute settlement proceedings in the WTO. Paragraph 1 of      GATS Article XXIII says ``[i]f any Member should consider      that any other Member fails to carry out its obligations or      specific commitments under this Agreement, it may with a view      to reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter      have recourse to the dispute settlement understanding.''       In addition to a potential violation under GATS Article III      on transparency, there are other WTO obligations that China      appears to violate with its Internet restrictions, including      other GATS provisions, as is discussed below.       Initiation of a WTO dispute settlement proceeding against      Chinese Internet restrictions by the United States would      signal to the U.S. business community, to consumers around      the world, and to China, that the U.S. government will assert      its rights under WTO agreements when China fails to fulfill      its WTO obligations, even in those areas that may be of a      more sensitive nature. Unfortunately, these sensitivities      give rise to a number of obstacles to U.S. initiation and      prosecution of a formal WTO dispute against China.       As noted, it is difficult to find companies willing to come      forward to support a potential case against China for fear of      retaliation. Due to this fear, specific facts needed by the      U.S. government to support many claims under the WTO are      difficult to document. In addition, also as noted, many of      the Chinese laws, regulations, policies, and practices      regarding Internet services are not written down, although      they are enforced de facto.    A. China's Internet Censorship Violates Other Provisions Of GATS       China made specific commitments regarding market access and      national treatment for services in various service sectors.      China's Internet policies would appear to violate many of      these specific commitments under the GATS, including in the      areas of Data Processing Services, Photographic Services,      Telecommunication Services, Mobile Voice and Data Services,      Audiovisual Services, Tourism and Travel Related Services,      and Transport Services. By pursuing these policies, China      denies market access to U.S. companies and discriminates      against the services of U.S. companies in favor of Chinese      companies.       Although U.S. companies offer a wide range of services over      the Internet, four service sectors that would appear to      suffer disproportionately under Chinese policies are: (1)      Advertising services (the primary revenue source for U.S.      suppliers of Internet-based services, particularly those      operating search engines, social networking, and data/photo      sharing, is through advertising and U.S. services suppliers      obtain revenue from the development and posting of targeted      advertisements on their webpages and facilitating access to      other websites by their users clicking on the      advertisements); (2) Data processing and tabulation services      (relevant U.S. services suppliers are providing consumers      with the ability to access certain tools over the Internet      that enable them to make, edit, and share videos or photos,      or other data and that allow them to search for content on      other websites and the U.S. services supplier is necessarily      processing data for the consumer and providing a tool to      access defined data bases or the Internet generally); (3) On-     line information and database retrieval; and (4) Videos,      including entertainment software and (CPC 83202),      distribution services (``Video/entertainment distribution      services'').       There follows below a brief discussion of some of the      specific GATS claims that might be made against the Chinese      measures in question and some of the factors that would need      to be considered in prosecuting such claims.                         I. National Treatment       China's restrictions on U.S. Internet companies appear to      violate the national treatment provision in Article XVII of      the GATS, which provides that ``each Member shall accord to      services and service suppliers of any other Member, in      respect of all measures affecting the supply of services,      treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own      like services and service suppliers.''       The Chinese measures at issue would seem to fall within one      or more of at least four services subsectors for which China      has inscribed a specific commitment, without limitation on      national treatment, in its WTO Services Schedule. As such,      China's measures must comply with the obligations in Article      XVII for these subsectors. Current Chinese treatment of U.S.      Internet companies, including filtering and blocking through      the ``Great Firewall'' and mandated disabling of certain      service functions, modifies the conditions of competition in      favor of Chinese suppliers such as Baidu (considered the      ``Google'' of China); as such, these measures are      inconsistent with Article XVII of the GATS.       If China's measures were challenged in a WTO proceeding, a      Panel would first determine whether China's measures are      indeed ``affecting'' the supply of these services. As noted      by the Appellate Body in EC-Bananas III:       [T]he term of ``affecting'' reflects the intent of the      drafters to give a broad reach to the GATS. The ordinary      meaning of the word ``affecting'' implies a measure that has      ``an effect on'', which indicates a broad scope of      application. This interpretation is further reinforced by the      conclusions of previous panels that the term `affecting' in      the context of Article III of the GATT is wider in scope than      such terms as `regulating' or `governing.'       It is therefore not necessary for China's measures to be      directly regulating or governing the business of U.S.      Internet service providers, but merely that the measures have      an effect on these services, and their providers' ability to      do business in China. China's measures clearly have ``an      effect on'' these services--indeed, a very detrimental one.       Second, the United States would need to demonstrate that      China's measures accord ``less favorable'' treatment to U.S.      suppliers than to China's domestic suppliers of ``like''      services. As set forth in GATS Article XVII:3, the test for      less favorable treatment is whether the measure ``modifies      the conditions of competition in favor of services or service      suppliers of' China compared to like services or services      suppliers of the United States. Persuading a panel in this      regard would require the production of extensive data and      specific information demonstrating the competitive      disadvantage suffered by U.S. companies due to China's      measures. A comparison of blockages of websites, upload times      for content of websites, and other significant impediments to      Internet service providers would likely reveal significant      and swift loss of market share by U.S. providers.                            2. Market Access       Article XVI:2 of the GATS prohibits Members from      maintaining or adopting quantitative limitations on service      operations or service output. China's restrictions on certain      U.S. Internet companies' services constitutes a de facto      quantitative limitation on such services, therefore violating      this provision.                         3. Domestic Regulation       Under Article VI of the GATS, for services sectors in which      specific commitments have been undertaken, China must      administer its measures in a ``reasonable, objective and      impartial manner'' and, for all services sectors, must ensure      that tribunals or procedures are available for the prompt      review and remedy of administrative decisions. China's      restrictions on U.S. Internet companies are subjective and      non-transparent, and there are no tribunals or procedures for      the review of these administrative decisions. The      restrictions therefore violate China's obligations under      Articles VI:1 and VI:2(a) of the GATS.       China's ``Great Firewall'' filtering and blocking practices      would also seem to violate the GATS Annex on      Telecommunications, which states in paragraphs 4 and 5 that      ``each Member shall ensure that relevant information on      conditions affecting access to and use of public      telecommunications transport networks and services is      publicly available'' and that ``{e}ach Member shall ensure      that any service supplier of any     other Member is accorded access to and use of public      telecommunications transport networks and services on      reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions.'' In      addition, paragraph 5(c) imposes an obligation on China to      ensure that U.S. services suppliers may use the public      telecommunications transport networks and services ``for the      movement of information within and across borders'' and ``for      access to information contained in databases or otherwise      stored in machine-readable form'' in the United States or in      the territory of another WTO Member. China's filtering and      blocking on Internet content clearly restricts the      availability of these telecommunications networks in a      discriminatory fashion.                               Conclusion       We appreciate the Commission holding this hearing and      inviting me to testify. We also appreciate the efforts of      USTR in submitting the GATS 111:4 questions. We urge the      Commission to take into account our views in its ongoing work      on this issue. We also urge the Commission to monitor China's      responses to these questions as well as USTR's continuing      efforts on this very important issue. An open and accessible      internet in China is a prerequisite to U.S. success in the      Chinese market, and a goal that we must continue to fight for      until it is achieved.                          ____________________
