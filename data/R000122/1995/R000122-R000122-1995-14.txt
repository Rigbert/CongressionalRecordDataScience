Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Hefley amendment. The most charitable thing I can say about this amendment is that it is ill-timed.  Mr. Speaker, today we are hosting the peace negotiators from the various factions in the United States. Because of diplomatic activities, and these peace negotiations, we have seen the level of violence in the former Yugoslavia decrease immensely. Now is not the time to derail that process or to take up these issues.  Now, there are significant issues to be debated prior to the commitment of American forces in the former Yugoslavia. I have visited Yugoslavia, Sarajevo, the Krajina, Macedonia. There are difficult issues we must address. The first issue is whether any agreement that is reached in Dayton is worthy of enforcement. We will not know that until the details have been hammered out and announced.  The second issue is whether or not our participation with NATO requires the commitment of American ground forces. Is there some other significant contribution we can make that will aid NATO without committing ground forces?  These are all legitimate questions. These are questions that should be debated, but now is not the time nor is this resolution the appropriate vehicle to do that.  Mr. Speaker, we have to, I think, give the negotiators a chance to reach an agreement and then consider our participation.
