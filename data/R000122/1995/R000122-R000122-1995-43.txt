Chairman, recently the Governor of Rhode Island announced that he has all of the matching funds and that the State expects to commence preliminary work prior to the end of fiscal year 1995. In addition, the Governor has requested a Federal contribution of $1 million in fiscal year 1996 to continue this work. It is my understanding that the subcommittee continues to believe that this project is worthy of Federal support.  Is this also the chairman's understanding?
