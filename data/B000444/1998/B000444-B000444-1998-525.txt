 President, I assume the reason why the Senator thinks that is because what I say is such content that he thinks I have spoken longer.  Let me be very brief and blunt. The fact is that we have several schools of thought about China on this floor and what our future relations will be. We constantly hear that those of us who are critical of China's human rights policy and proliferation policy should not tie our opposition to their point of view to trade. They say let's keep things in their proper perspective.  Well, if this is not the place to go, if to go to an organization that is an international organization constituted for the express purpose of discussing and identifying those nations that do not engage in practices consistent with what civilized countries should be doing relative to human rights, then there is no circumstance in which we can criticize China.  They say we should not criticize China and tie it to trade, and they say we should not criticize China here, we should do it privately. Privately malarkey. We should do it privately; we should also do it publicly.  We are not treating China any other way than we treat any other civilized nation in the world. As a member of the largest country in the world, they have to grow up and understand that if they take affront at us raising their human rights record in a forum, an international forum, that is constituted for that express purpose, thenthey have a great deal of political maturation they have to go through in order to be a world power that will gain respect from the rest of the world.  I will conclude, Mr. President, by saying, I think this is one of those cases where our silence would be deafening. I yield the floor.
