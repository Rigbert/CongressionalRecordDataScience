Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced legislation that will [[Page E46]] add bronchio-alveolar carcinoma to the list of diseases which the VA presumes to be service connected. This bill is identical to legislation I offered last year (H.R. 4156).  Bronchio-alveolar carcinoma is a rare form of nonsmokers' lung cancer which strikes otherwise healthy individuals for no known reason. In 1981, it took the life of Thomas McCarthy, a veteran who was a navigator aboard the U.S.S. McKinley during his time in the U.S. Navy in the 1950's.  In 1955, the McKinley was one of several ships to take part in Operation Wigwam, a secret Navy experiment which tested the effects of an atomic detonation under the ocean floor. The blast produced a mist which enveloped the ships on mission and their crewmen. The Navy refused to even acknowledge the test until 1979, and they still refuse to make public the dangers that the mist produced.  After Mr. McCarthy's death, his widow Joan applied for benefits through the VA. Unfortunately, she was consistently turned down despite the plethora of information she continued to unearth which confirmed that her husband's death was a direct result of his service connection.  I became involved with Mrs. McCarthy's case in 1986 and have been trying to persuade the VA to administratively include bronchio-alveolar carcinoma on the presumed service-connected list. Unfortunately, these requests have been rebuffed. I have been told that the only way to get this done is through legislation.  Last year, VA Secretary Jesse Brown promised me that the Department will support my efforts to pass this legislation. With Secretary Brown's help and as vice chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I will be working with my colleagues on the committee to ensure that the bill is brought up quickly and passed.  We have held hearings on this matter. I have met personally with Secretary Brown to urge action. The time for talking and debating is over. It is clear that this matter needs to be resolved and the time for action is now.  Joan McCarthy, and the few other veterans who suffer from this mysterious cancer and their families, deserve justice. I urge all my colleagues to strongly support this measure.                          ____________________
