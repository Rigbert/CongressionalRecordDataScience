 If you want to protect women who have been raped who are going into the emergency rooms--can you imagine the emotional problem they are facing right then and there? If you want to protect them so they can have emergency contraception and not be pregnant, you need 60 votes. Fifty-one will not do. If you want to give women basic health insurance so they can have a successful pregnancy, you need 60 votes. That is what is coming from the Republican side of the aisle. I don't believe it is consistent with the ethic that says we care not just about babies but about the mothers as well.  I yield to the Senator from Nevada for a question.
