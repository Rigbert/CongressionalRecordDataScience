. debate and goes to the heart      of Washington's current dilemma--America's poverty of      friendship.  It goes on to say:       And buying allegiances one country at a time is a far cry      from building a cohesive group committed to a common cause.      Another consequence of the Bush Administration's Iraq Policy      is that it could unintentionally undermine the President's      broader goal of implanting the seeds of reform in the region.      If the intervention comes to be seen by Iraq's neighbors as      illegitimate, the result could be more radicalism, not less.       The Administration's lofty goals in the Mideast could be      much harder to achieve if ``Americans are seen less as a      partner than as a foreign power,'' says Jon B. Alterman, who      recently left the Bush State Dept.  What a dramatic turn of events, and from the spirit of international cooperation, fighting the war on terrorism, for the United States to be in a bidding war to try to bring the Turks into the position where they will allow us to use their country, it is just such a change from where we were. It reflects a sad decline in our diplomatic skills.  Consider at the same time what is happening in North Korea. Here we have a country which has decided to test the United States. Why they have decided is anyone's guess. But let me hazard one. They see what is happening in Iraq. Iraq is waiting for the United Nations and others to protect them from a United States invasion, and they are not being successful. North Koreans decided to take a much different course. They are confronting the United States in the crudest and most dangerous way--suggesting that they are going to build nuclear weapons; they are going to fire missiles; they are going to harass our aircraft; and they are going to defy us. They believe that is the way to hold the United States back. The process they are building up could potentially proliferate nuclear weapons around the world.  Our response there, unlike with Iraq where we are full bore with a quarter million troops and billions of dollars committed, is to not even speak to the North Koreans. I don't understand that level of diplomacy. I don't understand how that will make this a safer world.  Let us reflect for a moment, though, on what is happening in the United Nations. I have read the critics from the right who basically said we should go right over the United Nations; we no longer need them; we have the power; we don't need to wait around for small nations with populations that are a fraction of the United States to decide whether they will support us. In a way, in the world of realpolitik, that is true. But the United States, in informing the United Nations, had something else in mind. It is not just a matter of whether we have the power and a show of more strength than the United Nations as a member but whether the United States is stronger with collective security engaging other countries around the world to join us in efforts such as containing Iraq and its danger.  I happen to believe that collective security is not old fashioned and outmoded. It is critically important for us to consider building alliances to achieve important goals for the United States and the world because in building those alliances through the collective security of the United Nations, we bring together common values, a consensus on strategy, and a world vision that will serve all of us well.  To walk away from the United Nations and say, once having engaged them in a resolution, that we may not be able to pass a use-of-force resolution and that we will do it ourselves is to walk away from an important concept which has been fostered by the United States and supported by the United States and which has been critically important to us as recently as our effort in the Persian Gulf and in Afghanistan.  But, by tomorrow, the decision may be made. If the United Nations Security Council does not support us, it is indeed possible that we will have unilateral action by the United States, with the possible support of the British.  I asked the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Rumsfeld, several weeks ago: Who are our allies in this coalition against Iraq? He said: Certainly the United States with about 250,000 troops, and the British with about 26,000 troops, and others. I said: Of the others, who would rank third? At that point, he said: The Turks.  We know what is happening. Their Parliament will not allow us to use their country as a base of operation. That may change. But it shows, when it comes to this effort, that it is by and large a bilateral effort by the United States and the British against the Iraqis. I think that is not the best approach. I think it is far better for us to acknowledge what I think is the real effective approach, and that is to engage our allies in the United Nations and in the Security Council to put meaningful deadlines on Saddam Hussein; for the inspectors to reach their goals; to let Saddam Hussein know that every step of the way, his failure to cooperate could result in the United Nations taking action against him. That does not call for an invasion, but it puts him on a tight timetable that he has to live by.  To abandon the inspections, to abandon the role of the United Nations, and to launch a unilateral invasion of this country is going to be something that I think we may regret. Will we be successful militarily? I believe we will. I can't tell you the cost in terms of American lives or in terms of Iraqis killed. But I trust our military to succeed in this mission.  Having succeeded militarily, though, what will we then face? We will face, of course, the devastation in Iraq.  This week, we learned that the United States was now soliciting bids from companies in the United States for the reconstruction of Iraq beforethe bombs have even fallen. That could be momentous in terms of cost. We will face it.  As Tom Friedman of the New York Times has written, when we go into a gift shop and see the sign, ``If you break it, you own it,'' the fact is when we invade Iraq and remove its leadership and occupy that country, it is then our responsibility. Others may help us, but it is primarily our responsibility.  The same thing is true in terms of the long-term vision of Iraq. This is a country with no history of self-government, this is a country with no history of democracy, and we want to bring certain values there. We have to concede the fact that it will take some time before they arrive at that point. We will be there in an occupational way with others perhaps, but we will have the responsibility of making that transformation a permanent or semipermanent presence of American troops in the Middle East and all that that entails.  At the same time, it is bound to enrage our enemies around the world--those who think the United States is acting unilaterally and not acting in concert with other nations, peace-loving nations that would share our ultimate goals. That, too, may complicate the war on terrorism. That has been conceded by intelligence agencies and others. Our efforts in Iraq may spread the seeds of terrorism on new ground, and maybe even here in the United States. We will have to work that much harder to protect ourselves.  I want to enter into the Record a letter sent to Secretary of State Colin Powell from John Brady Kiesling, who is with the United States Embassy in Athens, Greece.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Hon. Colin Powell,     Secretary of State,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing you to submit my      resignation from the Foreign Service of the United States and      from my position as Political Counselor in U.S. Embassy      Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart. The      baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to give      something back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat was      a dream job. I was paid to understand foreign languages and      cultures, to seek out diplomats, politicians, scholars and      journalists, and to persuade them that U.S. interests and      theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my country and      its values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic      arsenal.       It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State      Department I would become more sophisticated and cynical      about the narrow and selfish bureaucratic motives that      sometimes shaped our policies. Human nature is what it is,      and I was rewarded and promoted for understanding human      nature. But until this Administration it had been possible to      believe that by upholding the policies of my president I was      also upholding the interests of the American people and the      world. I believe it no longer.       The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible      not only with American values but also with American      interests. Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us      to squander the international legitimacy that has been      America's most potent weapon of both offense and defense      since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle      the largest and most effective web of international      relationships the world has ever known. Our current course      will being instability and danger, not security.       The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics and      to bureaucratic self-interest is nothing new, and it is      certainly not a uniquely American problem. Still, we have not      seen such systematic distortion of intelligence, such      systematic manipulation of American opinion, since the war in      Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us stronger than      before, rallying around us a vast international coalition to      cooperate for the first time in a systematic way against the      threat of terrorism. But rather than take credit for those      successes and build on them, this Administration has      chosen to make terrorism a domestic political tool,      enlisting a scattered and largely defeated al Qaeda as its      bureaucratic ally. We spread disproportionate terror and      confusion in the public mind, arbitrarily linking the      unrelated problems of terrorism and Iraq. The result, and      perhaps the motive, is to justify a vast misallocation of      shrinking public wealth to the military and to weaken the      safeguards that protect American citizens from the heavy      hand of government. September 11 did not do as much damage      to the fabric of American society as we seem determined to      do to ourselves. Is the Russia of the late Romanovs really      our model, a selfish, superstitious empire thrashing      toward self-destruction in the name of a doomed status      quo?       We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade more      of the world that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over      the past two years done too much to assert to our world      partners that narrow and mercenary U.S. interests override      the cherished values of our partners. Even where our aims      were not in question, our consistency is at issue. The model      of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what      basis we plan to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image      and interests. Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is      blind in Chechnya, as Israel is blind in the Occupied      Territories, to our own advice, that overwhelming military      power is not the answer to terrorism? After the shambles of      post-war Iraq joins the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it      will be a brave foreigner who forms ranks with Micronesia to      follow where we lead.       We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of many      of our friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral      capital built up over a century. But our closest allies are      persuaded less that war is justified than that it would be      perilous to allow the U.S. to drift into complete solipsism.      Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our President condone      the swaggering and contemptuous approach to our friends and      allies this Administration is fostering, including among its      most senior officials. Has ``oderint dum metuant'' really      become our motto?       I urge you to listen to America's friends around the world.      Even here in Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-     Americanism, we have more and closer friends than the      American newspaper reader can possibly imagine. Even when      they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know that the      world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a      strong international system, with the U.S. and EU in close      partnership. When our friends are afraid of us rather than      for us, it is time to worry. And now they are afraid. Who      will tell them convincingly that the United States is as it      was, a beacon of liberty, security, and justice for the      planet?       Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character      and ability. You have preserved more international      credibility for us than our policy deserves, and salvaged      something positive from the excesses of an ideological and      self-serving Administration. But your loyalty to the      President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an      international system we built with such toil and treasure, a      web of laws, treaties, organizations, and shared values that      sets limits on our foes far more effectively than it ever      constrained America's ability to defend its interests.       I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile      my conscience with my ability to represent the current U.S.      Administration. I have confidence that our democratic process      is ultimately self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I      can contribute from outside to shaping policies that better      serve the security and prosperity of the American people and      the world we share.       Sincerely,                                              John Brady Kiesling,                                              U.S. Embassy Athens.
