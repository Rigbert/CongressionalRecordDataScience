President, I rise today with by colleague, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison to introduce the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999. Today, some of our nation's poorest rural and inner-city communities face a crisis--they may soon have inadequate or no hospital healthcare because nurses are unwilling to work in these neighborhoods. The Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999 will ensure that hospitals located in these desperately underserved areas can continue to provide adequate healthcare to our most needy communities.  Hospitals located in underprivileged areas often experience severe difficulty in attracting nurses. These hospitals operate in the middle of some of the harshest poverty and crime in our country. The employees of these hospitals often treat the worst and most troubling cases.  The condition of the surrounding area imperils the ability of these hospitals to recruit and maintain an adequate nursing staff. These circumstances have pushed some hospitals into a financial crisis, threatening the quality of healthcare to those most in need.  For the past eight years, this problem has been addressed by the H(1)(a) visa program which has allowed these hospitals to hire nonimmigrant nurses. Unfortunately, the H(1)(a) visa program sunset in 1997, and so once again such hospitals are in crisis. By replacing the H(1)(a) visa, the Nursing Relief Act will alleviate this crisis.  The true beneficiary of this program will not be the hospitals, but the underprivileged communities which rely on the hospitals' services. Let me tell you a story about the role that this program can play in the health of a community. The story is about the St. Bernard Hospital on the South Side of Chicago.  St. Bernard Hospital is the only remaining hospital in the Englewood community, which serves over 100,000 people. It is located in one of the poorest and most crime ridden neighborhoods in the country. Over the years, St. Bernard has become indispensable to its community. Even though it has not been designated as a trauma center, St. Bernard receives the second highest number of ambulance runs from the Chicago Fire Department. St. Bernard also provides free vision exams and free screening for blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and sickle cell anemia. In addition, schoolchildren receive free physicals and inoculations.  St. Bernard Hospital also offers a great number of outreach and community services. A food pantry is stocked, and clothes are made available for patients in need. St. Bernard is sponsoring a project for affordable housing in the community. The hospital has opened four family clinics in Englewood to provide safe and easy access to healthcare for community residents. Physicians from St. Bernard visit senior housing facilities on a regular basis, and the hospital has been recognized by Catholic Charities for its work with senior housing and healthcare.  In addition, St. Bernard is by far the largest employer in the Englewood area. When the hospital faces a crisis, many jobs in the community are placed at risk.  Even though the health of Englewood relies on this hospital, St. Bernard almost had to close its doors in 1992. After aggressive recruitment efforts, the hospital was unable to attract enough healthcare professionals to maintain its services. The hospital was especially in need of registered nurses.  The problem had been solved in part by hiring foreign nurses through the H(1)(a) visa program. The hospital had gone through great lengths to hire domestic nurses, and was using the H(1)(a) program only as a last alternative to closing its doors.  In the first half of 1997, for example, the hospital placed want ads in the Chicago Tribune and received approximately 200 responses. However, almost 75 percent of the responses declined to interview when they learned where the hospital was located. St. Bernard has also tried to hire nurses through nurse registries. However, the rates of the registries would cost the hospital more than $2 million a year, an unsustainable expense for an already financially burdened hospital.  Clearly, the H(1)(a) visa program had been offering St. Bernard a way to maintain its service to the community when no other option was available. In 1997, even that option was eliminated.  The Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act will ensure that hospitals like St. Bernard can keep their doors open to the public and continue to support their community. In addition, however, the bill has been designed to protect the jobs of domestic nurses and to ensure that hospitals use the visa program faithfully and only as a last resort solution.  This bill is more narrowly targeted than the old H(1)(a) visa program. The measure ensures that nurses can only be brought into the United States by hospitals that have no alternative. In short, we have made every effort to ensure that no American nurse will lose his or her job as a result of this bill. While we want to assure that these hospitals have an adequate nursing staff, we must also guarantee that foreign nurses are not taking away jobs from domestic nurses.  Let me tell you what this bill does:  It establishes a nonimmigrant classification for nurses in health professional shortage areas. The program provides non-immigrant visas for 500 nurses each year to work in hospitals where there are severe nursing shortages.  The Nursing Relief Act protects the jobs of domestic nurses in three separate ways:  First, the measure requires that a hospital must certify that it has gone through great lengths to hire and retain domestic nurses before it can use this visa program to hire nonimmigrant nurses.  Second, the measure requires that nonimmigrant nurses must be paid the same wages and work under the same conditions as domestic nurses. In addition, nonimmigrant nurses cannot be hired in order to disrupt the activities of labor unions. These provisions ensure that hospitals cannot undercut the working conditions of domestic nurses.  And third, the measure limits the number of nonimmigrant nurses who may enter the United States in any given year. The Act provides spaces for only 500 nonimmigrants each year, and it caps the number of nurses who may enter each state.  In addition, the Nursing Relief Act provides for serious penalties for abuse, thus ensuring that hospitals will not misuse this new visa category. Moreover, the bill guarantees that hospitals use this program faithfully by narrowly defining the hospitals which are eligible. In order to hire nonimmigrant nurses through this visa program, hospitals must fulfill four strict requirements.  First, the hospital must be located in an area which has been defined by the Department of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals.  Second, the hospital must have at least 190 acute care beds.  Third, the hospital must have at least 35 percent of its in-patient days reimbursed by Medicare.  Fourth, the hospital must have at least 28 percent of its in-patient days reimbursed by Medicaid.  All of these measures ensure that the Nursing Relief Act will serve as a relief to our communities rather than a loophole in the immigration laws.  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to introduce this important and very timely initiative. I hope that my colleagues will join me and support the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999 so that every hospital can maintain an adequate nursing staff regardless of its location.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 455       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
