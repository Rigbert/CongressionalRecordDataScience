Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express by heartfelt relief that fellow American Aliza Marcus was acquitted by a State Security Court in Turkey today. The charges which had been brought against her raised serious questions about Turkish leaders' stated commitments to democracy, and her trial generated substantial interest in the United States and among Members of Congress. Perhaps more than any recent case, the trial of this Rueters journalist from New Jersey heightened awareness about restrictions on free speech in Turkey. Her case was specifically protested in report language on the recently passed foreign operations appropriations bill. Yesterday 9 Senators and 38 of my House colleagues joined me in an urgent appeal to the Turkey's President Demirel on behalf of Aliza Marcus and others charged with or imprisoned for speech crimes.  Mr. Speaker, in addition to the acquittal of Ms. Marcus, I am also encouraged by steps Turkey has recently taken to alter article 8 of the antiterror law, which has frequently been used to criminalize free speech. The release, since October 30, of up to 80 persons detained under article 8 is a significant positive development which offers further hope that this restrictive law, and others like it will soon become anachronisms in Turkey, as they have become in other European States.  Unfortunately, however, the Government of Turkey continues to routinely charge, convict, and imprison individuals for speech crimes. I would point out that four Kurdish members of Turkey's Parliament remain imprisoned for speech crimes, including Leyla Zana, who today was awarded the European Parliament's Sakharov prize for freedom of thought. It is sadly ironic that 1 day before the State Security Court acquitted Ms. Marcus, charges were brought against eight leaders of one of Turkey's most respected human rights organizations, the Human Rights Foundation. I recently met with the foundation's president, Yavuz Onen, when he was here to accept an award on behalf of the foundation.  Mr. Speaker, another troubling issue underscored by Ms. Marcus' case relates to the role of the military-sponsored State Security Courts. These legacies of military law pose serious questions about judicial independence in Turkey and the role of the military in Turkey's political life. These courts continue to be responsible for the imprisonment of Turkish intellectuals, journalists, and others, and are increasingly viewed as a major impediment to Turkish democracy.  Mr. Speaker, as long as the Government of Turkey maintains and uses laws to restrict free expression, and as long as hundreds of political prisoners remain in jail, questions about the Government's stated international human rights commitments will remain. Given the high priority Turkish leaders have placed upon Turkey's entry into the European Customs Union, recent reforms seem to reflect more of a commitment to good public relations than to principles of democracy.  Mr. Speaker, I have always supported the strategic, economic, and political foundations upon which our vital partnership with Turkey are based and have supported the Turkish Government's right to combat terrorism. Yet if we support these objectives to the detriment of human rights, we are doing a disservice to the people of Turkey and are undermining our own long-term policies in the region.                          ____________________
