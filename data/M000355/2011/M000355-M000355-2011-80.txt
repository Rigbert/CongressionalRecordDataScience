 SESSIONS. I will be pleased to.  Mr. McCONNELL. I have heard it said on the floor that because a number of terrorists have been tried in article III courts in the past--and I have heard people add up the number of times--that is somehow an argument for continuing to do it.  Is it not the case, I ask my friend from Alabama, that we just set up these military commissions a few years ago at the insistence of the Supreme Court in order to deal with this issue, and only since that time have we had a defined alternative for dealing with these enemy combatants who are also not citizens of the United States?
