President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 12:30. If there are no requests for morning business, the Senate may recess for several hours, as the Senate awaits House action on the remaining appropriations matters.  As previously announced, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session. If rollcall votes are necessary tomorrow, the votes will be scheduled within a 4-hour time span. The leader is now attempting to ascertain that 4-hour period. Also, if rollcalls will be necessary during Thursday's session of the Senate, Senators will be notified as soon as a decision is made concerning those possible votes on Thursday.  The Senate is also attempting to complete its business for the first session of the 105th Congress. Therefore, many executive and legislative items are in the clearance process.
