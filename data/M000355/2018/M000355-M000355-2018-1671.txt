 President, I would like to begin with a few words of tribute to two retired colleagues who passed away since we were last together.  On Friday, March 23, former Senator Zell Miller departed this life at the ageof 86. Those of us who served with Zell knew him as a kind and honorable man and a committed public servant.  He rose from a childhood without electricity and running water well into his school years to serve the State of Georgia as Governor and later as Senator. Zell Miller did so with grit and determination, never afraid to buck partisanship in favor of his principles.  Also, this past Thursday, Senator Daniel Akaka, our former colleague from Hawaii, passed away at the age of 93. He worked closely with Senator Inouye and others to advocate for his State. As the Senator himself once put it, he always preferred being a workhorse to a show horse.  The Senate offers our condolences to their families.                          ____________________
