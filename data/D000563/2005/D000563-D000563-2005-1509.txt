President, I rise to pay tribute to the important work of the president of the American Burn Association, Dr. Richard Gamelli of the Loyola University Medical Center in Chicago, as he approaches the end of his distinguished service in that position. Under Dr. Gamelli's leadership, the American Burn Association has worked tirelessly to improve the first line of defense: the prevention of burn injuries.  The ABA encourages and supports burn-related research, education, care, rehabilitation, and prevention through a variety of programs and publications, including the production of the leading peer-reviewed, scientific journal in the burn field, the Journal of Burn Care & Rehabilitation. During Dr. Gamelli's tenure, the ABA has worked to improve emergency response systems and to incorporate burn care into our Nation's disaster preparedness systems in light of new threats to the United States. Under Dr. Gamelli's guidance, the ABA has expanded its reach and established its position at the forefront of its field. Many physicians, nurses, and health care workers who are members of the ABA are currently on the front lines, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and treating America's injured soldiers.  As professor and chair of the Department of Surgery at the Loyola University Medical Center, Dr. Gamelli has dedicated his life to advancing clinical treatment of burn victims, accident and trauma victims and others whose medical needs are among the most difficult and dire a doctor ever sees. As a teacher he has provided guidance to high school students, college students,medical students, residents, graduate students, colleagues and others, encouraging them always to strive for excellence and look for new answers. As a researcher he has helped his department secure funding for more than 20 years from the National Institutes of Health. He is nationally and internationally recognized for his research and has authored more than 150 scientific articles, 23 book chapters, and 8 books.  In 1997 and 2000 Dr. Gamelli was named by Chicago Magazine as one of ``Chicago's Top Doctors,'' and in 1982, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1990, he was named Professor of the Year by the medical students at Loyola. He was selected by the faculty council of Loyola University Chicago as the 2002 member of the year for his excellence in teaching, research, patient care and service. In light of his extraordinary record of achievement, his alma mater, Saint Michael's College, inducted Dr. Gamelli into the inaugural class of its Alumni Academic Hall of Fame in 2002.  Having served the ABA admirably, Dr. Gamelli recently stepped down as ABA president at this year's annual meeting. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank Dr. Gamelli for his distinguished service and for his ongoing contributions to the American people and the medical community, and I wish him all the best in the future.                          ____________________[Pages S5295-S5296]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     TRIBUTE TO DR.
