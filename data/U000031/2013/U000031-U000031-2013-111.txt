Speaker, a review over how to treat crude oil derived from oil sands for the purposes of the oil spill liability trust fund is one in fact that we look forward to having, but it needs to be at the appropriate place and time.  I've got to say that we are fully supportive of the goals, purpose, and funding mechanisms of the trust fund, and we believe that the allocation of fees should be done equitably among crude oil received at a U.S. refinery and petroleum products entering the U.S. for use. However, a bill or an amendment to approve a single pipeline project is not the appropriate vehicle for this debate. Frankly, it needs to be part of the tax reform bill that I'm sure that Mr. Camp and others are going to move later on this year. I wish we could have debated this as an amendment to this bill, but we don't have that opportunity. It's simply a motion to recommit. So let's push it to the right date, and that is part of tax reform later this year.  Mr. Speaker, we have waited over 1,700 days for this project. Many of us have folks that commute 80, 90, even 100 miles a day. They need a source of gasoline. Canada provides 1.5 million barrels literally every day to the United States. They want to send as much as 6 million barrels by 2030. This is the best way to do it. Why send it by truck? Why send it by rail? Let's send it by pipeline. It's safer, more economical, and in fact it's going to help the consumer.  I remind my colleagues that 62 Members of the U.S. Senate earlier this year voted for this project. We need to do it here. Reject the motion to recommit and vote for final passage.  I yield back the balance of my time.
