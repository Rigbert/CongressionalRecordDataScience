President, I would like share the good work being done by my friend and colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman Peter Welch.  As Democrats and Republicans continue their discussions, I am proud that Peter is bringing a Vermont perspective and Vermont values to the debate. He understands the dangers the United States faces if we default on our debt, but the burden of addressing our mounting national debt must be shared fairly. Budgets are a reflection of our national priorities, and we simply cannot balance our budget on the backs of the most vulnerable alone.  I applaud Peter for bringing his reasoned and responsible message to the debate. I ask unanimous consent that an article on Congressman Welch from today's The Hill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Rep. Welch: Partisan Division Begs Clean Vote To Raise Nation's Debt                                 Ceiling                            (By Mike Lillis)       Lawmakers seeking a bipartisan deficit-reduction plan to      accompany the looming debt-ceiling vote are deluding      themselves about the efficiency of Congress, according to the      Democrat spearheading the push for a clean debt-limit bill.       Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who has emerged in recent weeks      as the staunchest proponent of a standalone debt-ceiling      hike, said the parties are simply too far apart ideologically      to reach a budget deal in time to avoid the market turmoil      many fear would attend inaction on the debt limit.       In a sit-down interview with The Hill from his fourth-floor      Longworth office, Welch noted the recent fight over 2011      spending took the country to the very brink of a government      shutdown.       The battle over the long-term budget will be even tougher      to resolve, he warned, and thus should be tackled separately      from the must-pass debt-limit hike.       ``If the leadership thinks it can make progress on some      steps that would move us toward a better long-term      sustainable budget--fine,'' Welch said Monday. ``But if any      of us are candid--and we saw how just the simple question of      trying to keep the lights on in the government brought us to      the midnight hour--do we realistically think that the gap      between the [Democrats'] approach on the budget and the      [Republicans'] approach on the budget can be bridged in that      period of time?''       Congress's systemic dysfunction was on display last month,      Welch charged, when Standard & Poor's revised its U.S. debt-     rating outlook from ``neutral'' to ``negative.'' That move      was largely influenced not by fiscal considerations, he      noted, but by ``a lack of confidence in Congress and its      ability to make the compromises that are required to get from      here to there.''       With that in mind, Welch last month spearheaded a letter      urging Democratic leaders to unite behind a clean debt-limit      bill. It was endorsed by 114 Democrats. The potential      economic fallout of flirting with default, he warned, is too      serious to saddle the debt-ceiling vote with politically      charged budget conditions.       ``This is not a matter of ripping up the credit card; this      is a matter of paying off the credit card,'' Welch said.      ``And if you don't allow us to do that . . . we're basically      saying we're going to stiff our creditors.''       For almost a century, Congress has set a cap on the      nation's debt, allowing the government to issue bonds to fund      its deficit spending--up to a certain level.       Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has projected the      government will surpass the current $14.3 trillion ceiling on      May 16. Recognizing the improbability that Congress will act      before then, Geithner on Monday told lawmakers he can take      ``extraordinary measures'' to stave off default for several      more months. He set the new deadline at Aug. 2.       All sides of the debate agree that Congress will ultimately      raise the debt ceiling. The question remains how it will do      that.       Republican leaders have insisted that the debt-limit vote      be coupled with a strategy for bringing down deficits over      the long haul--a sentiment shared by a growing number of      Senate Democrats.       ``The vehicle upon which something is likely to be achieved      to reduce government spending is the debt ceiling,'' Senate      Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters      Tuesday. ``I don't intend to vote to raise the debt ceiling      unless we do something significant about the debt.''       In the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) suggested      Tuesday that Republicans might stage a vote on a clean debt-     ceiling bill just to prove it can't pass--a strategy Welch      blasted as a ``political stunt.''       Rep. John Larson (Conn.), chairman of the House Democratic      Caucus, said this week that Democrats are ``amenable'' to      strategies that couple the debt-ceiling vote with a long-term      deficit-reduction plan--with a major caveat.       ``They just have to be consistent with not touching Social      Security, Medicare, Medicaid and dismantling the social      compact between the American people and [their] government,''      Larson told The Hill on Tuesday.       Therein lies the trouble, as GOP leaders are eyeing cuts to      all of those programs as part of their deficit-reduction      plans.       Leaders from both parties, representing both chambers, will      meet Thursday with Vice President Biden in the first official      attempt to reach a long-term budget agreement.       Welch, a chief deputy whip, doesn't have much faith in a      quick resolution.       ``The more the clock ticks, the more apprehension you'll      start to see in the markets,'' he warned. ``When this      happens, it could happen very quickly--and with devastating      consequences.''       It's not the first time Welch has emerged on the national      stage amid a thorny budget debate. In December, he was among      the fiercest opponents of the agreement between Obama and      McConnell to extend the George W. Bush-era tax cuts through      2012, even for the wealthiest Americans.       This week, he tempered that criticism with a bit of      pragmatism.       ``It was not a great deal, but it was the best deal [we      could get],'' he said. ``My criticism also acknowledges that      the president had his reasons, and we in the House--the      Democrats--didn't have the votes.''       Welch was also highly critical of the cuts to low-income      energy subsidies contained in Obama's 2012 budget proposal--     cuts Welch said would ``literally freeze'' his constituents      who rely on them to pay their heating bills.       ``A lot of us understood that the president was making a      statement,'' Welch said Monday of that critique. ``I      respected what motivated the president.''       In some sense, Welch's rise to prominence is as improbable      as passage of the clean debt-ceiling hike he's lobbying. The      third-term liberal is a relative newcomer to Capitol Hill.      And the Vermont he represents hardly shares the national      political reputation that characterizes many of its New      England neighbors.       Yet lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say Welch's      emergence is no accident. Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), a Blue      Dog leader who shares a Capitol Hill apartment with the      liberal Welch, said his roommate studies hard and uses his      experience as a state legislator to great advantage in      Washington.       ``Peter is a nerd, just like me,'' Cooper said in an e-     mail. ``He actually takes the time to read legislation and      understand the issues, which has become a rarity in      Washington. Coming from state government, where you need to      balance the budget every year, he understands the importance      of paying for legislation. This has made him a key consensus      builder in the House and one of the strongest advocates of      fiscal responsibility in the Progressive Caucus.''       Rep. Peter Roskam (Ill.), the Republican chief deputy whip,      called Welch ``a happy warrior''--the rare legislator who      ``firmly believes in a set of principles'' but is also quick      to engage the other side.       ``When the country looks at Washington, they feel like      members are just talking past each other,'' Roskam told The      Hill this week. Welch, on the other hand, ``is very      engaging.''       The bookshelf in Welch's office tells a similar story. It      holds volumes by Nancy Pelosi as well as T. Boone Pickens; it      boasts the 9/11 Commission Report but also a collection of      poems by Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet and mystic.       Welch is also one of the few Democrats willing to go face      to face with Sean Hannity, the conservative--and      characteristically combative--Fox News pundit.       Welch conceded Monday that he ``got the Democratic      treatment'' during his recent Hannity appearance. But only by      reaching across the aisle, he said, will lawmakers in      Washington ever be truly effective.       ``A lot of us get in arguments as though it's an      ideological battle to be won, rather than a practical problem      to be solved. . . . That doesn't work for the country,'' he      said. ``I hope that we all can take a step back--all of us--     and see that there's real advantage to us trying to work      together.''                          ____________________
