Thank you, Dr. Roe, for your very kind remarks, but more importantly, for your witness for life, particularly as an OB/GYN and for delivering those 5,000 babies.  I would like to now yield to another doctor, Dr. Andy Harris, the gentleman from Maryland, who works often at Johns Hopkins, and a great defender of life and an eloquent spokesman.
