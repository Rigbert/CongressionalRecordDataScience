Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate one of Northwest Indiana's most caring and dedicated citizens, Professor Rosalie Levinson. Her career as a Professor at Valparaiso University has allowed her the opportunity to touch the lives of numerous students, both in and out of the classroom. In honor of her gracious service to Valparaiso University, on May 1, 2004 she was named the first Phyllis and Richard Duesenberg professor of law. Rosalie's appointment was announced during a gala at Chicago's Field Museum celebrating the 125th anniversary of Valparaiso University's School of Law.  Rosalie Levinson has accomplished many visionary goals throughout her career. She earned her bachelor's and master's degrees at Indiana University and her law degree from Valparaiso University. Rosalie has been a law professor at Valparaiso University since 1973. She has argued several civil rights cases before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals and is a frequent lecturer on continuing legal education, including the Federal Judicial Center for Federal Judges and the Practice Law Institute programs. Rosalie has team taught with the United States Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Clarence Thomas at the Valparaiso University's study center in Cambridge, England.  Numerous articles written by Rosalie have been published in national law journals. She has co-authored with Professor Bodensteiner a four volume treatise entitled ``Civil Rights Liability'' and also a textbook entitled ``Civil Rights Legislation and Litigation.'' Rosalie served as chair of the Civil Rights Section of the Association of American Law Schools and as a board member on the Jewish Human Relations Council of Northwest Indiana.  Although Rosalie has served on numerous Law School and University Committees and has donated time to the students at Valparaiso University, she has never neglected to provide support and love to her family. Rosalie and her husband Don have two children and two grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, Rosalie has given her time and efforts selflessly to the students at Valparaiso University throughout her years of service. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Professor Rosalie Levinson for her outstanding contributions. I am proud to commend her for her lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
