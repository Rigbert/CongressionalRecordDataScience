 According to a distribution analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the taxpayers above $20,000 in income received a tax increase. So no longer was it just taxing the top 2 percent richest people in America. That was when you were campaigning for President. When you get to be President, it is $20,000.  It was true that taxpayers above $200,000 go up far more than other groups. But generally taxpayers above $20,000 saw their taxes rise.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the joint tax distribution analysis of the 1993 tax bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF THE REVENUE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1993 AS                                           AGREED TO BY THE CONFEREES                                               [103 income Levels]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Present-law        Present-law      Proposed change    Burden change as      Expanded income class \1\       Federal taxes \2\   average tax rate  in tax burden \4\  a share of income                                           Billions         \3\  Percent         Millions           Percent----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Less than $10,000...................                 $9               10.4            -$1,152              -1.2810,000 to 20,000....................                 39               11.9               -993              -0.3020,000 to 30,000....................                 72               17.0                 94               0.0230,000 to 40,000....................                 86               19.1                949               0.2140,000 to 50,000....................                 93               20.9              1,271               0.2950,000 to 75,000....................                201               22.3              3,517               0.3975,000 to 100,000...................                120               24.6              2,653               0.54100,000 to 200,000..................                142               26.6              4,598                .85200.000 and over....................                168               30.2             29,663               5.39                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Total, all taxpayers..........               $930               22.1            S40,800               0.97----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ The Income concept used to place tax returns into income categories is adjusted gross income (AGI) plus: [1]  tax-exempt interest, [2] employer contributions for health plans and life insurance, .
