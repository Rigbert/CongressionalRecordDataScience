Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to rise on behalf of all of the Members on this side of the aisle. Joelle works for the majority. She used to work for the minority, and I was in the majority. Joelle and I have switched places. And I have been here 20 years, so I have known Joelle for a long, long time. I think I speak for everybody on our side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, that she is perhaps not equally, because I do not want to get her in trouble with the majority, but she is very helpful to us, always courteous, always with a good word, always cheerful, and has made this institution a better place.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all of us on this side of the aisle, she has operated in a nonpartisan, bipartisan, efficient and effective way to make this institution run better; and we all join, Mr. Speaker, in congratulating her and thanking her for her service to this institution and to her country.
