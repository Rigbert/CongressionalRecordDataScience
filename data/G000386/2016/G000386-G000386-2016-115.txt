 President, I would just say a simple thing. I have already said we don't want dangerous people to have guns. But the point is that the VA is not identifying the people who might be a danger to themselves or a danger to society. As the Senator from Illinois says, they are simply doing it because ``You can't handle your own finances.'' That is where their constitutional rights are being denied. Their constitutional rights are being denied by a VA employee--maybe somebody who doesn't know anything about mental health--and that is wrong. That is what we are trying to prevent.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The majority leader.                             Cloture Motion  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for the Collins substitute amendment No. 3896.
