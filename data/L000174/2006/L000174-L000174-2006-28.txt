President, two Sundays ago, when Marcelle and I were at mass at Holy Trinity at Georgetown, we listened to a homily about the life of Angelo D'Agostino, SJ. I had been thinking about Father D'Ag, as those of us knew him called him, since I had received word from his dear friend Ben Palumbo that he had died. Ben and Madge Palumbo were wonderful friends to Father D'Ag, as they have been to Marcelle and me.  As Father Kevin O'Brien noted while talking about the home Father D'Agostino began in Nyumbani, Kenya, Father D'Ag worked tirelessly to raise money, especially for abandoned HIV-positive children. His Nyumbani village was designed to hold together families, where most members had lost their normal family cohesiveness because of deaths from AIDS. So many of us, like my friend Senator Dennis DeConcini and others, always responded when the Palumbos asked us to go to fund-raisers to raise money for the work Father D'Agostino was doing throughout Africa. I told some of his fellow Jesuits that we long ago decided that we would do whatever Father D'Agostino wanted--eventually he'd make sure we would anyway, so we might as well do it graciously to begin with. Nothing fazed him when he was asking for others. He always went out of his way to remind Senator DeConcini, Ben Palumbo, and me that we shared Italian heritage. I once told him, ``Angelo, no matter who you were seeking help from, you would find something to connect you, and that would be the reason to do it.'' I remember his laugh to this day.  The beauty of Father D'Agostino and the saintly nature of him was that he never asked for anything for himself--it was always for others. He gave a voice to those who had no voice, and he leaves a great gap in their lives.  Even the President of Kenya and his wife attended the funeral to express his sorrow for the death of Father D'Agostino. He told the board members and others at the funeral that they must carry on Father D'Ag's work. He said, ``I am sure that is the assurance Father D'Agostino would have liked. He founded these homes and wanted to succeed in reducing the prevalence and effects of HIV/AIDS. You should take the responsibility of ensuring that Father D'Agostino's work continues.''  I ask unanimous consent that an article by Joe Holley of The Washington Post about Father D'Agostino be printed in the Record, as well as an article from the official website of the President of Kenya.  For my part, I feel blessed for having known Father D'Ag and I mourn his loss.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          Angelo D'Agostino; Priest Aided HIV-Positive Orphans                            (By Joe Holley)       The Rev. Angelo D'Agostino, 80, a physician, psychiatrist      and Jesuit priest who opened one of the first orphanages for      abandoned HIV-positive children in Kenya, died Nov. 20 of      cardiac arrest at the Karen Hospital in Nairobi. He had been      hospitalized for a week with abdominal pain from      diverticulitis and died after surgery.       Father D'Agostino, who practiced and taught psychiatry in      Washington during the 1970s and '80s, was called to a country      with more than 1 million children whose parents have died of      AIDS. Many of the children, often HIV-positive themselves,      have been abandoned or left to roam through Kenya's big-city      slums.       He encountered the needs of Kenya's children while serving      on the board of governors for a large orphanage in 1991. When      the orphanage began receiving scores of abandoned children      who tested HIV-positive, Father D'Agostino suggested setting      up a facility for them. The board opposed the idea, so in      1992, he founded the Nyumbani Orphanage, beginning with three      HIV-positive children.       Today Nyumbani, or ``home'' in Swahili, shelters about 100      Kenyan children, from newborns to 23-year-olds.       The larger nonprofit organization, also called Nyumbani,      includes Lea Toto (Swahili for ``to raise the child''), a      community-based program founded in 1998 to provide outreach      services to HIV-positive children and their families in the      Nairobi area. Nyumbani also has the most advanced blood      diagnostic laboratory in Kenya.       At the time of his death, Father D'Agostino, an      indefatigable fundraiser, had just returned from Rome and the      United States, where he had solicited money for Nyumbani      Village, a self-sustaining community to serve the orphans and      elderly left behind by the ``lost generation'' of the AIDS      pandemic. The goal of the village, which has plans for 100      houses, a school, a clinic and a community center, is to      create new blended families for orphaned children under the      care of elderly adults.       ``It was difficult to say no to him, particularly because      what he asked you to do were the kinds of things your      conscience would bedevil you about if you said no,'' said      Benjamin L. Palumbo, a Washington attorney who serves as      president of Nyumbani's U.S. board of directors.       Father D'Agostino's friends and orphanage supporters ran      the political gamut, from     former Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-     Vt). Leahy called him ``a living saint''       Short and rotund, ``Father D'Ag,'' as some knew him, was      quick to laugh but also had a temper, his friend James      Desmond recalled. Desmond, former owner of a downtown bar      called Beowulfs, one of the priest's haunts when he lived in      Washington, recalled being with him in a meeting with      congressional aides who were giving him the polite brushoff.      When the priest realized what was happening, Desmond had to      hustle him out the door before his temper got the best of      him.       In 2001, Nyumbani became the first place in Africa to      import deeply discounted AIDS drugs under an Indian      pharmaceutical company's program to make such drugs more      affordable on the continent where most of the world's AIDS      patients live and die.       ``I am sick and tired of doing funerals,'' Father      D'Agostino told The Washington Post, explaining why he was      willing to defy national regulations and international patent      rules to buy cheaper, generic AIDS drugs.       ``It's really the darker side of capitalism, the greed that      is being manifest by these drug companies holding sub-Saharan      Africa hostage,'' he told The Post. ``People are dying      because they can't afford their prices.''       He also sued the Kenyan government for its policy banning      HIV-positive children from the nation's public schools. He      won that suit last year, which allowed more than 100,000      children to rejoin their classmates in schools across the      country.       Angelo D'Agostino was one of six children born to Italian      immigrants in Providence, R.I. His younger brother, Dr.      Joseph D'Agostino of Fairfax, recalled that he had asthma as      a child, so he spent a lot of time reading, making model      airplanes and growing plants and flowers in the family's back      yard.       He received his undergraduate degree in chemistry and      philosophy from St. Michael's College in 1945 and his medical      degree from Tufts University in 1949. He received a master of      science degree in surgery from Tufts in 1953.       He served in the Air Force from 1953 to 1955 as chief of      urology at Bolling Air Force Base. After attending a retreat      with the Knights of Columbus, he decided to enter the      priesthood in 1954, although the Jesuits at Georgetown asked      him to take a year before making a final decision.       ``The Jesuits couldn't use a urologist or kidney stone      specialist,'' his brother recalled, ``so they told him to go      into psychiatry.''       After a psychiatric residency at Georgetown from 1959 to      1965 and further work at the Washington Psychoanalytic      Institute from 1962 to 1967, he became one of the first      American Jesuits to be trained as a psychiatrist. (He liked      to say he had ``more degrees than a thermometer,'' a nephew      recalled.)       He was ordained in 1966, earlier than expected because the      Jesuits were concerned that he was going to succumb to lupus,      an illness he had battled his whole life.       He taught psychiatry at Georgetown University and George      Washington University and in 1972 founded the Center for      Religion and Psychiatry at the Washington Theological Union      to promote dialogue between the two. From 1983 to 1987, he      was in private practice in the District. A number of his      clients were police officers, many whom he met over beers at      Beowulf's.       Father D'Agostino helped administer refugee centers in      Thailand and East Africa in the 1980s, but it was the lost      children of Kenya who captured his heart and wouldn't let go.      They called him ``Faza.''       He retired when he turned 80, ``but it was retirement with      a small `r,' ``Joe D'Agostino said. ``He still went to the      office every day, although he was happy he didn't have to go      to meetings anymore.''       He will be buried in Kenya. His brother, his only immediate      survivor, recalled that Father D'Agostino had only one regret      about his adopted homeland: ``He couldn't grow good tomatoes      over there. Being a good Italian, that was important to      him.''                                  ____    President and First Lady attend Father D'Agostino's Requiem mass       President Mwai Kibaki and First Lady Lucy Kibaki Monday      joined other mourners for the requiem mass for Rev. Father      Angelo D'Agostino at the Consolata Shrine Catholic Church in      Westlands, Nairobi.       The mass was conducted by Nairobi Archbishop Ndingi Mwana      A'Nzeki.       Addressing the congregation, President Kibaki urged Kenyans      to emulate Father      D'Agostino and assist the less fortunate in the society.       He called on board members of Nyumbani Children's Home, Lea      Toto and Nyumbani Village in Kitui to carry on with Father      D'Agostino's work, ensuring that the homes are well      maintained and succeed in serving the HIV/AIDS orphans.       President Kibaki said: ``I am sure that is the assurance      Father D'Agostino would have liked. He founded these homes      and wanted them to succeed in reducing the prevalence and      effects of HIV/AIDS.''       ``You should take the responsibility of ensuring that      Father D'Agostino's work continues,'' the Head of State said.       Paying tribute to Father D'Agostino, the First Lady      described him as a colleague in her work of caring for      orphans and in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the country.       She pointed out that Father D'Agostino played a pivotal      role when she was setting up the Kenya Chapter of the      Organization of African First Ladies Against HIV/AIDS (OAFLA)      by introducing her to key people and institutions helping in      the fight against HIV/AIDS.       As the patron of Nyumbani Children Homes, the First Lady      reassured the orphans that she will continue working hard to      provide them with the resources they need.       The First Lady recalled conversations she had with U.S.      President George W. Bush during a state dinner in Washington      when the U.S. leader hailed the work done by Father      D'Agostino in assisting vulnerable members of the Kenyan      society.       The mass was also attended by the Pope's representative in      Kenya Archbishop Alain Paul Lebeaupin among others.                          ____________________[Pages S11487-S11488]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        FATHER ANGELO D'AGOSTINO
