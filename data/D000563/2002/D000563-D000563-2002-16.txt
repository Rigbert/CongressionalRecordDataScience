I do notbelieve those following this debate, unless they have watched it for a long time, can appreciate the amount of time and effort that has been put into this bill by Senator Lieberman and his staff. The record and history will demonstrate that before the President introduced a Department of Homeland Security, Senator Lieberman not only introduced one, which I was proud to cosponsor, but passed it favorably from the Governmental Affairs Committee without the support of a single Republican Senator.  There was some confusion on the Republican side as to what the President's intentions were, but there was no confusion on the Democratic side. Senator Lieberman believed, and still does, as I do, that a Department of Homeland Security is important for the defense of America against the threat of terrorism.  About 2 weeks after Senator Lieberman's bill passed out of committee, the President introduced his own. Senator Lieberman then addressed the issue again to make his bill and our bill conform more closely with the President's intentions and brought this matter to the floor. There was a controversy which ensued. It was an incredible controversy because it related to the rights of new employees in this Department. I use the word ``new'' advisedly because the 170,000 employees of the Department of Homeland Security are already working for the Federal Government.  With the passage of this legislation and its implementation, they will come under a new roof and a new title, but, frankly, they will be doing many of the same things they have done for years.  There was a question as to whether or not we would be able to protect these employees who had collective bargaining rights in the new Department. It was a contentious issue and one on which the White House and many Members of Congress disagreed.  Senator Lieberman, again in good faith, tried to find some common ground. With the help of some of our colleagues, such as Senators Breaux and Landrieu of Louisiana, as well as many Republicans, we came up with compromise language weeks ago that could have raised this issue and moved it forward.  I say pointblank, there were Members of the Senate who did not want this issue resolved before the election. They did not want the Department of Homeland Security enacted before the election. They wanted to be able to campaign across America suggesting that the Democratic Senate had not passed this important legislation. As a result, they used every procedural trick in the book. They slowed down the process. They refused to have a vote and they got their way. We left for the election without the passage of this important legislation with the compromise language that had been prepared.  In many States and many congressional districts across the Nation, this became a political issue. Sadly, it had an impact on the election far beyond its actual gravity because we could have passed this legislation, and sadly, we come today in an effort to try to bring this issue to a close in the hopes of doing it before we adjourn for the year, before the new Congress comes into session. I certainly hope we can achieve that.  The point has been made by Senator Byrd, Senator Lieberman, and others that we were literally given a 484-page document, which passed the House of Representatives late last night, which creates this new Department of Homeland Security. There are many items in this document that are repetitive. Looking back to the President's original proposal and the proposal from the Governmental Affairs Committee, a lot of this is not new although many things are new. Many of us are trying to digest it.  I was paging through this bill as the debate was ensuing on the floor, picking out sections that raised questions in my own mind. If one looks around the Senate Chamber, they will see a 484-page bill on each desk. By my rough calculation, some 48,000 pages of documentation, many of which will never be read, are looked at by colleagues in the Senate. I do not say that being critical because, frankly, it is almost impossible for an individual Senator to monitor and evaluate every page of a bill. We rely on staff and people who we trust to get that done. But the fact is this just came over.  The reason I raise that issue is as soon as I finish this presentation, I am going to propose a second-degree amendment to Senator Lieberman's amendment which relates to an issue that is completely ignored in this 484-page bill on the Department of Homeland Security.  To give a little background, on September 11, 2001, I was in a meeting in this building when word came that we had to evacuate because of the planes flying into the World Trade Center. With hundreds of others, I raced down the steps of the Capitol on to the lawn outside. We stood there, not knowing quite what to do next. I heard a sonic boom as we scrambled the fighter jets over Washington, DC, to prepare for further attack. We could see on the other side of the Capitol the black smoke billowing out of the Pentagon. Many of us who are entrusted with the responsibilities of serving in Congress were bewildered as to what had happened to our country and wondered what we could do, as individual Senators and Congressmen, to make it safer. I thought about it long and hard, and there is one area on which I decided to focus. I do not profess great expertise when it comes to first response in fighting terrorism, but the one omission I found that needed to be addressed in the administration of our Government was the information technology systems, the computer systems used by the Federal Government.  The reason I had been alerted to this problem was that in a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee a few weeks before September 11 we brought in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and, among other things, asked them about the state of their computers.  I am sorry to report to the Senate and those following this debate that the computer systems in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the premier law enforcement agency in the United States of America, is disgraceful. It reflects a mentality within that agency that has resisted change, resisted new technology and, as a result, is currently operating with computer systems that small businesses in my hometown of Springfield, IL, would reject out of hand as archaic.  I dare say, we could bring in from anyplace in the United States a grade school student who is familiar with computers and they would find the FBI computer system laughable. What they are using to fight crime in the United States, to track down terrorism around the world, is outclassed by computers that can be purchased off the shelf at Sears, Best Buy, and Radio Shack. As hard as that may be to believe, it is a fact.  I also might add that we came to learn that the computer systems of the major agencies which we are depending on to protect America cannot communicate with one another. Would any of my colleagues want to be the CEO of a corporation with a variety of different departments and offices around America that had computer systems that could not communicate with each other? That is a fact today in the Federal Government. It is a fact of life, and it is a disgrace. This bill which we are considering to establish the Department of Homeland Security virtually ignores this problem.  How could we say to the American people, we are going to create a Department to make them and their family feel safer if we do not address the most fundamental issue of the exchange of information? In my concern over this issue, I decided to try to focus on it. I said this is the one thing I will work on. There are 535 Members of Congress. Everyone has a different agenda. I am going to try to carve out this niche and work on upgrading the computer systems in the FBI and creating what they call interoperability, the power of computers in different Federal agencies to communicate with one another. I have worked on it for over a year. I came up with some ideas based on historical experience.  I looked back in history because others have written of this challenge. They make reference to the Manhattan Project. For those who are not students of history, that was in 1939, before World War II. Before the attack on Pearl Harbor, our scientists in America discovered nuclear fission. It was a breakthrough. They knew they had something with great potential with the nuclear fission process. They werenot quite sure what they could do with it on a positive or negative basis.  Then President Franklin Roosevelt created the uranium committee to explore the various scientific things that could be done with nuclear fission and report back. The committee, like most, did some things but did not do them very quickly and did not produce much.  Then came December 7, 1941. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Within 2 days, President Roosevelt came before a joint session of Congress and asked for a resolution of war against the empire of Japan and its allies, Germany and Italy, and America was truly at war.  In August of 1942, President Roosevelt was reminded about this uranium committee. He made a historic decision. He put them out of business. He said, we want to create a new project under the Army Corps of Engineers. We are going to, in this new project, try to take on a much bigger challenge. In charge of this project was an individual, a commanding officer named General Leslie R. Grove. Under what was called the Manhattan Project, we said to General Grove, you have the responsibility to gather together in the Manhattan Project the scientific, industrial, and military capability of America so that we can take nuclear fission and develop weapons that could win World War II.  General Grove is an interesting figure. From what I have read, I understand he was a powerful individual. In the course of several years, 4 years, he spent $2 billion. This is the early 1940s. In today's dollars, that would be $20 billion on the Manhattan Project. He developed four bombs, which were detonated over Japan, which brought an end to World War II. The Manhattan Project was successful.  Think about that when we talk about our own computer capability. I believe we need a Manhattan Project when it comes to the computer information technology of our Federal Government. I believe we need to empower a person and an agency to not only look to bring the most modern technology to each agency but to determine how they work together. That is what is missing.  The Department of Homeland Security bill, 484 pages long, does not even envision this as a challenge to be met. How, then, can we offer security to this country? How, then, can we use the best technology and scientific resources to make this a safer nation?  Currently, each of the agencies--the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, FEMA, INS, the Secret Service, the new Transportation Security Administration, and others--are to be coordinated under this Homeland Security Department. They each operate with their own information technology system and with their own budget. Needless to say, they do not communicate with outside agencies as the FBI or the CIA. These agencies already spend about $2 billion a year on information technology. The President is asking for $37.5 billion for a new Department, which is being gathered from current budgets.  Let me illustrate for a moment an example of why this challenge is important. A few hours ago, we considered port security--I voted for it; 95 Senators did--to try to make our ports safer in the United States. Of course, representing Chicago and Lake Michigan, I understand the importance of port security. Take a ship entering the U.S. waters that comes down the St. Lawrence Seaway. It comes into the Great Lakes. What happens? Four agencies of the Federal Government collect information on that ship. One agency determines whether the ship is carrying contraband. Another Federal agency checks whether the ship has paid its tariffs and fees. Another agency determines whether the ship and its crew comply with immigration law. And another agency checks for adherence to health and safety regulations. One ship, four different Federal agencies.  As currently planned, much of this information will end up in separate systems--some of them new and expensive. One of those, a $1.3 billion Customs Services project known as the automated commercial environment, is an import processing system. Another, the student exchange and visitor information system, is being developed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Other border protection is held on databases held by the Coast Guard and by the Department of Agriculture.  The new Transportation Security Administration also will collect and hold relevant information in its systems. Think of how many different agencies I have just mentioned are concerned about the one ship that we fear may be bringing the wrong people with the wrong cargo to threaten the United States.  Now reflect on this: None of these information technology systems are designed to communicate with one another, none of them. How in the world can we assure the American people of their safety when we are dealing with such archaic standards, when we are ignoring the most basic requirement--that these agencies work together and share information? This bill, 484 pages in length, ignores this challenge. We cannot ignore this challenge. Frankly, we have to respond because these divergent systems will ultimately need to be linked to the Homeland Security Department. We need to make certain there is a seamless interconnected system.  We have to ask key questions about the best way to ensure that the homeland security components communicate and share information with one another. By whom, when, how, and at what cost can the systems be linked. In addition, it is equally important to establish appropriate links between the Homeland Security Department and other agencies, particularly the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies.  Think about the ship coming into Lake Michigan from a foreign port and all of the questions that I just proposed. Would you not want to make certain that the FBI and the CIA had access to that information? In addition, the National Security Agency, Department of Defense, State Department, State and local officials, all of them could benefit by having access to that information. These links are needed because the Homeland Security Department will be inordinately dependent upon full and timely information exchange.  We cannot put a soldier or policeman on every corner in America and make this a safe nation. But what we can do is gather important information and share it so that it can be evaluated and coordinated and acted upon. That cannot happen with this bill as it currently stands before the Senate. This bill does not even envision that as a goal to be met. The status quo, which unfortunately this bill in many ways preserves, is not adequate to do the job.  At a June 26 Governmental Affairs Committee meeting focusing on the Department of Homeland Security in the intelligence community, I introduced the concept of ensuring interoperability, the communication of different computer systems in the Federal Government. I talked about the history of the Manhattan Project. My premise was if we are going to combine the intelligence resources and gathering of the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Justice, and the new Department of Homeland Security, would it not make common sense to establish a Manhattan Project when it comes to information technologies so all these agencies can communicate with one another, share information, and try to make the job more effective?  We have all this discussion on reorganization, but we are not facing the basic challenge. Given the current state of affairs in the Federal information technology systems, it is obvious we need to address the information technology issues that are raised as part of the new Manhattan Project.  Let me tell you about some of the current problems and challenges we face, if you wonder how we are going to make America safer against the threats of terrorism. Six years ago the U.S. Congress mandated the Immigration and Naturalization Service to establish a database to record visa holders exiting the United States. Understand the process. You are a foreign national and you want to come to the United States for any number of reasons--as a student, as a visitor, for some other reason. You go through the Immigration and Naturalization Service and a visa is offered to you through our consulates overseas. That is recorded. That is part of their database.  We then said to the INS we want you to make a record of those leaving theUnited States so we have, at any given time, an inventory of people who are visa holders in our country. It makes sense. If you don't do that, frankly, you are turning loose visa holders with no accountability as to whether they overstayed the legally permitted period for their visa or something else.  Six years ago we said to the INS, come up with a database that will record the exit dates of visa holders. We received a report a few months ago from the Director General that, despite 6 years of effort, the INS is unable and incapable of creating this database. Think about that for a second, about making America safer, about visa holders and people coming into this country. We have been unable in a 6-year period of time to establish that database.  Let me give you one other illustration. Both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service collect fingerprints. They, of course, do that in the course of law enforcement, in the course of people visiting the United States. Three years ago we said to these two agencies, the INS and the FBI, combine the fingerprint database. We want to know if you have a person who is a criminal suspect who also may be out of status with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. We want to put that information together into one single database of fingerprints available to law enforcement in the United States. Three years later, still it has not been done.  As we look at the challenges we face, it is one thing to move the boxes around on the chart, to talk about a new Department of Homeland Security with 170,000 employees, but it is quite another to make certain that when these employees sit down at their desks in their offices, they have computer capability to literally protect America. This bill does not address that.  This is our Department of Homeland Security. It is being given to us by the House, which will soon adjourn without any effort to address this challenge.  An article in the July 27 edition of Fortune magazine also ascribes such a styling to the concept, pointing out:       There is an abundance of breathtakingly versatile      technology available to counter the menace of terrorist      attacks at home. Now for the bad news: Computers are only as      smart as the bureaucrats who use them.  This is Fortune magazine speaking.       It may require a Manhattan Project of social engineering to      induce agencies that have traditionally viewed each other      mostly as rivals for budget dollars to reach out and hold      hands.  At the hearing which we held before the Government Affairs Committee, I asked several of our witnesses to comment. One of the witnesses was GEN Hughes, LTG Patrick Hughes, U.S. Army, retired, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, 1996 to 1999. I talked to him about what I have just said in my opening remarks here. Here is what he said--first replying. General Hughes said to me:       First, your characterization of this problem is, in my      view, right, but it is not about technology. The technology      to do the things that you are talking about wanting to do is      present and available. It is about parochial interests,      managing and constructing the technology for their own      purposes, as opposed to the synergistic, larger effect of      mission support across the government.  This man, who for 3 years had the responsibility in the Defense Intelligence Agency, knows what the problem is. He knows, unfortunately, that it is a problem that is not addressed by this Department of Homeland Security proposal. The amendment which I propose to create a Manhattan Project through the Department of Management and Budget had the bipartisan cosponsorship of Senator Lieberman, who was on the floor earlier, as well as Senator Thompson, who is here. It was added to the bill by unanimous consent of all members of committee. Section 171 of the committee-approved legislation requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a comprehensive enterprise architecture for information systems of agencies related to homeland security.  It calls for designating a key official at OMB, approved by the President, whose primary responsibility is to carry out the duties of the Director. This is our General Grove. This would be our Manhattan Project. The President would have the last word on this person and the responsibilities he would have to execute. OMB must make sure agencies implement the plan and regularly submit status and progress reports to Congress, as they should.  The enterprise architecture and resulting systems must be designed so they can achieve interoperability between and among Federal agencies responsible for homeland security and homeland defense, whether inside or adjunct to the new Department.  These systems must be capable of quick deployment. These must be readily upgraded with improved technologies. Effective security measures must be maintained as well.  The OMB director and Secretary of the new Department shall also facilitate interoperability between information systems of Federal, State, and local agencies responsible for homeland defense. This is a common complaint. I have heard it from the City of Chicago and other agencies across my home State, that the whole question of homeland security has to work its way down to the first responders at the local level, as does the information. This bill, sadly, does not address that because it does not include the amendment which I proposed in committee.  Enterprise architectures require systematically thinking through the relationship between operations and underlying information technologies. Used increasingly by industry and some governments, they can reduce redundancies, modernize operations, and improve program performance.  Historically, Federal agencies have developed information systems in what you call, euphemistically, parochial stovepipes with little or no thought about communication with other agencies. Agencies vital to homeland security are currently plagued by outdated technology, poor information security, and, unfortunately, not the necessary motivation to make the positive change.  An article appearing in this month's issue of Government Executive magazine captured the problem. Let me give you just a few words from that article, if I might. This is from Government Executive, September, 2002:       When a computer mistakes a 70-year-old black woman for a      28-year-old white man who is a triple murder suspect on the      FBI's terrorist group list, something is wrong with the      computer or the information inside it. The terrorist list on      which this person's name appeared is just one of more than 25      maintained by dozens of law enforcement, intelligence and      Defense Department agencies. Those lists are not integrated      and often are not shared. We must build a system of systems      that can provide the right information at all the right      times. Information will be shared horizontally, across each      level of government, and vertically among Federal, State, and      local government, private industry, and citizens.      Electronically tying together the more than 20 agencies to be      merged into a new Department will harness their security      capabilities, thereby making America safer.  It goes on to quote John Koskinin. He was the Federal Y2K chief brought to avert what we thought might be a computer crisis. He was asked to assess the challenge of bringing them together. I am for bringing them together. Here is a man who worked to analyze all the computers of the Federal Government and what he says is, I am afraid, chilling. I quote:       You'll never get your arms around it.  He believes placing all the security agency systems under one roof and building more systems will not make agencies communicate. He understands the challenge we face. This bill does not face that challenge and that, unfortunately, is a terrible shortcoming.  Interoperable information systems would permit efficient sharing of data and better communication. I have discussed this with a man I respect very much. Tom Ridge and I came to Congress in 1982, and we served many years together in the House. I was one who praised the President for choosing Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania as the first person to direct our homeland security operation. I called him on this issue. I explained to him what it was all about. Tom said to me, in his own words, he believed that what I am proposing here in this amendment would be a ``force multiplier.'' It would enhance our technology, enhance our ability to protect America.  This substitute which we have before us does not include that force multiplier. This substitute, unfortunately, falls short of utilizing the resources we have most effectively.  It scratches the surface by tasking an under secretary with ensuring informational systems compatibility. Yet there is no corresponding duty outside of this Department of Homeland Security with any other agency or any other director in government.  If there is a coordination of information technology within the Department of Homeland Security, there is no premise or promise that we are going to have this agency communicate with the CIA, with the FBI, with the Department of Defense, with the Department of State, and without that interoperability, we are missing this force multiplier. The amendment would make sense and fill the gap. It would give an overarching job to OMB for homeland security enterprise architectures.  I think we can all agree there is no one single magic silver bullet to protect America. But we have to strengthen our security. We have to use the information we collect and use it effectively.  When you take a look at the systems, we have to consider a recent challenge. On October 23 of this year--a few weeks ago--GovExec.com, an online news service, reported that the FBI ran into serious shortcomings in its effort to capture the Washington-area snipers. A system known as ``Rapid Start'' was set up at the investigation command center in Rockville, MD. Leads called in to the center and to hotlines were manually entered into a database which organized the information to try to find the snipers. They assigned investigators to follow up. According to the news article, Rapid Start--the computer system at the FBI--was never designed to handle the large volume of information and the 67,000 calls they received. The system was overwhelmed. What is even more compelling is that Rapid Start was created by the FBI as a way to avoid working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's existing computer system, the ``Automated Case Support System.'' The agents of the FBI had already determined the existing computer capability at the FBI could not handle the investigation to find two snipers in the Washington, DC area. The FBI's antiquated technology systems don't allow its agents to share information among field offices.  Let me give an illustration. The September 11 disaster occurred. Within a few hours, we collected photographs of the 19 suspected terrorists who we believed to be on those airplanes. The FBI, when they collected these photographs, communicated that information and these photos to their field offices.  How would you do that if you were at a home computer and you wanted to send a photograph to your grandson or your granddaughter? Virtually every computer system that is worth its salt has the capacity to transmit photographs. But not the computer system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They had to FedEx the photos of the suspects to their field offices because the computer system couldn't transmit photographs.  Think about that. Would you buy a computer system if you were a law enforcement agency that couldn't do that? That is a fact today.  The Automated Case Support System that Rapid Start was built to circumvent was blamed for the loss of 4,000 documents in the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City bombing.  According to a recent article, only in recent months did the FBI start a computer system through a project known as Trilogy. It is starting to replace obsolete desktops. I have been talking about this for a long time. This committee has tried to address it. We did address it with a bipartisan amendment agreed to by Senator Lieberman, Senator Thompson, Republicans and Democrats in the committee. We put it in the bill. But it is not in this bill that has come over to us from the House of Representatives.  What I am proposing to my colleagues on the Senate floor is this: Please let us depoliticize this issue. Why in the world should this became a partisan matter? The computers of this government are going to serve all of the citizens. No one is going to be able to have bragging rights--Democrats or Republicans, or anyone of any other political stripe. It is a question of whether we are going to put in place the resources and tools and weapons we need to fight terrorism.  The amendment which I am about to propose as a second-degree amendment would do just that. It would take the exact language from the Governmental Affairs Committee on a bipartisan basis, put it in this bill, and give us a chance to establish interoperability and enterprise architecture across the Federal Government.  How in the world can we pass this legislation without doing that? How can we leave Washington and say to America, ``Sleep safely. You know the terrorist threats are there. We are doing everything we can''? We are not.  This 484-page bill fails in one of the most basic challenges. It does not challenge us to establish the very best in computer technology for the Federal Government. The fact of the matter is our current system doesn't even measure up to the most basic standards of requirements of computers and computer basics across America. Shouldn't we bring to the American people the very best in computer technology to protect our Nation, our families, our children? That, I think, is what is at stake here.  I implore my colleagues. I understand what is going on here. We were told the House will leave town, we will get this 484-page bill, don't change a period, a comma, or a single word--no amendments, take it or leave it--and we are going home. That isn't good. That really isn't good.  I think the Senate has a responsibility. We can identify the glaring omissions from this bill--and one that ultimately has to be corrected. But in the months before we return, while this problem still festers and looms, we are not going to be protecting America as much as we should. We will not be providing the American people the kind of defense against terrorism which they deserve. We will not be using the best resources of our government and technology to make America safer.  I am hoping my colleagues will consider this amendment and give it the same type of bipartisan approval they did in the Governmental Affairs Committee.                Amendment No. 4906 to Amendment No. 4902  I would like to offer the amendment which I filed with the clerk as a second-degree amendment to the pending Lieberman amendment.
