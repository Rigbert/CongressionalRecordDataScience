Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would say to the gentleman from Akron, Ohio (Mr. Sawyer), thank you so very much. The gentleman was mayor of Ohio long before he was elected to this Congress and understands the importance of this program. He took time from a markup in another committee to be here this morning. We thank him so very, very much for his leadership and interest on this issue.
