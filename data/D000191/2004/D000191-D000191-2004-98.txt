Speaker, as we pause to commemorate Memorial Day and remember all those who have proudly served our nation, I am pleased that we will finally dedicate the long-overdue World War II Memorial here in Washington, D.C. Now Congress should re-dedicate itself to improved services and benefits for our veterans and our troops and future veterans.  Since the fighting began in Iraq last year, nearly 800 American service men and women have died. It is my solemn privilege and honor to name the casualties from my district.  Specialist Joseph M. Blickenstaff, U.S. Army, Sergeant Travis A. Moothart, U.S. Army, Specialist Nathan W. Nakis, Oregon National Guard, Lance Corporal Gary F. VanLeuven, U.S. Marines, Specialist Chase R. Witham, U.S. Army.  In gratitude and in sorrow, I commemorate their courage and sacrifice. They chose to serve and served honorably and well. It is now our duty to keep these men in our hearts and in our memories as we celebrate the joy of living free and strong.
