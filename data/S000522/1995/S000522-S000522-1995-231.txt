Mr. Speaker, less than 1 month has passed since the President extended most-favored-nation trading status once again to the People's Republic of China. Ignoring the tragic human rights record of China, the huge trade imbalance, the on-going pirating of intellectual properties, the forced abortion policy and the exporting of nuclear technology to rogue nations, Mr. Clinton rewarded the Chinese leaders while turning his back on the millions of Chinese who are imprisoned, tortured, persecuted, forced into slavery, and have their voices silenced, some even before they are born.  Mr. Clinton believes that granting MFN to China will encourage the Chinese leadership to improve their human rights record. It didn't work last year. And it's not going to work this year, either.  Case in point: On June 19, 1995, Harry Wu, a United States citizen, was arrested as he entered China.  Harry Wu is well known to many of us here in Washington. A former political prisoner in China for 19 years, Harry has tirelessly worked to expose China's human rights abuses--the extensive prison labor system, the backbone of China's export industry; the trafficking of body parts of prisoners for transplants and research--uncovering the numerous products manufactured in the slave labor camps which are being sold in the United States.  Knowing that each time he returned to China to investigate human rights abuses he put himself in danger, Harry continued to go back remembering those millions who, like he, suffered, or like his brother, died at the hands of the Chinese Government and military.  Harry has been a stellar, informative, persuasive witness at several congressional committee hearings. Once, when asked about why he placed his life at risk to expose the horrors of China's prison labor system he responded: ``I really want to forget the nightmares of the past period, but, you know, some things simply didn't go away. So, like a bad dream, they refuse to disappear.  ``Finally, I got a chance to tell the truth to the world.  ``I am a survivor. I think I have a responsibility to those inmates who are still there.''  Today Harry Wu is not free. His whereabouts are unknown. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing was not informed of his arrest until June 23--4 days after the arrest.  A U.S. Embassy spokesperson claims that the delay in notification was the result of poor communications. Another spokesperson said that the Embassy and Chinese officials were discussing sending a representative to visit Harry.  Ten days have passed since Harry Wu, a United States citizen, was arrested in China. How much longer will he have to wait for the U.S. Government to respond? How long will the discussions take? And in the meantime, what will happen to Harry Wu?  Mr. Speaker, I have sat with Harry Wu in my own office many times hearing of the unspeakable conditions under which the Chinese people live while their leaders are rewarded year after year after year. It distresses me greatly to think that Harry is not free, may be tortured, and that the administration is moving so slowly to respond to his need.  Mr. Speaker, I call on the Clinton administration to move swiftly to make contact with Harry Wu and to obtain his release. I urge my colleagues to do the same. The administration may at this point be accustomed to turning its back on the people of China. We cannot allow them to become accustomed to ignoring innocent Americans in foreign prisons.  I also urge my colleagues to sign the letter to Jiang Zemin calling for the release of Harry Wu.  Soon the House will take up the disapproval of MFN for China. Some of us might be tempted to put trade, money, over human rights and dignity. Some of us might believe that criticizing China for human rights abuses is interfering with the internal matters of a foreign government. I do not.  Today an innocent United States citizen is being detained in China. What more needs to happen? We cannot ignore this. It should offend every Member of this body that while the administration rewards the Chinese Government, that government responds by arresting a United States citizen.  Harry Wu has been a voice for the voiceless crying out for truth and justice. Now his voice has been silenced, and I pray that silence is only temporary. We must raise our voices loudly and clearly to the Chinese Government. Harry Wu must be released and the Chinese Government must be held accountable for this affront against the United States.                          ____________________
