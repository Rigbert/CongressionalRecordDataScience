President, I have voiced my great disappointment many times with how the Telecommunications Act of 1966 is costing consumers millions of dollars.  I complained about this at the time that Act passed, and continue to be concerned that Vermonters are being taken to the cleaners.  I was one of five Senators to vote against that bill. I thought it was clear then, and it should be clear by now to everyone, that the Telecommunications bill means higher costs for consumers.  As other hi-tech industries, such as computer technology, offer lower and lower prices over time--the telephone and cable TV industries are presenting consumers with higher and higher charges.  For example, I am mad as heck that pay phone charges in Vermont went up to 35 cents--from 10 cents.  But what annoys me more is that if I do not have exact change--if I use two quarters--the change the phone company keeps is more than the ten cents the call used to cost.  I have been know to say ``keep the change'' in restaurants, or when I buy a newspaper.  But I do not like phone companies taking my change. I am fed up with pay phone service providers nickel and diming consumers.  This bill will make phone companies provide change to consumers at the pay phone--or provide a credit in the amount of the lost change to the consumer or to states to be used to help consumers.  My bill will also give the FCC broad powers to give states authority to control pay phone rates, if necessary.  The bill permits pay phone providers in Vermont to issue a credit whenchange is not provided to the consumer which would go to Vermont. This means that Vermont could provide better pay phone service for public safety or health reasons.  For example, this fund could be used by states to provide better pay phone service to those with disabilities, or those living in nursing homes. It would provide funding for pay phones to be placed in remote areas in case of emergencies.  I would rather this change go directly to the consumer, and believe when this bill is fully implemented that most consumers will not be overcharged for calls.  In the meantime, however, I would rather have the change used to benefit Vermonters than go to the phone companies.  There are over 2 million pay phones in the United States. The Washington Post explained on Monday that if 75 percent of those pay phones charge 35 cents for a local call and if just one person a day overpays 15 cents at each of those phones, companies would get more than $230,000 extra a day, or about $7 million a month.  My guess is that this hugely underestimates the size of this windfall.  Keep in mind this windfall, in Vermont, is on top of the raise from 10 cents to 35 cents. I have also noticed fewer and fewer phone booths except at places such as airports or train stations where consumers are in a hurry and may not have time to track down change.  My bill goes beyond just keeping phone companies from getting windfall profits. It calls for a national investigation of monopoly pricing and price gouging in the pay telephone markets.  It goes further than that--it then gives the Federal Communications Commission the tough new authority to deal with this problem. It allows them to give states the right to establish rates for local calls if necessary to stop this overcharging. Remember, when Vermont was in charge before the Telecommunications Act passed the pay phone rates were a dime.  My bill will also encourage the development of new technologies so that consumers are not overcharged for local phone calls to begin with.  My bill also provides funding--and the money comes from telephone companies not consumers--for public interest pay phones. These are phones which the FCC has determined each state should provide to its citizens in areas where there otherwise might not be a phone. They did this in a decision issued on October 7, 1996.  This was a good idea--but there is no federal funding to implement the decision.  In addition, it is uneconomic for a phone company to provide a pay phone in remote areas of Vermont. But in a roadside emergency these phones could be vital. My bill would provide for this program using money that now just goes out of your pockets to the phone companies.  Also, public interest pay phones could be placed in nursing homes, emergency homeless shelters, emergency rooms in hospitals, and other similar places.  Emergency 911 calls would be free from these phones, and other calls would cost but at least there would be a phone in a location where there otherwise might not be one.  What is best about this approach is that Vermont would decide how to use this funding that now goes directly into the coffers of phone companies.  I have also designed the bill in a way that prevents phone companies from trying to take advantage of this situation.  The bill gives the FCC board powers to ensure that the pay phone providers ``do not pass any costs relating to such compliance to consumers.''  It also mandates that the FCC monitor this situation and ensure that implementation does not result in any reduction in pay phone service.  The bill requires that pay phone companies which charge more than 10 cents for local phone calls provide either cash change or other alternatives to consumers, or credits to states equal to the value of the unpaid change.  These credits to states would be used by states for telecommunications activities that promote the public interest, such as safety, health, emergency services, or education and promote public interest pay phones in hospitals, schools, emergency homeless shelters, facilities for the disabled, and at similar types of locations.  The bill directs the FCC, within one year of the bill's enactment, to issue proposed rules that apply to pay phone providers that charge more than 10 cents for local pay phone calls. Companies would have to provide for cash change or automatically credit the appropriate public service agency in the respective states to account for instances in which change is not provided at the pay phone.  The bill requires that the FCC ensure that pay phone providers do not pass any costs of compliance with this bill on to consumers and that pay phone providers in no way reduce or limit service based on this anti-windfall requirement.  The FCC is given major new powers to take action to prevent any price gouging including giving states back the authority to regulate the price of local calls.  The bill requires that small stickers or other notice be posted on pay phones for the purpose of advising consumers when cash change will not be provided.  The bill directs the FCC to reconsider its rules under which the FCC removed authority from states to regulate the charge for local calls made over pay phones. The FCC would reexamine the need for states to have greater decision making roles where local competition between pay phone providers is not present.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1928       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Pay Telephone      Protection Act of 1998''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Some payphone service providers have increased the      charge for the use of a coin-operated pay telephone for a      local call to 35 cents but have not put into place a system      for providing change to users of such telephones for amounts      deposited in such telephones in excess of such charge.       (2) Payphone service providers should charge pay telephone      users only for the actual time of use of pay telephones.       (3) Most consumers, if given a choice, would prefer that      any amount of such excess deposits that are not refunded to      consumers be used for pay telephones for public health,      safety, and welfare purposes rather than have such excess      deposits accrue to the financial benefit of payphone service      providers.       (4) There are approximately 2,000,000 pay telephones in the      United States, and payphone service providers accrue      substantial revenue at the expense of Americans who do not      have the exact amount of the charge for their use.       (5) A decision of the Federal Communications Commission to      deregulate the provision of payphone service was premature      and did not address adequately the need for local competition      that would benefit users of pay telephones.       (6) The decision of the Commission does not promote the      widespread deployment of affordable payphone service that      would benefit the general public, nor does the decision      promote the widespread deployment of public interest      telephones.       (7) The use of coin-operated pay telephones represents an      increasing commercial activity that substantially affects      interstate commerce.       (8) Public interest telephones should be maintained in each      State and should be provided to promote the public safety,      health, and welfare.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is--       (1) to require payphone service providers--       (A) to provide cash change to pay telephone users who      deposit amounts for local telephone calls in excess of the      amounts charged for such calls; or       (B) in the event that such providers do not provide such      change, to transfer amounts equal to such change to      appropriate State entities for public interest purposes      related to telephone service;       (2) to encourage such changes in pay telephone technology      as are needed to assure that payphone service providers--       (A) do not overcharge pay telephone users who do not have      the exact amount of the charge for local pay telephone calls;      and       (B) do not charge pay telephone users for any time in which      pay telephones are not actually in use; and       (3) to require the Federal Trade Commission to determine--       (A) whether dysfunctions exist in the market for payphone      service including locational monopolies in which the size of      the market concerned results in the availability of payphone      service from a single provider; and       (B) whether rates for coin-operated pay telephones for      local telephone calls are market based.     SEC. 3. PUBLIC INTEREST PAY TELEPHONES.       Section 276(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47      U.S.C. 276(b)(2)) is amended to read as follows:       ``(2) Public interest pay telephones.--       ``(A) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress      that--       ``(i) in the interest of the public health, safety, and      welfare, public interest pay telephones should be available      and maintained in locations where there would not otherwise      likely be a pay telephone; and       ``(ii) such public interest pay telephones should be fairly      and equitably supported.       ``(B) Use of funds.--In accordance with such regulations as      the Commission shall prescribe, each State agency that      receives amounts under subsection (c)(2)(A) shall use such      amounts to promote or otherwise support the installation,      maintenance, and use of public interest pay telephones,      including specially designed payphones for the disabled and      the provision of payphone service in remote locations,      nursing homes, emergency homeless shelters, hospitals,      facilities that assist the disabled, schools, and other      appropriate locations determined by the State agency      concerned.''.
