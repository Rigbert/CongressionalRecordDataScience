Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.  This is not a technical amendment. Taking money from children to give tax breaks to the rich is not a technicality.  That is what this amendment does--it takes $65 billion from the disabled, the poor, and the children so that we can give $125 billion to our Nation's richest 1 percent. The American people do not want this. They do not want us betraying our children to pay for tax cuts for the rich.  But that is what we are doing today--we are betraying our children. Not just the children who will be cut off welfare--or do without a school lunch--to pay for the Republican tax cut. But all the children who will grow up to see an exploding deficit--a deficit that exploded because we stole our children's education and food to provide tax cuts for the rich.  The Republican proposal kicks 6 million children off welfare. It kicks a quarter million disabled children off. It cuts money for milk for 1.6 million infants.  And why must we kick so many kids off? To pay for the $320 billion tax cut for those with six figure incomes. To pay for the $125 billion dollar tax cut for the richest 1 percent of Americans.  The Republicans should be forthcoming about what they are doing. This so-called technical amendment states that they are taking $65 billion from children to give to the rich. Do not hide the facts in a technical amendment. Stand up for what you believe in.  I urge my colleagues to reject this so-called technical amendment. For those who do support this amendment, I have a request. Come clean. Lay your cards on the table--face up. You support taking $65 billion from children so that you can give it to the rich.
