Mr. Chairman, presently there is no formal international agreement defining a biosphere reserve--no treaty, no convention, no compact, no protocol--not one. Nor is there any domestic legislation authorizing and implementing the biosphere reserve program--none whatsoever. A biosphere reserve is an ambiguous concept in the field of international relations and lacks any legal definition in U.S. law.  Forty-seven biosphere reserves have been created in the United States with virtually no congressional oversight, no hearings, and no legislative authority. Congress is not notified when a biosphere reserve nomination is under consideration--nor is there any requirement to do so.  At a hearing held in March 1995 by the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations, Congressman Nethercutt asked witnesses from the National Park Service, ``Are there any more biosphere reserves to be designated at this time that you know of?'' Mr. Kennedy, then Director of the Park Service replied, ``No sir.''  Yet, we now know that: Plans were well underway to designate the Ozark Highlands Biosphere Reserve and that the National Park Service was a prime force behind this effort.  The National Park Service applied for a grant in late 1994 or early 1995 from the U.S. Man and Biosphere Program--approved the following May--for ``Elevation of Isle Royale Biosphere Reserve to Fully Functional Status.'' According to the grant description, the project would develop a Lake Superior protected areas directory, and this would be the first U.S. step toward designation of additional protected areas and community partnerships in the Lake Superior binational region. In other words, this grant was for a study to expand the Isle Royale Biosphere Reserve.  Expansion of the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve to include 11 counties in West Virginia was--and still is--under consideration.  The current system for implementing these programs has eaten away at the power and sovereignty of the Congress to exercise its constitutional power to make the laws that govern lands belonging to the United States.  The public and local governments are never consulted about creating biosphere reserves. On October 7, 1997, during debate on H.R. 901, ``The American Land Sovereignty Protection Act,'' opponents kept saying that biosphere reserves were designated at the request of local communities. They seem to believe that if they keep repeating the mantra that ``biosphere reserves are created at the request of local communities'' often enough, then somehow it will prove to be true. The Committee on Resources has now held three hearings on this issue and has yet to find one example where a biosphere reserve designation was requested by a broad-based cross-section of either the public or local officials. On the contrary, the committee has found that biosphere reserve designation efforts are almost always driven by Federal agencies and often face strong local opposition whether in New York, Arkansas, New Mexico, or Alaska.  Once again, biosphere reserves are designated with little or no input from the public or local government. They are very unpopular. In the few cases where the local citizenry has become aware of a pending biosphere reserve designation, the designation has been strongly opposed. Proposed biosphere reserve nominations for the Catskill Mountains in New York, the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas and Missouri, and for Voyageurs National Park and Boundary Waters Wilderness in Minnesota were defeated by an aroused local citizenry. The Alaska and Colorado State Legislatures have passed resolutions supporting H.R. 901, and the Kentucky senate passed a resolution opposing the biosphere reserve program, particularly in Kentucky. I would like to include these resolutions in the Record.  I also wish to include in the Record a recent column, entitled ``Protected Global Soil?,'' which appeared recently in the Washington Times. I urge my colleagues to read the resolutions and this important commentary.        A Resolution--in the Legislature of the State of Alaska       Relating to supporting the ``American Land Sovereignty      Protection Act.''       Be it resolved by the legislature of the State of Alaska:       Whereas, the United Nations has designated 67 sites in the      United States as ``World Heritage Sites'' or ``Biosphere      Reserves,'' which altogether are about equal in size to the      State of Colorado, the eighth largest state; and       Whereas, art. IV, sec. 3, United States Constitution,      provides that the United States Congress shall make all      needed regulations governing lands belonging to the United      States; and       Whereas, many of the United Nations' designations include      private property inholdings and contemplate ``buffer zones''      of adjacent land; and       Whereas, some international land designations such as those      under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man      and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific,      Educational, and Culture Organization operate under      independent national committees such as the United States      National Man and Biosphere Committee that have no legislative      directives or authorization from the Congress, and       Whereas, these international designations as presently      handled are an open invitation to the international community      to interfere in domestic economies and land use decisions;      and       Whereas, local citizens and public officials concerned      about job creation and resource based economies usually have      no say in the designation of land near their homes for      inclusion in an international land use program; and       Whereas, former Assistant Secretary of the Interior George      T. Frampton, Jr., and the President used the fact that      Yellowstone National Park had been designated as a ``World      Heritage Site'' as justification for intervening in the      environmental impact statement process and blocking possible      development of an underground mine on private land in Montana      outside of the park; and       Whereas, a recent designation of a portion of Kamchatka as      a ``World Heritage Site'' was followed immediately by efforts      from environmental groups to block investment insurance for      development projects on Kamchatka that are supported by the      local communities; and       Whereas, environmental groups and the National Park Service      have been working to establish an International Park, a World      Heritage Site, and a marine Biosphere Reserve covering parts      of western Alaska, eastern Russia, and the Bering Sea; and       Whereas, as occurred in Montana, such designations could be      used to block development projects on state and private land      in western Alaska; and       Whereas, foreign companies and countries could use such      international designations in western Alaska to block      economic development that they perceive as competition; and       Whereas, animal rights activists could use such      international designations to generate pressure to harass or      block harvesting of marine mammals by Alaska Natives; and       Whereas, such international designations could be used to      harass or block any commercial activity, including pipelines,      railroads, and power transmission lines; and       Whereas, the President and the executive branch of the      United States have, by Executive Order and other agreements,      implemented these designations without approval by the      Congress, and       Whereas, actions by the President in applying international      agreements to lands owned by the United States may circumvent      the Congress; and       Whereas, Congressman Don Young introduced House Resolution      No. 901 in the 105th Congress entitled the ``American Lands      Sovereignty Protection Act of 1997'' that required the      explicit approval of the Congress prior to restricting any      use of United States land under international agreements; be      it       Resolved, that the Alaska State Legislature supports the      ``American Lands Sovereignty Protection Act'' that reaffirms      the constitutional authority of the Congress as the elected      representatives of the people over the federally owned land      of the United States.                                                                         ____                Memorial 0111--House of Representatives       Under clause 4 of Rule XXII, a memorial of the following      title was presented, as follows:       By the Speaker: A memorial of the General Assembly of the      State of Colorado, relative to House Joint Resolution 97-1032      showing that the State of Colorado supports the legislation,      which reaffirms the Constitutional Authority of Congress as      the elected representatives of the people, and urges the      ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act'' be introduced      and passed by both the House of Representatives and the      Senate, as soon as possible during the 105th Congressional      session.       Referred to the Committee on Resources. June 3, 1997.                House Joint Resolution 97-1032--ColoradoBy representatives Entz, Arrington, Epps, Pankey, Paschall, and Young;      also senators Duke, Arnold, Congrove, Mutzebaugh, and Powers.       Whereas, The United Nations has designated sixty-seven      sites in the United States as ``World Heritage Sites'' or      ``Biosphere Reserves'', which altogether are about equal in      size to the State of Colorado, the eighth largest state; and       Whereas, Section 3 of Article IV of the United States      Constitution provides that the United States Congress shall      make all needed rules and regulations governing lands      belonging to the United States; and       Whereas, Many of the United Nations designations include      private property inholdings and contemplate ``buffer zones''      of adjacent land; and       Whereas, Some international land designations, such as      those under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and      the Man and Biosphere Program of the United Nations      Scientific, Educational, and Cultural Organization, operate      under independent national committees, such as the United      States National Man and Biosphere Committee, which have no      legislative directives or authorization from Congress; and       Whereas, These international designations, as presently      handled, are an open invitation to the international      community to interfere in domestic land use decisions; and       Whereas, Local citizens and public officials usually have      no say in the designation of land near their homes for      inclusion in an international land use program; and       Whereas, The President and Executive Branch of the United      States have, by Executive Order and other agreements, and      implemented these designations without the approval of      Congress; and       Whereas, Actions by the President in applying international      agreements to lands owned by the United States may circumvent      Congress; and       Whereas, In the 105th Congress, Congressman Don Young      introduced HR-901, entitled the ``American Land Sovereignty      Act'', to protect American public and private lands from      jurisdictional encroachments by certain United Nations      programs, and such resolution has been referred to the      Resource Committee with 77 cosponsors; now, therefore,       Be It Resolved by the House of Representatives of the      Sixty-first General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the      Senate concurring herein:       That the State of Colorado supports this legislation, which      reaffirms the Constitutional Authority of Congress as the      elected representatives of the people, and urges the      ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act'' be introduced      and passed by both the House of Representatives and the      Senate as soon as possible during the 105th Congressional      session.       Be It Further Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be      sent to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the      House of Representatives of the United States Congress and to      each member of the Congressional delegation from Colorado.     Charles E. Berry,       Speaker of the House of Representatives.     Tom Norton,       President of the Senate.     Judith Rodrigue,       Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives.     Joan M.

Williams, and G. Williams introduced the      following resolution which was ordered to be printed.       Introduced and adopted (voice vote) May 29, 1997.       A resolution opposing the Biosphere Reserves designation of      the Man and the Biosphere Program and urging that the      proposed Biodiversity Treaty not be ratified by the United      States.       Whereas, the United Nations has promoted a Biosphere      Program throughout the world; and       Whereas, the Biosphere Program threatens to place millions      of acres of land under the control of United Nations via      agreements and/or executive orders; and       Whereas, the United Nations Cultural, Educational, and      Scientific Organization (UNESCO) has created a worldwide      system of 328 Biosphere Reserves in 82 nations; and       Whereas, 47 United Nations-designated Biosphere Reserves      are within the sovereign borders of the United States, and      two United Nations-designated Biosphere Reserves are within      the Commonwealth of Kentucky; and       Whereas, neither the legislature of the Commonwealth of      Kentucky nor the Congress of the United States has      considered, debated, or approved such designations; and       Whereas, such designations require strict land use      management procedures as are set forth in the 1994 Strategic      Plan for the United States man and the Biosphere Program, as      published by the United States State Department, and further      described in the Global Biodiversity Assessment, published by      the United Nations Environment Program, expressly for the      Conferences of the Parties to the Convention on Biological      Diversity; and       Whereas, Biosphere Reserves are, by definition, designed to      continually expand each of the three zones: core protected      zone, buffer zone, and zone of cooperation; and       Whereas, Biosphere Reserves are expected to be the nucleus      of the system of protected areas required by Article 8 of the      Convention on Biological Diversity as expressed in the      minutes of the first meeting of the Conference of the      Parties; and       Whereas, no land owner within reach or potential reach of      the Biosphere Reserves has input or recourse to land use      management policies of UNESCO or the Conference of the      Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity; and       Whereas, no body of elected officials, whether local,      state, or federal, has input, recourse, or veto power over      such land use management policies that may be prescribed by      either UNESCO or the Conference of the Parties to the      Convention on Biological Diversity; and       Whereas, even though the Convention on Biological Diversity      has not been ratified by the United States Senate, the very      presence of United Nations Biosphere Reserves on     American soil demonstrates the compliance with an      international treaty that has not been ratified; and       Whereas, the use of land in biosphere areas for ordinary      commercial or agriculture purposes may be severely restricted      or eliminated; and       Whereas, the Mammoth Cave area and the Land Between the      Lakes area have already been designated as Biosphere      Reserves; and       Whereas, none of the current areas included within the      Biosphere Program in Kentucky have been included at the      request of or with the consent of the General Assembly of the      Commonwealth of Kentucky; and       Whereas, the General Assembly does not believe that a      request from the National Park Service or a tourist and      convention service should be adequate to subject land in      Kentucky to the control of the United Nations or any other      foreign parties; and       Whereas, the areas encompassed by these reserves included      not only public, but private, lands; and       Whereas, the placing of environmental or other restrictions      upon the use of private lands has been held by a number of      recent United States Supreme Court decisions to constitute a      taking of the land for public purposes; and       Whereas, the proposed Biodiversity Treaty, if ratified by      the United States, would ultimately lead to the reality that      Kentuckians could not use their private and public lands in      the manner to which they have been accustomed; and       Whereas, there are no proposals either to purchase the      private lands by the United States or the United Nations; and       Whereas, the restrictions contemplated together with the      outside control of the land encompassed by a Biosphere      Reserve constitutes an unlawful taking of that land in      violation of the Constitution of the United States, to wit:       Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, before any state lands can      be purchased, the consent of the state legislature and not      the state executive branch, must be obtained.       Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2, we note that, ``[N]othing      in this Constitution shall be construed as to Prejudice any      Claims of the United States, or of any particular state.''       Article IV, Section 4, we note that, ``The United States      shall guarantee to every State in this union a Republican      Form of Government.''       Amendment V of the Constitution of the United States, ``nor      [shall any person] be deprived of life, liberty, or property,      without due process of law, nor shall private property be      taken for public use, without just compensation''; and       Whereas, the virtual ceding of these lands to the United      Nations leaves the residents who own the land, local      governments, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky without any      legitimate form for redress of grievances for input into any      decision-making process relating to the Biosphere Reserve;      and       Whereas, under Article VI of the Constitution of the United      States, this treaty would be given equal footing with the      Constitution of the United States, thus effectively      precluding any legal means of redress; and       Whereas, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of      Kentucky does not wish to have portions of its land area      controlled by foreign minions over which it has no control      and who are not subject to its laws;       Now, Therefore; Be it       Resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the      Commonwealth of Kentucky:       Section 1. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of      Kentucky is unalterably opposed to the inclusion of any land      within the borders of the Commonwealth within the purview of      the Biodiversity Treaty or any biodiversity program without      the express consent of the General Assembly of the      Commonwealth of Kentucky, as provided by the Constitution of      the United States and the Constitution of Kentucky.       Section 2. The General Assembly urges the members of the      Congress of the United States, and especially the Kentucky      delegation to the Congress of the United States, to oppose      ratification of this treaty and the inclusion of any land      within the Commonwealth of Kentucky in any biosphere program      of the United Nations.       Section 3. The Clerk of the Senate is hereby directed to      transmit copies of this Resolution to the Honorable Bill      Clinton, President, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington,      D.C. 20500; the Honorable Madeleine K. Albright, 2201 ``C''      Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20520; the Honorable Wendell      H. Ford, 173A Russell Senate Office Building, Washington,      D.C. 20510; the Honorable Mitch McConnell, 361A Russell      Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20510; the Honorable      Ed Whitfield, 236 Cannon House Office Building, Washington,      D.C. 20515; the Honorable Ron Lewis, 412 Cannon House Office      Building, Washington, D.C. 20515; the Honorable Anne Northup,      1004 Longworth Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515; the      Honorable Jim Bunning, 2437 Rayburn House Office Building,      Washington, D.C. 20515; the Honorable Harold Rogers, 2468      Rayburn Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515; and the      Honorable Scotty Baesler, 113 Cannon House Office Building,      Washington, D.C. 20515.                                                                         ____               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 12, 1997]                         Protected Global Soil?                    (By David Rothbard/Craig Rucker)       Whether it be the Grand Canyon, Statue of Liberty, or Taj      Mahal, there are many places of natural and cultural interest      on the Earth. Of this, there can be no doubt. The question of      how to preserve these treasures, however, is very much open      to debate.       The United Nations, through its Man and the Biosphere (MAB)      and World Heritage Sites (WHS) programs, believes      international cooperation--or a collectivist approach--is the      best solution. But among a growing number of skeptics, these      programs are not only unnecessary, but may actually be a way      for Green utopians and international bureaucrats to chip away      at national sovereignty and shut down any important natural      resource developments they may oppose. And despite House      passage last Wednesday of the American Land Sovereignty Act      proposed by Rep. Don Young, Alaska Republican, this is not a      controversy that's likely to be put to rest any time soon.       The first major concern surrounding these global patches of      protected soil is the issue of sovereignty. The United      Nations, in its publications and official statements, strains      its vocal cords trying to tell the world that national      sovereignty is not at risk. But while this may be true on      paper, many observers see the process as the proverbial      camel's nose under the tent by which the U.N. can get sites      established now and worry about expanding the scope of its      authority later.       And even in establishing these sites, there is serious      question about the openness of the process, since over the      last decade the story of biospheres and WHS's, at least in      the United States, is not one of local involvement and input      from elected representatives, but rather, secrecy, deception,      and political maneuvering of agencies within the executive      branch of our own government.       When hearings were recently held on Capitol Hill concerning      the bill introduced by Mr. Young, witness after witness came      forth to testify to this very fact. From Arkansas, citizens      like Betty Beaver lambasted efforts to establish 55,000      square miles of the Ozark Highlands as a biosphere reserve,      claiming it was all done ``under cover of darkness'' and      pointing to actual MAB documents stating that citizens ``were      not to be introduced to the MAB by name'' and that ``there      should be no press conference or large public meetings      because they encourage polarized views before the story can      be told in an objective, nonthreatening manner.''       And in perhaps the most infamous of these controversies to      date, involving Yellowstone National Park, witnesses spoke      about how without precedent, Green bigwigs within our own      Interior department invited U.N. bureaucrats to come out and      ``inspect'' Yellowstone at taxpayer expense, urged them to      declare the park a WHS ``in danger,'' and thus effectively      put the kibosh on a proposed gold mine that was to be sited      three miles outside the area.       As seen at Yellowstone, the other major concern swirling      around this global debate is the way biospheres and WHSs are      being used by environmental extremists as a convenient way to      attack what raises their blood pressure most--namely,      industrial and economic development.       The situation playing out in Kamchatka, Russia, where the      collapse of the old Soviet system has left many of the area's      residents hungry and unemployed, is one such example. Here,      the prospect of major gold and mineral mining in the region      was met with understandable enthusiasm.       But environmentalists, led by the Environmental Defense      Fund and the Sierra Club, opposed any development of the      region from the get-go, and pushed the U.N. to establish a      WHS around the volcanoes of Kamchatka. Over the pleas of the      people, they did this in December of 1996, seriously      jeopardizing the project's future and prompting one Russian      official to say, ``the attitude of the pro-environmentalists      shows criminal disrespect for human life. . . .Our children      have to starve and freeze. . .[while] environmentalists      resort to falsification of facts and distortion of      information.''       In the Bering Strait off Alaska, efforts are under way to      establish the Bering Land WHS, which would not only threaten      nearly one-quarter of all U.S. coal reserves, but also the      world's largest zinc mine. Near the Taj Mahal in India, some      292 industrial plants may have to shut down for allegedly      harming that WHS. And in Australia, the push is on to create      the Lake Eyre Basin WHS that would severely restrict grazing      and threaten property values over an astounding 35 percent of      the entire nation.       So are biospheres and WHS's really something to fret about?      Well it's true that no national sovereignty has yet been      officially abridged, but environmentalists are already able      to exert undue influence simply through the public-relations      angle of this whole business. And it's not that much of a      stretch of the imagination to see how the Greens could very      soon argue on behalf of more sharptoothed international      regulations, like they successfully did on ozone depletion      and are currently attempting on global warming.       Clearly, this is one issue on which the American people,      and the people of the whole world for that matter, ought to      keep a keen eye.                               ____________________
