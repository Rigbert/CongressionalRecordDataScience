President, I take this opportunity to thank so many people who were significant in the passage of this legislation. First, let me recognize Senator Hutchison, the ranking member, for her valuable contributions throughout. Also, and gladly, I not only welcome back Senator Johnson but recognize that as chairman of this committee, we communicated. He was very influential in the final outcome of the legislation. I not only welcome him back, but I gladly and joyfully give him the reins of the subcommittee so that the next time this bill comes to the floor, Senator Tim Johnson will be managing it, and I will be proud to be working with him.  I particularly want to thank staff members who made such a huge and critical contribution to this effort: Christina Evans, B.G. Wright, Chad Schulken, and Elizabeth King from my staff; and from the minority staff: Dennis Balkham, Chris Heggem, and Yvonne Stone.  I thank all my colleagues who cooperated so willingly and effectively.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
