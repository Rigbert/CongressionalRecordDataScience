Mr. Speaker, today I rise to introduce a bill to extend by 15 years the only remaining long-term contract for timber on the Tongass National Forest. The extension was requested by the both Houses of the Alaska State Legislature. It is supported by Alaska's Governor. Democrats and Republicans in Alaska are behind the 15 year extension.  Some may remember that there were two long-term timber contracts when this House last passed the Tongass Timber Reform Act. There should be two contracts, but at the urging of environmental extremists, the Clinton administration breached one and canceled it in 1994.  This bill is not the ultimate answer to the problems of the Tongass, problems with which this body has dealt too often.  Many may know that I introduced a bill last year that could give power and control over the Tongass to the State of Alaska, but the bill I introduce today is no substitute for H.R. 2413. Ultimately, the Federal political process, Federal bureaucrats, and Federal actions are no way to guide the management of treasures like the Tongass.  Indeed, the fact that I even need to introduce a bill to again attempt a Federal solution for the Tongass--just 5 years after the last Federal legislative solution--is evidence that the State of Alaska by its laws and policies should own and manage the Tongass.  I want to be clear. This bill has nothing to do with expanding clearcutting on the Tongass. The only lands subject to harvesting are those left in the timber base after the past wilderness withdrawals form past acts of Congress. This has nothing to do with the public financing of environmental improvements. The company will finance the improvements itself based on the extended contract. This contract extension is corporate workfare with a fair return to the taxpayers.  The bill I introduce today is needed because the 1990 Tongass Timber Reform Act, which was passed and signed over my objection, has failed. It failed because 42 percent of the timber economy that was not supposed to diminish after the 1990 act is gone from the Tongass. The remainder of the timber economy--at one time over 4,000 strong--is just hanging on.  With its command and control approach to Federal land management decisions, Washington, DC, has failed Alaskans and those in other States. It has failed because the promise of the land base to support timber has been eroded by administrative action, laws, and lawsuits. The latest administrative proposal is to withdraw an additional 600,000 acres from the land available for timber harvesting. That means more land withdrawn by that single administrative action than has been harvested in the Tongass since 1909. There have been so many failures by the Federal Government regarding laws and decisions on the Tongass and the 75,000 people who live there are tired of it.  One of the most grave Federal failures resulted from the unilateral timber contract modifications--over the objections of contract holders--ordered by the 1990 Tongass Timber Reform Act. While there is a deep history attached to the long-term contracts in the Tongass, overnight the Federal Government just changed the contract at its whim. It was not because of any environmental or ecological reason. It was with arrogance and the design to stop the very small amount of timber harvesting in the largest national forest.  That was one of several decisions forced onto the Federal Forest Service and is a primary reason that the Alaska Pulp Corp. wanted to begin retooling its facility in Sitka. After they began doing so, their long-term contract was canceled under orders from the Department. It was a blatantly political decision and will end up costing the Federal Government millions of dollars.  The other long-term contract holder, the Ketchikan Pulp Corp. now barely survives with the unfair changes unilaterally inserted into its contract by the 1990 Tongass Timber Reform Act. The company has about 8 years remaining on its contract, but is facing several business options. The company has indicated a willingness to invest substantial resources--upwards of $200 million--to install environmental improvements to the plant and make it more energy efficient. Amortizing that investment requires a 15-year extension to their existing contract.  The 15-year extension is the first feature of my bill. The remaining parts of the bill attempt to improve the fairness of the contract provisions that were unilaterally changed under the 1990 Tongass Timber Reform Act. One provision requires a harvest plan which details the volume of timber and its location. Another provision requires normal independent appraisals and competitive rates for timber. Another provision concerns proportionality of harvests and includes a new criteria--acreage--by which proportionality is measured. Other provisions remove the termination clause and specifically allow conversion or replacement of the pulp mill with a similar facility. A final provision says that future modifications of the contract must be by mutual agreement.  I remind critics of logging on the Tongass that this bill has nothing to do with changing wilderness or LUD II designations. This bill has nothing to do with removing stream buffer protection. This bill has nothing to do with restoring the Tongass timber supply fund. This bill has nothing to do with any other part of the Tongass Timber Reform Act. Some may wish it did change those parts of the unfair law, but it does not.  This bill concerns fairness. It concerns restoring a viable long-term contract and extending its term. Before passage of the 1990 Tongass Timber Reform Act, nearly every environmental interest emphasized that timber harvesting and timber employment would not be affected if the Tongass law was reformed. I regret to say that those who made the representations have forgotten that they promised peace in the valley. The bill I introduce today does the least possible to address one issue that might make peace in the valley.  The timber economy has faltered in the Tongass. Not because it is inefficient, but because the law agreed to by powers in Washington, DC, doomed the timber economy. Passage of this bill means hope to those in Ketchikan and throughout Southeast. It means hope because an extended, viable timber contract will result in a clearer chlorine-free mill with improved energy efficiency. It means hope because it means jobs. Jobs and a cleaner environment means a good future for the timber resource industry in the Tongass.  An additional point is worth mentioning. There were allegations of timber theft by the company holding the long-term contract on the Tongass. My staff checked this report. They were told by the FBI that there is no planned or existing investigation of the company for timber theft. Nothing, according to the FBI after having visited the Tongass, has prompted the Bureau to even initiate a preliminary or full-fledged investigation of criminal timber.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the House Agriculture Committee to advance this piece of legislation.                          ____________________
