Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, all of us on both sides, at least the vast majority, believes judicial review is very, very important. That is a concept that has been embraced by both the majority and the minority and that forms the core of title I.  But I think it is important to understand specifically what title I does and why this amendment, I do not think, aids in adequate judicial review. In fact, it might create a situation where the system can be exploited to get 1, 2, 3, bites of the apple rather than an efficient system which allows everyone--small business people, ordinary American citizens--to go ahead and make sure regulations are sensible.  Judicial review is part of title I. It is triggered by a claim that procedurally the agency did not effectively institute a regulatory flexibility analysis. An agency director, when trying to promulgate regulations, must consider the impact on small business under the regulatory flexibility analysis or decide there is no significant impact and certify such a fact.  At that point, when that decision is made under the present statute, an affected entity has 180 days to appeal.
