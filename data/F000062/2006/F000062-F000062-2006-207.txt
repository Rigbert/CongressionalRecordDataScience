 President, I rise today to introduce the North Bay Water Reuse Program Act of 2006. The act would authorize an innovative program to protect the environment while meeting the future water needs of urban and agricultural water users in the North Bay region of California for years to come.  As regulations continue to tighten restrictions on wastewater discharges into the San Francisco Bay, communities are faced with major financial challenges as they determine the best way to discharge their treated wastewater. At the same time, agricultural producers in the North Bay region are facing serious water shortages resulting from a serious overdraft of groundwater. The North Bay Water Reuse Program will solve both problems together.  When completed, the North Bay Water Reuse Program will provide forthe collection and conveyance of treated urban wastewater to agricultural growers, promising a permanent and dedicated supply of about 30,000 acre-feet of water per year. The use of reclaimed water for irrigation will reduce the demand on both surface and groundwater supplies, and thus improve instream flows for riparian habitat and fisheries recovery.  In the off-season when irrigation demand is diminished, the reclaimed water will be used to increase surface water flows for restoration of wetland habitat in the former Cargill Salt Ponds.  This reclaimed water that would be applied productively to vineyards, fields and wetlands is now being discharged as treated wastewater into the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. The North Bay Water Reuse Program will benefit the ecosystem of the bay by providing a cost-effective, environmentally sound alternative for the disposal of urban wastewater.  The legislation I am introducing today allows for the Federal participation of the first phase of this long-term regional project. This cost-shared water reclamation and reuse program is the first of its kind in Northern California, and the first to provide water primarily for agricultural and environmental uses. It is supported by the local governments in three counties--Napa, Sonoma and Marin--that have joined together to undertake the project. Agricultural organizations, such as the Napa and Sonoma County Farm Bureaus, the Carneros Quality Alliance, the Winegrape Growers of Napa County, the Napa Vintners Association, and the North Bay Agriculture Alliance, support the program. And environmental organizations, such as The Bay Institute, likewise endorse the program.  The North Bay Water Reuse Program brings together stakeholders that are usually at odds with one another and provides an ideal solution to guarantee water to the environment and agricultural producers, and simultaneously providing regulatory relief to wastewater agencies.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3646       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
