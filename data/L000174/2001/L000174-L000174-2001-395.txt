President, I rise today to introduce important legislation that will impact the health and readiness of the Selected Reserve. The Selected Reserves includes over 900,000 dedicated men and women divided between the National Guard and the Reserves. Over the past ten years, this force has become increasingly critical to carrying out our Nation's defense, whether deploying to far-flung regions of the globe or backfilling for other units making those deployments.  The country simply cannot meet its commitments without these proud citizen-soldiers. It follows, then, that steps to increase the readiness of the Selected Reserves will have a positive effect on the readiness of the entire force. It was this goal in mind that I introduce the Health Care for Selected Reserve Act.  This legislation will ensure that all members of the drilling reserves have adequate health insurance. The legislation acknowledges our reserves' continuing contributions to the defense of the Nation and expresses the need for full medical coverage. The legislation will commission an independent study on the extent of insurance shortfalls and examine the feasibility of extending the TRICARE or FEHBP program to the reserves.  Currently, when a member of the Selected Reserve goes on active duty over 60 days, they are provided full coverage under the TRICARE Prime program conducted through the active military's medical treatment facilities. But when reservists are not on active duty, they are left to gain insurance through their civilian employers. Like the rest of society, most gain adequate coverage through their employers like the rest of society, but, mirroring broader shortfalls in the wider population, many go without any health coverage at all. This shortfall has an even more noticeable affect on the country because it affects military readiness.  There is also an underlying issue of fairness here. It seems wrong to me that one week someone can be patrolling the skies over Iraq with full coverage and the next week they can have no health coverage at all. That situation gives the impression that the National Guard and the Reserves are the poorly-paid subcontractor to the active duty force. If we really believe in the idea of the Total Force, we cannot let these health coverage shortfalls exist.  I want to thank the other sponsors of this bill for helping me craft this bill. Senators DeWine, Daschle, Cochran, Carnahan, Snowe, and Johnson are deeply interested in this issue, and I look forward to working with them to develop a set of concrete steps to meet this problem. I urge the legislation's adoption.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1119       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of the Armed      Forces is the element of the Armed Forces of the United      States that has the capability quickly to augment the active      duty forces of the Armed Forces successfully in times of      crisis.       (2) The Selected Reserve has been assigned increasingly      critical levels of responsibility for carrying out the      worldwide military missions of the Armed Forces since the end      of the Cold War.       (3) Members of the Selected Reserve have served proudly as      mobilized forces in numerous theaters from Europe to the      Pacific and South America, indeed, around the world.       (4) The active duty forces of the Armed Forces cannot      successfully perform all of the national security missions of      the Armed Forces without augmentation by the Selected      Reserve.       (5) The high and increasing tempo of activity of the      Selected Reserve causes turbulence in the relationships of      members of the Selected Reserve with their families,      employers, and reserve units.       (6) The turbulence often results from lengthy, sometimes      year-long, absences of the members of the Selected Reserve      from their families and their civilian jobs in the      performance of military duties necessary for the execution of      essential missions.       (7) Family turbulence includes the difficulties associated      with vacillation between coverage of members' families for      health care under civilian health benefits plans and coverage      under the military health benefits options.       (8) Up to 200,000 members of the Selected Reserve,      including, in particular, self-employed members, do not have      adequate health benefits.     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that steps should be taken to      ensure that every member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready      Reserve of the Armed Forces and the member's family have      health care benefits that are adequate--       (1) to ease the transition of the member from civilian life      to full-time military life during a mobilization of reserve      forces;       (2) to minimize the adverse effects of a mobilization on      the member's ability to provide for the member's family to      have ready access to adequate health care; and       (3) to improve readiness and retention in the Selected      Reserve.     SEC. 3. STUDY OF HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE FOR MEMBERS OF                    THE SELECTED RESERVE.       (a) Requirement for Study.--The Secretary of Defense shall      enter into a contract with a federally funded research and      development center to carry out a study of the needs of      members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of the      Armed Forces and their families for health care benefits.       (b) Report.--(1) Not later than March 1, 2002, the      Secretary shall submit a report on the results of the study      to Congress.       (2) The report shall include the following matters:       (A) Descriptions, and an analysis, of how members of the      Selected Reserve and their dependents currently obtain      coverage for health care benefits, together with statistics      on enrollments in health care benefits plans.       (B) The percentage of members of the Selected Reserve, and      dependents of such members, who are not covered by any health      insurance or other health benefits plan, together with the      reasons for the lack of coverage.       (C) Descriptions of the disruptions in health benefits      coverage that a mobilization of members of the Selected      Reserve causes for the members and their families.       (D) At least three recommended options for cost-effectively      preventing or reducing the disruptions by means of extending      health care benefits under the Defense Health Program or the      Federal Employees Health Benefits program to all members of      the Selected Reserve and their families, together with an      estimate of the costs of individual coverage and family      coverage under each option.       (E) A profile of the health status of members of the      Selected Reserve and their dependents, together with a      discussion of how that profile would affect the cost of      providing adequate health benefits coverage for that      population of beneficiaries.       (F) An analysis of the likely effects that providing      enhanced health benefits coverage to members of the Selected      Reserve and their families would have on recruitment and      retention for, and the readiness of, the Selected Reserve.       (3) In formulating the options to recommend under paragraph      (2)(D), the Secretary shall consider an expansion of the      TRICARE program or the Federal Employees Health Benefits      program to cover the members of the Selected Reserve and      their families.
