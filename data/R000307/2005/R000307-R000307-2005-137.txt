President, I thank the Senator for a very comprehensive statement. I thank him for what I think is a very accurate statement, more especially with the history he has outlined of the intelligence community; more especially with the contributions of the men and women within the intelligence community who have successes that obviously you cannot talk about, but the obvious need for reform because of what we have gone through; especially for the Senator's comment in relationship to the new DNI in relation to the Department of Defense. That was right on target.  There has been a great deal of comment, as the vice chairman knows, that 80 percent of the funding of the intelligence budget goes to the military, and in terms of being the majority user of intelligence nobody would quarrel with that. I don't know of any Member of Congress who would say otherwise. I think we have made great progress between the intelligence and the military and the real-time analysis or real-time intelligence to the warfighter, even though our challenges in parts of the world are very great. But I point out--and I think the vice chairman agrees--that the principal user of intelligence--not majority but principal user of intelligence--is not the military, as important as they are; it is the President of the United States and the National Security Council and the Congress of the United States to determine policy.  I thank the Senator for bringing that out and I thank him for a very fine statement and also for being a fine vice chairman. We aggressively tried to provide insight and advice to the new DNI.
