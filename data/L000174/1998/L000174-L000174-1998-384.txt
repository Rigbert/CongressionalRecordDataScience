President, I am proud to join Senator DeWine in introducing the Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act. This legislation will address and strengthen our services for disabled victims of crime throughout our country.  It is important that we focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims not only during this week, National Crime Victims Rights Week, but throughout the year. For the past several years, I have worked hard with others to make improvements in the law and provide greater assistance to victims of crime.  My involvement with crime victims rights began more than three decades ago when I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, Vermont, and witnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime and domestic violence, rather than presents additional ordeals for those already victimized.  The needs of victims of crime are many and must be addressed in a number of ways, including strengthening law enforcement and education, improving and increasing services for victims, and protecting the rights of victims. Today I am proud to again have the support of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services in focusing attention on the needs of crime victims with disabilities with the Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act.  Research conducted abroad has shown that individuals with disabilities have a four to 10 times higher risk of becoming a victim than do individuals without disabilities. Despite these findings, there have been no significant studies on this subject conducted in the United States. The Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act we are introducing today will rectify this omission.  The Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act proposes to have the Committee on Law and Justice of the National Academy of Sciences conduct research so as to increase public awareness of victims of crime with disabilities, to understand the nature and extent of such crimes, and to develop strategies to address the safety and needs of victims of crime with disabilities. This Act directs the Attorney General to utilize statistics gathered from this study for inclusion in the National Crime Victims Survey. The Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act also directs the Attorney General to submit a report detailing the means by which each State can establish and maintain a database on the incidence of crimes against individuals with disabilities.  Over the last 20 years we have made strides in recognizing crime victims' rights and providing much needed assistance. I am proud to have played a role in passage of the Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, and the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and the other improvements we have been able to make.  In the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, Congress acted to ensure a right of allocation for victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse and to make tens of millions of dollars available to crime victims. No amount of money can make up for the harm and trauma of being the victim of a crime, but we should do all that we can to see that victims are assisted, compensated and treated with dignity by the criminal justice system.  I was the author of the Victims of Terrorism Act that was passed by the Senate in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and became the basis for the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act signed into law in April 1996. We were able to make funds available through supplemental grants to the States to assist and compensate victims of terrorism and mass violence, which incidents might otherwise have overwhelmed the resources of Oklahoma's crime victims compensation program or its victims assistance services. We also filled a gap in our law for residents of the United States who are victims of terrorism and mass violence that occur outside the borders of the United States. In addition, we allowed greater flexibility to our State and local victims' assistance programs and some greater certainty so that they can know that our commitment to victims programming will not wax and wane with events. And we were able to raise the assessments on those convicted of federal crimes in order to fund the needs of crime victims.  Last year, I cosponsored the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. That legislation reversed a presumption against crime victims observing the fact phase of a trial if they were likely to provide testimony during the sentencing phase of that trial. As a result of that legislation, not only were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing able to observe the trial of Timothy McVeigh, all those who were able to witness the trial and were called as witnesses to provide victim impact testimony at the sentencing phase of that trial were able to do so.  The Crime Victims Assistance Act, legislation that I introduced this past July with Senator Kennedy, builds upon the progress made over the last several years. It provides for a wholesale reform of the Federal Rules and Federal law to establish additional rights and protections for victims of federal crime. This bill would provide crime victims with an enhanced right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention and plea bargains, an enhanced right to a speedy trial and to be present in the courtroom throughout a trial, an enhanced right to be heard on probation revocation and to give a statement at sentencing, and the right to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison. The Crime Victims Assistance Act would also strengthen victims' services by increasing Federal victim assistance personnel, enhancing training for State and local law enforcement and Officers of the Court, and establishing and ombudsman program for crime victims.  With a simple majority of both Houses of Congress, the Crime Victims Assistance Act could be enacted this year and we could mark a significant and immediate difference in the lives of victims throughout our country. I hope that the Senate will turn to this important measure without further delay. Unfortunately, one consequence of the effort to focus attention on proposals to amend the Constitution has been to dissipate efforts to enact effective victims rights legislation over the past two years. The momentum we had built over the last several years has been dissipated by this focus to the exclusion of statutory reform.  While we have made great improvements in our law enforcement and crime victims assistance programs and have made advances in recognizing crime victims' rights, we still have work to do. This week is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. Crime victims advocates across Vermont and the nation are commemorating this week with ceremonies, awards and proclamations. I am honored to have received recognition from the Vermont Center for Crime Victims Services and the Vermont Network for Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault during National Crime Victims Rights Week in 1996 and a Congressional Leadership Award from the National Organization for Victim Assistance. Each year at this time our hearts go out to the families and victims of crime. Each year I try to help focus attention on those who work so hard every week of the year on behalf of all crime victims in crime victims' assistance and compensation programs.  There are many individuals in Vermont who I would like to thank for their expertise and advice in addressing victims' rights and services, including Lori Hayes, Executive Director of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services, and Marty Levin, Coordinator of the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. Their hard work and dedication have made a real difference in the lives of people who suffer from violence and abuse.  In May 1997, the Department of Justice Office for Victims of Crime concluded that ``Vermont's programs are setting the standard for outreach to undeserved populations and service coordination among providers and allied professionals.'' Vermont's leadershipwas also recently recognized with its selection for participation in the Department of Justice Rural Victim Services 2000 project. The Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services will administer this grant to conduct the first systematic survey of what rural crime victims need. The more informed we become of the needs of victims, the more we can adapt services to make them more effective and efficient.  I commend all those in Vermont and across the country who are committed to assisting crime victims.                                 ______                                       By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Reid):  S. 1977. A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study and issue a report on predatory and discriminatory practices of airlines which restrict consumer access to unbiased air transportation passenger service and fare information; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.         the consumer access to travel information act of 1998  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that will benefit consumers and small businessmen and women who must travel by air. The bill I am introducing today, the Consumer Access to Travel Information Act of 1998, will reverse an increasingly anti-consumer, anti-competitive trend in airline travel across the country.  For three years, the major airlines have been moving to gain more control over the airline travel ticket distribution system. While this effort may seem harmless, the ramifications to consumers are significant. Currently, most air travelers get their information from one of the 33,000 travel agencies around the country. These agencies provide consumers with unbiased and comprehensive air travel information, i.e., the best flight at the cheapest fare. Without that independent source of travel information, there is no doubt that consumers will be paying more, in many cases, substantially more for air travel.  The Consumer Access to Travel Information Act of 1998 is a reasonable, and balanced bill that is significant not only for what it does, but also for what it doesn't do. This legislation would simply require the Secretary of Transportation to investigate the behavior of major airlines, including discriminatory and predatory practices of airlines which target travel agents, other independent distributors, and small airlines. This is authority that the Secretary currently has under the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, but has thus far not elected to use. This bill makes certain this investigation is undertaken. If it is determined that anti-competitive, discriminatory or predatory practices exist, the Secretary must report to Congress those steps the Department intends to take to address such practices.  What this legislation does not do is regulate the airline industry. In fact, this legislation is a wake up call for the industry. As the for-profit hospital and HMO industries discovered, if consumers are disregarded, and anti-competitive activities are encouraged, the heavy hand of regulators and anti-trust remedies will soon follow. This investigation by DOT may bring to light practices that the airlines themselves may not even realize exist. It is far better to have DOT look into these issues and have them addressed now, than to have Congress begin pursuing more proactive legislative remedies in the future.  Travel agents provide critical services to air travelers, and air travelers depend heavily upon travel agents to provide an accurate, broad selection of schedules, fare quotes, and ticketing services for all airlines. Agents quote schedules and fares, and provide ticketing services, to consumers on major U.S. airlines, small U.S. airlines, large and small international airlines, and start-up airlines.  The travel agency community and other independent ticket distributors are the only efficient, independent and comprehensive sources of information for airline travel options. Travel agencies and other independent distributors comprise a considerable portion of the small business sector in the United States, employing over 250,000 people. Over 50% of travel agencies are owned by women or minorities.  Every industry study conducted since the 1960's has concluded that travel agents can process reservation and ticketing transactions in any medium more efficiently than can airlines. Just this year, one of the world's largest and most efficient airlines announced the closing of all of its U.S. ticket offices in favor of the efficiencies of the U.S. travel agency industry.  So why are multi-billion dollar airlines putting the squeeze on the mom and pop travel agencies? Unfortunately, the answer lies beyond just sucking more revenue from the travel agent. The biggest threat to the current airline oligopoly is the young, upstart airlines. Wherever these airlines operate, the major air carriers' prices are competitive. Wherever these airlines do not operate, the consumer pays monopoly prices. Small domestic airlines, many international airlines, and start-up airlines heavily depend upon the travel agency distribution system. There is no alternate distribution system available to these types of airlines. A less ubiquitous, less independent travel agency means less business for, and less competition from, the smaller airlines.  As part of the effort to consolidate their market power, the airlines began to focus on the ticket distribution system. Twice in the last three years, the major airlines have initiated and supported reductions in travel agent commissions on the sale of air travel. In February alone, total travel agent commissions on domestic travel dropped 21%. More reductions from airlines, and greater travel agent losses, are expected. The number of travel agencies has decreased for the first time since World War II, and many more closings are expected as agency operating reserves are exhausted.  As travel agents are forced out of the industry and airlines secure more direct consumer business, consumer alternatives will continue to decrease, resulting in significantly higher consumer travel costs. Major airlines have generally misrepresented the reason for agency commission cuts, citing a need to reduce expenses and pass savings on to consumers. In fact, airline ticket prices have steadily increased, there have been no consumer benefits, airlines are posting record profits quarter-after-quarter, and consumers are paying the highest airfares in history.  Commissions are not the only way in which the airlines are using anti-competitive practices to pressure the travel agents. For example, confidential business information generated by travel agents, such as marketing, bookings, and sales data, is routinely shared by the airlines.  Considering airlines regard themselves as competitors of travel agents, this is an intolerable situation for the travel agents.  Another example of unfair treatment is the use of promotions, concessions, and benefits that airlines can pass on to consumers that are denied to travel agents. In addition the airlines operate the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), which controls both who can become a travel agent and the settlement of funds between travel agents and the airlines.  Internet travel servicing, one ticket distribution alternative which holds great promise for consumers, is also being dominated by the major air carriers. As a practical matter, travel agents have already been excluded by airlines from selling tickets booked by electronic means. As with conventional distribution, Internet consumers have very limited ability to view consolidated electronic schedule and fare information, much less interpret the rules, restrictions and penalties attached to such lower fares as might be found.  That is why, Mr. President, Congress must pass the Consumer Access to Travel Information Act of 1998 before consumers are hurt further, and before there is an overwhelming cry to reregulate air travel.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1977       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Access to Travel      Information Act of 1998''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) To foster and preserve competition, national      transportation policy should support the continuation of      widespread, convenient, and efficient public access to      unbiased comparative air transportation passenger service and      fare information.       (2) The traveling public relies upon unbiased comparative      air transportation passenger service and fare information      provided by independent retail travel agents and other      independent sources.       (3) Concentrations of market power, restrictions on entry,      and predatory and discriminatory practices of airlines impair      consumer access to independently distributed unbiased      comparative information about air transportation passenger      services or fares.       (4) If not corrected, such practices will seriously      restrict consumer access to the independent and unbiased      service and fare information provided by travel agents and      other independent sources.     SEC. 3. POLICY.       Section 40101(a) of title 49, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(16) Ensuring that consumers may obtain unbiased      comparative information from travel agents and other      independent sources about air transportation passenger      services and fares in an efficient and convenient      manner.''.     SEC. 4. STUDY; REPORT.       (a) Study.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation      (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'')      shall undertake a study of the availability to consumers of      adequate unbiased information about air transportation      passenger services and fares. The study shall include an      investigation of the following practices:       (1) Air carrier policies that deter or prevent travel      agents or other independent sources from using competitively      efficient phone systems, computer reservation systems, or      other electronic systems to communicate or consummate      transactions with the public.       (2) Air carrier policies that deter or prevent travel      agents and other independent sources from offering the public      the same or greater concessions, benefits, or services than      those offered by air carriers directly to those consumers.       (3) Discriminatory collective or joint operation of assets      used to offer concessions, benefits, or services to the      public while denying comparable access to such concessions,      benefits, or services through travel agents and other      independent sources, including joint sales activities, denial      of competitive tools, and denial of distribution      efficiencies.       (4) Sharing of competitively significant sales transaction      data in violation of the confidentiality interests of the      travel agents or other independent sources that generated      such data.       (5) As the Secretary considers appropriate, any other      practices which may impair consumer access to independently      distributed unbiased comparative information about air      transportation passenger services or fares.       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall transmit to      Congress a report of the conclusions of the study required by      subsection (a).     SEC. 5. CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.       The Secretary shall, after notice and hearing, order any      air carrier or other party engaged in any practice or policy      which constitutes a predatory, unfair, or deceptive practice      or unfair method of competition which restricts the      widespread, convenient, and efficient access by the public to      unbiased comparative air transportation passenger service and      fare information or the sale, booking, or distribution of air      transportation passenger services or products, to cease and      desist therefrom.                                 ______                                       By
