 President, I would like to comment briefly on the tragic death of Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, which occurred last week in Croatia.  I have know Ron Brown and his family for 12 years. Ron was a friend of mine, and a friend of the State of California. One of his first duties as Commerce Secretary was to find ways to resuscitate California's economy, and he helped to do just that. Ron Brown made the Department of Commerce a positive force for helping the largest State in the Union recover from the devastating recession of the early 1990's.  Ron had a vision of a prosperous America, where the cliche that ``a rising tide lifts all boats'' could actually come true. He focused his Department and this administration on looking for opportunities to help the American economy make the transition from the era of heavy industry to an era of high technology, scientific innovation, and the advancement of the current revolution in communications.  Ron helped formulate this vision, made sure that his Department gave grants and other forms of assistance to firms pursuing it, and at the time of his death was advocating that vision to other parts of the world.  But even more important than his career was the man himself. Always upbeat, with ceaseless energy, Ron could persuade the most vehement skeptic of the value of his vision and efforts for our country. He served in a variety of roles, and in each he excelled. His days as an effective leader with the National Urban League demonstrates this, where he became deputy executive director, general counsel and vice president of the Urban League's Washington, DC office.  Ron Brown's boundless energy and commitment to excellence did not stop at the National Urban League. It continued to help him break racial boundaries and become the first African-American to head a major political party, helping to elect the country's first Democratic President in 12 years; the first African-American to become a partner in his powerful Washington, DC law firm; and the first African-American to take the helm at the U.S. Department of Commerce.  I know of no chairman of the Democratic National Committee who was better regarded, whose fundraising calls were more frequently returned, or whose hardships and public statements were more well regarded--Ron Brown was tops.  In my view, Ron Brown's stewardship as Secretary of Commerce was unparalleled. He truly cared about his work and those the Department serves, and the record reflects accurately billions of dollars in trade and new business that will, in the future, benefit this country's businesses and industrial base.  I find the circumstances of his untimely death to be particularly poignant. Here he was, leading a group of business people and his staff, on a mission of peace to the war torn land of the former Yugoslavia.  He did not wait for peace to be restored. He went when risks of hostile action were still present. He did not wait for pleasant weather before springing into action. And, he did not just work on economic issues. He also spent time with our troops over there, to let them know we support their efforts.  Mr. President, we have lost a great American in Ron Brown. Whether it was politics, or crafting legislation for the Senate, or civil rights, or military service, or being a husband and a father, Ron Brown was a great patriot, and a great human being. I shall always treasure the relationship he and I had, and I shall miss him terribly.  To Alma Brown and Tracy, who have traveled with me in the campaign, I send my heart and prayers. With all his family, I share an unrelenting emptiness and sadness. I will miss the phone calls, the smile, the exploits from progress, and, most of all, his abiding and consummate belief in all of us.                          ____________________
