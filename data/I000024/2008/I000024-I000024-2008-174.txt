President, as one of the Senate's commercially licensed pilots, I wish to talk about an issue near to my heart--flying. As many in this Chamber know, I have flown thousands of hours, I attend the well-known AirVenture aviation event in Oshkosh, WI, every year, and I have even recreated Wiley Post's trip around the world.  Today, I am here to acknowledge a group of people who share my love of flying--volunteer pilots and nonprofit, charitable associations called Volunteer Pilot Organizations, VPOs, that provide resources to help these self-sacrificing pilots serve people in need. I have introduced an amendment, S.A. 4606, to provide much needed liability protection to these pilots and nonprofit organizations. My legislation is supported by the American Red Cross, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, and many volunteer pilot organizations throughout the Nation.  Unfortunately, the majority has used a procedural tactic to restrict my ability to offer this amendment to the bill we are currently debating, the FAA Reauthorization Act. However, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss my amendment and to encourage my colleagues to join me in seeking to pass basic liability protection for volunteer pilots into law at the first opportunity.  There are approximately 40 to 50 VPOs in the United States--ranging from small, local groups to large, national associations. Air Charity Network, ACN, is the Nation's largest VPO and has seven member organizations that collectively serve the entire country and perform about 90 percent of all charitable aviation missions in the United States. ACN's volunteer pilots provide free air transportation for people in need of specialized medical treatment at distant locations. They also step in when commercial air service is not available with middle-of-the-night organ transplant patient flights, disaster response missions evacuating special needs patients, and transport of blood or blood products in emergencies.  ACN and its more than 8,000 volunteer pilots use their own planes, pay for their own fuel, and even take time from their ``day'' jobs to serve people in need. These Good Samaritans provided charitable flights for an estimated 24,000 patients in 2007 and their safety record is phenomenal. In more than 30 years of service, the pilots of ACN have flown over 250,000 missions covering over 80 million miles and have never had a fatal accident.  Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, ACN aircraft were the first to be approved to fly in disaster-response teams and supplies. Similarly, in 2005, ACN pilots flew over 2,600 missions after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, reuniting families torn apart by the disaster and relocating them to safe housing. Their service was invaluable to thousands of people.  My own State of Oklahoma is served well by a number of volunteer pilot organizations, including Angel Flight South Central and Angel Flight Oklahoma. On a daily basis, they selflessly serve my constituents by flying individuals to get surgeries and treatments.  I would like to share comments from two of my constituents with you. Angela Looney, from Norman, OK, says that, ``I could not have received the care I've gotten without Angel Flight. No one in Norman or anywhere in Oklahoma could perform my surgery. I had to get to M.D. Anderson.'' Tonya Dawson, from Broken Arrow, OK, travels with Angel Flight to treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. She reports, ``The pilots are great. I can't say enough good things.''  Despite this goodwill, there is a loophole in the law that subjects these heroes and charitable organizations to frivolous, costly lawsuits. Currently, although volunteer pilots are required to carry liability insurance, if they have an accident, the injured party can sue for any amount of money. It would be up to a jury to decide on an amount. If that amount is higher than the liability limit on a pilot's insurance, then the pilot risks being held personally responsible, potentially bringing him or her financial ruin.  Additionally, the cost of insurance and lack of available nonowned aircraft liability insurance for organizations since the terrorist attacks of September 11 prevents VPOs from acquiring liability protection for their organizations, boards, and staff. Without this insurance, if a volunteer pilot were to have an accident using his or her own aircraft, everyone connected to the organization could be subject to a costly lawsuit, despite the fact that none of those people were directly involved with the dispatch of the flight, the pilot's decisions, or the aircraft itself.  Exposure to this type of risk makes it difficult for these organizations to recruit and retain volunteer pilots and professional staff. It also makes referring medical professionals and disaster agencies like the American Red Cross less likely to tell patients or evacuees that charitable medical air transportation is available for fear of a liability suit against them. Instead of focusing on serving people with medical needs, these organizations are spending time and resources averting a lawsuit and recruiting volunteers.  In order to close this costly loophole, I have introduced Senate amendment 4606. My amendment expands the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, which was passed into law to increase volunteerism in the United States, to protect from liability volunteer pilot organizations, their boards, paid staff, nonflying volunteers, and referring agencies, should there be an accident. It also provides liability protection for individual volunteer pilots over and above the liability insurance that they are currently required to carry.  My amendment will go a long way to help eliminate unnecessary liability risk and allow volunteer pilots and the charitable organizations for which they fly to concentrate on what they do best--save lives.  I ask unanimous consent to have Senate amendment No. 4606 printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       At the appropriate place, insert the following:     SEC. __. LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR VOLUNTEER PILOT NONPROFIT                    ORGANIZATIONS THAT FLY FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT AND                    TO PILOTS AND STAFF OF SUCH NONPROFIT                    ORGANIZATIONS.       Section 4 of the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 (42      U.S.C. 14503) is amended--       (1) in subsection (a)(4)--       (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses      (i) and (ii), respectively;       (B) by striking ``the harm'' and inserting ``(A) except in      the case of subparagraph (B), the harm'';       (C) in subparagraph (A)(ii), as redesignated by this      paragraph, by striking the period at the end and inserting      ``; or''; and       (D) by adding at the end the following:       ``(B) the volunteer--       ``(i) was operating an aircraft in furtherance of the      purpose of a volunteer pilot nonprofit organization that      flies for public benefit; and       ``(ii) was properly licensed and insured for the operation      of such aircraft.''; and       (2) in subsection (c)--       (A) by striking ``Nothing in this section'' and inserting      the following:       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2),      nothing in this section''; and       (B) by adding at the end the following:       ``(2) Exception.--A volunteer pilot nonprofit organization      that flies for public benefit, the staff, mission      coordinators, officers, and directors (whether volunteer or      otherwise) of such nonprofit organization, and a referring      agency of such nonprofit organization shall not be liable for      harm caused to any person by a volunteer of such nonprofit      organization while such volunteer--       ``(A) is operating an aircraft in furtherance of the      purpose of such nonprofit organization;       ``(B) is properly licensed for the operation of such      aircraft; and       ``(C) has certified to such nonprofit organization that      such volunteer has insurance covering the volunteer's      operation of such aircraft.''.
