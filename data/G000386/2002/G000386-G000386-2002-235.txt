 President, this year marks the 76th year of operations for the U.S. International Trade Commission, ITC. Throughout that time, the Commission has played an essential role in the administration of U.S. trade remedy laws.  Today, I would like to emphasize two aspects of the ITC that I believe are critical to their ability to effectively administer U.S. trade remedy laws in the future.  First, it is important to remember that the ITC is an independent, impartial arbiter in international trade disputes under U.S. trade law. This independent stature was established and is guaranteed by the Congress. Inevitably, by deciding the cases on the merits, the Commission has made decisions that may be unpopular with certain industry sectors or individual Senators and Representatives--including me--and will doubtless to so again. But, despite disagreements the Congress continues to defend the Commission's independence. The fact that the Commission and Commissioners can rule on the merits, without fear of political pressure or retribution, is crucial to America's economy at home and our trade negotiations abroad.  As other nations begin to implement their own trade remedy laws, they often look to U.S. law and institutions for guidance. It is important the U.S. institutions serve as good models for other nations. One way to do that is for Congress to ensure that the independent nature of the ITC is preserved, regardless of the outcome of any particular case, just as we would any other quasi-judicial agency. It is our duty as elected representatives.  There is one other issue related to the ITC I would like to highlight, and that is the importance of having ITC Commissioners with an agriculture background. As the number of agricultural cases before the ITC increases, the appointment of a Commissioner with a substantive agricultural background is crucial to American agriculture. There are currently a number of antidumping orders and pending investigations affecting agricultural products. The ITC's commissioners must determine whether U.S. producers have suffered injury from unfairly traded products. A background in agriculture would assist the Commission in deciding these cases on the merits. I hope that the Administration will consider nominees with a background in agriculture, as current Commissioners' terms expire.                          ____________________
