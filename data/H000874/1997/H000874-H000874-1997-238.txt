Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address the House and particularly to respond to the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough], who spoke and who since left.  Mr. Scarborough made the point that Republicans, he said, were perceived as not liking children, not liking senior citizens, and now not liking flood victims. I do not know whether that is the case. Maybe that is his feeling and his concern. He also observed that both sides of the House have added things to emergency relief bills in the past and cited a New York Times article, which I have not read but which I know to be true.  That is the case. There is always the time when a bill that should pass and most of us believe must pass and be signed, in this case the belief for those who have been ravaged by rains and flood and who are at risk and what this Nation wants to help. Everybody believes this bill ought to pass and it ought to pass quickly.  But lest my colleagues or anybody else be confused that this is the regular course of business, let me reflect a little bit on history. It took just 15 days to provide the assistance that President Bush asked this Congress to give for the victims of Hurricane Andrew. We are now in the 83rd day.  It was not that President Bush and the Congress, then led by Democrats, controlled by Democrats, agreed on everything. That was not the case. But what President Bush and the Democratic Congress did agree on was that it was our responsibility to pass that emergency relief in a timely fashion, 15 days, as opposed to the 83 days that this bill has languished in this Congress.  And why does this bill languish? Why does a bill that everybody said should pass and must pass not pass? It is, Mr. Speaker, because the leadership of this House and the leadership of the Senate has determined that they want to stare down the President, that they want to muscle the President, that they want to leverage the President, and they have taken hostage the victims of the floods of these past months in order to accomplish that objective.  My colleagues have heard the issues discussed. There are two principal ones. One is called a continuing resolution and it is put forth by the Republicans in this House and in the Senate as an effort to prevent government shutdown.  Mr. Speaker, I represent 56,000 Federal employees. I am for preventing government shutdown. In point of fact, it was in the last Congress for the first time since I have been serving since 1981 that we consciously and purposefully shut down the Government.  The Republican leadership said in April of 1995 they were going to do that. They reiterated that in July of 1995. And sure enough, on November 19, 1995, they shut down the Government, looked the President in the eye, and said, if you do not do it my way, we will do it no way.  That is not what the people sent us here to do. They sent us here to work together. The fact of the matter is that when we did work together, we passed appropriation bills and we opened the Government after 2 long shutdowns consciously planned by the Republican majority to force the President to do something that he said he was not going to do. That never happened when the Republicans were in control in the 1980s and the first 2 years of the 1990s and Democrats controlled this Congress.  Were there differences? Yes. Did the Democrats try to get advantage on the Republican President? Yes. But did there come a time when they said that they would not move, that they would be immovable in the face of presidential opposition? The answer is no.  When President Clinton asked for relief for the Midwest floods just in the last Congress, it just took us 29 days, less than one half of the time that this bill has languished in this House and in the Senate. The other issue that the Republicans talk about as being a must add to the emergency relief for flood victims is this sampling issue. It is all about politics, because Republicans have been quoted as saying, ``If we allow sampling and the count that will result, we will find poor people, we will find minorities, and we are afraid that they will vote for Democrats and that will be to our political disadvantage.''  So the Speaker of the House, who two years ago said that he thought sampling made sense and ought to be pursued has changed his position. And who suffers? The victims of the rain and the floods are held hostage as this political dispute is engaged.  Mr. Speaker, a number of us have risen on this floor tonight, a number of us are rising throughout this city and talking to the press, talking to the public, and talking, yes, to our colleagues. We have a budget agreement. We sat down and for 5 months worked out a very tough problem. I supported it. That is the proper process, not to hold hostage, either Government employees or flood victims or some other group and say, we will hold their relief in abeyance if they do not agree with us.  Yes, Mr. Speaker, we urge the leadership of this House and the Senate to bring to this floor a clean, continuing resolution, relief for flood victims, support for our troops in Bosnia and around the world. Pass that, the President will sign it. We can pass it by 12 noon tomorrow and the President will sign it by tomorrow afternoon. That is what we ought to do. Let us be about the business of giving relief to the victims of these floods.                          ____________________
