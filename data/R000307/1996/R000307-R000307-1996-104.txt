Chairman, I notice on line 11 of the amendment, it says, ``Shall use the funds to conduct restoration activities in the Everglades ecosystem, which may include acquiring private acreage in the Everglades.''  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified to change ``may'' to ``shall.'' We can answer the problems with the budget in part and the problems by the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] in terms of other very fine environmental programs.
