Chairman, as the House proceeds to consider H.R. 4635, the Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001, I wish to highlight several features of this legislation that are important to our nation's science enterprise. I also will comment on EPA's reformulated gasoline mandate.                      national science foundation  Concerning the National Science Foundation, I support funding at the requested level of $4,572 billion for fiscal year 2001. On May 17, 2000, I introduced H.R. 4485, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2000. This bill authorizes programs at NSF not authorized by the Science Committee in previous legislation. Together with other authorization bills passed by the Committee--including H.R. 2086, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Act, and H.R. 1184, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act--H.R. 4485 would boost NSF's FY 2001 authorization to about $4.6 billion, $54 million above the requested level.  While it should be recognized that, with a increase of $167 million, NSF has fared comparatively well in the appropriations process, I would have preferred to see an increase in funding closer to the level requested, especially given the large increases planned for the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  Indeed, I think it is important that the role of NSF in providing the intellectual capital needed both for economic growth and biomedical research be more widely recognized. Today, we are in the midst of one of the Nation's longest economic expansions, an expansion that owes much to technological changes driven by the basic scientific research conducted 10 to 15 years ago. Many of today's new industries, which provide good, high paying jobs, can be linked directly to research supported by NSF.  Moreover, many of the breakthroughs in biomedical research have their underpinnings in research and technologies developed by investigators under NSF grants. The development of Magnetic Resonance Imaging is just one of many examples. We often loose sight of the fact that the ongoing revolution in medicine is as much a phenomenon of the physical and computational sciences as the biological sciences.  I do not begrudge the increased funding provided for NIH, but I think we could achieve a better balance between the biomedical fields and the other fields of science that contribute to our health and well being in ways that may not be readily apparent. The case for maintaining diversity in the federal research portfolio was made in the Science Policy Study, Unlocking Our Future, which found that, ``It is important that the federal government fund basic research in a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines . . . and resist overemphasis in a particular area or areas relative to other.''  If Congress continues to concentrate scientific funding in one area, I am concerned that important research in other ares may be given short shrift. Such a result could have serious consequences for future economic growth and biomedical breakthroughs.             national aeronautics and space administration  While I am disappointed that H.R. 4635 does not fund the Space Launch Initiative, I am pleased to note that the bill recommends $13.714 billion for NASA, an increase of $112.8 million over this fiscal year.  I especially commend the hard work of the Subcommittee and Committee leadership, and the Chairmen, to insure that NASA's programs and policy initiatives are sound and emphasize the pursuit of a broad range of space science. Among other notable issues cited in the accompanying committee report, I support the bill's recommendations to fully fund the Space Shuttle, Earth Sciences, and Space Station; to encourage use of the Shuttle for life and microgravity research missions; and to withhold funding for the proposed ``Living With a Star'' program until some of our questions about the program are adequately and fully answered.  As Members are aware, several important NASA programs have suffered some failures this year and the agency is appropriately reexamining its implementation of the concept of ``faster, better, cheaper.'' I believe NASA must continue to pursue cost-savings measures as it designs and builds future space, but that it manage these plans with more agency oversight and with mission costs predicated on appropriate levels of risk.  Finally, I commend the Committee for insuring that NASA's aeronautics activities are properly targeted and that the agency not expend its limited budget on activities that more appropriately fall under the jurisdiction of other federal agencies.  The Space Station and the X-33 continue to drag on NASA's ability to move our space program to the next level of achievement. The Administration made fundamental management errors, in the first instance by allowing Russia to bring station construction activities to a complete halt, and in the second instance by entering into a cooperative agreement with an industry partner without appropriate safeguards to protect the federal investment.  I understand the Chairman is committed to working with the Senate to try and restore the Space Launch Initiative funds in the Conference Report. I look forward to working with the Chairman to accomplish that goal because I believe the program is important.                  EPA's Reformulated Gasoline Mandate  Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandated the sale of reformulated gasoline (RFG) to help reduce ozone levels in areas determined by the EPA to have high levels of ozone. At the time the original requirements were implemented in 1995, I had concerns about RFG's human and environmental health effects, cost, potential harm to engines, and about a possible drop in gas mileage. Numerous studies, including one by the EPA's own Blue Ribbon Panel, have shown my early skepticism to be well founded. The Blue Ribbon Panel recommended the phase-out of MTBE, an RFG additive, because it has been identified as a potentially dangerous drinking water contaminant. Another study, by the National Research Council, concluded that the use of commonly available additives in RFG has little, in any impact on improving air quality.  Now, following EPA's implementation of RFG Phase II requirements, gas prices in the Midwest in areas forced to comply with the new requirements are the highest in the nation. Despite the clear correlation between the areas in the Midwest forced to comply with the RFG mandate and those areas with exceptionally high gas prices, EPA has refused to accept even partial responsibility and has rejected opportunities to provide a solution to the problem. To-date, EPA has refused to grant even a temporary waiver from RFG enforcement despite repeated requests from state and federal officials gasoline consumers, and businesses in Wisconsin and Illinois. EPA has even refused to grant a waiver during the on-going FTC investigation into possible price gouging. Initial reports indicate the FTC's investigation could be lengthy, meaning a resolution to this costly ordeal may not be near.   EPA's lack of strong science to support the RFG mandate and refusal to accommodate the requests of the severely impacted communities is troubling. I continue to be extremely disappointed with EPA's actions on this issue.
