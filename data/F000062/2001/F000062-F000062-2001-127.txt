 President, today I am proud to introduce the Aircraft Clean Air Act of 2001. The bill is designed to encourage airlines to keep records of airplane cabin air quality complaints, as well as complaints of illnesses that may be a result of poor air quality.  Airlines are not required to maintain records of passenger and crewmember complaints regarding cabin air quality, even if the passenger or crewmember reports an illness as a result of poor air quality.  As a result, potentially valuable information is lost to researchers studying cabin air quality.  The Aircraft Clean Air Act allows passengers and crewmembers to submit their complaints directly to the Federal Aviation Administration and requires that the Administration record the complaint and pass it on to the appropriate airline.  The bill requires airlines to maintain records of complaints for ten years.  If a passenger or crewmember requests mechanical or maintenance records with regard to their complaint, and the passenger or crewmember has had a health care professional verify their symptoms, this legislation requires that the airline provide the requested information within 15 days. If the airline does not comply with the request, it is subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 for each day it does not produce the records.  Airlines must be ready to provide maintenance records of all chemicals used in or on the plan, from cleaning solvents to hydraulic fluids.  The traveling public should have access to any chemicals to which they may be exposed.  The Aircraft Clean Air Act addresses another issue, as well: aircraft pressurization.  Planes are currently pressurized to 8,000 feet while in the air. That means that even though the plane is flying at 30,000 feet, the cabin has the same air pressure as it would at 8,000 feet.  Airplane manufacturers arrived at the 8,000 figure in the 1960s when commercial air travel was booming. They agreed on the figure after testing the effects of different pressurizations on young, healthy pilots.  Because oxygen is absorbed into the blood at a much lower rate in high altitudes, there is speculation that some illnesses experienced during flight are a result of the 8,000 feet pressurization. Commonly reported symptoms such as shortness of breath and numbness in the limbs may be a direct result of the high altitude.  The Aircraft Clean Air Act directs the Federal Aviation Administration to sponsor an aeromedical research project to determine what cabin altitude limit should provide enough oxygen to passengers and crew.  The bill allows universities to compete to conduct the study, and the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Air Quality in Passenger Cabins of Commercial Aircraft to select the winner.  Researchers will examine the oxygen saturation in people of different ages, weights, and body types at 5,000 feet through 8,000 feet. The bill directs researchers to determine which altitude provides enough oxygen to ensure that individuals' health is not adversely affected either in the short-term or long-term.  It is unacceptable that airlines do not maintain records of air quality complaints on their commercial flights. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to protect the traveling public and the hardworking men and women who make air travel possible.                                 ______                                       By
