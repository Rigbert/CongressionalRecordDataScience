 This is avery complicated issue, as we all know. It has been around multiple Congresses, and it took their leadership and coordination and cooperation first to produce a 14-to-1 vote in the committee and then this extraordinary success we have had out here on the floor. I know all of us are extremely proud of the great work you have done.  Congratulations. We deeply appreciate the contribution you have made to our country.
