President, Oregon's 363 miles of coastline are extremely susceptible to tsunamis. Just 2 weeks ago, at 7:40 p.m. on June 14, 2005, the tsunami threat became reality for those living on or visiting the coast. A 7.0 earthquake off the coast of California triggered an automatic tsunami warning for the entire west coast of the United States. The emergency response capabilities of these communities were put to the test. Fortunately, the warning was called off at 9:09 p.m. after it was determined that the earthquake failed to produce a tsunami.  Looking back, a lot of things went right. In Oregon, in cities such as Seaside and Cannon Beach, the alarms were sounded and people evacuated. However, there is a lot more that needs to be done. Models indicate that should an offshore earthquake trigger a tsunami, coastal towns will only have between 12 and 30 minutes before the first wave hits the beach. On June 14, for many people on the coast, the information would have come too late.  I am pleased that the Tsunami Preparedness Act, S. 50, of which I am a consponsor and strong supporter, will pass the Senate by unanimous consent today. The world has recently seen how potentially devastating a tsunami can be. America needs to take steps to prepare and be ready. Oregonians are acutely aware that, at some point, a tsunami could hit the coast of the United States. This bill will give our coastal communities opportunities that weren't afforded the victims of the tragic tsunami in Southeast Asia last year. It will harness the brains and expertise of universities, like Oregon State University and Oregon Health and Science University, to improve our tsunami detection and warning system and to make available the resources necessary to adequately prepare, inform, and protect U.S. citizens.  The U.S. has the tools to establish a top-notch national tsunami warning system and hazard mitigation program. Oregon universities are leading the way in tsunami research, and the practical applications of this research must be used. Our region, and the other vulnerable areas in the Nation, will benefit from better knowledge about the tracking, forecasting, and effects of tsunami waves. I look forward to the implementation of the Tsunami Preparedness Act and to reviewing the first annual report to Congress on the status and progress of work on this issue.  The committee amendment was agreed to.                           Amendment No. 1101                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)  The amendment (No. 1101) was agreed to.  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of Amendments.'')  The bill (S. 50), as amended, was read the third time, and passed.                          ____________________
