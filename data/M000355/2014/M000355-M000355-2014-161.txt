 President, I rise today to honor and congratulate my good friend, Mira Ball. On June 5, Mira will receive the Midway College Legacy Award for her many contributions and years of service to Midway College, located in Midway, KY.  Mira is the first ever recipient of this award, which will be given out at the Inaugural Spotlight awards in June. The purpose of the Legacy Award is to recognize ``a person or persons that have impacted Midway College over a period of many years by giving time, service, support and/or resources.'' With such a description, it's no wonder that Mira was the first in line to receive it.  Mira's contributions to Midway College, which is Kentucky's only women's college and a leader in degree programs for men and women, are aplenty. She has served on the board of trustees since 1990, became the first woman to chair the board in 1997, and was honored to be elected a life trustee in 2000. Last year, she served as interim chair while the institution was in a transitional period.  Even with her devotion to Midway College, Mira has amazingly found time to pursue a multitude of other interests and causes. She became the first woman president of the Lexington Chamber of Commerce in 1991 and was also the first woman to chair the University of Kentucky board of trustees, a post she occupied from 2007 to 2010. If you hadn't noticed, my friend Mira has never been afraid to be the first to do anything.  Additionally, Mira has been one of our State's strongest advocates for education reform, and she currently serves on the endowment board of Kentucky Educational Television, KET. She is also an involved member of the Calvary Baptist Church and is an active philanthropist to health care and education groups.  Somehow, amidst this seemingly endless stream of extracurricular activities, Mira carves out some time for her day job. She serves as the chief financial officer for the very successful Ball Homes LLC homebuilders, which she runs with her husband, Don, and their three children--Ray Ball, Mike Ball, and Lisa Ball Sharp. In addition to their children, Mira and Don have seven grandchildren--making for a wonderful family that is undoubtedly her biggest achievement of all.  Mira's tireless efforts to better the lives of others deserve the recognition of this body. Thus, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring Mira Ball, and congratulating her for being the first-ever recipient of the prestigious Midway College Legacy Award.                          ____________________
