 President, let us continue that work today. The Republican-led Senate has made important strides to get the legislative process functioning again. We know the impact that can have on restoring the appropriations process. We also know cooperation is going to be important as we move forward.  It was good to see our Democratic colleagues yesterday, recently pledging cooperation in the appropriations process, writing that this ``is a win-win opportunity, and we should seize it together.''  I have been pleased to see the headway that has already been made by the Appropriations Committee. The committee has held dozens of hearings so far and, later this morning, members will mark up 2 more of the 12 funding bills, adding to the two the committee has already reported out unanimously. We will continue floor consideration of one of those unanimously endorsed measures today: the energy security and water infrastructure funding bill.  The legislation before us includes provisions that impact each of our States. It will support our waterway infrastructure, boost energy innovation, and promote American competitiveness. It will strengthen national security and support our nuclear security program. It will also reduce wasteful spending.  I appreciate the leadership of Senators Alexander and Feinstein on this bill and recognize the hard work and research that have gone into it. I also appreciate the Appropriations chairman, Senator Cochran, for working with Senator Mikulski to move these appropriations bills through committee and to the floor. This is a responsible bipartisan bill. It invests in the future of American energy and waterways. It will keep our country safe. So let's continue working today to advance it.                          ____________________
