 Speaker, this is really an incredible rule. What we have been hearing for the last year and what we will be hearing shortly is that the leadership here in the Congress thinks that we should make savage cuts in Medicare, force elderly people who do not have the money to pay more for premiums. Meanwhile, they are suggesting that we spend $13 billion more for the military than the President wants. Do not you think the American people are entitled to that debate on priorities? The Republican majority wants to savage Medicaid; 88 million people will no longer have health insurance. Children will be without health insurance. Elderly people will be unable to pay for their prescription drugs.                              {time}  1315  Mr. Speaker, I ask, ``Don't you think we should have a debate as to whether or not we cut military spending, or we salvage Medicaid?''  I think the American people want that debate.  Maybe they will agree with our colleagues. Maybe they think we should spend more money on star wars and B-2 bombers and less money on health care; maybe our colleagues are right. I do not think they are. But I think that is a debate that we should have.  Mr. Speaker, all over America, middle-class families are desperate. In Vermont they are knocking their brains out trying to figure out how they can afford to send their kids to college. Meanwhile the Republican leadership is cutting back on loans and grants.  I think the American people, the middle class of this country, has a right to decide whether we put more money into education or whether we continue to spend a hundred billion dollars a year defending Europe and Asia against a nonexistent enemy.  Mr. Speaker, some of the cuts that have been advocated here by the Republican leadership are cruel, they are unnecessary. It seems to me that before we go after nutrition programs for children, we take a hard look at the military budget. We have a right to have that debate.  Defeat this rule.
