 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the previous order under the provisions of S. Res. 534 as a further mark of respect to William L. Armstrong, former United States Senator from Colorado.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:04 p.m., adjourned until Thursday, July 14, 2016, at 9:30 a.m.                          ____________________
