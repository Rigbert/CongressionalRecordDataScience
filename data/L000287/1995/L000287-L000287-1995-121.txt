Mr. Speaker, it is very important that we come here tonight to talk about the President's nominee for Surgeon General, Dr. Henry Foster. Now, a lot has been said about Dr. Foster, but I don't think people truly understand Dr. Foster. Dr. Foster has spent a lifetime making our country a better place.  First, let me say that I think Dr. Foster is a fine choice for Surgeon General. Apparently, many other individuals and organizations do too, including the American Medical Association, which has praised him as ``a dedicated teacher, a dependable leader, and a concerned advocate for improving access to quality health care.'' I would like to include as part of the Record [[Page H1534]]  some of the letters of endorsement that have been sent on behalf of Dr. Foster.  I believe we need to stop for one moment and rethink this discussion about Dr. Foster. This should not and must not be a discussion about how many abortions Dr. Foster has performed. He performed a legal medical procedure. Those who oppose a woman's right to choose to have an abortion must take that fight somewhere else. Every woman in America has the right to choose--that is the law of the land. Dr. Foster has done nothing wrong.  In fact, Dr. Foster has done a great deal that is right. He is a leading authority on reducing infant mortality and preventing teen pregnancy and drug abuse. He has educated young people about contraception and preventive health care. He has worked to encourage children to quit smoking.  This is a man who has not been content to simply practice medicine, that is in itself a noble profession. Instead, he has looked in his community, seen that there are problems and has tried to help find solutions.  He created the I Have a Future program at Meharry Medical College, where he was dean of the medical school and acting president. Then I Have a Future program was recognized by President Bush as one of his Thousand Points of Light.  This is a program that helps give teenagers hope and steer them toward college instead of teenage pregnancy. This program works. It has changed Tonika East's life. Tonika lives in public housing and joined the I Have a Future program because as she said, ``everyone else was doing it.'' She is now student body president of her school and has traveled around the country visiting colleges she might attend.  Mr. Speaker, this is just one example among many. Dr. Foster has spent a lifetime working to improve the lives of others. Dr. Foster cares about this Nation and about the future of this country--our children.  It is clear to me that Dr. Foster should be confirmed as Surgeon General. There is too much important work to be done in our country to waste any more time on this.  There is no confusion here. There are no more questions that need to be answered. Dr. Foster should be confirmed. And he should be confirmed now.  Mr. Speaker, I include the following material, which is supportive of Dr. Foster's confirmation:                                 American Medical Association,                                    Chicago, IL, February 2, 1995.     Hon. William J. Clinton,     President of the United States,     The White House, Washington, DC       Dear Mr. President: The American Medical Association      enthusiastically supports the nomination of Henry W. Foster,      Jr., MD for the position of Surgeon General of the U.S.      Public Health Service.       Dr. Foster is a leading expert in the field of reproductive      health. As Chief of the Department of Obstetrics and      Gynecology at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital of      Tuskegee University, Dr. Foster developed a program which is      a nationally recognized model for regionalized perinatal      health care systems. During his tenure at Meharry Medical      College, Dr. Foster founded the innovative ``I Have A      Future'' program to address teen pregnancy which brought to      focus one of the nation's most pressing public health issues.      The ``I Have A Future'' program provides strategies for at-     risk youth to develop positive decision-making in the areas      of personal health and responsibility, while enhancing their      self-image. With so many of our nation's youth in crisis, we      need creative programs like this one to dramatically reduce      the alarming rate of teen pregnancy and we applaud Dr.      Foster's commitment to this issue. Adolescent health has long      been a public health priority for the AMA and we look forward      to working with Dr. Foster on this and other critical public      health issues.       Dr. Foster is a dedicated teacher, a dependable leader, and      a concerned advocate for improving access to quality health      care for women and underserved populations. Dr. Foster has      been a longstanding member of the AMA and he brings the      requisite experience, knowledge, and commitment to provide      effective leadership as the Surgeon General. We firmly      believe that Dr. Foster will serve in the position of Surgeon      General with distinction and make many positive contributions      to the nation's public health.           Sincerely,     James S. Todd, MD.                                                                    ____                                 National Medical Association,                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1995.     The President,     The White House, Washington, DC       Dear Mr. President: The National Medical Association (NMA)      strongly supports the nomination of Henry Foster, M.D. as      United States Surgeon General. As an active NMA member, Dr.      Foster's service has been exemplary and his work has served      as a national model that is being replicated in various      segments of health care.       The NMA believes that Dr. Foster's presence as U.S. Surgeon      General will greatly enhance the Administration's ability and      capacity to protect the health and welfare of our nation and      applauds your excellent selection.           Sincerely,                                        Tracy M. Walton, Jr., M.D.     President.                                                                    ____                                        The Assocation of Minority                                   Health Professions Schools,                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1995.       The Association of Minority Health Professions Schools      (AMHPS) today expressed its support for the nomination of      Henry Foster, MD as the Surgeon General of the United States.       AMHPS President, Dr. Henry Lewis stated, ``Dr. Foster is a      national leader in medicine and research. His efforts to      develop programs for the education and academic enrichment of      young people, particularly minorities, have been commendable.      Dr. Foster's ``I Have a Future'' program at Nashville's      Meharry Medical College is truly a national model.''       Dr. Foster is a former acting president of Meharry Medical      College. Meharry is an institutional member of AMHPS, which      represents the nation's Historically Black medical, dental,      pharmacy and veterinary schools.                                                                    ____                                         Association of Schools of                                                Public Health,                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1995.     Hon. William Clinton,     President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the deans of the 27      graduate schools of public health in the nation, I wish to go      on record in support of Dr. Henry Foster as U.S. Surgeon      General. Dr. Foster is well known and respected by the      academic public health community for his work with the      underserved and for his keen understanding the role      prevention plays in reducing morbidity and delaying      mortality. He is a recognized leader in the health      professions education field and will, no doubt, contribute      greatly to fulfilling the administration's primary care and      public health workforce goals.       The Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) is the      only national organization representing the deans, faculty,      and students of this nation's 27 accredited schools of public      health in the United States and Puerto Rico. These schools      have a combined faculty of over 2,000 and educate more than      13,000 students annually from every state in the U.S. and      most countries throughout the world. The 27 schools graduate      approximately 4,000 public health professionals each year.       ASPH's principal purpose is to improve the public's health      by advancing professional and graduate education, research      and service in public health.           Sincerely,                                  Harvey V. Fineberg, M.D., Ph.D.,     President.                                                                    ____                                           American College of                                          Preventive Medicine,                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1995.     Hon. William J. Clinton,     President of the United States,     The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear President Clinton: The American College of Preventive      Medicine is pleased to support the nomination of Henry      Foster, MD, for the position of Surgeon General of the United      States.

Dear Mr. President: We, the faculty, staff and students of      the Graduate School of Public Health would like to      enthusiastically endorse the appointment of Henry Foster,      M.D. for the position of Surgeon General.       He brings a broad experience in prevention and public      health as well as practice of clinical medicine.       We believe he is an excellent choice.           Sincerely,                                         Donald R. Mattison, M.D.,     Dean.                                                                    ____                                  Department of Public Health,                                 Des Moines, IA, February 2, 1995.     Hon. Donna Shalala,     Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.       Dear Secretary Shalala: It has come to our attention that      Dr. Henry W. Foster may become our nation's next Surgeon      General. On behalf of the Association of State and      Territorial Health Officials, I would like to indicate our      support for this choice and offer any assistance we can in      assuring Dr. Foster's success.       The office of Surgeon General has the conscience of our      nation's health system. Surgeon Generals have advanced public      awareness of the dangers of smoking, unprotected sex and teen      pregnancy. No simple issues with forgone conclusions. Today,      with health system changes abroad, the need for the public      conscience has never been greater, and the need for public      health to support this articulation never more imperative.       Dr. Foster's life experience in both urban and rural      settings equip him well to understand the diversity of our      nation. Moreover, his clinical, academic and administrative      responsibilities have prepared him well to ensure that our      nation's response to the issues, particularly, of teen      pregnancy and primary care, are appropriate, workable and      effective.       As we see a renewed emphasis on state based planning and      community delivery of human services, the state health      officers and ASTHO recognize the need for a clear      articulation of national interests, strategies and      objectives. We believe that Dr. Foster can be a positive      force in ensuring that this outcome is achieved.           Respectfully,                                          Christopher G. Atchison,                                                         Director.  Mr. Speaker, what I would like to do right now is to yield to my good friend, the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Clement], from the city of Nashville, who has the great privilege of representing Dr. Foster in this body.
