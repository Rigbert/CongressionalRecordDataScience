 Now, that is good, but it is not good enough. Since we have a 5-year window, we should patch AMT for all 5 years. My amendment is to make sure that AMT is patched 2013 and 2014 so that the entire 5-year period has an AMT patch.  This would provide tax relief to 18 million families at a cost of $114 billion. This patch is essential to honest budgeting because we all know that the AMT will eventually pass without being patched. This amendment also helps families plan their financial affairs properly, rather than leave them guessing as to what their future tax burden will be.  Also, by giving greater stability to this area of the tax law, tax professionals will administer the law better, leading to better compliance and a smaller tax gap.  I ask support for this amendment to patch AMT for 2013 and 2014, and I yield the floor.
