Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of the 43d Congressional District is unparalleled. My district has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give of their time and talents to make their communities a better place to live and work. Mr. David Goldware was first among these individuals. He died last week at the age of 81.  David Goldware was a man who never shied away from becoming involved from helping others and helping his community. He was a strong advocate for the less fortunate, for his community, and the country he loved. David Goldware served with honor in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and was decorated with a presidential unit citation for saving the life of a fellow crewman when their ship was torpedoed. After leaving the Navy, he continued this commitment to his country through his involvement with veterans' issues. When the Riverside National Cemetery fell into disrepair a few years ago, David helped put together any army of volunteers to clean up the cemetery and maintain the grounds.  He was also active in many community organizations, including B'nai B'rith, Temple Beth El, City of Hope, Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce, United Way, Boy Scouts of America, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Riverside Community Hospital Foundation, and the Janet Goeske Senior Center. His good deeds and work in the community would fill pages and pages were I to try and list them all. David's outstanding accomplishments made everyone who met him proud to call him a friend, community leader, and fellow American.  David was a wonderful guy--he brightened up every room and every person he met. He became the unofficial historian at every event he attended because he always had his camera with him. I have pictures in my desk drawer that David sent to me of a charity event in Riverside that were taken just a few days before his death. As always, David was there with his camera and a smile for everyone he met.  David would have agreed that his greatest accomplishment was his family. He married his wife, June, in 1942 and together they raised two wonderful sons. She has recently preceded him in death. My deepest condolences go to David's sons, Michael and Nick. My thoughts and prayers are with them. David Goldware will be sorely missed--I don't know how you replace someone like him. The 43d Congressional District, and I, have lost a dear friend. We can best honor him by trying to meet the same high standard he set as a patriot, citizen, and friend.                          ____________________
