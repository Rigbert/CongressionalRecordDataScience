 President, I rise today, as I do every year, to commemorate the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. It has now been 88 years since this tragic event unfolded, and after another year, the historical fact of this atrocity continues to be questioned.  April 24, 1915, marked the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's brutal and unconscionable policy of mass murder, directed against men, women and children Armenians. Over 8 years, Armenians faced starvation, deportation, and violent death at the hands of their own government. Before the genocide began, 2.5 million Armenians lived in the Ottoman Empire. One and a half million Armenians were killed and another 500,000 were driven from their homes, their property and land confiscated.  Many descendants of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide live in the United States, and some actual survivors settled in my own State of California. Overall, half a million Armenian Americans live in California, and I am proud to serve them in the Senate. The strength and importance of their community exemplifies how any group of people can be reborn in the United States. Armenian Americans are at the forefront of the effort to keep the events of the Armenian Genocide in the public eye, but it is the duty of us all, as citizens of a nation that embodies justice, liberty, and freedom not to forget.  We must take time each year to acknowledge this act of ethnic cleansing because we cannot afford to forget. The 20th century saw too many genocides, the events in the Ottoman Empire being only the first. In Germany and Eastern Europe, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Serbia, millions of people were killed because of their race, ethnicity, or religion.  Through these tragedies, too many have remained silent. We must make clear, in the 21st century, that mass murder cannot be tolerated, will not be tolerated. We cannot afford to forget or hide events such as the Armenian Genocide, or another group in another place will experience the same persecution and the same systematic intent to destroy an entire people. This is why we must commemorate this horrific period in the history of the Armenian people each and every year.  Let us remember the Armenian Genocide. Let us ensure that those who suffered did not die in vain. Let us ensure that those who survived did not do so to watch the world forget their sufferings. We honor the living by speaking out today.                          ____________________
