 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed immediately to the executive session to consider the following nominations on the Executive Calendar: No. 401, and nominations on the Secretary's desk in the Army, Marine Corps, and Navy.  I finally ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record, that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.
