 President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas.  The budget resolution before us has been termed an historic document. It certainly is. For the last decade, the Congress of the United States has recognized that our public lands are too precious to sell unless their sale is in the best interest of the public. That is good policy and one that has enjoyed strong bi-partisan support.  But it is a new day. Today, we may well vote to sell our children's heritage to pay our debts. I reject that approach [[Page S7222]] to debt reduction and I reject that approach to disposition of our Federal assets.  What is at risk? Potentially on the sale block are assets ranging from oil supplies beneath the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; to battlefields reminding us of the pain and sacrifice of the Civil War; to Power Marketing Associations that provide hydroelectric energy, transportation, and resource protection; to endangered wildlife living in our National Wilderness Preservation System; to toll-free interstate highways present in every State in the Nation; to public timber sold primarily to small businesses dependent upon National Forests for their wood supply.  These assets should not be sold to reduce the deficit. And they, certainly, should not be sold to provide a tax cut to wealthy Americans. Instead, our Federal assets should be sold only when, after reasoned debate and a full public airing, we decide their sale is in the best interest not only of this generation--but of every generation that follows. We owe our children much more than a balanced budget. We owe them their heritage.  I urge my colleagues to vote first for Senator Bumper's amendment precluding scoring of the sale of all Federal assets.  While I have the floor I want to just mention two other amendments I will be offering tomorrow that my colleagues will be voting on.              sense of the senate resolution on impact aid
