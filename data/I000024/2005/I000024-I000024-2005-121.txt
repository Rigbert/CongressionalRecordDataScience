HARKIN. Since I am on my time, the Senator can get his own time to respond.  That is why we need to codify it. I think the Senator has put his finger on it. That is why our amendment is necessary. It takes the DOD directive, what is in writing, and codifies it and makes it law. That way there won't be any confusion. That way we will know whether they are living up to their own words. Secondly, putting in an ombudsman--not ``may,'' what the Senator says in his amendment--will do the following: That person will be appointed by the Secretary of Defense; not engage in any censorship; conduct reviews of integrity, balance, and fairness; respond to program issues raisedby the audience; make suggestions regarding ways to correct imbalances; and, most importantly, prepare and present an annual report to the Secretary of Defense and Congress on whether American Forces Radio is satisfying its mandate to provide fair and balanced political programming.  The Senator, by his own words, shows why this is necessary. All of a sudden we hear there is a policy. It is not written down. We have never heard of it before. Yet we know what is happening.  I repeat for emphasis: On the 33 stations around the world, we have 100 percent Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura and James Dobson, and zero percent of any kind of progressive radio. I don't care how you cut it, slice it, dice it, or excuse it, this is unfair. This is censorship. This is propagandizing our troops. They deserve better than that.  I yield the floor.
