 President, I am not going to respond to the substance of the amendment but to give some background on where we have come over the last 5 or 6 years on this legislation for the consideration of people who will want to debate against the amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts.  I suggest to you that when Senator Heflin from Alabama was a Member of the Senate, he and I served as either chairman or ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on courts that has jurisdiction over bankruptcy issues for the period of time that he and I served together in the Senate, which, I think, was 16 years--1980 to 1996.  Just prior to that time, and my coming to the Senate, the Senate had adopted the last bankruptcy reform legislation, which I think was in 1978 or 1979.  During the period of time he and I served as either chairman or ranking member--depending upon which party was in the majority--he and I sponsored some technical corrections and some small changes to the last major overhaul of the bankruptcy law. But as time went on, into the early 1990s, Senator Heflin and I came to the conclusion that there were changes in the economy--the globalization of the economy and a lot of other reasons--and that we ought to give considerable attention to greater changes of the bankruptcy code rather than the very small changes we enacted from time to time during the 1980s.  He and I also came to the conclusion we would probably not have the time, as the two Senators shouldering the responsibilities on bankruptcy legislation, to do it through our subcommittee. So we set up the Bankruptcy Commission of which this legislation we are dealing with now is a product. That commission was not made up of any Members of Congress. It was made up of appointees by legislative leaders and by the President of the United States.
