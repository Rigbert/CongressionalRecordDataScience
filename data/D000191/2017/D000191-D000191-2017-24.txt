So do the math. The President can do math. He is a businessman. That would be 540,000 jobs if we delivered on the President's promise to make significant new investments with Federal partnership in clean water in America.  So, we can put together health, cleaning up the environment, and jobs, as opposed to the Republican bill, which deteriorates health, deteriorates the environment and protections, and won't create any jobs.  Just one quick quote here: ``The Clean Water State Revolving Fund is a perfect example of the type of program that should be reauthorized because it creates jobs while benefiting the environment, and is an efficient return on taxpayer investment.''  That is from the Oregon Water Resources Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I will conclude as we proceed to this absurdity of saying, by deteriorating health, we will create jobs.
