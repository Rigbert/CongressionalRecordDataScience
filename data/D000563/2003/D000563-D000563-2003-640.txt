President, I would like to take a moment to commend U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson for his recent announcement that the United States' delegation to the World Health Assembly would support the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the world's first global tobacco treaty.  As we know, tobacco is the leading preventable cause of death in the world today.  According to the World Health Organization almost five million people die each year from tobacco related illnesses.  As tobacco use continues to grow at alarming rates around the world, the death toll is expected to rise to 10 million people per year by 2030, with 70 percent of these deaths occurring in developing countries.  Clearly, we must give greater attention to the reality of the harmful effects of tobacco use.  The United States has traditionally been a world leader in tobacco control efforts, often providing the science and expertise to demonstrate the harms of tobacco and the public health efforts needed to reduce tobacco use.  As one who has long advocated for extensive tobacco control measures to stop the spread of tobacco use around the world, I was pleased when the United States joined other WHO member states in treaty negotiations.  These negotiations have been on-going for nearly four years.  As a result of that hard work, the final draft of the Framework Convention was overwhelmingly approved on March 1, 2003, by 171 WHO member states.  The Framework Convention contains a wide range of provisions aimed at controlling tobacco marketing and consumption and identifies sound public health policies for countries to adopt or strengthen.  These include two particularly strong requirements: No. 1, a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, with an exception for nations with constitutional constraints; and No. 2, the implementation of health warning labels covering at least 30 percent, but ideally 50 percent or more, of the display area on tobacco product packaging.  In addition, the FCTC calls upon countries to ban misleading language that gives the false impression that the product is less harmful than others, such as ``mild,'' ``light,'' or ``low tar''; significantly raise tobacco taxes; provide smoke-free public spaces and workplaces; consider using litigation to hold the tobacco industry liable for its wrongdoings.  Collectively, these provisions provide nations with a roadmap for enacting strong, science-based policies that can save lives and improve health across the world.  It is for these reasons that I rise today to applaud the efforts of Secretary Thompson and to commend him for advancing the cause of international health. He has rode to the rescue.  The press reports coming out of these meetings suggested the United States was not going to be fully engaged and fully involved in the development of this important global standard related to the use of tobacco. Secretary Thompson arrived on the scene and came in quickly with good news.  Only with concerted action can we avert millions of premature deaths and prevent future generations of young people from falling victim to the tobacco epidemic.  The Framework Convention has brought nations of the world together to combat this global epidemic.  But, this is the only the first step.  Now, it is imperative that the United States continue to play an active role in the effective implementation of this treaty.  This begins with signing and ratifying the Framework Convention.  I will be working in the United States Senate to make sure we do our part in this process.  And I hope the Administration will follow the lead of Secretary Thompson and will do their part as well.  I am confident that working together, we can reduce the terrible toll in health, lives, and money that tobacco use takes around the world.                          ____________________
