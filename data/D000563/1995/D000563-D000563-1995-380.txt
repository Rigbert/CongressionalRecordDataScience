Chairman, I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Louisiana, for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I would say to the committee that I have a different position on the death penalty than the gentleman who has offered the amendment. I favor the death penalty, he opposes it, but I still believe he offers a valuable amendment.  If Members believe in the bedrock of the American judicial system, it is trial by jury. It is a decision by America's citizens as to the guilt or innocence of an individual.  What the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Fields] is suggesting is that that jury, under the most heinous crimes and heinous circumstances, would be given two options and not one. Under the bill, they have only one option, the death penalty. Under the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Fields], they have a second option of life in prison without parole.  It strikes me we are dealing with factors that are somewhat subjective, aggravating and mitigating factors. I think that if we believe in the Constitution and the bedrock of our judicial system, we give to that jury these two options.  Both options protect society from those individuals who have committed such violent crimes that we no longer want to see them on the streets or in our neighborhoods, but I think it is reasonable to offer this option. I salute my colleague, the gentleman from Louisiana, for offering that option.  I hope that my colleagues, despite their fervor over the death penalty, will understand that this gets to the [[Page H1430]] bedrock principle of justice in this country, whether or not a decision is to be made by a jury of a person's peers.
