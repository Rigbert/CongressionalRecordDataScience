 President, on another matter, last night we saw the latest example of committees getting back to work in a new Congress--getting back to work for the American people. The Finance Committee passed an important bipartisan bill, trade promotion authority, with broad support from both parties, 20 to 6--20 to 6. The chairman and ranking member of that committee, Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden, worked hard to achieve the result we saw last night.  Along with Chairman Ryan in the House, they put together an agreement that reflects the kind of honest compromise they can take pride in. It protects and enhances the role of Congress in the trade negotiating process, while ensuring that Presidents of either party--and I would remind our colleagues that this is a 6-year trade promotion authority bill. It will give to the next President the opportunity to negotiate additional trade agreements and send them to Congress for approval.  These agreements can boost our economy and support more high-quality American jobs. Now, this bipartisan bill will move to the Senate floor. It is my hope to pass it during the current work period.                          ____________________
