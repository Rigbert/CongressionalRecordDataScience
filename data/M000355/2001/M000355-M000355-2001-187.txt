 President, listening carefully to the Senator from Connecticut trying to explain the previous nonseverability clauses that passed in 1992 and 1993, those nonseverability clauses included the whole bill, so that if any little portion of the bill that cleared the Senate in 1990, cleared the Senate in 1992, cleared the Senate in 1993, if any little portion of that bill was unconstitutional, the whole bill fell.  As I understand the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Louisiana, the whole bill does not fall. It carefully tied the two relevant parts of the amendment, the Snowe-Jeffords language and the party soft money ban.
