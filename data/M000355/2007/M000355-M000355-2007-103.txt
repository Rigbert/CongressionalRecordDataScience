 President, we are now in the sixth week of the 2008 fiscal year, and the majority still hasn't sent a single funding bill to the President for the 2007 fiscal year. It has been 20 years--20 years--since Congress has waited this late in the year to send a single appropriations bill to the President. The Veterans appropriations bill, for example, passed the Senate 2 months ago but is still sitting in Congress.  So why do our friends on the other side of the aisle continue to drag their feet on this very important measure? We know everyone agrees the bill is important and needed. We know our veterans have sacrificed for our country, and it is our duty--our duty--to provide for them. We know the bill holds wide bipartisan support, and the military construction part of the bill is important for providing housing, readiness, and improved quality of life for our troops. We also know the President will sign the veterans bill into law when he gets it. So why hasn't this bill been brought to the floor for a vote? Why haven't we had a vote on the veterans conference report? Shouldn't we put aside the gamesmanship and send this bill to the President so it can be signed before November 11, which happens to be Veterans Day?  The majority has decided it wants to tie the veterans bill, which will be signed into law, to the Labor bill, which is approximately $9 billion over the President's request, which, of course, will be vetoed. Now, some have said $9 billion is not much of a difference, but to put it into context, $9 billion is more than the individual budgets of 33 of our States. It is more than the entire yearly budget for the FBI. It is more than the budget of the U.S. Coast Guard. More than that, this figure will serve as a starting point for next year's budget, and that will serve as the starting point for the year after that. In short, this increase will compound into $120 billion in more Washington spending over the next 10 years.  To put this in context, for American taxpayers, for this same amount of money, we could have, instead, made permanent marriage penalty relief and permanent the expensing for small business and have increased taxpayers' standard deduction or we could have provided a 2-year alternative minimum tax patch.  So why attach a bill that overspends so dramatically it would not be signed into law and further postpone funding for our veterans? Our veterans deserve better. We shouldn't penalize them for the mismanagement and overspending of this Congress. We have a responsibility to send the veterans bill to the President at the earliest possible time. Providing funding to our veterans by Veterans Day, November 11, is still a realistic and attainable goal, and Congress should do it.  The election was 1 year ago. It is time to get serious about funding our veterans. We must remember our current force is composed entirely of volunteers, and they have earned our support. If our colleagues are serious, they will bring the veterans bill to the floor. No gimmicks, no games. Let us get it done before Veterans Day.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
