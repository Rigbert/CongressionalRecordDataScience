 I do this because it states the sense of the Senate that the budget resolution assumes a series of long-term entitlement reforms, including reducing the CPI by one-half a percentage point each year, which would cut Social Security spending by about $38 billion over the next 6 years, and it would increase taxes by about $35 billion over that period.  The amendment also calls for increasing the retirement age for civilian and military retirees and Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries, COLA limits for very high civilian and military pensions, and partial privatization of Social Security.  On behalf of Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, I move to table the Kerrey amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.
