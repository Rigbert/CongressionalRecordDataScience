Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. I want to remind my fellow colleagues that this is a very well-crafted, bipartisan effort and this would disrupt what I would say is a great chariot that is going to go off on to the horizon and become law.  Mr. Speaker, I oppose the motion.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas).
