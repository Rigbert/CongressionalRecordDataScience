President, when you serve as the Secretary of Treasury, you are charged with a variety of responsibilities, and right at the center of your duties is to address taxes. This is an area that the nominee to head the Treasury Department, Mr. Steven Mnuchin, waded into very early on after his nomination became public.  News leaked on November 29 of last year that Mr. Mnuchin was the President-elect's choice for Secretary of the Treasury. The very next day, Mr. Mnuchin appeared on a CNBC program and confirmed his selection. During an extended interview with CNBC, he introduced what I have come to call the Mnuchin rule. I will quote Mr. Mnuchin directly with respect to what he said: ``Any reductions we have in upper income taxes would be offset by less deductions, so there would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.''  I will repeat that last part of the Mnuchin rule: ``no absolute tax cut for the upper class.''  Mr. Mnuchin is the President's nominee for Treasury Secretary. This is a position that has been held by American economic giants like Alexander Hamilton, Albert Gallatin, Salmon Chase, Henry Morgenthau and Lloyd Bentsen. When a nominee for Treasury Secretary makes a pledge like Mr. Mnuchin's, it really ought to mean something. It ought to stand for something.  Unfortunately, it already looks as though the Mnuchin rule is on the ropes. The very first act of the 115th Congress and a unified Republican government, repealing the Affordable Care Act, shatters the Mnuchin rule.  The Affordable Care Act repeal scheme that Republicans kicked off months ago, in my view, is a Trojan horse of tax breaks for the most fortunate. Nobody outside the top 4 or 5 percent of earners would get any of that break. Most of it would go to households in the top 1 percent of earners--even then, the top one-tenth of 1 percent--and it is paid for by taking insurance coverage and tax cuts for health care literally out of the hands of millions of working people.  Then it is back for another whack at the Mnuchin rule later this year. Last week, the New York Times published a story talking about Mr. Mnuchin, which said that ``his guarantee appears impossible to fulfill either under the tax overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or similar, sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article titled ``Treasury Nominee Vows No Tax Cut for Rich. Math Says the Opposite.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             [Feb. 9, 2017]   Treasury Nominee Vows No Tax Cut for Rich. Math Says the Opposite.                          (By Patricia Cohen)       The newly christened ``Mnuchin rule''--the assurance given      by the Treasury nominee Steven T. Mnuchin that ``there would      be no absolute tax cut for the upper class''--seems as if it      was made to be broken.       Mr. Mnuchin initially made the statement during an      interview on CNBC in November,     after President Trump chose him for the cabinet. At Mr.      Mnuchin's confirmation hearing, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon      Democrat, rebranded the comment as a ``rule,'' transforming a      throwaway line into a formal pledge.       Whether it will be kept may become clearer in two or three      weeks--the timing Mr. Trump mentioned Thursday for delivering      a ``phenomenal'' tax plan.       Although Mr. Mnuchin said any rate reductions at the top      would be offset by the closing of fat loopholes, his      guarantee appears impossible to fulfill either under the tax      overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or similar,      sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered.       Redesigning the tax code with an eye fixed on lower rates      has been a Republican mission for decades, and one that Mr.      Trump adopted. That prospect, combined with a promised      regulatory retreat, has pumped up the stock market and fueled      optimism among business leaders.       At the same time, the president has raised expectations      among his working-class supporters that ``the rich will pay      their fair share,'' and that ``special-interest loopholes      that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and for      people like me, but unfair to American workers'' will be      eliminated. Mr. Mnuchin, soon to be one of the      administration's top economic policy officials, promised ``a      big tax cut for the middle class.''       Yet analyses of the president's and the House Republicans'      plans consistently conclude that the wealthy will receive the      largest tax cuts by far.       Start with the House blueprint, which at the moment is the      closest thing to a working draft that exists. The nonpartisan      Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and      Brookings Institution, found ``high-income taxpayers would      receive the biggest cuts, both in dollar terms and as a      percentage of income.''       How big? ``Three-quarters of the tax cuts would benefit the      top 1 percent of taxpayers,'' if the plan were put into      effect this year, it said. The highest-income households--the      top 0.1 percent--would get ``an average tax cut of about $1.3      million, 16.9 percent of after-tax income.''       Those in the middle fifth of incomes would get a tax cut of      almost $260, or 0.5 percent, while the poorest would get      about $50.       That split would worsen down the road, the Tax Policy      Center says: ``In 2025 the top 1 percent of households would      receive nearly 100 percent of the total tax reduction.''       Those wary of any potential liberal bias could turn to the      conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. Its analysis found a      smaller gap between the wealthy and everyone else, but a gap      nonetheless. The foundation concluded that four out of five      taxpayers would see only a 0.2 to 0.5 percent increase in      after-tax income, while those in the top 1 percent of the      income scale would save at least 10 times as much, or 5.3      percent. That's nearly $40,000 extra for those at the top,      compared to $67 for those smack dab in the middle of the      income scale.       ``The Mnuchin rule is already being broken as Republicans      look to strip away hundreds of billions of dollars in      Affordable Care Act tax credits for working Americans to pay      for a giant tax break for the wealthy,'' Senator Wyden said.      ``Bottom line is it's unfair to cut benefits that the middle      class depends on, all so the wealthy pay a lower rate.''       Mr. Mnuchin did not respond to a request for comment.       Republicans argue their plan makes everyone a winner--that      lower taxes will unleash an enormous swell of economic      growth, raising wages, incomes and tax revenue all around.       The historical record does not offer much support for the      claim that slashing taxes for the most affluent creates      growth. Yet even assuming the rosiest of forecasts, the top 1      percent, according to the Tax Foundation, would still receive      close to a $l00,000 tax cut--32 times as much as a middle-     income family.       Mr. Mnuchin has offered his own formula for adhering to the      standard he laid down, explaining that ``any reductions we      have in upper-income taxes would be offset by less      deductions.''       That would require some otherworldly mathematical magic,      however.       Consider the list of proposals that would reduce taxes on      the rich:       Cut the top income to 33 percent, from 39.6 percent.       Cut taxes on capital gains, 70 percent of which flow to the      top 1 percent.       Eliminate the estate tax, which applies to a tiny number of      people, couples that have estates bigger than $10.8 million.       Eliminate the 3.8 percent surtax on high earners'      investment income that has been used to subsidize health care      for poorer Americans.       End the alternative minimum tax, which currently limits      deductions for high earners.       Lower taxes on cash flow and income that passes from small      businesses to their owners, which also primarily benefits      wealthier Americans.       Now, what deductions could be eliminated that would offset      all those cuts at the top? There aren't many, said Alan      Viard, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise      Institute. If Republicans insist on lowering taxes on top      wages, capital gains, estates and cash-flow and pass-through      income as advertised, ``there's not a lot of latitude to      limit itemized deductions further,'' Mr. Viard said.       Any plan to curb itemized deductions would be partly offset      by Mr. Trump's plan to increase the standard deduction.      Curtailing mortgage deductions for the most expensive homes      is probably a good idea, Mr. Viard said, but that isn't going      to do much to raise revenue from those at the top of the      income pyramid, and the deduction is already roughly limited      to the interest paid on $1 million in mortgage debt.       Such alternative ideas, however, assume that the Mnuchin      rule will have a meaningful impact on what the White House      will propose or Congress will debate. Not everyone is      convinced that it will. As Mr. Viard said, ``I don't know how      much interest there is in fulfilling that statement by      Mnuchin, however it's interpreted.''
