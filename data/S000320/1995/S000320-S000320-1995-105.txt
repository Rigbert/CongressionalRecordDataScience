 President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's attention a resolution adopted by the National Conference of State Legislatures in opposition to the preemption of State tort law. The conference stated that ``no comprehensive evidence exists demonstrating either that State product liability laws have created a problem of such dimension that a Federal solution is warranted or that Federal legislation would achieve its stated goals.'' Mr. President, the conference went on to state that they ``strongly oppose[s] all legislation before Congress that would have the effect of preempting State laws regulating recovery for injuries caused by defective products.''  I believe that the Senate would be wise to listen to position of the conference of State Legislatures, made up of legislators from all 50 States. The Senate should not federalize our Nation's tort system and destroy over 200 years of State law. I urge my colleagues to heed the advice of our Nation's State legislators. I ask that a resolution adopted by the National Conference of State Legislatures be printed in the Record.  The resolution follows: National Conference of State Legislatures Resolution Adopted July 20,                                   1995       NCSL has reviewed proposed federal legislation that would      preempt state law by severely restricting the rights of      persons injured by defective products to seek recovery in      state courts. Such legislation fails to meet the standards      necessary for federal preemption.       In particular, no comprehensive evidence exists      demonstrating either that state product liability laws have      created a problem of such dimension that a federal solution      is warranted or that federal legislation would achieve its      stated goals. NCSL believes that the proposed legislation      would create serious new problems in the field of product      liability by dictating a single set of rules controlling the      timeliness of claims and the admissibility of evidence. It      would conflict with long-standing state laws governing tort      liability, workers' compensation and insurance regulations.      By doing so, such proposals would place state legislatures      and state courts in an intolerable legal straightjacket.       Therefore, in conformance with our general policy in      opposition to federal preemption of state law and in the      conviction that it is particularly improper for the federal      government to attempt to restrict citizen access to state      courts, the National Conference of State Legislatures      strongly opposes all legislation before Congress that would      have the effect of preempting state laws regulating recovery      for injuries caused by defective products.                               ____________________
