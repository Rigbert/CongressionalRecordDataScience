 President, today, the Senate will conduct a period of morning business. Last night, we were able to reach a time agreement on the Oman free trade bill, and Senators are encouraged to use that time this morning and then on Monday. We will have 30 minutes of debate on the trade bill remaining for Tuesday's session, and Senators should expect a vote on passage before the policy luncheons on Tuesday. That will be the first vote of the week. We are also attempting to clear some nominations and treaties for today, and we hope to have an agreement on those for later this morning.                          ____________________[Page S9649]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
