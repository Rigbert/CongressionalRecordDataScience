 It is, to my knowledge, the first time anyone came into the United States--this young Nigerian from a very prominent Nigerian family--wearing a diaper that had enough of this PETN, this new explosive, to blow up the plane. He missed in detonation and it caught on fire and the fire was put out.  There have been other incidents of trying to smuggle this PETN in cartridges of computers and they even had dogs going to the airport and they could not smell the explosive inside the computer cartridge. That was in Dubai. It is a very dangerous explosive. It is new, and it has been improved. It is something we need to be very wary of.  I also wish to point out that there is a public safety exception to Miranda. We do not have to Mirandize someone or we could continue to question them, if there is a public safety risk. So Mirandizing an individual is not a point in this argument, in my view, because we can continue the interrogation.  What is a point, in my argument, is that the FBI now has competence; that there is a group of special experts who can be flown to a place where someone is arrested and do initial interrogation. They are specifically trained and, to the best of my knowledge, they are effective at interrogating. My point is, the system is working, and we should keep it as it is.  I yield the floor.
