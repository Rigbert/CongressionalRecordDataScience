 President, back to the Time article. One would think there was no reason to tighten up the current system, that those of us who support bankruptcy reform--a large bipartisan majority--had lost our hearts, our souls, and possibly our minds. Some folks might find that easy to believe, but if they simply compare the language of the legislation to the case studies in the article, they will find that in virtually every significant claim and detail, the charges leveled against this reform legislation are not true. They are simply false; they are flat wrong; and they are easily and conclusively refuted by a quick look at the facts.  First, a little primer on the bankruptcy code reform. Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code requires a liquidation of any assets and a payout to as many creditors as possible from the proceeds. Chapter 13 allows the filer to keep a home, a car, and so on, but requires them to enter into a repayment plan. The irony is, chapter 13 was put in to help people from the rigors of chapter 7. I do not have time to go into that, but it is a basic premise that is missed by the article.  The bankruptcy reform legislation that is the cause for such alarm in this article asks a question that I think most Americans would be surprised to learn is never even asked under the present system. The question is: Do you have the ability to pay some of those debts that you want forgiven?  If the answer is yes, then you will have to file for bankruptcy under chapter 13 and have what they call a workout, a repayment plan. No one--I repeat, no one--who needs it would ever, as this article puts it, be denied bankruptcy assistance. That cannot happen now, and it will not happen under this legislation. So it is not the idea you are denied bankruptcy, it is how you file for bankruptcy--under chapter 7 or chapter 13.  Only a few filers of bankruptcy, no more than 10 percent of those now filing under chapter 7--maybe even less--would see any change at all in their status. Those who have demonstrated an ability to pay would be told to file under chapter 13 and would follow the kind of repayment plan their resources would allow.  A key point must be stressed: Chapter 13 is not some kind of debtor's prison. It is a practical solution to the problem of too many creditors chasing a debtor with too few resources. The article suggests that any change in the availability of chapter 7 will be the equivalent of the whip and the lash and the restoration of debtor's prison. The truth is different.  Chapter 13 was added to the bankruptcy code in the 1930s as the more desirable alternative to the draconian liquidation required under chapter 7. It was conceived as the ``wage earner's'' form of bankruptcy, for those who had an income and the ability to pay some of their creditors but who needed protection of the system to keep their creditors from hounding them.  Although this may seem like a quaint notion these days, it was intended to preserve some of the debtor's dignity at a time when bankruptcy carried more of a stigma for some people than it does today.  A profoundly mistaken view of the difference between chapter 7 and chapter 13 is not the most serious flaw inthis article. The real impact of this article comes from its stories of hard-working, honest, everyday American families who have fallen on hard times. These are the people who will, according to the article, find the door to a fresh start shut to them.  As disturbing as these stories are, they are all based on a demonstrably false premise. As the Senator from Iowa said, virtually none of the low- to moderate-income working families whose stories were so compellingly told in that article would be touched by the reforms affecting the availability of chapter 7.  That is right. In each and every case, given their income and their circumstances as presented, those families and individuals who were talked about in the article would still be eligible for chapter 7 protection. The central claims about the impact of bankruptcy reform on the families described in this article are flat wrong.  I know a lot of my colleagues have been concerned about these charges, and I urge them to take a simple test. Compare the financial circumstances of the individuals in the article and the stories that are told with the terms of our bankruptcy legislation. My colleagues will see the claims that these families will be cut off are not true.  They are wrong chiefly because the reform legislation contains what we call a safe harbor which preserves chapter 7, with no questions asked, for anyone earning the median income or less for the region in which they live. This is a protection I sought along with other supporters of bankruptcy reform. It was a key element of the Senate bill, and it has been accepted in conference.  There is even more protection: Those with up to 150 percent of the median income will be subject to only a cursory look at their income and obligations, not a more detailed examination.  These provisions provide that the door to chapter 7 remains open for just the kind of family the article claims will be most hurt.  I will not chronicle all of them, but I ask you to listen to this one story. Of all the cases chronicled in the article, I read most carefully the story of Allen Smith of Wilmington, DE, my hometown. A World War II veteran, he had worked in our Newark, DE, Chrysler plant until the downsizing of the 1980s cost him his job.  Struck by cancer, my constituent from Wilmington, DE, was also hit with the tragedy and expense of his wife's diabetes and then her death. Health care costs drove him deeper and deeper into debt, and he filed for bankruptcy under chapter 13. Further financial troubles led to the failure of his chapter 13 plan, and he was then switched to chapter 7 under which he will lose his home to pay some of his obligations.  I searched in vain to find any relevance of this profound human tragedy to the bankruptcy reform legislation. To the extent it has anything at all to do with the supposed point of the story, Mr. Smith's story is presented to show us someone who is going to lose his home in bankruptcy, because he is now in chapter 7, exactly what the authors previously argued should be the preferred chapter for individuals in his circumstances. His sad story is an argument for catastrophic health insurance, not against bankruptcy reform.  They contrast his case with that of a wealthy individual who uses the protection of the present bankruptcy code by purchasing an expensive home under Florida's unlimited homestead exemption to protect assets from creditors. One would never know it from reading the article, but in the Senate we voted to get rid of that unlimited exemption that now is in the law.  More recently, the conferees have agreed to eliminate precisely the kind of abuse criticized in this article. The article discusses at length a case that has nothing to do with reform but criticizes an abuse that is actually fixed by this reform bill.  There are other profound inconsistencies and factual errors in the article, including the assertion that medical expenses would not be considered in calculating a filer's ability to pay or would not be dischargeable after bankruptcy or that family support payments, such as child support or alimony, would be a lower priority than a credit card debt. None of these assertions is true.  However, without these errors, there would be no article.  In many cases, in terms of the new, additional protections for family support payments and improved procedures for reaffirmations, filers in the kind of circumstances chronicled in the other stories in this article would be better off, not worse off, when this legislation passes.  I know my colleagues have expressed their worries about this article. I truly ask them, look at the language of the legislation, look at the articles that are written, and you will find that, although this is not a perfect bill, that none of the families chronicled in that article would be affected at all except their circumstances improved, if in fact anything was to happen.  I know that my colleagues who have expressed their worries about this article are sincere in their concern about the fairness of bankruptcy reform legislation. I urge them to apply the simple test of fairness to this article, to compare the situations of those families in the article to the actual provisions in the bankruptcy reform legislation. They will find those families's access to the full protection of Chapter 7 unchanged by this bill.  I ask them to do it for themselves: they don't have to take my word for it.  This is not a perfect bill. It is not the even bill that I would have written by myself. But it is a bill that can pass that test.  I thank the Chair and I thank my colleagues assembled on the floor for the additional 4 minutes. I realize it is a tight day and time is of the essence. I appreciate their courtesy.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                    [Bankruptcy Criminal Cases 1999]                          U.S. Trustee Program  (Criminal Cases: The United States Trustee Program's duties include     policing the bankruptcy system for criminal activity, referring  suspected criminal cases to the appropriate law enforcement agencies,    and assisting in investigating and prosecuting those cases. Some    significant bankruptcy-related criminal cases are described here)                                  1999                                alabama       Attorney John C. Coggin III of Birmingham, Ala., was      sentenced July 26 to 36 months in prison for conspiracy      consisting of bankruptcy fraud, money laundering, and false      statements to a federal officer. Coggin hid more than      $200,000 that was due to creditors in his bankruptcy case,      using a corporation set up for that purpose.                                arizona       Bankruptcy petition preparer Richard S. Berry of Tempe,      Ariz., was sentenced April 20 in the District of Arizona to      six months in prison for criminal contempt of court, after      being fined $1 million in 1998 for willfully violating      Bankruptcy Court orders. Since January 1997, several court      orders addressed Berry's violations of the Bankruptcy Code's      provisions regulating bankruptcy petition preparers. The      Bankruptcy Fraud Task Force for the District of Arizona      sought criminal contempt charges against Berry based on his      violation of a January 1997 Bankruptcy Court order limiting      his fees.       Lawrence R. Costilow of Tucson pleaded guilty February 19      to two counts of bankruptcy fraud arising from his actions as      a creditor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Costilow loaned      $50,820 to a married couple, obtaining an unsecured      promissory note in return. After the spouses filed for      bankruptcy, Costilow altered the note so it purposed to take      a security interest in their property. Costilow recorded the      note and later testified in bankruptcy court as to it      validity.                               california       Sherwin Seyrafi of Encino, Calif., pleaded guilty December      28 in the District of Arizona to bankruptcy fraud, misuse of      a Social Security number, and failure to file a corporate tax      return. The counts for bankruptcy fraud and misuse of an SSN      arose from Seyrafi's filing of a bankruptcy petition with the      knowledge that it contained a false spelling of his name and      a false Social Security number.       Judy Scharnhorst Brown, a Spring Valley, Calif., real      estate broker, was sentenced Nov. 9 in the Southern District      of California to 15 months in custody followed by three years      of supervised release and ordered to pay $75,000 in      restitution and fines for a bankruptcy fraud and mail fraud      scheme. On March 30, a jury convicted Brown on one count of      conspiracy, three counts of bankruptcy fraud, and eight      counts of mail fraud after a two-week jury trial.       On April 21 a federal jury in Los Angeles convicted      Faramarz Taghilou of Castaic, Calif., on two counts of      concealing his private airplane in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy      case. Taghilou failed to disclose in his bankruptcy documents      that he owned a Cessna 310Q insured for $120,000 and was      paying monthly leasing fees to have the airplane kept at Van      Nuys airport. Additionally, Taghilou's bankruptcy schedule      omitted a     creditor who had placed a mechanic's lien on the airplane;      the debtor paid that creditor two weeks after filing for      bankruptcy.       Theresa Marie Thompson-Snow pleaded guilty March 17 in the      Central District of California to false representation of a      Social Security number and bankruptcy fraud. Through an      error, Thompson-Snow obtained loan documents belonging to a      college classmate--now an English professor--with a similar      name. She subsequently assumed the professor's identity to      obtain thousands of dollars in credit, and ultimately filed      for bankruptcy in her victim's name.       Tricia Mendoza of Norwalk, Calif., was sentenced Jan. 11 to      one year in prison and ordered to pay almost $250,000 in      restitution for embezzling from a Chapter 13 trustee      operation. Mendoza, who was the trustee office's      receptionist, changed names and addresses in the computer      system to the name and address of an accomplice, thereby      diverting payments intended for creditors to an address she      controlled.       Stephen Martin Zuwala was sentenced June 9 to 57 months in      federal prison and 36 months supervised release, and ordered      to pay more than $50,500 in restitution, based on his      conviction on five counts of mail fraud, three counts of      criminal contempt, and four counts of misuse of a Social      Security number. Non-lawyer Zuwala contacted individuals      facing home foreclosure and offered assistance through      ``little-known federal relief programs'' that turned out to      be filing for bankruptcy. Zuwala typically charged $500 to      $1,000 per case, but disclosed only part of his fees in      documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court. All criminal      contempt counts arose from Zuwala's violation of a prior      judgment obtained by the United States Trustee to permanently      enjoin him from preparing bankruptcy documents for filing in      the Northern and Eastern Districts of California.       Bankruptcy petition preparers Regina Green and Raymond Zak      were sentenced April 15 based on their earlier convictions      for criminal contempt and bankruptcy fraud. Because of      misconduct, Green and Zak had been ordered by the Bankruptcy      Court for the Northern District of California to stop      preparing bankruptcy petitions, and they were prosecuted for      violating that order. Green was sentenced to seven months in      prison for contempt of court and forgery, and Zak was      sentenced to six months in a halfway house for bankruptcy      fraud. Both defendants were ordered to pay restitution and      were barred from acting as bankruptcy petition preparers.                                colorado       James Francis Cavanaugh pleaded guilty Oct. 8 to bankruptcy      fraud in the District of Colorado. When Cavanaugh filed for      bankruptcy, he falsely stated that he had sold certain horses      from his Colorado horse breeding operation for $10,000,      although he had earlier valued the horses at $124,000. He      also failed to disclose to the bankruptcy court that he had      interests in two bank accounts in Missouri.                                florida       After a jury trial in the Middle District of Florida,      certified public accountant Kenneth A. Stoecklin was      convicted July 8 for embezzlement from the bankruptcy estate      of Chapter 11 debtor Commonweal Inc. and obstruction of the      administration of the internal revenue laws. Stoecklin, the      controlling corporate officer of Commonweal Inc., transferred      substantially all of his assets to the real estate      development company in an apparent attempt to avoid an      individual income tax liability exceeding $137,000. He      subsequently withdrew funds from an account established to      provide the government with ``adequate protection'' pending      the outcome of tax-related litigation.       Warren D. Johnson Jr. was sentenced June 23 to 97 months      imprisonment and ordered to pay more than $5 million      restitution after being convicted of bankruptcy fraud, bank      fraud, and money laundering. During a June 1998 bond hearing,      Johnson testified that he had no interest in stocks or other      assets in the Turks and Caicos Island, when he actually held      around $25 million worth of stock in a publicly traded      company. In addition, Johnson claimed he was indigent and      could not pay restitution despite the fact that the      controlled more than $10 million in assets placed in the      names of family members and off-shore shell corporations.      Johnson's bankruptcy convictions resulted from a 1992      bankruptcy case in which he claimed over $7.2 million in debt      and no assets, when he actually expected to receive at least      $1.2 million in real estate sale profits. Johnson laundered      approximately $250,000 of these profits by transferring the      funds to his wife and then using them for living expenses.      The bank fraud conviction resulted from Johnson's filing      false financial statements to obtain a $600,000 loan that he      did not repay.                                Georgia       The District Court for the Northern District of Georgia      entered judgment on December 13 against David Alvin Crossman      of Atlanta following his guilty plea to one count of filing a      false income tax return and one count of bankruptcy fraud.      Crossman set up a car leasing scheme under which he created      false financial statements and tax returns to lease cars as      if he were fleet leasing for a business, and then re-leased      the vehicles to individuals with poor credit. In his      individual and corporate Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases, he      failed to turn over lease payments to the bankruptcy      trustees.       Craig D. Butler pleaded guilty Sept. 17 to bankruptcy fraud      and income tax evasion. In October 1995, Butler filed a      bankruptcy petition in which he made false representations      and statements to evade payment of federal income taxes.      During the bankruptcy case, Butler, who formerly practiced      medicine in Albany, Ga., used funds of his professional      corporation to pay his personal expenses and those of his      family members, while designating the payments as business-     related expenditures.                                 Hawaii       On December 10 a federal jury in the District of Hawaii      found attorney Stacy Moniz of Kaneohe guilty of filing a      false income tax return, structuring cash transactions to      evade currency reporting requirements, failing to report the      receipt of $15,000 cash in the operation of his law office,      making false statements to the IRS, and making a false      statement under penalty of perjury in a bankruptcy      proceeding. The bankruptcy count arose from Moniz's falsely      reporting a client to be a creditor in his August 1997      bankruptcy case.       Arthur Kahahawai pleaded guilty Oct. 4 in the District of      Hawaii to two counts of bankruptcy fraud. Kahahawai concealed      from the bankruptcy trustee and his creditors a $71,517      workers' compensation settlement that he received less than      one month before filing for bankruptcy.       Miyoko Mizuno, a/k/a Miyoko Proctor, pleaded guilty in the      District of Hawaii Sept. 24 to concealment of assets in her      bankruptcy case. The debtor attempted to discharge      approximately $185,000 in unsecured debts by filing for      Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She listed no interests in real      property, when in fact she had deeded to her son a      condominium and her residence while retaining a life interest      in both properties, which could generate substantial rental      income.       Edward O'Kelley, former owner and president of HOJE      Construction, was sentenced April 23 in the District of      Hawaii to 33 months in prison for bankruptcy fraud      (concealment of assets and fraudulent transfer), and money      laundering. O'Kelley had been found guilty in a jury trial      for his role in putting HOJE Construction into Chapter 7      bankruptcy and hiding its assets in bank accounts in Alaska      and Texas. HOJE performed subcontracting work on military      projects in Hawaii and Alaska from 1992 through 1995.      O'Kelley and HOJE operations manager Harry Jordan conspired      to hide more than $450,000, which the bankruptcy trustee      recovered.       Harry Jordan pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud Feb. 8 in      the District of Hawaii; he was sentenced to one year      probation with one month home confinement, and ordered to pay      $75,000 in restitution. The court took into account that      Jordan, the former operations manager of HOJE Construction      Inc., cooperated with the United States Attorney and      testified against HOJE president Edward O'Kelley, who was      found guilty of bankruptcy fraud and money laundering. HOJE      performed subcontracting work on military projects in Hawaii      and Alaska from 1992 to 1995, when it filed for bankruptcy.      More than $450,000 in concealed assets have been recovered.                                Illinois       A federal jury in the Northern District of Illinois Oct. 22      convicted Vincent M. Gramarossa on two counts of bankruptcy      fraud and eight counts of money laundering. Gramarossa      defrauded bankruptcy creditors by skimming more than $580,000      from his business, a State Farm Insurance agency in suburban      Chicago. Gramarossa's confirmed Chapter 11 reorganization      plan directed that he pay half his profits to creditors, but      Gramarossa devised a scheme under which he diverted      commissions to conceal approximately one-third of his      commissions.                                Indiana       Bankruptcy debtors' attorney David T. Galloway of Porter      County, Ind., pleaded guilty April 5 in the Northern District      of Indiana to criminal contempt and agreed to resign from the      practice of law for three years. Galloway served as counsel      for a Chapter 7 debtor who concealed a pending personal      injury action from the bankruptcy case trustee. The debtor      testified at the Section 341 meeting of creditors that his      medical debts resulted from illness. After the Section 341      meeting, the United States Trustee's office in South Bend,      Ind., and the case trustee investigated the nature of the      medical debts, leading to the discovery of the personal      injury lawsuit.                                Kentucky       Debtors Daniel Caldera and Martha Kay Caldera of      Elizabethtown, Ky., were sentenced Oct. 20 in the Western      District of Kentucky for bankruptcy fraud. Daniel Caldera      pleaded guilty to concealing a $101,295 payment from C      Carpentry Service Inc.'s bankruptcy estate. He was      sentenced to 21 months imprisonment plus two years      supervised release, and ordered to pay $11,272 in      restitution. Martha Kay Caldera pleaded guilty to filing a      bankruptcy petition containing a materially false      declaration--that she and/or her spouse did not own an      annuity when in fact her spouse did. She was sentenced to      24 months probation, including six months of home      incarceration.                               Louisiana       Former district attorney James A. Norris, Jr. was sentenced      June 22 in the Western District of Louisiana to 33 months in      prison     and three years supervised release, and ordered to pay      $490,000 in restitution for bankruptcy fraud. On March 10, a      jury found Norris guilty of four counts of making false oaths      in a bankruptcy proceeding, in connection with his four      statements under oath that he had burned $500,000 cash in his      backyard. In 1989, Norris withdrew approximately $500,000      from his law partnership's account in a dispute over business      decisions; his former law partners ultimately obtained a      court judgment against him and filed an involuntary      bankruptcy petition against him.       Attorney Betty L. Washington was sentenced Jan. 20 in the      Eastern District of Louisiana to 33 months in prison, and      ordered to pay approximately $5,000 in restitution, based on      a jury verdict finding multiple counts of fraud, including      bankruptcy fraud. In her Chapter 7 bankruptcy case Washington      concealed her right to receive legal fees from a client.      Further, as part of a scheme to obtain more than $20,000 in      automobile loans, Washington tried to mislead a bank into      believing her bankruptcy case had been concluded.                                 Maine       On June 8 Catherine Duffy Petit was sentenced in the      District Court for the District of Maine to 15 years and      eight months in prison and three years supervised release,      and ordered to forfeit nearly $164,000 and to pay restitution      of nearly $8 million, based on her conviction on 54 counts      (reduced by the court from 78) of conspiracy, bankruptcy      fraud, securities fraud, and other violations. Petit and co-     conspirators had raised almost $7 million--ostensibly for      litigation expenses--by selling interests in Petit's state      court suit against a bank.                             Massachusetts       On July 8 attorneys Wendy Golenbock and Cheryl B. Stein of      Weston, Mass., were each sentenced in the District of      Massachusetts to 21 months in jail for bankruptcy fraud. The      attorneys attempted to conceal their property interest in a      Cape Cod, Mass., vacation home from their bankruptcy trustee      and creditors. In March 1999, a jury found them guilty of      bankruptcy fraud and conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud.       Prosecutors in Boston announced Feb. 9 the settlement of      charges filed against Sears, Roebuck & Co. for improper debt      collection from Chapter 7 debtors. Sears agreed to pay a $60      million criminal penalty, which is the largest ever paid in a      bankruptcy fraud case. The monies will be deposited into the      Crime Victims' Fund. Sears already paid over $180 million in      restitution and $40 million in civil fines to state attorneys      general, in connection with civil settlements in the case.                               Minnesota       Mark John McGowan of Mound, Minn., was sentenced Sept. 1 to      one year in prison and two years of supervised release for      bankruptcy fraud and perjury. In his Chapter 7 bankruptcy      schedules, McGowan listed a $100,000 house that he claimed      exempt as his homestead although he actually rented the house      and had no intent to occupy it.       Daniel J. Bubalo of Edina, Minn., was sentenced June 8 to      21 months in prison and ordered to pay $85,000 in restitution      following his conviction on two counts of bankruptcy fraud.      After Bubalo's bankruptcy case was converted from Chapter 11      to Chapter 7, and without the Chapter 7 trustee's knowledge,      Bubalo sold for $70,000 a Duluth, Minn., bar valued at      $175,000. He later testified that the property's status had      not changed since his case was converted.                                Missouri       Keith D. Linhardt of Warrenton, Mo., pleaded guilty Feb. 12      in the Eastern District of Missouri to bankruptcy fraud and      perjury. Linhardt admitted that he concealed financial      accounts as well as his interests as primary beneficiary of      seven life insurance policies--totaling more than $1.5      million--on his wife, who died on a camping trip in April      1998. In July 1998, at his Section 341 meeting with      creditors, Linhardt testified to the trustee concerning his      non-debtor spouse as though she were alive. On January 15,      1999, Linhardt pleaded guilty to second degree murder of his      wife and was sentenced to life in prison. He also pleaded      guilty to four counts of insurance fraud and was sentenced to      20 years in prison, consecutive to the life sentence.                               New Jersey       Michelle A.

Those companies and individuals then filed for      bankruptcy to delay foreclosure on the properties, but      the victims ended up losing their homes.

The companies and individuals      filed for bankruptcy to delay foreclosure. Homeowners paid      Daniels a $500 ``set up'' fee plus $500 per month, assuming      he was working to address their mortgage problems. They ended      up losing their homes.

The District Court for the Southern District of West      Virginia August 4 sentenced Donald S. Pritt to 30 months      imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and      restitution of $193,990 following his conviction on one count      of mail fraud and two counts of bankruptcy fraud.

Pritt was      ordered to pay in excess of $600,000 in attorney fees to the      manufacturer. The bankruptcy counts arose from his transfer      and concealment of assets, which began after the state court      litigation and continued during the bankruptcy case.

She converted the bankruptcy case to a      Chapter 7 liquidation but did not disclose the receipt of      funds to the bankruptcy trustee. Baker's bankruptcy discharge      was revoked after the trustee discovered the receipt of funds      as well as Baker's false testimony that there were no assets      other than those listed in the bankruptcy schedules.                               Wisconsin       The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit July 20 upheld      the March 1998 conviction of attorney John Gellene for false      material declarations in a bankruptcy proceeding, and upheld      the trial court's sentencing determinations. Gellene did not      disclose that his law firm represented a senior secured      creditor as well as the Chapter 11 debtor, giving rise to a      conflict of interest in representation. He was convicted      after a jury trial in the Eastern District of Wisconsin,      sentenced to 15 months in prison, and fined $15,000. In its      ruling, the Appeals Court rejected Gellene's argument that      his false statements were not material, finding it beyond      doubt that ``a misstatement in a Rule 2014 statement by an      attorney about other affiliations'' is material.                          ____________________
