President, I rise to introduce the Rating Accountability and Transparency Enhancement, RATE, Act to strengthen the Securities and Exchange Commission's, SEC's, oversight of credit rating agencies and improve the accountability and accuracy of credit ratings.  Credit ratings have taken on systemic importance in our financial system, and have become critical to capital formation, investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the U.S. economy. However, in recent months we have witnessed a significant amount of market instability stemming in part from the failure of these agencies to accurately measure the risks associated with mortgage-backed securities and other more complex products.  As the Chairman of the Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, I chaired a hearing in September of 2007 to examine the role of credit rating agencies in the mortgage crisis, and these issues were also addressed at a hearing by the full Committee last year. From these hearings, it is clear that problems at credit rating agencies contributed to the significant financial sector instability our country has been experiencing. In fact, an SEC investigation last summer found that credit rating agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch Ratings conducted weak analyses and failed to maintain appropriate independence from the issuers whose securities they rated.  Credit rating agencies are in the business of providing investors with unbiased analysis, but the current incentive structure gives them too much leeway to hand out unjustifiably favorable ratings. Let us be clear: not every rating is suspect and these firms provide crucial information for investors and the marketplace, but credit rating agencies like any other industry should be held accountable if they knowingly or recklessly mislead investors.  According to a mortgage industry trade publication, the three major credit rating agencies have each downgraded more than half of the subprime mortgage-backed securities they originally rated between 2005 and 2007. Ratings agencies made these mistakes in part because of conflicts of interest and other problems with internal controls, underscoring the need for enhanced oversight of this industry.  The bill I introduce today gives the SEC strong new authority to oversee and hold rating agencies accountable for conflicts of interest and other internal control deficiencies that have weakened ratings in the past. The bill includes a carefully crafted liability provision that allows investors to take action when a rating agency knowingly or recklessly fails to review key information in developing the rating.  It also enhances disclosure requirements to allow investors and others to learn about the methodologies, assumptions, fees, and amount of due diligence associated with ratings. It requires rating agencies to notify users and promptly update ratings when model or methodology changes occur. Finally, the bill requires ratings agencies to have independent compliance officers, and to take other actions, to prevent potential conflicts of interest.  I hope my colleagues will join me in helping improve the accountability and transparency of credit ratings that are so critical to the functioning of our financial markets.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1073       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Rating Accountability and      Transparency Enhancement Act of 2009'' or the ``RATE Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) because of the systemic importance of credit ratings      and the reliance placed on them by individual and      institutional investors and financial regulators, the      activities and performances of credit rating agencies,      including nationally recognized statistical rating      organizations, are the subject of national public interest,      as they are central to capital formation, investor      confidence, and the efficient performance of the United      States economy;       (2) credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized      statistical rating organizations, play a critical      ``gatekeeper'' role     that is functionally similar to that of securities analysts,      who evaluate the quality of securities, and auditors, who      review the financial statements of firms, and such role      justifies a similar level of public oversight and      accountability;       (3) because credit rating agencies perform evaluative and      analytical services on behalf of clients, their activities      are fundamentally commercial in character and should be      subject to the same standards of liability and oversight as      apply to auditors and securities analysts;       (4) in certain of their roles, particularly in advising      arrangers of structured financial products on potential      ratings of such products, credit rating agencies face      conflicts of interest that need to be carefully monitored and      that therefore should be addressed explicitly in legislation      in order to give clear authority to the Securities and      Exchange Commission;       (5) in the recent credit crisis, the ratings of structured      financial products have proven to be inaccurate, and have      contributed to the mismanagement of risks by financial      institutions and investors, which impacts the health of the      economy in the United States and around the world; and       (6) credit rating agencies should determine their ratings      independently, without regulatory approval of methodologies,      in order to avoid overreliance on ratings and to ensure that      the rating agencies, rather than the Securities and Exchange      Commission, are accountable for such methodologies, except      that regulators should have strong authority to ensure that      all other aspects of rating agency activities are designed to      ensure the highest quality ratings and accountability for      those creating them.     SEC. 3. ENHANCED REGULATION OF NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED                    STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS.
