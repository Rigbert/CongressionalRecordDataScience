 President, I wish to discuss the Defense authorization bill, which passed the Senate yesterday. The bill contains several provisions that I have strongly advocated and worked hard to advance.  First and foremost, the bill authorizes funds for three military construction projects in my home State of Delaware that will add to our military preparedness. The first of these is a C-5 aerial delivery facility at Dover Air Force Base that will allow the base to fulfill the strategic brigade airdrop mission, enhancing Dover's leading role in meeting our new military requirements in the post-cold war era. Second, $12 million for new visiting officers quarters will ease a severe housing shortage at Dover and also allow for a much-needed transportation upgrade at the base. Third, an operations and training complex for the Air National Guard will improve readiness by replacing several outdated and dilapidated facilities at the Air Guard's headquarters at the New Castle County Airport. I am grateful to my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for including these projects, which I had requested.  I am also pleased that the bill provides for the transfer of the last parcel of military-controlled land at Cap Henlopen to the Delaware State Park System, completing a long-standing project I began when I first arrived in the Senate.  In addition, the bill restores two important provisions that I fought hard to include in the antiterrorism act, but were removed by the conference committee. First, the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici amendment, of which I am an original cosponsor, gives authority to the Armed Forces to assist local law enforcement, should we ever face an emergency involving a chemical or biological weapon. The Armed Forces alone have the capacity and equipment to respond to such an incident. In addition, this amendment will improve our ability to interdict weapons of mass destruction before they reach American soil. It will help ensure the security of all Americans by expanding programs to safeguard nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.  The second antiterrorism provision is a Feinstein-Biden amendment to prohibit the distribution of bomb-making information on the Internet. The Senate had overwhelmingly approved this amendment to the antiterrorism bill, but it was not included in the final conference report.  I am pleased that these two crucial antiterrorism provisions are included in the Defense authorization bill.  Another important amendment to this bill calls for a study of the benefits and costs of enlarging the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include the new democracies of Central Europe.  While I believe that the addition of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia may well strengthen our own security, that or our allies, and that of Europe as a whole, we must understand in detail what we are undertaking before asking these countries to shoulder the burdens of NATO membership. The mandated study will answer the relevant questions.  Despite these significant achievements, Mr. President, I cannot support a bill that is fiscally irresponsible. If we are serious about balancing the budget, no area of Government--including defense--should be immune to a critical review of spending.  Between 1981 and 1992, the annual Federal deficit quadrupled--from $74 billion to $290 billion. Since 1992, the deficit has been cut by more than half--the Congressional Budget Office now projects that the Federal deficit will be about $140 billion this year, down from $290 billion at the end of the Bush administration.  This marks the first time in modern budget history--since we demobilized at the end of WWII--that the deficit has gone down 4 years in a row.  The deficit is now less than 2 percent of our Nation's output--we have the best budget record of any of the advanced industrial economies. Today, Federal spending as a share of the economy is the lowest it has been since 1979.  This is a record that owes a lot to the hard choices we made in 1993 and to the discipline it has taken to stick with those decisions. We cannot--we must not--put this record in jeopardy. We certainly should not throw more money at the Pentagon than it says it needs.  For every dollar wasted on exotic weapons systems that the Department of Defense is not asking for, there is less for crime prevention, for the infrastructure that underpins our economy, and for education and research that will be the key to tomorrow's productivity growth.  We have to balance our priorities carefully and to use our scarce resources efficiently. The Defense budget should not become the new way to keep old habits alive.  The overwhelming majority of the money added to the President's Defense authorization request would go toward procurement and development of weapons systems that the Pentagon does not believe are necessary to ensure the security of the United States. In fact, $3.8 billion of the additional money is for programs that are not even in the Pentagon's long-range plan to defend our country.  Mr. President, my distinguished colleagues argued for this unnecessary spending on the grounds that the readiness of our military was at stake. This ignores the fact that American military readiness today is at an all-time high.  We cannot take an additional $11.4 billion our of the pockets of the taxpaying American people to buy airplanes and ships we don't need. We cannot continue to borrow from our grandchildren's future to pay for additional weapons at a time we face no major military threat. In short, we cannot afford this bill.  Mr. President, I could not in good conscience vote to spend $11.4 billion more than the military itself believes is necessary to defend our Nation. It is my hope that the conferees will work to bring down the spending in this bill to an acceptable and responsible level, so that at time, I can support the bill.                          ____________________
