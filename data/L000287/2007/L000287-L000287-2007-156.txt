Madam Speaker, today I would like to recognize an important event for the city of Atlanta--the upcoming grand opening of the New World of Coca-Cola adjacent to Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, Georgia.  Seventeen years ago in 1990, the World of Coca-Cola opened its doors to the public and has since delighted over 13 million visitors at its Underground Atlanta location. This new and expanded facility opening May 24 is twice the size of the current World of Coca-Cola. It will be a much more interactive and dynamic version of its predecessor.  The New World of Coca-Cola will house exhibits that draw upon Coca-Cola's history and timeless values of optimism and refreshment. It is a physical manifestation of the company's vision and values and commitment to the city of Atlanta. It will introduce visitors to the Coca-Cola Company of the 21st century: a company that is committed to offering people more than 400 ways to be refreshed and to having a meaningful impact in the communities in which it operates.  I would like to congratulate the Coca-Cola Company on a premier destination for Georgia residents and visitors from around the world.                          ____________________
