The season starts with the Mets and Royals at Kauffman Stadium, so they can start all over again. It would be a good thing, perhaps, if the Mets made it again, and certainly with the Royals, and gave it a shot.  I am very glad the Senator mentioned the incident where Hosmer decided to steal home. That was like Jackie Robinson back in the day when he was seeking to steal home. Who did that? And to do that in today's ball game, where people pitch only a certain amount of innings and players look to the manager to steal and do this and do that and everything is sort of in a box--the Royals played out of the box and they had fun.  The reason they are all great players is because they played as a team, as my distinguished colleague from Missouri just pointed out. It was a lot of fun. It is going to be fun next year. Don't worry, Mets, you will have a chance again.
