President, I rise today to commend Maj. Gen. Ray E. McCoy, USA, upon his retirement from the United States Army after more than 32 years of distinguished and dedicated service to our Nation.  Major General McCoy, a native son of the Oklahoma farmland, graduated in 1965 from Oklahoma State University, where he received the prestigious Drummond Saber Award as the year's outstanding ROTC graduate. That honor was the harbinger of an extraordinary military career.  After completing Infantry School and Ranger training, Ray McCoy served in a variety of combat and command assignments stateside and overseas, including two tours in Vietnam and one in Korea. In the operations theater, his abiding concern for his charges, his roll-up-your-sleeves approach to getting the mission done, and his tempered-steel military bearing earned him the respect of all who soldiered with and for him.  As his career progressed, he served in a number of high-level staff positions at the Department of the Army, Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Army Material Command, and the Defense Logistics Agency [DLA] America's combat support agency. For the past 2 years, Major General McCoy has served as DLA's Principal Deputy Director. His vision and leadership were vital to the agency's business-process reengineering, which incorporated the best public and private sector practices. These initiatives elevated material readiness and strengthened the management and oversight of Defense contracts--and at markedly reduced cost to the taxpayers and the warfighters. Blending combat experience with business acumen, Ray McCoy was instrumental in the agency's successful efforts to accelerate logistics response and improve weapons-systems readiness. With Major General McCoy having led the charge, DLA is now a front line partner with combat and contingency operations forces in Bosnia and around the world.  Whether it was on the rough terrain of the combat theater or behind a desk, Ray McCoy served his country with valor, loyalty, and integrity. With the physical stature of a sturdy oak and the energy of a southwestern tornado, Ray McCoy demonstrates time and time again that he truly deserves to be called a soldier's soldier. On the occasion of his retirement from the U.S. Army, I offer my congratulations and thanks to this esteemed son of the Sooner State, and wish him well in his future pursuits.                          ____________________
