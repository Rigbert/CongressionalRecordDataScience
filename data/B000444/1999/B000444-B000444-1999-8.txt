 President, today I am introducing the NIH Office of Autoimmune Diseases Act of 1999. This legislation, which is very similar to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Waxman, would create an Office of Autoimmune Diseases as part of the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health. I would like to outline briefly why I feel that this office and this legislation are needed.  To understand autoimmune diseases, it is first necessary to talk about the body's immune system. The immune system is a collection of tissues which is designed to fend off any foreign invaders into our body. For example, we live in a world surrounded by microbes of various kinds, many of which would be harmful to us if they could set up shop in our bodies. However, the immune system recognizes that a foreign microbe has entered our body and it mobilizes a variety of defenses to expel this foreign invader.  The critical importance of the immune system can be easily seen when something goes wrong with it. For example, when a baby is born with a major defect in its immune system, it is extremely vulnerable to attacks by bacteria that a healthy baby would be able to fight off. Such immune-deficient babies need to be protected from their environment in order to preserve their lives. You may have seen the TV programs about such ``bubble babies'', who have to spend their entire lives in a protective plastic bubble or a spacesuit.  However, although the immune system is essential for human life, it sometimes can cause problems with our health. When someone gets a kidney transplant, for example, it is the immune system which tries to fight off this ``foreign invader'', a process called rejection. The survival of the transplant requires that the recipient begiven treatment in order to suppress the immune system.  Occasionally, the body's immune system goes haywire and starts to attack the body's own tissues as if they were foreign invaders. This process is called autoimmunity, and diseases in which autoimmunity is thought to play an important role are called autoimmune diseases. The spectrum of human illnesses for which there is evidence of an autoimmune component is extremely broad, ranging from lupus to diabetes to multiple sclerosis. At the National Institutes of Health, these different diseases are often studied in completely different institutes: diabetes in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; lupus in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; multiple sclerosis in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; and so forth.  Despite being studied in different locations, these diseases all have one thing in common: abnormalities of the immune system that lead to an autoimmune process in which the body actually attacks itself. It is vital that researchers on one autoimmune disease understand what research advances are being made on other autoimmune diseases; the key to understanding the autoimmune process in multiple sclerosis might very well be uncovered by a researcher working on autoimmunity in diabetes.  This is where the need for an NIH Office of Autoimmune Diseases arises. Its purpose is to make sure that there is cooperation and coordination across scientific disciplines for all those working on the broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases. Researchers working on autoimmunity in one narrowly defined disease must be able to benefit from research advances in autoimmune research. The history of medicine is replete with examples where breakthroughs in one area were actually a direct consequence of advances in a completely unrelated field.  This bill sets up an Office of Autoimmune Diseases at NIH, along with a broadly representative coordinating committee to assist it. The director of the Office of Autoimmune Diseases will be responsible for setting an agenda for research and education on autoimmune diseases, for promoting cooperation and coordination among the disparate entities that are working on autoimmune diseases, for serving as principal advisor to HHS on autoimmune diseases, for husbanding resources for autoimmune disease research, and for producing reports to keep other scientists and the public informed about progress in autoimmune disease research.  Mr. President, I'd like to explain why I have a particular interest in the area of autoimmune diseases. A very close friend of mine in Delaware, Ms. Tia McDowell, is fighting valiantly against a chronic disease. At present, the treatments for this disease no longer seem to be working very well, so Tia's hope lies in new research advances. Although doctors are not sure what causes Tia's disease, they do think that autoimmunity plays an important part. For Tia, and for others with diseases where autoimmunity is important, I want to make sure that we are moving ahead with research in the most efficient manner possible, and I think that creation of an NIH Office of Autoimmune Diseases is one way to help this process along.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the NIH Office of Autoimmune Diseases Act of 1999 as something we in Congress can do to help our research scientists conquer this puzzling and pernicious group of diseases. I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  The bill follows:                                S. 1897       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``NIH Office of Autoimmune      Diseases Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES AT                    NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.       Title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 281 et      seq.) is amended by inserting after section 404D the      following section:                         ``autoimmune diseases       ``Sec. 404E. (a) Establishment.--There is established      within the Office of the Director of NIH an office to be      known as the Office of Autoimmune Diseases (in this section      referred to as the `Office'), which shall be headed by a      Director appointed by the Director of NIH.       ``(b) Duties.--       ``(1) In general.--The Director of the Office, in      consultation with the coordinating committee established      under subsection (c), shall carry out the following:       ``(A) The Director shall recommend an agenda for conducting      and supporting research on autoimmune diseases through the      national research institutes.
