 President, my experience is not as extensive as the leader's and slightly more extensive than the Senator from Utah's here, but it seems to me we waste a whole lot of time working out whether we can work things out rather than just bringing them up and voting on them. By the time we get to vote on it, we are slowing things up.  I have another amendment we can move to, then.
