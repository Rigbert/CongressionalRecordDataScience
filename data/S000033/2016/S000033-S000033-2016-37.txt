 President, to commemorate Public Recognition Week, the Vermont Federal Executive Association, VTFEA, recognized the more than 4,000 Federal employees working across the State and the good work they do every day. I would like to offer special congratulations to the 2016 Excellence in Government award winners, who have been recognized by VTFEA for their exemplary government service.  Excellence in Management and Program Support Award, Individual Award--Heather Festa, management program analyst, personnel security division, Office of Security and Integrity, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, South Burlington--Heather demonstrated exceptional innovation and professionalism in response to the Office of Personnel Management's security breach of electronic systems containing background investigation records. When OPM instructed Federal agencies to mail all paper documents, many agencies simply halted their personnel security processes. However, Heather skillfully designed and implemented an action plan for the hard-copy paper forms to ensure there would be no interruption in processing security checks within U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.  Excellence in Management and Program Support Award, Group Award--northeast regional office position description workgroup, northeast regional office, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, South Burlington, including Jeannine Longchamp, Maegan Cutler, Brian Johansson, and Laurie Juskiewicz--the northeast regional office human resources team led a working group to review supervisory position descriptions for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services's entire field operations directorate. Not only did the team ensure that all positions aligned with Office of Personal Management guidelines, it also created supervisory positions at new grade levels that opened up previously unobtainable career paths for some employees.  Professional Award--Peter Banacos and Andrew Loconto, meteorologists, National Weather Service, Burlington International Airport, South Burlington--Peter and Andrew worked together to develop a snow squall identification and forecasting technique that has greatly improved winter weather forecast and warning systems for many National Weather Service offices. Historically, there has been an overall lack of forecaster awareness in identifying the weather conditions in which snow squalls can occur, as well as understanding their impact. Peter and Andrew's innovation, leadership, and persistent efforts over the past 3 years have enhanced the National Weather Service's ability to provide useful winter weather information to the public.  Law Enforcement, Safety and Security Award--Amanda Cahill, special agent, Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, satellite office, Rutland--Amanda exemplifies the highest traditions of government service: tireless dedication and devotion to her agency and the residents of her community. She has singlehandedly reestablished a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives presence in southern Vermont and has begun to fill a void in the law enforcement community's fight against armed drug traffickers. She has acted as an undercover agent, as well as a lead investigator, and recently, she has been recognized for her efforts by the U.S. attorney for Vermont.  Managerial/Supervisory Award--Daniel Whitney, section chief, training, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, law enforcement support center, Williston--Dan Whitney exemplifies the continued pursuit of excellence and an unparalleled record of achievement. The law enforcement support center, LESC, is U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's primary point of contact for law enforcement agencies throughout the country. Dan is responsible for ensuring that all LESC employees receive continuous training in multiple law enforcement databases, including ICE's new enterprise database that his team tested to ensure that LESC employees had the training and the tools to provide up to the minute information to law enforcement agencies. Dan is someone who leads by example and is always willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that LESC meets its mission.  Tina Gurka Community Service Award--registered nurse Sharon Levenson and police officer Guy Gardner, VA medical center, White River Junction--in January 2016, Nurse Sharon Levenson and Officer Guy Gardner demonstrated their dedication to veterans in their local community. After one of her patients did not show up for an appointment, Sharon contacted the local police department and requested a welfare check. When the police department said the situation did not warrant a check, VA Officer Guy Gardner contacted a neighbor, and they discovered the veteran in serious distress. Thanks to Sharon and Guy's efforts, the patient recovered fully. Their commitment to veterans was recognized by VA Secretary McDonald during testimony before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.  Interagency Collaboration and Partnership Award--Brian Wood, Border Patrol agent, U.S. Border Patrol, Richford--Brian has demonstrated exemplary professionalism and work ethic in forming and maintaining valuable and productive partnerships with various Federal and State agencies in Vermont and across the country. Brian's efforts have resulted in the arrest of numerous alien smugglers, drugdealers, and human traffickers and the removal of countless illegal firearms, heroin, and cocaine from our communities. Brian uses his expertise in law enforcement and his ability to collaborate successfully to keep our communities and citizens safe.  Heroic Act Award--John Marsh, Border Patrol agent, U.S. Border Patrol, Swanton sector, Beecher Falls Station--in April 2016, while returning from a call for assistance in New Hampshire, Agent Marsh approached two men on the ground, one pounding the chest of the other. Agent Marsh found the person on the ground was choking on food, was not breathing, and would not respond to verbal stimulation. After requesting emergency medical services, Agent Marsh administered the Heimlich maneuver and was able to dislodge the food from the victim. He remained with him until the paramedics arrived and took over care. Thanks to John's training and his ability to stay calm under pressure, the victim is alive and well today.  Vermont Federal Team of the Year Award--the northwest vermont locality pay committee: Brandon Ackel, Transportation Security Administration, Robert Brugman, National Credit Union Administration, Brian Johansson, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Kelly Larsen, Federal Aviation Administration, Alaska, Bruce McDonald, Transportation Security Administration, Sean McVey, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Mark Nielsen, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Jeff Ostlund, Transportation Security Administration, Corey Price, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Texas, Lisa Rees, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Krista Scheele, Transportation Security Administration--in November 2012, VTFEA discussed what initiatives would benefit the most Federal employees, and it didn't take long to realize that securing locality pay for Vermont was the No. 1 priority. In early 2013, VTFEA created a locality pay committee, consisting of employees from six Federal agencies. Working tirelessly, the team prepared a locality pay proposal for northwest Vermont and, in December 2013, presented it to the Federal Salary Council in Washington, DC. Unfortunately, the first proposal was denied, so the following year, they tried again. Again, the proposal was denied. Not to be discouraged, the team drafted a third proposal in November 2015, and committee members traveled to Washington at their own expense to support the package and their fellow Vermonters. At the hearing, the Council approved the package, which is waiting for approval by the President's pay agent and the President. The northwest Vermont locality pay committee's tenacity, collaborative spirit, and positivity is why Vermont is being considered for locality pay, and it is because of their efforts that VTFEA chose them as ``Federal Team of the Year.''                          ____________________
