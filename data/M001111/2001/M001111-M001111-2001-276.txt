 I urge all colleagues to think about the principles of this bill and the underlying concept: We want to make sure every child in this country succeeds. That is not what this amendment will do. It is what we need to do in terms of investing in our communities, our schools, in the right way, so all children can succeed.  There is no magic bullet. The vouchers amendment is certainly not one. I hope we are not tempted by the false promise of vouchers as that magic bullet.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote no.
