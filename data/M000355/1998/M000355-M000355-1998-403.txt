 President, let me say to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, this is not exactly an isolated case. The Senator from New Hampshire mentioned that the trend in the courts--in fact, Richmond, San Francisco, San Diego, Dade County, New Orleans, Columbus, Louisiana and Michigan are all court cases striking down these kinds of preferences; in other words, striking down Government discrimination based upon race in general.  What is astonishing, I agree with my dear friend from New Hampshire, is that this is in this bill in the wake of the decision.  I wonder how long it is going to take, I ask my friend from New Hampshire, at this rate with every single aggrieved party having to sue, I wonder if my friend from New Hampshire has any sense of how long it may take to get these preferences off the books and bring American practice, Government practice into line with the Constitution.
