 President, I really have no question, just a statement.  I thank the Senator from Alaska for the way he is handling this. I literally just got off the phone with the Secretary of State, who said, knowing you were speaking now, that when you finished, or at any time that is convenient for you, she is willing to personally assure you, and authorized me to tell you as well, that she makes a personal commitment that she will coordinate more closely with you and any Member of the Senate on Taiwan policy in a contemporaneous fashion. She is willing to assert that to you.  I know no one here doubts her word. But I realize time is close in terms of the schedule here. But she is prepared and ready and willing to take your call and anxious to personally make that commitment to you. But she authorized me to be able to say what I just said on the floor.  I thank the Senator for the way in which he has concluded to handle this matter, and I appreciate the Secretary's willingness to be available and contemporaneously discuss these issues with the Senator from Alaska, who, obviously, along with the Senator from North Carolina, I do not know of any two people that have shown a greater interest in Taiwan than those two of my colleagues.
