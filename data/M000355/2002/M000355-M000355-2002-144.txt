 I had not known the Senator from New York very well. He came to the Senate in the beginning of 1999. I enjoyed getting to know him in the process. I enjoyed working with him.  This legislation is a classic example, with Senator Dodd's leadership, and Senator Torricelli was deeply involved; the five of us had a bonding experience here. We managed to come together on a very worthwhile piece of legislation which I anticipate will pass tomorrow by a very large margin, if not unanimously.  I thank the Senator from New York for his friendship and on this bill.
