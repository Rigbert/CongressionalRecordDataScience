 President, yesterday I asked unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to myself and Senator Baucus signed by 41 Democrat Senators. However, at the time of printing it was missing its second page. I again ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley, Chairman,     Hon. Max Baucus, Ranking Member,     Senate Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Baucus: We believe      reauthorizing the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families      (TANF) program is an important item on the congressional      agenda for this year. The Personal Responsibility and Work      Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) made dramatic      changes in our Nation's welfare laws that have had a profound      impact on disadvantaged families. We agree with the President      that the main goal of welfare programs should be to      strengthen families and support self-sufficiency. We would      like to work with you to build on the strengths of the new      system, as well as address areas where the new law falls      short.       We are encouraged by the number of families who have moved      successfully from welfare to work. However, 33 million      Americans still live in poverty. The current economic      downturn has led to increases in both unemployment and, more      recently in many States, the welfare caseload. Today, almost      every State in the Nation faces a fiscal crisis. Under these      circumstances, a concerted, bipartisan effort is necessary to      preserve the progress we have seen so far, as well as      encourage States to help more families become independent.       We strongly support several of the concepts the President      has outlined, if designed and implemented appropriately.      ``Universal engagement'' of welfare recipients would help      make sure each family's specific circumstances are considered      and addressed. Ending the current ``caseload reduction      credit,'' which gives States credit for people who are not      working, and replacing it with an ``employment credit,''      would provide stronger incentives for States to move families      not only off of welfare but into jobs. Similarly, bipartisan      proposals to strengthen child support would encourage better      relations between non-custodial parents and their children,      and help families stay off welfare. We would like to work      with you to make sure all States can participate and that      families receive the child support they are owed. We also      agree that transitional Medicaid benefits should be extended      so parents who leave welfare will know their children will      have health care as their families make the transition to      work.       We are concerned, however, that the administration's      proposals lack several key reforms that will help more      families achieve self-sufficiency. We believe reauthorization      should include four important components to achieve this      goal.       First, to be successful, a work-oriented welfare program      must demonstrate that work will be fairly rewarded, and that      families will be better off if they play by the rules. We      must make sure states can provide critical work supports,      especially quality child care. Child care assistance is      essential if parents are to get a job and stay employed.       A significant increase in funding for child care is needed      not only to support the current level of child care provided      to low-income working families, but also to improve the      quality of care provided and cover the millions of eligible      children currently without assistance. We know there are      significant additional costs associated with increases in      work requirements. Any welfare reform bill must include      sufficient funding to ensure that we are not cutting child      care services currently provided to low-income working      families in order to pay for child care for families      receiving TANF cash assistance. In addition, funding must be      provided to improve the quality of child care to ensure that      low-income children enter kindergarten ready to learn, as      well as to increase access for the millions of families who      are eligible but currently receive no child care assistance.       This investment is even more important because of the      states' fiscal crises. At least 13 states cut their      investments in child care in 2002 because of budget      pressures, and more are likely to be forced to do so this      year or even next year. In this climate, it is not realistic      to rely on states to restore these needed funds, or fill in      gaps left by federal policies. Failure to strengthen the      federal investment in child care will have dire consequences      for many low-income families that are trying to succeed in      the workplace. We are pleased that the Senate Budget      Resolution rejects the President's proposal to freeze child      care funding, but we are still concerned that the proposed      funding will not sustain current levels of support, let alone      improve the quality of care or allow for increased work      requirements.       Second, we must recognize the role legal immigrant families      play in our economy. Most legal immigrants came to this      country to find work; they contribute economically to their      communities and play important roles in the labor force.      Because of language and other barriers, many must take lower      paying jobs and thus can be buffeted by economic dislocation.      At their annual winter meeting, the nation's governors      reiterated that immigration, which is controlled by the      federal government, creates demands at the state level for      education, job training, social and health services, and      other assistance that is necessary to help immigrants      integrate into our communities and become self-sufficient      members of society. Currently, 31 states use their own funds,      without federal support, to provide TANF benefits and      services or health assistance to legal immigrants, and other      states often absorb emergency health care costs for these      families. Giving states the options to use federal funds for      benefits and services to legal immigrants is an issue of      fundamental fairness, and it would provide needed fiscal      relief for states.       Third, states need more flexibility to make sure workers      have the skills to succeed in the workplace. At a minimum, we      support the provisions included in the bill reported by the      Finance Committee last year. Full-time, work-related      vocational training and education, post-secondary education,      basic adult education, work-study, and other similar      activities can lead to better jobs, more opportunities for      advancement, increased family incomes, and a more competitive      workforce. We should not arbitrarily limit states' ability to      support these activities, since they provide a true ``ticket      to independence.''       Fourth, we support state and local innovation, but will not      support a ``superwaiver'' that merely shifts resources from      one pot to another and eliminates basic protections for      families, while bypassing Congressional oversight. A broad,      vague superwaiver is no substitute for providing states with      the flexibility within TANF to craft welfare-to-work programs      that meet the particular needs of their state economies and      the families they serve.       Finally, we would like to express concern over      Administration and House proposals to significantly increase      work participation standards and work hours, without      flexibility and adequate increases in work supports. We agree      that TANF recipients should be engaged in work activities      that will help them to ultimately become self-sufficient.      However, we feel strongly that we should not impose rigid      requirements that would undermine successful state programs,      or reduce states' flexibility, which allows them to consider      and address the individual needs of participating families,      including disabilities and other barriers to employment.       We would also like to point out that states have been      successful in reducing their cash assistance caseloads      because they have taken advantage of the flexibility in TANF      to support low-income working families, including not only      those receiving cash assistance, but also those who have left      welfare or those who are at risk of needing welfare. These      innovative efforts are already in danger because of the      states' fiscal crises; increasing work participation      requirements threatens the success of these programs by      significantly reducing the help available to support low-     income working families for child care, and other key      services. We believe this would be a major step in the wrong      direction.       We would also like to correct the perception that states      can support higher work participation standards without      additional resources. An argument has been made that states      have more resources per TANF family than they had in 1996.      This claim is misleading for several reasons. This line of      reasoning assumes that non-TANF Child Care and Development      Block grants (CCDBG), which support many low-income working      families, are used only to support families receiving TANF      cash assistance. In fact, the statute specifically states      that CCDBG funds are to be used not only for families      receiving assistance, but also for, ``families who are      attempting through work activities to transition off of such      assistance program, and families who are at risk of becoming      dependent on such assistance program.'' (PRWORA, Section      603).       The Administration's figures also assume that all TANF      resources are used to support only families receiving      assistance. But states have been successful in reducing their      cash assistance caseloads because they have taken advantage      of the flexibility in TANF to support low-income working      families, including those who have left welfare or those who      are at risk of needing welfare. The General Accounting Office      reported in April 2002 that ``at least 46 percent more      families than are counted in the reported TANF caseload are      receiving services funded, at least in part, with TANF/MOE      funds.''       The President has said, ``It is not yet a post-poverty      America.'' If we are to reach this goal, we must maintain      strong federal and state support for welfare reform, so that      families can escape the ravages of poverty and become self-     sufficient. We look forward to working with you on a      bipartisan basis to achieve these important goals.           Sincerely,         Tom Daschle, Bob Graham, Jay Rockefeller, Blanche L.
