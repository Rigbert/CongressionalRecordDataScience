 President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will not be in session on Friday and will return on Monday for business. Following morning business on Monday, the Senate will begin consideration of the Governmental Affairs funding resolution. That resolution was reported by the Rules Committee this afternoon.  The majority leader will be discussing with the Democratic leader the possibility of an agreement on this resolution which would allow us to complete action on that resolution early next week. The majority leader will notify all Members when this agreement is reached and the voting schedule as it becomes clear. However, any votes ordered on Monday will be stacked to occur on Tuesday at a time to be determined later.                          ____________________
