President, I have been here this afternoon and hope to get a little more time than we are getting. Right now we are into the final debate on the vote that will take place at 5:30. The Senator from Nevada, Senator Ensign, has agreed to let me have 10 minutes, so I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in morning business.
