 I worry about those, however, who voted for that war and did not vote to stop that war and voted for the very first time that this country has ever gone to war in its history without a tax to pay for it. We voted for it on a credit card--an unnecessary war, a war that hurt the interests of the United States, and it will eventually cost us $2 trillion. Nobody--nobody--talks about paying for that. But to protect the police officers, who are on the street every day protecting us, oh, we cannot do that. We cannot do that, even though we have done so before.  I could name the six police officers who were killed in Oklahoma. I am not going to. I am not trying to make this personal. But the Presiding Officer understands law enforcement. She supported this. Everybody on this side of the aisle supports it. It is to protect our police officers.  We will spend $2 trillion on a useless war, but we will not spend a tiny fraction of 1 percent--one one-thousandth of 1 percent--to support our men and women, especially when we now have a provision in here to protect women police officers as well as men police officers. What could be more--what could be more--nonpartisan than this? That is why Senator Ben Nighthorse-Campbell and I joined together, why Republicans and Democrats have joined together.  I am proud that every Democratic Senator is in favor of this legislation. I wish the Republicans would lift their objection. We should pass this bill. If you stand with law enforcement, then you need to stand with them when it matters most. I can assure you--and they can assure you--it matters here, and it matters now.  I yield the floor. I think I have expressed my dismay that the other side of the aisle would not stand up to protect these police officers.
