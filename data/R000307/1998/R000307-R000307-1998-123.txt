President, I simply close in quoting the last two paragraphs:       Isn't it too late now to change course? Some argue that      even if the decision to expand NATO wasn't the most      thoughtful, historically aware way to make policy, that the      decision has been made and going back on it would be a      disaster far greater than the problems NATO expansion itself      will bring.  That is a good argument. As a matter of fact, I think that may be a persuasive argument. I have listed a lot of concerns that I have. I think the adjectives and adverbs that I have used and the language I have used would indicate, if somebody is watching, ``Well, Senator Roberts, he is going to vote no.'' I am undecided.  Again, what the professor has indicated that ``the decision has been made and going back on it would be a disaster far greater than the problems NATO expansion itself will bring.  Then he goes on to say this:       This sounds a little like the refusal of the Titanic's      captain to cut his ship's speed when told there were icebergs      ahead. Consistency is a fine idea most of the time, but there      are moments when it's just plain irresponsible.  That is the other view.       Only future historians will be able to say whether this is      such a moment.  Professor Gaddis goes on to say:       . . .But the mood of current historians should not give the      Administration--or those senators who plan to vote this week      for NATO expansion--very much comfort.  I thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the indulgence of my colleague from Illinois. I apologize to him for going on a little bit longer than I told him, and I yield the floor.
