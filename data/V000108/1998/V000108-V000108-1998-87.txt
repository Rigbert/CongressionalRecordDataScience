Speaker, it is with the greatest pleasure that I pay tribute to one of the leading citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Carl Traicoff, of Highland, Indiana. After serving as one of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished, compassionate, and dedicated teachers for twenty-seven years, Carl announced his retirement on Saturday, August 22, 1998.  A 1956 graduate of Lew Wallace High School in Gary, Carl enrolled as a student at Kansas State University, which he attended for one year. In 1958, he transferred to Culver-Stockton University where, in 1960, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education and Health. Carl continued his education at Northeast Missouri, now Truman State, earning a Master's degree in Physical Education, Health, and Administration. While attending graduate school, Carl also worked as a girls basketball coach, beginning his long and distinguished coaching career.  From 1960 through 1966, he served as a basketball coach at the high schools of Louistown, Clarence, and Centralia. In 1966, he moved back to Indiana's First Congressional District and began teaching and coaching at Calumet High School, in unincorporated Calumet Township, Lake County, Indiana. As Calumet High School's coach, Carl posted 417 wins, for a career total of 477 wins. Indeed, along with these wins, his teams won four Sectional Titles, and he was honored by his fellow coaches as Coach of the Year six times. Though Carl is acknowledged for his coaching ability, his teaching successes have often been overlooked. He made his mark on the Calumet High School curriculum by instituting a Life Management course and influenced nearly every student that attended the Calumet High School by teaching this class, as well as Health, annually. This legacy, more than any coaching award, is what will live as Carl's greatest achievement. Indeed, his dedication and caring is represented through his four Teacher of the Year Awards, as well as his Inland Steel Teacher of the Year Award.  Carl was always a dedicated and caring coach and teacher. Though he spent must time and effort on his players and students, this did not diminish his devotion to his wife, Margie, and their daughter, Karen. His professional success was complemented by an even more rewarding family life. Now that he has retired, Carl plans to spend much of his time with Margie and Karen, who now works for NASA. He also, he continues to serve as a member of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, the Indiana Basketball Coaches Association, as an instructor and local basketball camps, and as a teacher at Purdue University Calumet.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Carl Traicoff for his lifetime of dedication, service, and leadership to the students and faculty of Calumet High School, as well as the people of Northwest Indiana. Carl's efforts as an educator and a basketball coach blended together to help kids make the most of their potential and earn their success in the world. Northwest Indiana's community has certainly been rewarded by the true service and uncompromising dedication displayed by Carl Traicoff.                          ____________________
