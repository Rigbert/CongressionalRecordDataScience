President, today I am submitting a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. I am joined by Senators Feingold, Reed, Harkin, McConnell, Moynihan, and Kohl.  A year ago I doubt anyone would have predicted that a settlement of East Timor's political status would be in sight.  While there are many obstacles and dangers ahead, we should take note of what has been accomplished. In the past year:  President Suharto relinqushed power.  The Indonesian Government endorsed a ballot on autonomy, which is planned for August 8th.  The United Nations, Indonesia, and Portugal are to sign an agreement today on the procedures for that vote.  If the East Timorese people reject autonomy, there is every expectation that East Timor will be on the road to independence.  The resolution that I am submitting today recognizes the positive steps that have been taken.  But it also expresses our deep concern that since January, when Indonesian President Habibie expressed the willingness to consider independence for East Timor, violence and intimidation by anti-independence militias backed by members of the Indonesian military has increased dramatically.  The perpetrators of the violence want to sabotage the vote on East Timor's future.  I spoke with one East Timorese man today, Mr. Franciso Da Costa, who witnessed the April 6th massacre of scores of people in the village of Liquica.  An Op Ed article in today's New York Times by East Timorese lawyer Aniceto guterres Lopez says it all. He wrote: ``With arms, money and a license for reckless rampages, the militia leaders have openly threatened death to anyone opposed to continued Indonesian occupation.''  I received a report earlier today that Mr. Lopez' house is surrounded and he has been threatened with death. Bishop Belo, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and one of the most courageous people I have ever had the privilege to meet, has also been threatened.  Hundreds of East Timorese civilians have been killed, injured or disappeared. Thousands have fled their homes to escape the violence, and are struggling to survive. Food and medicines are in short supply because the Indonesian Government has severely restricted access.  This resolution sounds an alarm. The situation is extremely fragile. The militias are sowing chaos and terror. Far stronger steps are needed by the Indonesian Government and military to rein in the paramilitary groups.  The resolution calls on the President and Secretary of State to intensify their efforts to urge the Indonesian Government and military to disarm the paramilitary groups. This must be done.  Another recommendation we make is that the United States contribute to the U.N. Trust Fund which will set up polling booths and put people on the ground to monitor the vote. I plan to work with Senator McConnell, who is a cosponsor of this resolution and Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, to obtain the funding as soon as possible.  The resolution says that any agreement to sell or transfer military equipment to Indonesia should state that the equipment will not be used in East Timor. We would prefer that there be no military equipment. But at the very least, we do not want our equipment ending up in the hands of thugs who are trying to derail the vote.  We know from history how much blood can be shed in East Timor. Nobody--not the Indonesian Government, not the Indonesian military, and certainly not the East Timorese people, benefits from a return to those days.  Mr. President, this resolution should receive overwhelming bipartisan support. I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times Op Ed article by Mr. Lopez be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Times, May 5, 1999]                    East Timor's Bloodiest Tradition                      (By Aniceto Guterres Lopes)       Dili, East Timor--April 6, 1999. Another massacre. April      17. Another. Two more to add to an already lengthy list in      East Timor. Since Indonesia invaded my homeland in 1975 and      officially annexed it the following year, our history has      seemed little more than a succession of massacres, one      following the other in a depressingly predictable pattern.       Although the recent attacks have many precedents, they were      committed when we were filled with unprecedented hope. Only      four months ago, the Government of President B.J. Habibie      offered us the chance to vote on whether to remain in      Indonesia or become independent. Indonesia began working out      the logistics of the vote with the United Nations and      Portugal (the former colonial power still acknowledged under      international law as the administering authority over East      Timor). Today the Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, is due to      sign the final agreement on the vote at the United Nations.       The recent wave of violence here reveals that the Habibie      Government is reneging on the promise of a peaceful      resolution to East Timor's disputed political status.      Although the Habibie Government denies it, the military,      since last December, has organized its hardened East Timorese      camp followers into militias. With arms, money and a license      for reckless rampages, the dozen or so militia leaders have      openly threatened death to anyone opposed to continued      Indonesian occupation. Their spokesman, Basilio Araujo, told      an Australian television crew, ``We will kill as many people      as we want.''       The militia bosses boast that they are countering pro-     independence guerrillas, but they have not fought a single      battle with the guerrillas. They have only attacked unarmed      civilians and created a refugee crisis. In sweeps through the      countryside, the militias have threatened to kill the      families of any male, young or old, who refuses to join their      ranks. Many ``members'' of the militias are ordinary      villagers, some of whom I know personally. They are forced      recruits sullenly going through the motions and hoping to      avoid being hurt and hurting others.       The human rights organization I direct has been trying to      care for those who fled the villages to escape the militia      threats. According to our figures, about 18,000 refugees are      now sheltered in the towns. With little food, money and      medicine, they are slowly succumbing to disease.       By unleashing the militias, the Indonesian Government's      apparent strategy is to create the appearance of a civil war.      Indonesia falsely claims to be an enlightened and neutral      arbiter between a factious and primitive people not yet ready      for independence.       As is clear to all observers, the militias have not been      engaged in any pitched battles with pro-independence forces.      They attacked, with axes and machetes, hundreds of helpless      refugees sheltered in a church in Liquica on April 6. My      staff has recorded the names of 57 dead, many of them women      and children. Here in East Timor's capital, they attacked      another group of about 150 refugees on April 17. Meanwhile,      the pro-independence guerrillas, observing a cease-fire since      December, refrained from responding to the militias' attacks      on civilians until mid-April, as the Indonesian military      spokesman in East Timor has admitted.       The militias have no other aim than to sow chaos and      terror. Instead of allowing us to vote on whether to remain      within Indonesia, the militia bosses are killing those who      oppose them and vowing to wreck the United Nations-supervised      vote scheduled for August. Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, who      won the Novel Peace Prize in 1996, is on their hit list, as      are Australian journalists, East Timorese students and human      rights workers (myself included). The militia bosses are even      threatening to attack United Nations officials who will come      to administer the vote.       Sadly, President Habibie and his top military commander,      Gen. Wiranto, have done nothing to stop the militias. Over      the past five months, the gang leaders have, in public view,      committed atrocities and issued death threats. Yet they move      around with impunity. The much-publicized ``peace pact'' Gen.      Wiranto arranged in Dili on April 21 was nothing more than a      public relations stunt. The militias continue to attack      unarmed civilians unilaterally.       For a free and fair vote to be held, Portugal and the      United States will have to insist on a disarming of the      militias and a substantial withdrawal of Indonesia's all-     pervasive troops. The United States, holding considerable      leverage over bankrupt Indonesia, should take strong action,      like cutting off all military aid and training until a valid      vote on independence is held in East Timor.       Every day my staff records more cases of torture,      disappearances and killings. All East Timorese, except for a      few deranged militia leaders, have experienced enough      violence in their lives. We are desperate for a peaceful      resolution. Yet the Indonesian military, by allowing these      militias to be deployed, is drowning our hopes in blood.
