 Crosby to again justify the claims regarding the EADS and Airbus contributions to this country on jobs, suppliers and economic contributions. For more than a year, his company has refused to answer my questions and the requests from the Department of Commerce. I asked Mr. Crosby to make public the EADS 2002 tanker proposal submitted to the Air Force.  We know the Air Force said the proposal was high risk, more expensive than Boeing, and could limit U.S. force projection worldwide. For 2 years, EADS and Airbus have been able to access Boeing proprietary information about its technology and pricing, that came available during the tanker program review.  Now, after spending $90 million to develop a tanker it previously did not have, Airbus wants to reopen the tanker contract after it has already seen all of Boeing's cards. Airbus has learned an awful lot about Boeing and tankers and it has used that new technology to best Boeing in a recent tanker competition for Australia. Mr. Crosby will not talk about his 2002 proposal. He wants to compete with Boeing based on everything Airbus has learned about Boeing over 2 years and an additional $90 million investment in tankers.  Finally, I asked Mr. Crosby to provide a full accounting of Airbus' involvement with the tanker lease program on par with the various information subpoenaed from both the Department of Defense and Boeing.  I also asked Mr. Crosby to provide a full accounting of Airbus' lobbying activities, including support given to tanker opponents. I await a reply from Mr. Crosby.  Let me say that given the tremendous damage Airbus has done to the commercial aerospace industry in this country, and particularly in Washington State, I have real questions about the appropriateness of U.S. taxpayer dollars going to strengthen Europe's competitive position and hurting American aerospace workers.  I have talked in great detail tonight about why EADS and Airbus are threats to the U.S. aerospace leadership and to American workers. Europe has a plan to take over global leadership in aerospace. Europe views aerospace as a social program, a jobs program for the benefit of Europeans. Airbus and EADS are the prime example of Europe's vision for its citizen and its aerospace industry.  There are real consequences for U.S. national security in what happens here. We have to retain our supplier base, our skilled workforce, and our technological advantages to project force and to defend our Nation.  We have a decision to make in Washington, DC. U.S. policymakers on behalf of the American people have to decide whether we want to sit idly by as Europe hopes we continue to do or whether we want to commit ourselves to a future in global aerospace.  I conclude by talking briefly about a few things we must do to keep American workers at the forefront of commercial aerospace. Let me offer three specific suggestions.  First of all, we should hold Europe accountable for its market-distorting actions. We have to look seriously at a trade case to challenge Europe's failure to adhere to its treaty obligations. We have to recognize the future of aerospace is larger than a trade case or a Boeing dispute with Airbus. Only a determined Federal commitment to aerospace will assure our children and our grandchildren opportunity to compete for the high-skill, high-wage aerospace jobs of the future.  Second, we should not reward EADS and Airbus for their market-distorting, job-killing behavior. Airbus wants U.S. policymakers and the public to buy its campaign that it is a good U.S. citizen. That is baloney. They are trying to mask the real harm they are posing to American workers.  Europe wants to further weaken U.S. aerospace competitors by accessing U.S. taxpayer-funded defense programs. And, most offensively, Airbus is working to undermine both the Air Force and the Boeing Company to kill the tanker program so it may ultimately outsource tanker manufacturing to Europe.  It is long past time to shine a very bright light on Airbus and its lobbying efforts in Washington, DC. If we reward their underhanded methods, if we let them steal the tanker contract away from our American workers, the American taxpayers will be paying Europe to help finish off our aerospace industry.  I don't see how we can let a subsidized foreign company use our tax dollars to put Americans out of work.But if they get away with their lobbying, their bogus claims, and their PR campaign, we will have bought Airbus a sledgehammer to whack away at our aerospace industry. That is outrageous. We cannot let it happen. We need to hold Europe accountable for what it has done and we need to make sure Airbus is not rewarded for its bad actions.  Finally, we should act boldly to embrace many of the recommendations from the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry.  The administration is acting on a number of fronts. Congress must do more, as well. As a first step, Congress should create a Joint Committee on Aerospace. I intend to introduce legislation to create that joint committee. It will help Congress recognize our future is very much tied to aerospace and commercial aerospace, in particular. A dedicated group of House and Senate Members with a targeted agenda can help the administration and the country recommit itself to the next century of global aerospace leadership.  I have sounded the alarm. No Member of Congress can claim they did not know what European governments and Airbus are doing to American workers. This is a critical industry. They are jobs worth fighting for.  I am not willing to surrender our leadership in the second century of flight. There is a battle for the future of the aerospace industry. Europe is putting its full support, subsidies, and power behind Airbus, and it is working. We have to get off the sidelines.  I am committed to working in the Senate to make sure American workers have a fighting chance to lead the world in aerospace. I know if we focus on the challenge before us, our country will recover from this, just as Seattle recovered from the downturn in the 1970s. We have a bright future ahead if we take the steps I have outlined and hold on to our leadership in commercial aerospace.  Aviation was born in America 100 years ago. Let's make sure Americans are leading it 100 years from now.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
