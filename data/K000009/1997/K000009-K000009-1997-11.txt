Speaker, I thank our ranking member, the gentleman from Cleveland, OH [Mr. Stokes] for granting me this time, along with our chairman, the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis], who has been very gracious.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to engage the chairman in a colloquy on the proposed VA cemetery, Veterans Administration Cemetery in Guilford Township, Ohio. I am concerned about the potential conflict that could arise between Federal and local land and water uses between Medina County and Wayne County related to the development of that new veterans cemetery.  As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations and a member of this VA-HUD subcommittee as well, I have heard from many local officials and citizens in the community concerned about farmlands preservation being essential to the maintenance of a sound rural economy in this region of Ohio.  Before the final Federal water contracts are negotiated, I would urge the Veterans Administration to meet with township and other local officials in both counties to ensure that local land use is respected, the impact of the proposed VA water acquisition on productive farmland is assessed, and the best water source for the new national cemetery is developed.
