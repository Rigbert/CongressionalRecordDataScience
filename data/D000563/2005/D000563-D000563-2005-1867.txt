President, this amendment will exempt from the bankruptcy bill's means test those disabled veterans whose indebtedness occurred primarily during a period of military service. They have given us their arms, their legs, very important parts of their lives.  After 2 weeks of debate, after scores of amendments that have failed, I ask my colleagues, just once, in the consideration of this bill, whether they will take into their consideration those who, because of misfortunes they could not control, have had their lives seriously changed. We need to honor these veterans who have given so much to America.  If the Senate owes a great debt to the credit card industry, don't we owe a greater debt to these brave soldiers? I ask you to vote aye.
