Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Doris L. Beach, who passed from this life on November 13, 2012 at age 74. Doris was a true humanitarian and gave of herself fully. For more than forty years, Doris Beach was the face of Green Thumb, now known as Experience Works Inc. linking capable older adults with employment. A tireless advocate in pursuit of job opportunities for older adults, that service was her passion.  One of six children, Doris Beach graduated from high school in Pittsburgh. She briefly worked in a hospital and broadcasting, but soon found her calling as she set out to make Toledo's Green Thumb the best senior employment service. She sought out employers, when necessary taught them the value of hiring older workers, and matched older workers to the jobs. Explained her longtime colleague Billie Johnson, president of the Area Office on Aging of Northwest Ohio, ``She was so out-of-the box and didn't think in traditional terms of how to find employers who would hire retirees. She went above and beyond and knew how to help a retiree package a skill set.'' Doris knew the work ethic of older adults, understood their needs and guided them toward their potential. She was an inspiration to all who knew her, an amazing woman. We knew her for her ``ready smile, a raspy voice, compassion and an air of authority'' and she was endeared to us all.  In addition to her life's work, Doris Beach gave to her church, St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church, and her family was most important. She was a well-loved sister and aunt. We share her family's sorrow at her passing, and hope they find comfort in the gift that was her remarkable life. Through Doris' life-giving counsel and street smarts borne of struggle, her persevering work bettered the lives of thousands of older Americans and gave them added meaning and purpose. Our community remains indebted always to the ethic of service to others her life embodies.                          ____________________
