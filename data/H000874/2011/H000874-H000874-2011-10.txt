Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.  It is December 20, and the Republicans are using it as a day to dissemble, pretending to support a tax cut for working Americans while making it uncertain and delayed.  We, of course, as we all know, could pass the Senate bill by 2 o'clock today, send it to the President, and provide certainty to working Americans come January 1 that their taxes will not go up.  The choice, I suggest to all of you, is not between 60 days and 1 year, because at least we all say we're for 1 year--we are for 1 year, we will support a 1-year extension--but we know the Senate has been unable to agree. So they sent us back an agreement that they could agree on to give us 60 days to get to that 1 year.  Instead, House Republicans refuse to even bring the Senate's bipartisan compromise to the floor. Eighty-nine U.S. Senators voted for a compromise, and you will not bring it to the floor. You create uncertainty and anxiety among the public.                              {time}  1300  That is shameful and disappointing.  As a result, on January 1, if there is no agreement, those of you who vote to send this to conference today and against this motion to instruct will be responsible for 160 million Americans seeing their taxes increase next year, for 2.3 million people seeking jobs who will lose their unemployment lifeline by mid-February, and for 48 million Americans having their access to doctors placed in jeopardy.  Those are the stakes.  America thought we had an agreement this weekend. John McCain thought we had an agreement this Saturday--and yes, Speaker Boehner thought we had an agreement on Saturday. America thought there was reason to hope that middle class Americans would be spared this entirely preventable tax increase.  I tell you, my friends, if this were about the upper income tax increase, it would pass like lightning in your conference--like lightning. But no. This is about putting in jeopardy a middle class tax cut, and we could play political games with that. We're now witnessing the concluding convulsion of confrontation and obstruction in this most unproductive, Tea Party-dominated, partisan session of Congress. As a result, Speaker Boehner decided he wasn't for the agreement.  Now let me tell you what Speaker Boehner said 6 months ago, because there was a lot of talk about this 1-year extension. He called proposals to extend or expand the payroll tax cut at that point by a year ``another little short-term gimmick.''  Same rhetoric. Different circumstances. But both put at risk the middle class.
