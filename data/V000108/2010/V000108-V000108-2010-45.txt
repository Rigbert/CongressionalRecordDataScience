Rick Mazer, from Saint John, Indiana. On April 8, 2010, Rick was honored by Horseshoe Casino and the Northwest Indiana Forum in appreciation for his many years of service as a dedicated executive and for his numerous contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana. The celebration took place at Gamba Ristorante in Merrillville, Indiana.  Rick Mazer's professional and academic career led him to become a prominent leader in the gaming industry for nearly thirty years. In 1976, Rick earned a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Boston University. His lifelong career in the gaming industry began in 1979, in Atlantic City, where he held various positions at Caesar's Entertainment and Resorts International. In 1991, Rick's career led him to Peoria, Illinois where he played an instrumental role in the grand opening of Par-A-Dice Riverboat Casino, where he served as Vice President of Marketing. In late 1995, Mr. Mazer became the Director of Marketing and Advertising at the Empress Casino in Joliet, Illinois. He joined the team at Horseshoe Casino nearly fifteen years ago and successfully maintained a leadership role through three ownerships. In 2007, due to his outstanding management skills and superior business strategies, Rick was subsequently promoted to oversee the two Harrah's Entertainment casinos that book-end the state, picking up responsibilities for what was known as Caesars Indiana, now Horseshoe Southern Indiana. Mr. Mazer led the transformation from one great brand to another. The ``mother of all boats'', or MOAB, is the moniker fondly used internally to reference the $500 million casino that Rick spearheaded. The design, construction, and opening of one of the most stunning casinos in America could have only happened under his guidance. For his efforts, Mr. Mazer has been presented with the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce Business Person of the Year award. After years of service in the Indiana market, Rick was given an opportunity to oversee multiple casinos in America's gaming capital, Las Vegas. Staying within the Harrah's Entertainment family has made the transition very smooth.  Rick Mazer exemplifies what it means to be a true leader. His outstanding leadership skills are reflected by staff members, who have been quoted as saying, ``Rick actively engages members of his team, constantly challenging them to expand their expertise while fostering their talent and growth. Rick understands that with a truly engaged team, anything is possible.''  In addition to his impressive professional career, Rick passionately serves the people of Northwest Indiana through his involvement in many community organizations. Among his many contributions, Rick is actively involved with the Northwest Indiana Forum, Tradewinds Rehabilitative Services, Northwest Indiana Symphony Orchestra, Casino Association of Indiana, Lake Area United Way, Crisis Center, Haven House, American Cancer Society, Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce, Lake County Convention and Visitor's Bureau Hospitality Committee, and the Indiana Black Expo. For his many charitable efforts, Rick was awarded the prestigious Raoul Wallenberg Humanitarian Award. For his continuous, selfless devotion to the community of Northwest Indiana, Mr. Mazer is to be highly commended.  Rick's dedication to his community is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. This coming May, he and his wonderful wife, Aria, will celebrate 30 years of marriage. They have two beloved daughters, Ericka and Racquel.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Mr. Rick Mazer as he is honored for his lifetime of service and dedication to the Northwest Indiana community. Rick continues to touch the lives of countless people,and for his unselfish, lifelong commitment, he is worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
