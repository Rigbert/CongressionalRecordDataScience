 President, I support the amendment offered by Senators Hatch, Shelby, and Grassley regarding the drug office. I strongly support the addition of $3.9 million to help our new Drug Director--General McCaffrey--with the increased staff he needs. As my colleagues know, I have the distinction of being the author of the law that opened the Office of National Drug Control Policy. It took more than a decade worth of effort to start this office--the Reagan administration opposed my every effort to have a Drug Director. It was not until 1988 that they finally relented.  Let me also offer a little history about why the Drug Office staff was reduced in the first place. Under the previous administration, the Drug Office had become overrun with political appointees. Frankly, it became a political dumping ground with the greatest percentage of political appointees of any Cabinet agency. This was not the only reason for the reduction in staff, but it was the key reason I did not oppose the reduction.  But, today we have a new Drug Director, an accomplished, impressive general who has been tasked with the difficult job of bringing action to our national effort against drugs. The General has asked for, and the President has formally requested, an additional $3.9 million to increase the staff by 80 personnel.  Today, we are offered an amendment sponsored by Republican Senators that provides what General McCaffrey requested. It is my hope that this signals that my Republican colleagues will be as supportive of General McCaffrey's future requests as they are of this one.
