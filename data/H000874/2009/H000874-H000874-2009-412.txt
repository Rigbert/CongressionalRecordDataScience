I find that somewhat ironic.  But, in any event, in answer to your question, I think we have learned that we needed greater accountability. Very frankly, we thought the Bush administration would exercise more accountability and oversight. We provided, as I am sure you know, significant oversight. Now you call it after sight, and that may be an apt term to it, but we provided significant oversight, including the GAO, which has said it was not done as well as it should have been done, which led to Mr. Frank's legislation, which was on the floor yesterday. So we think that was very positive.  In closing, I appreciate the gentlelady saying this was the appropriate thing to bring to the floor. We provided legislation that would be brought to the floor. It is here.  I would, in closing, urge all of the Members, notwithstanding the fact that it's on the floor, notwithstanding that their vote will be of no effect. I understand it will be a statement to our constituents where we stand on the issue. And this is an unpopular program. But, across the board, liberal and conservative economists, the Secretary of the Treasury, present and future, President Bush and President Obama, have both concluded that if we are to meet the economic crisis that confronts us, moving forward with the additional second phase of TARP is essential.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion of disapproval.
