Madam Speaker, today I wish to honor Brigadier General William J. Sharrow--a truly great American. Bill has tirelessly served this country for many years, managing some of our country's important military programs. Most recently, Bill served as my State Director, where he dedicated himself to tirelessly working for the people of Alaska.  Born in Witherbee, New York on August 19, 1932, Bill entered the Army in 1952. He served with the 867th AAA Battalion at Fort Richardson, Alaska until his discharge in November 1954. He returned home to New York and joined an Army Reserve Unit. However, he realized his heart was back in Alaska and returned a short time later to make Alaska his permanent home. Bill joined the Alaskan Army National Guard where he served as First Sergeant of Company D, 207th Infantry Battalion until he was commissioned in November 1956.  Some of Bill's many roles in the National Guard include: radio repairman, supply officer, administrative assistant, personnel officer and Command Administrative Assistant to the Adjutant General. His military assignments range from platoon leader to battalion commander. He served as Chief of Staff for the Alaska Army National Guard from 1972 to 1974 and was appointed as Assistant Adjutant General on February 7, 1974. Bill's dedication to our Nation was federally recognized on June 25, 1974 when he was promoted to Brigadier General.  During his 20 plus years of service to Alaska and to his country, Bill remained a strong leader who set an example of achievement that was unmatched. He represented the United States with honor and dignity and continuously strove for excellence. The loss to the United States the day Bill left his post, was a great gain to me and to all Alaskans.  Bill worked for me for 24 years as my State Director. When I was unable to attend an important function or meeting, it was Bill that I always be trusted to represent me. We share a common love of Alaska and its people and it was comforting for me to know that when work forced me to remain in Washington, Bill would always be there to listen to the Alaskan people and keep them informed of our work.  Bill has been happily married to Margaret for 52 years and is the father of 3 sons: David who lives in Anchorage, AK; Phillip who lives in Auckland, New Zealand; and Steven who lives in Fairbanks, AK. He is also the grandfather to 6 grandchildren. I know that Bill is looking forward to spending more time with his family and traveling around the world with the love of his life, Marg.  Bill has always provided sage advice to colleagues and staff and done so with quick wit and much humor. Bill was an invaluable employee and he will be sorely missed but he continues to be a dear friend and confidant. I will miss his daily leadership and guidance but know that our friendship will endure. My wife Lu and I wish him and Marg all the best as they embark on this new chapter of their lives.                          ____________________
