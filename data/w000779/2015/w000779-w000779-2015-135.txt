President, this trade package is about bringing our policies into 2015. This amendment would throw us back into the 1950s.  President Kennedy, who first proposed TAA, called it a program to afford time for American initiative, American adaptability, and American resiliency to assert itself. To me, those sound like sound bipartisan priorities.  This package will expand TAA and help ensure workers are not knocked off stride in tough times. Let's not turn our backs on this country's workers. Let's not break the bipartisan compact this bill represents.  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.
