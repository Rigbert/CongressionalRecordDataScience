 I have discussed this matter with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and it is his view--and I share that view, certainly--that in that instance granting a unanimous consent would be appropriate. Obviously, if the circumstances change and such an amendment were necessary, I think the gentleman will find that the chairman is inclined--and I believe the subcommittee chairman will be inclined--to give unanimous consent to achieve that objective.
