Bonaminio, a Riverside Police Officer and Army veteran. Today I ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible man who died in the line of duty while serving and protecting his community.  On Sunday, November 7, 2010, Ryan was shot after pursuing a driver of a stolen vehicle, and who was also suspected of a hit-and-run in downtown Riverside. Bonaminio became the first City of Riverside police officer to die in the line of duty in ten years. He was two weeks shy of his 28th birthday.  Officer Ryan Bonaminio was born in Riverside, California on November 25, 1982. He is survived by his parents, Joseph and Geraldine Bonaminio, along with his brother Christopher and sister Nicole. After graduating from Ramona High School in 2000 he joined the U.S. Army. He served with the 314th Military Police and served in Kuwait City, Baghdad, Mosul and Umm Qasr in southern Iraq. He also served in the 282nd Base Support Battalion in Hohenfels, Germany. After his honorable discharge from the Army, Ryan returned to Riverside and joined the Riverside Police Department on July 7, 2006, and graduated from the San Bernardino County Sheriffs Academy on December 21, 2006.  Bonaminio served both in the military and in the police force with honor and distinction, and was praised by his peers and supervisors on many occasions. For his outstanding service he had been awarded several medals, including the Army Commendation Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Army Reserve Mobilization Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Army Reserve Overseas Training Ribbon, Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal, and earned his Expert Qualification Badge-9mm pistol.  Friends and family of Officer Bonaminio describe his constant smile and generous heart. His actions on November 7th demonstrate that he was a brave young man who was unwavering in his dedication to protect the community. It is a sad irony to think that Ryan survived overseas fighting for our country on foreign soil, only to come home and be fatally wounded protecting his home community.  The day the Bonaminio family learned of their son and brother's death was probably the hardest day they have ever faced and our thoughts, prayers go out to them. They have our deepest gratitude for their sacrifice and Ryan's service to our nation. There are no words that can relieve their pain and what words we can offer only just begin to convey our deep respect and highest appreciation.  The dangers our police officers face every day often go unnoticed and without remark. Officer Bonaminio's death is a stark reminder of the very real threats that police officers face on a daily basis protecting us and our communities. We will never know what Officer Bonaminio's future would have been but our world is certainly less bright without him in it. We all share in the loss of such a promising, courageous and truly remarkable young man. The goodness Officer Bonaminio brought to this world and the sacrifice he has made, will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
