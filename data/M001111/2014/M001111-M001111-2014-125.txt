 President, I would like to speak about the excellent nominee we are considering to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Washington, Stan Bastian.  In my home State of Washington we have a bipartisan judicial selection process that allows us to recommend nominees who are supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, and while we don't always agree on every nominee, that process has served our State well for a long time. As the Senate votes today on the nomination of Mr. Bastian, I would like to inform my colleagues that during the bipartisan process to select him, his support was unanimous. That means every Republican and every Democrat who helps select judicial nominees in our State supports Mr. Bastian on the Federal bench. In today's political atmosphere, that is the strongest endorsement I can think of.  He has nearly 30 years of litigation experience. He is a fellow in the American College of Trial Lawyers. He is the chairman of the Equal Justice Coalition, and throughout his career he has served the Washington bar, first as a member of the board of governors and eventually as president. He has practiced in both State and Federal courts, tried hundreds of cases, including civil and criminal cases and jury and bench trials.  Our system of government is at its best when good people step up to the plate and are willing to serve. Throughout his legal career Stan Bastian has done just that. So I am here to express my support and urge our colleagues to do the same.  Thank you. I yield the floor.
