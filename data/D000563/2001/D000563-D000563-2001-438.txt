President, I rise today to introduce a resolution honoring The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on the 135th Anniversary of their founding.  The dedicated volunteers of The ASPCA have provided shelter, medical care, and placement for abandoned and abused animals for more than a century.  The ASPCA is the oldest animal welfare organization in North America. Henry Bergh began the organization in 1866 as a platform to prevent the cruel beating of carriage horses in New York City. Today, The ASPCA is a national organization, employing 680,000 workers and providing services to millions of people and their animals. The success of the organization has made the term ASPCA synonymous with ``animal rescue'', ``animal shelter'', ``animal adoptions'' and ``humane education.''  In my homestate of Illinois, The ASPCA has an Animal Poison Control Center--the first and only non-profit animal-dedicated poison control center in the U.S. In 1996, The ASPCA acquired the center from the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. The center is committed to relieving pain, fear and suffering in animals who have been poisoned, and to provide education on toxicology.  The ASPCA continues to educate adults and children that kindness, caring and respect for all creatures benefits both humans and animals. In addition, millions of Americans have participated in ``Prevention-of-Cruelty-to-Animals'' activities in the month of April through their schools and civic organizations.  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in congratulating the staff, directors and volunteers at The ASPCA on a successful 135 years of service                          ____________________
