Speaker, and I thank my chairman, Mr. Deal, as well. Particularly, I want to thank Chairman Barton and his staff; I want to thank the Republican leadership and their staff for getting this bill to the floor so quickly. I also want to thank my Democratic cosponsor, Mr. Larsen, who I know is rushing to the floor to speak, and I know that in his district I am told that he has I think lost five individuals because of this.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5280 is a simple bill to ban the Internet sale of a drug called dextromethorphan, also known as DXM.  DXM is an excellent ingredient for a lot of cough syrups that are on the market and when used properly there is no danger. And I know that because I have a company in my district that makes this, and that same company came to me earlier this summer and said, we have a problem that we think you ought to be alerted to. And that is what this bill does.  There are some folks that are out there that are absolutely determined to sell this ingredient in its dry bulk form on the Internet. Sadly, kids are buying it. They are mixing it with alcohol to get high. In a massive dose, the drug can raise the blood pressure, lead to seizure or collapse into a coma and die, as we have seen in Mr. Larsen's district and other places around the country. In fact, in the last 2 years we know that there have been at least five deaths directly attributed to this abuse.  The companies and the pharmacists that work with this ingredient on a regular basis don't want it to become the next meth. We have worked on that; we don't want another one. And they know that there is absolutely no reason to have this bulk ingredient outside of the regular channels for drug manufacturing. And that is why, as was said by Mr. Pallone, it is endorsed by the American Pharmacist Association, the Consumer Health Care Products Association, which is the generic drug manufacturers, the Food Marketing Institute, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and obviously the Partnership for a Drug Free America.                              {time}  1115  This bill allows the FDA to promulgate the rule on the sale of unfinished powder or bulk DXM. It limits the distribution of DXM to only those persons who are a valid part of the drug industry.  This bill, I think, will cut off the supply of pure DXM to those who sell it as a street drug or plan to use it to get high themselves. We need to pass this bill.  Sadly, kids are under the false impression that getting high off this is harmless because it is simply an ingredient in cough syrup. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our kids are playing Russian roulette each time they get high on DXM. Sooner or later somebody is going to die. We have seen it happen. Enough is enough. We need to end it.  I am pleased that we have had so many here in just the last 2 days coming into the office. Yesterday local CBS national radio talked about this as a terrible case that is plaguing many parts of America. Today I think it was on the Today show that they talked about this. We are acting quickly. We have recognized the problem and we are acting quickly. We need to pass this bill today and have the Senate adopt it as well.
