Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit. The language that would be offered, I believe by either the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) or by the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), would force most health care providers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to provide chemicals and devices that result in early abortions.  What is largely unknown and largely misunderstood is the fact that some devices and some chemicals that advertise as contraceptives also have the effect of preventing implantation of a newly created human being.  For example, the copper IUD, when inserted up to 7 days after intercourse, after intercourse, acts in a way that does not prevent fertilization, but it acts in a way to prevent implantation. That is advertised as emergency contraception.  If a conscientious objector who is not basing his or her objection on religious beliefs or plan would like to not provide this, they would not have that opportunity because it is a mandate. That is what we are talking about.  All of these things are permissible under current administrative policy and current law. All of these things are permissible, including early abortions through these chemicals. What is not the case, they are not mandated.  This is all about a mandate saying to a plan, you either tow the line and offer copper IUDs 7 days after intercourse, or you lose your ability to be in this program; and that is where the mandate ought to be rejected. Keep it permissible, not mandatory. Vote ``no'' on the motion.                              {time}  1915
