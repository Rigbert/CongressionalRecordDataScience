 President, I was troubled by a recent report in Roll Call which details a plan by House Republicans to devise a media campaign to support their efforts to shut down the government in order to restrict census sampling. I ask that this article be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.  Mr. President, the census is a critical issue for my State and for the nation. The census count determines how nearly 200 billion of federal funds are allocated. An inaccurate count means that these federal funds are misallocated.  According to a recent study by the nonpartisan General Accounting Office, the 1990 census undercounted the United States population by about 4 million people--or approximately 1.6 percent of the entire population.  Many states had undercounts above the national average. California's undercount was 2.7 percent; New Mexico's was 3.1 percent; Texas' 2.8 percent; and Arizona's 2.4 percent, just to name a few.  According to the GAO, 22 of the 25 large formula grant programs use census data as part of their allocation formula. Those funds are used for our schools, health care facilities, and transit systems. California was the most harmed because of the 1990 census undercount, losing nearly 2.2 billion in federal funds, or 2,660 per person missed.  In 1998 alone, California lost 198 million in federal funds for Medicaid; 9.4 million for foster care; 3.2 million for Social Security; 1.9 million for child care and development; and 1.1 million for vocational training. Millions more in federal dollars for adoption assistance, prevention and treatment of substance abuse, highway planning and construction, and other programs did not flow to California because of the inaccurate census.  Other states also suffer: Texas lost almost 1 billion because of the 1990 undercount, and Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana each lost over $100 million.  Moreover, all areas and groups are not undercounted at the same rate, and some members of our society are more likely to be missed than others. According to the GAO, 5.7 percent of African Americans were not counted in the 1990 Census. Nor were 5 percent of Latinos and 4.5 percent of Native Americans. Of the 835,000 people undercounted in California, most were minorities. Nearly half the net undercount--47 percent--were Hispanic. Twenty-two percent were African-American and 8 percent were Asian.  Such differences in census coverage introduce inequities in political representation and in the distribution of federal funds. Because Hispanics, African-Americans, and other minority groups had a larger undercount than whites in the 1990 Census--as in prior censuses--minorities and the communities in which they live have been disadvantaged in government programs in which population is an important factor in fund allocation.  This is an issue of basic fairness. Every American should be counted. And unless we can provide the Census Bureau with our support for an accurate census, and do so without any political intervention, then we run the risk of doing a grave injustice to our citizens.  Since the failed 1990 population count, the Census Bureau has worked with experts to design a more accurate census for 2000. The National Academy of Sciences, in three separate reports, concluded that the key to improving accuracy in the census is the use of sound statistical methods to count those missed during the conventional ``head count.'' This involves detailed ``statistical sampling'' to determine the characteristics of those who are missed by the head count.  But for partisan reasons, some in Congress evidently prefer to ignore the expert advice and plan to shut down part of the government rather than see an accurate count. They argue that sampling is unnecessary. Unfortunately, during the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal the undercount was 6.5 percent for Sacramento, California; 3.1 percent for the Menominee Indian Reservation in Wisconsin; and 9.1 percent for the entire state of South Carolina.  The magnitude of such undercounts and the implications for the 2000 Census that fails to correct the problem are particularly great for states with large and diverse populations, such as Florida, Texas, Arizona, New York, California and many others.  The Supreme Court has affirmed that sampling is required for purposes other than apportionment if `feasible'.  The census should not be about politics. And Mr. President, I will oppose any efforts to include any restrictions on the ability of the Bureau of the Census to conduct the most accurate census possible. Anything else would simply be unfair.  The article follows:GOP GIRDS FOR CENSUS BATTLE FIRST TO HOLD JOB, HE'S LEAVING FOR PRIVATE                                  SECTOR                  (By Jim VandeHei and John Mercurio)       Fearing the loss of two dozen House seats if his party      blinks, Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) has tapped former      National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Bill      Paxon (N.Y.) to prepare GOP troops for a budget fight over      the 2000 Census that could provoke a partial government      shutdown.       At Hastert's request, Paxon huddled this week with NRCC      Chairman Tom Davis (Va.), Republican media strategist Eddie      Mahe and others to help devise a coordinated strategy to      block President Clinton's plan to use sampling in the 2000      Census.       ``I am one of a group of people trying to figure out how to      keep Mr. Bill Clinton from imposing his political      calculations on the census,'' Mahe said in an interview.       The impending battle will erupt in earnest next month when      GOP leaders begin working on the funding bill for Commerce,      Justice, State, the judiciary and related agencies. During      last year's budget negotiations, Republicans and Clinton      agreed to put off final decisions on whether to fund the use      of sampling until this June, when the results of the Census      Bureau's dress rehearsals would be available and the Supreme      Court would have ruled on a much-anticipated legal challenge      to sampling.       The budget fight follows the High Court's decision in late      January that the bureau's plan to use sampling in the      decennial for reapportionment of House seats violates the      Census Act.       But according to pro-sampling Democrats' interpretation of      Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion, the federal      government can, ``if feasible,'' use sampling for the very      different purpose of redistricting, or the redrawing of House      district boundary lines, within each state.       Following the court's ruling, Census Bureau Director      Kenneth Prewitt said the Clinton administration will seek an      increased level of funding to conduct two counts--one using      the GOP-backed practice of trying to count every American,      the other using the Clinton-endorsed sampling.       Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to amend the Census Act to      allow sampling for reapportionment, and Republicans will try      to place language in the spending bill that would restrict      funding for any sampling practices associated with the      census.       The GOP plan, according to informed sources, likely will      include a media campaign against Clinton's plan, which most      House Democrats support.       It will also include a lobbying campaign to convince      Republican Members to stand up to Clinton if he threatens to      shut down the government to scare off opposition.       ``Everybody knows this is 'do or die' for the party,'' said      one GOP official familiar with the nascent strategy. ``We're      not going to back down on this.''       That spending plan will include a provision preventing the      bureau from using statistical sampling, which Hastert and      Paxon fear will cost Republicans dozens of House seats in the      new millennium.       ``The Speaker and virtually every GOP leader believe no      single vote will have greater ramifications on the future of      the Republican majority than the vote to block President      Clinton from changing the way we conduct the census,'' said      one Hastert confidant.       But Democrats understand that if Clinton backs down,      Republicans' chances of retaining their majority will      increase.       He won't capitulate to GOP demands, according to      senior Democratic leadership sources.       ``They have never shown any weakness and I don't know why      they would,'' said a top Democratic adviser, who insisted      White House officials will shut down the government if      Republicans refuse to back down.       Democrats said the Republican moves show they are preparing      to allow this battle to result in a shutdown. A government      shutdown in 1995 caused their party's support to plummet and      ultimately led to a more conciliatory tone among House GOP      leaders.       ``They weren't able to convince the American people to      believe they were justified in doing that in 1995, and I      don't see how they would be able to do so in 1999,'' said      Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the      Government Reform Committee.       ``If they do make it a partisan issue and close down three      departments of government, they're going to need to spend a      lot of money to try to convince people they're not being      partisan again,'' Waxman said. ``And I don't think they're      going to succeed.''       Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), the ranking member of the      Government Reform subcommittee on the census, said Democrats      can turn back the Republican budget proposal by appealing to      ``at least 10 Republicans'' to support sampling. So far, only      three Republicans--Reps. Connie Morella (Md.), Christopher      Shays (Conn.) and Nancy Johnson (Conn.)--have sided with      Democrats in the sampling battle.       ``I truly believe there are at least 10 Republicans who      truly care about their constituents and their country who      would not go along with this.''       But Maloney said the GOP media plan ``wouldn't surprise me.      The Republican machine has been focussing like a laser beam      on this subject in their attempts to make sure that blacks,      Hispanics and Asians are not counted. It's wrong, and they      should stop.''       While talk of a government shutdown may be hyperbole by      both sides, the political posturing underscores how      contentious the upcoming budget debate will be.       Last Congress, Republican and Democratic leaders ended      months of bickering over the census by delaying a final      decision until after the election. They passed a six-month      funding bill and agreed to tackle the tricky topic when the      pressure of impending elections subsided and the Supreme      Court had ruled on a legal challenge to the sampling plan.       The six-month funding bill expires in June, but Hastert      wants appropriators to start work soon, likely early next      month, to provide leadership with as much as time as possible      to avert a shutdown.       In the meantime, Paxon is working with several Members and      strategists to develop a plan to win the public relations war      over the census.       Besides Davis, Mahe and Paxon, House Administration      Chairman Bill Thomas (R-Calif.); Rep. Dan Miller (R-Fla.),      chairman of the Government Reform subcommittee on the census;      and two GOP strategists, Bill Greener and Chuck Greener, are      intimately involved in the strategizing, sources said.       Paxon's team is considering a paid media campaign to      educate voters on the census issue in the weeks leading up to      a final vote on legislation and a variety of communications      ideas to prevent the PR debacle in the wake of the 1995      government shutdown, the sources said.       GOP leaders have not decided who will run the media      campaign or who will pay for it.       In the meantime, Hastert plans to hand more money to Miller      and his census subcommittee to conduct an oversight      investigation into how the administration is reacting to the      Supreme Court decision on sampling.       He also plans to educate Members on the topic and lobby      them to support the leadership's position.       Davis said GOP leaders don't anticipate more than one      Republican defecting, though both Shays and Morella remain      opposed to leadership's position, according to their      spokesmen. ``And we'll pick up some Democrats,'' he said,      though he refused to list any possibilities.                          ____________________
