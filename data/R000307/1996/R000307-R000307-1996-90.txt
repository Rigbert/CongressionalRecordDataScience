Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, as the gentleman knows, you are looking at possibly the strongest possible defender of the CRP. To have those acres remain in the Great Plains, where we truly need it in this criteria, there is an out-option. The farmer may leave the Conservation Reserve Program, but not, of course, in terms of the highly environmentally sensitive ground. When he does that, on his own volition, the Secretary then has the same number of acres and money and he can apply it to other sensitive acres. But there is no criteria to move this program from one section of the country to another.
