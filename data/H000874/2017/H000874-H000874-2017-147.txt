Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Members ought to plan accordingly.  Secondly, Mr. Speaker, the Appropriations Committee is marking up its bills, but we have not yet adopted a budget and, therefore, have no House-approved top line for discretionary spending.  Can the majority leader give us any view as to whether or not the Budget Committee may be reporting, before we leave for the August break, a budget establishing an upper line for discretionary spending?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I have two good pieces of information I would take from there. The Budget Committee will be marking up in committee next week. Appropriations, as you know, because you were a member of it, I have never seen appropriations work like they have this year, knowing that we have a new administration, knowing that you get the budget late, but they have every single bill, all 12, out of subcommittee already. As of the end of the day, they will have seven out of full committee, and at the end of next week, they will have all 12 done through subcommittee and full committee.  So I knew you would be excited. Those are concerns of yours.
