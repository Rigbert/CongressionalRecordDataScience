Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am definitively not in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I want to congratulate the gentleman on this, creating a permanent set-aside for this critical harbor maintenance in the Great Lakes.  I have a similar amendment targeted toward small ports in the base bill. But, as the gentleman mentioned, what this points to is the fact that the Corps is stretched too thin. They have a $2.5 million backlog on operations and maintenance, yet there is $9.8 billion in the nonexistent harbor maintenance trust fund. That is, there is $9.8 billion in taxes that has been paid by shippers and passed on to consumers that hasn't been spent on harbor maintenance.  Were we to create a harbor maintenance trust fund next year and, say, it was to be fully obligated, we would have an additional $500 million in current revenues to invest in operations and maintenance, let alone the $9.8 billion that harbor maintenance and construction is owed from past collections.  So I think this is an excellent amendment. I recommend it to my colleagues. The Great Lakes need this sort of attention, but we have got to get to the underlying problem which is insufficient funds.  I thank the gentleman for his support also on that issue.  I urge a positive vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
