 President, moving on to the business before the Senate today, last week the President vetoed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. At noon today, the Senate will vote on whether to override his veto of that legislation. After this vote, Members should be prepared for votes on the continuing resolution.  Our colleagues in the House made good progress last night on a way forward to help the people of Flint in the Water Resources Development Act, or WRDA, which, as we have said, is the proper vehicle. The Senate already voted overwhelmingly--95 to 3--to pass assistance to Flint families as part of the WRDA bill, and both Chairman Inhofe and I have pledged to continue to pursue resources for Flint once WRDA goes to conference.  As a result, we are hopeful that we will soon reach an agreement with our Democratic colleagues to move forward on the clean CR-Zika package today. It includes important resources to support our veterans, to combat the Zika virus and heroin and prescription opioid crisis, and to serve as a significant downpayment for flood relief. It also funds all current government operations through December 9 at last year's enacted levels. Let's keep working together to pass it.                          ____________________
