It is our hope and expectation that it be considered as if included in the fiscal year 2003 Foreign Operations report, as originally printed in the Record last week.                               Exhibit 1                  Democracy Oversight and Coordination       The Committee strongly supports programs and activities      that advance democracy and freedom abroad, and has included      funding in this Act for specific democracy programs it      believes are important to United States security interests.      The Committee believes that democracy promotion abroad can be      an effective bulwark against terrorism, if properly      established and implemented.       However, the Committee remains concerned with the      inconsistent application of democracy programs by State and      USAID, and the apparent lack of coordination of these      programs within, and between, the agencies. For example,      while the Committee applauds State's comprehensive review of      Middle East democracy programs, it is perplexed by its lack      of leadership and support for the advancement of democracy in      Burma.       In order to address these concerns, the Committee      recommends that State and USAID jointly conduct a      comprehensive review of democracy programs, and consider      centralizing oversight and coordination within the Bureau of      Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The Committee will review      the progress made in this endeavor as it considers action on      the fiscal year 2004 foreign operations appropriations bill.                          ____________________
