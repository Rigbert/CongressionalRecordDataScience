 President, I want to thank all of the people who helped get this bill passed.  Senator Hatch, Senator Sessions, Senator Torricelli, and Senator Biden have all been very helpful. I thank them publicly for their hard work. I even want to thank Senator Leahy. I also want to thank the staff who have been helpful: Makan Delrahim and Renee Augustine of Senator Hatch's staff; Ed Haden and Brad Harris of Senator Session's staff; Jennifer Leach of Senator torricelli's staff; Jim Greene of Senator Biden's staff; Kolan Davis and John McMickle of my staff. I also want to thank Ed Pagan and Bruce Cohen of Senator Leahy's staff.  I want to emphasize the great amount of work and expertise toward this successful effort of my Counsel, John McMickle. Without his hard work the bill would not have been the good product and compromise it is.
