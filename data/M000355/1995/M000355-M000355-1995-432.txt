 250. A bill to amend chapter 41 of title 28, United States Code, to provide for an analysis of certain bills and resolutions pending before the Congress by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.              the litigation impact statements act of 1995 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill that joins the effort to improve our legal system with the goal of eliminating unfunded Federal mandates.  Too often, Mr. President, Congress passes a bill without regard as to its impact on the court system. How many new cases will the law generate? Will they be Federal court cases or State court cases? How much will it cost government to enforce the new law through the legal system? How much liability will government, as well as the private sector, incur as a result of the new law?  These questions are rarely asked by Congress before a bill becomes law. The bill I am introducing will change all of that. It requires the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to provide a litigation impact statement for all bills reported from committees--except private relief bills and appropriation bills.  The A.O. is equipped to perform this task; in fact, the staff already does provide a judicial impact statement for certain bills. They did it for the Violence Against Women's Act, and they did for a bill I introduced in the 102d Congress, the Pornography Victims' Compensation Act.  In 1994, more than 281,000 new cases were filed in the Federal courts, with an increase in the civil filings of 3 percent over last year--Interestingly, the criminal filings have gone down.  In 4 of the last 5 years, filings in the Federal courts have increased. This increase in court filings occurs at the State level, where hundreds of thousands of cases are also filed. Too many of these cases are a direct result of Federal legislation enacted without a thought as to the effect on the courts. My bill will give Congress the opportunity to consider, for every bill, what burdens it will create for the courts, as well as the financial impact for potential liability the new law will have on governmental and private entities. Cities and towns are spending more and more of their budgets on liability insurance, and part of the blame for that rests with Congress for the new laws creating runaway liability.  Will a litigation impact statement slow Congress down? I certainly hope so. It would be just fine with the American people, if Congress imposed fewer burdens on them. After all, they delivered a loud message last November. They said our government does not work properly; it's too big, too expensive and inefficient. So, before Congress goes off passing laws which will create more lawsuits, let's get Congress educated about the impact any new laws will have on our court system.  Congress already gets an assessment of the budget impact for any new legislation. Let's also have a litigation impact statement. It is a very good beginning on the road to reforming the legal system.  And on reforming the legal system, I will have more to say in the coming days. The time is right to undertake comprehensive reform of our legal system. I know it will be a top priority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I look forward to working with that committee on this issue.                                 ______      By Mr. McCAIN:  S. 251. A bill to make provisions of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 applicable to Cambodia; to the Committee on Finance.          most-favored-nation status for cambodia legislation Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last year, I introduced legislation to clear up an anomaly in United States law that prohibits the President from granting Cambodia most-favored-nation status [MFN]. Despite my efforts, Cambodia is without MFN and the President is still without the statutory power to grant it. There were many more important issues for Congress to address in 1994. But MFN is very important to Cambodia. And it should be important to all of us interested in a stable and prosperous Southeast Asia. Accordingly, today, I am reintroducing legislation to grant MFN to Cambodia.  Areas of Indochina under Communist control, including significant portions of Cambodia, were denied MFN under the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 and the 1974 Trade Act. Cambodia as a whole was denied MFN in 1975 by Executive action and its new trading status was confirmed by Congress in the 1988 Trade Act.  The 1974 Trade Act provided a process for restoring MFN to those nations then denied it. However, only a portion of Cambodia was denied MFN at the time the 1974 act was signed into law. There is no clear legal authority for restoring MFN to the entire nation under the processes established by the 1974 Trade Act. It cannot be restored by reversing the action taken in 1975 through an Executive order because Cambodia's non-MFN trading status was made law in the 1988 Trade Act. In short, the President wants to grant MFN to Cambodia, but lacks the authority to do so.  The legislation I am introducing would give the President the authority to grant Cambodia MFN status by bringing the entire country under the restoration procedure of the 1974 Trade Act. Under these procedures, Cambodia will have to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, reach a bilateral agreement with the United States, and have its status approved by the Congress. The President may also waive the requirements of Jackson-Vanik, which has for political reasons come to mean a policy decision far beyond the original concern for emigration, and immediately upon this legislation becoming law, extend MFN to Cambodia. Cambodia would be eligible to receive MFN by virtually the same process [[Page S1235]] that all other non-MFN countries, except the Baltics, have received it since the signing of the 1974 Trade Act.  I want to emphasize that if this bill becomes law, the President will retain his prerogatives to respond to developments in Cambodia.  Despite some disturbing developments in Cambodia since I introduced this legislation for the first time last May, I remain hopeful for the future of Cambodia. Cambodia's democracy is a very fragile and incomplete one, but it is a democracy. It needs careful attention to fully develop and sustain the rights of the Cambodian people. Promoting economic development through open markets would offer considerable support for Cambodian democracy and demonstrate American concern for its future. I encourage my colleagues to act on legislation to grant MFN to Cambodia at the earliest possible opportunity.                                 ______      By
