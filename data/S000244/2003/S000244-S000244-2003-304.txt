Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, I am getting a little sick of hearing that this is an assault on the first amendment. We are using constitutional processes to overturn a Supreme Court decision that made no sense.  Now, last year a lot of my colleagues, not me, voted for a campaign finance reform bill that significantly restricted people's rights to express themselves on political issues. And that was emaciated by a lower Federal court, and it probably will be declared unconstitutional as well by the Supreme Court. So let us be consistent, the first amendment is not absolute.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).
