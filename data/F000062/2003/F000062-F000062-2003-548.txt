 President, I rise today to offer the Intelligence Community Leadership Act of 2003. This legislation creates the position of Director of National Intelligence to provide budget and statutory authority over coordinating our intelligence efforts. This will help assure that the sort of communication problems that prevented the various elements of our intelligence community from working together effectively before September 11 never happens again.  Today there are 14 different agencies and departments which make up the Intelligence Community: the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, Army Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence, Marine Corps Intelligence, intelligence elements of the Departments of State, Treasury, Energy, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Coast Guard. Together they make up a huge network, with thousands of employees and a significant, secret, budget.  Interestingly, there is no real head of this sprawling Community. In law the Director of Central Intelligence leads both the CIA and the Intelligence Community, but in practice he is unable to exercise meaningful control and leadership. The Community is plagued by acute turf battles, incompatible information systems and uncoordinated operations. The present structure makes coordination and movement of personnel within the Intelligence Community more difficult than it should be.  Last Spring I offered legislation to address this problem, S. 2645, which created the position of Director of National Intelligence.  Since then the Joint Inquiry of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees completed its investigations into the Intelligence Community role in the attacks of September 11.  The Joint Inquiries' major recommendation was the creation of a ``Director of National Intelligence'', DNI, with real authority to run the Intelligence Community, separate from the head of the CIA, and thus free from having to run both the Community and one of its major constituent agencies.  Working with those recommendations, I have updated the bill I introduced last year to reflect the Joint Inquiries' findings. The changes include adding specific language to ensure that the new Director of National Intelligence has meaningful and effective budget and personnel authority.  Specifically this legislation would create the new position of Director of National Intelligence who would head the intelligence community, serving at the pleasure of the President, with the proper and necessary authority to coordinate activities, direct priorities, and develop and execute the budget for our nation's national intelligence community.  The DNI would be responsible for all of the functions now performed by the Director of Central Intelligence in his role as head of the intelligence community, while a separate individual would be Director of the CIA.  Nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the DNI would be empowered to create and execute the national intelligence budget in conjunction with the various intelligence agencies within our government.  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, DCIA, freed from the double burden as head of the intelligence community, would then be able to concentrate on the critical missions of the CIA alone: Assure the collection of intelligence from human sources, and that intelligence is properly correlated, evaluated, and disseminated throughout the intelligence community and to decision makers.  I recognize that this bill will certainly not solve every problem within the intelligence community, but I believe it is an important, perhaps critical, first step. My hope is that introduction of this bill will move the much-needed debate on Intelligence Community reform forward.                                 ______                                       By Mr. DeWINE:  S. 191. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide adequate coverage for immunosuppressive drugs furnished to beneficiaries under the medicare program that have received a kidney transplant, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin, in introducing a bill to help organ transplant patients maintain access to the life-saving drugs necessary to prevent their immune systems from rejecting their new organs.  Tragically, today over 86,000 Americans are waiting for a donor organ. Those individuals who are blessed to receive an organ transplant must take immunosuppressive drugs every day for the life of their transplant. Failure to take these drugs significantly increases the risk that the transplanted organ will be rejected.  We need this bill, because Federal law is compromising the success of organ transplants. Let me explain. Right now, current Medicare policy denies certain transplant patients coverage for the drugs needed to prevent rejection. Medicare does not pay for anti-rejection drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, who received their transplants prior to becoming a Medicare beneficiary. So, for instance, if a person received a transplant at age 64 through his or her health insurance plan, when that person retires and relies on Medicare for health care coverage, he or she would no longer have immunosuppressive drug coverage.  Medicare only pays for anti-rejection drugs for transplants performed in a Medicare-approved transplant facility. However, many beneficiaries are completely unaware of this fact and how it can jeopardize their future coverage of immunosuppressive drugs. To receive an organ transplant, a person must be very ill and many are far too ill at the time of transplantation to be researching the intricate nuances of Medicare coverage policy.  End Stage Renal Disease, ESRD, patients qualify for Medicare on the basis of needing dialysis. If End Stage Renal Disease patients receive a kidney transplant, they qualify for Medicare coverage for three years after the transplant. After the three years are up, they lose not only their general Medicare coverage, but also their coverage for immunosuppressive drugs.  The amendment that Senator Durbin and I are introducing today would remove the Medicare limitations and make clear that all Medicare beneficiaries including End Stage Renal Disease patients who have had a transplant and need immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of their transplant, will be covered as long as such anti-rejection drugs are needed.  In the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act, Congress eliminated the 36-month time limitation for transplant recipients who both receive a Medicare eligible transplant and are eligible for Medicare based on age or disability. Our bill would provide the same indefinite coverage to kidney transplant recipients who are not Medicare-aged or Medicare-disabled.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and help those who receive Medicare-eligible transplants to gain access to the immunosuppressive drugs they need to live healthy, productive lives.                                 ______                                       By
