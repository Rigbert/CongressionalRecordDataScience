Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to remind my colleagues that this bill has been a very long process with many, many meetings. We reached a very balanced bill supported by 4,000, and every governing organization in this Nation.  I can agree about what has been said about this amendment, but the reality is this amendment should not be adopted.  I got interested about the gentleman from Georgia talking about how much we own. Last year he asked us to buy Cumberland Island. If that is the case,that he does not believe in Federal ownership of land, and I have not mentioned anybody's name so I will not yield at this time, if anybody would like to have purchased the land, then maybe we ought to take and have that land sold back to the private sector. The private sector would be the best way, because the Federal government should not have any more land.
