Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I regret that Representative DeSaulnier couldn't be here today because he partnered with Representative Stauber on this legislation. He has been very concerned and has been raising this issue with me repeatedly because of the incident at San Francisco and general concerns he had about runway intrusions and other problems. So he is on an airplane, as we speak, flying here, hopefully, safely. That is unfortunate since he won't be here to actually get credit on the floor, but I want to extend that to him.  I want to thank Ranking Member Graves for his support on this and the other Ranking Member Graves for his support on this and Representative Larsen who is probably also on an airplane somewhere. It is rare that I would be here on a Monday, but the harbor maintenance bill attracted me to be here.  Mr. Speaker, I urge that this be adopted, and I urge a ``yes'' vote. This is one more little bit of an addition, or a major addition, to our safety culture in aviation in this country with the largest and most complex airspace in the world, and this is a necessary step to make it safer.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
