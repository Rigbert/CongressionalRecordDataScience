President. I rise today to talk about a unique education program nestled in the hills of Burlington, VT. Champlain College is one of the many higher education institutions in my home State and it has distinguished itself as a leader in career-oriented education. Under the leadership of President Roger Perry, Champlain College provides its students with innovative distance learning and workforce development programs to build the skills of Vermonters. While I have long known of the quality offerings of Champlain College, I was very pleased to see a story in the Los Angeles Times recently about one program in particular that serves single parents on welfare who want to earn a college degree.  With the recent reform by the Federal Government of our Nation's welfare system, many individuals are seeking training that can lead to better jobs and ultimately to increased wages. In response to this growing need, an 11-year-old program at Champlain College aimed at moving single parents off welfare is receiving attention nationwide. The impressive statistics from this public-private partnership clearly indicate its success--less than 10 percent of those participating in the program drop out; most in the program earn a 2-year associate degree; and, many even go on to receive a 4-year bachelor's degree. According to President Roger Perry, more than 90 percent of the single parents who graduate from this program have not returned to the welfare program. This program is helping single parents break the welfare cycle and show their children the importance of getting a college degree as a step toward supporting themselves and their family. Its success also reinforces Champlain College's role in Vermont as a leader in career-oriented education. I commend President Roger Perry, the faculty and staff, and especially the students for continuing to make Champlain College a model for quality higher education.  I ask unanimous consent that the following article from the May 13, 2001 issue of the Los Angeles Times be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 13, 2001]                         (By Elizabeth Mehren)Vt. College singles Out Parents Education: Unique Curriculum That Helps       Welfare Mothers Get Job Training Has Become a National Model       BURLINGTON, Vt.--What galls Dulcie Christian is when her      Champlain College classmates say they didn't get their papers      done because they were out drinking all night.       ``I think, well, I was up all night with two sick kids and      I did get mine done,'' Christian said. ``Plus, I did the      laundry.''       As a participant in an unusual state-supported college      program geared to move single parents off welfare, Christian,      33, is well aware of how her life diverges from the      conventional undergraduate path. There's no room for wild      parties. And instead of spring breaks in Jamaica, Christian      uses time off to double up on hours working at the local      Social Security office. Her old Subaru just better hold      itself together, because there's no deep-pockets daddy to      bail her out. More than once, in a pinch, Christian has      brought Justin, 9, or Shelby, 5, to class with her.                        Fewer Than 10% Drop Out       For Christian and the 60 or so other single parents      enrolled at Champlain this semester, the challenges are      immense. And yet, said program director Carol Moran-Brown,      ``The retention rate for these single parents is higher than      the school average. You wouldn't believe the motivation.''       With federal welfare reform providing an impetus for      recipients to train for better jobs, the 11-year-old program      at this private college has emerged as a national model.       Typically, college officials say, fewer than 10% of these      students drop out; most in the program earn a two-year      associate of arts degree and many go on for a four-year      bachelor's degree. More than 90% of the single-parent      graduates have not returned to welfare rolls, said Champlain      College President Roger H. Perry.       Those are strong indicators, Perry said, that the program      is achieving its goal of helping to shatter the cycle of      single parents living off government assistance.       State money pays the salaries of Champlain's two full-time      social workers devoted to single-parent students--almost      always women, through the occasional single dad enrolls.      State subsidies also fund the day care that enables these      parents to take classes at the 1,400-student campus. The      program is labor intensive, with workshops and weekly social      hours at which single parents trade everything from outgrown      snowsuites to names of kid-friendly professors.       For a group often made up of first-generation college      students, social workers focus on time and stress management,      as well as study skills. The students and social workers      often meet daily, discussing what's going on      academically--and also addressing such outside issues as      abusive boyfriends, nasty landlords and sick babies.      Budgets are a big topic, as many single parents struggle      to get by on welfare payments while attending the four-     year college. When it all becomes too much, ``that's when      I show up at their door, saying, `I'm concerned about you,      what's going on? Can I lend a hand?' '' social worker      Felicia Messuri said.       Champlain is a career-oriented school where most students      easily step into jobs upon graduation. But Moran-Brown said      the 97% job placement rate in the single-parent program      stands out. A state study is underway to determine how well      the single-parent graduates do over time--and how their      experience compares to single parents who do not finish      college.       Last year, Champlain received $96,000 in state money to run      the program. An experimental seven-year federal waiver      allowing Vermont to use special support funds for the single-     parent college program expires in June. Eager to continue the      program, the state Legislature passed a measure allowing the      state's social welfare agency--Prevention, Assistance,      Training and Health Access--to allocate discretionary funds      for single parents in college.       At Champlain, single-parent students pay full $10,000-a-     year tuition. But they are eligible for grants and loans.      Under state rules, their welfare checks are not in jeopardy      if they also hold down jobs.       When state supplements for transportation, caseworker      salaries and incidentals are factored in, supporting each      single-parent college student costs about $500 per year above      the normal welfare allotment, Moran-Brown said. ``It's      cheap,'' she said.                 parents and kids do homework together       In Vermont, an unemployed single parent with one child      usually receives about $557 each month, she said.       Noting that the endeavor benefits the state and students      alike, PATH's deputy commissioner, Sandy Dooley, said her      office views the single-parent college program as ``a work-     force development strategy'' that could easily be replicated      elsewhere.       For 23-year-old Cindy Sarault, it was dissatisfaction with      a $5.65-an-hour job as a grocery clerk that pushed her to      study accounting at Champlain. Now she and her 5-year-old      daughter, Brooke, often do homework together.       Like Sarault, classmate Heidi McMann, 21, got pregnant as a      high school senior. After two years as a low-wage office      assistant, McMann signed on at Champlain to study computer      networking.       ``Partly it was about getting somewhere in life, so I could      get a decent job,'' she said. ``But also I wanted Taylor, my      daughter, to learn from me, not just see me working in dead-     end, low-wage positions forever.''       Only a few miles from campus, in the small apartment she      shares with her two children, Christian agreed that a big      payoff is ``setting an example of how important school is.''       As the first member of her family to graduate from high      school, Christian said it never crossed her mind to continue      her own education. ``I thought college was for people who can      write papers,'' she said.       Then someone mentioned the single-parents program at      Champlain. She tried a class and liked it so much she quit      her clerical job. To the horror of her working-class parents,      she went on welfare and sought out state child-care      subsidies.       Soon Christian was set on a career in social work, and      earning a 3.97 grade point average. Graduation is a year      away, and Christian has a job lined up at the Social Security      Administration. She said that after juggling school, a job      and two kids, she is unfazed by the prospect of paying off      college debt of at least $25,000.       For her, the biggest obstacle has been ``making it through      the tough times, when     the money is short and your temper is short because you're      worrying about the money, and the kids have problems at      school and you have problems at school. You just want to      crawl off somewhere. But you can't.''                 ``I do think I'm breaking the cycle''       At school, Christian said, she talks about her kids      constantly. At home, she talks about school. Better yet, her      kids see her hunkering down with a book, and it makes them      want to do the same. When they complain that they don't like      a teacher, Christian says, guess what, she doesn't like all      her professors either. Then they all do their homework      together.       ``So I do think I'm breaking the cycle,'' Christian said.      ``It feels great.''                          ____________________
