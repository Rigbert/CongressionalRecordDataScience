SKELTON. I think coercion is certainly absolutely wrong. I would say to the gentleman that we would do everything we could to correct the mistake. I am certainly positive that the military would stand behind a mistake that they made.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman, and I hope that we can get this rectified. As I said previously, there are many good parts to this bill. I believe in the all-volunteer military; I believe in the pay and benefits enhancements; and I believe in providing better equipment, which the bill does. I intend to support it.
