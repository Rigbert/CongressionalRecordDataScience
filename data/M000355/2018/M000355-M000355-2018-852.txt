 President, before we wrap up, I would be remiss if I let the day pass without calling our attention to two veteran Senate staff members who are concluding their distinguished service this week.  Patrick Renzi has served the U.S. Senate for 27 years, rising to chief reporter in the Office of Official Reporters of Debates.  Patrick is a native of Silver Spring, MD. His mother Eileen also worked in transcription, including here in the very same office, but, as my colleagues know well, no route to the Senate is a straight line. After completing his studies at the University of Maryland and Strayer College, Patrick moved furniture, tried freelance court reporting, and recorded a brief, forgivable stint working over in the House of Representatives. But by 1991, he had returned to where it all began.  Over the next 27 years, Patrick became a key staff member, updating the technology and team that keep the Office of Official Reporters running smoothly. His staff describe him as a stalwart chief with great respect for the Senate and those with whom he has served.  Mr. President, Scott Sanborn currently serves as the Senate Journal clerk. He arrived in this body back in 1979 as a page for Lowell Weicker, our former colleague from Connecticut.  Scott wound up serving the Secretary's legislative staff as an assistant bill clerk. I am told he impressed so many colleagues so quickly that in short order he was asked to serve as assistant editor, deputy chief reporter, and coordinator of the Congressional Record.  By 2001, Scott had become the 20th Journal clerk of the U.S. Senate. Along the way, he has helped revolutionize the way the Senate records and reviews its transcripts. He found ways to increase efficiency and cost-savings, and he served as a go-to technical liaison, connecting the official reporters with the Members' offices.  These two gentlemen have combined to contribute, literally, decades of service to this body. To see them both embark on well-earned retirements in the same week serves as a useful reminder of just how many incredibly talented men and women there are who may seldom find themselves in the spotlight but who are absolutely essential to the smooth functioning of the Senate in a thousand ways that we all get to take for granted every single day.  We don't say thank you nearly enough around here. I am honored to be able to say it today.  Thank you, Patrick.  Thank you, Scott.  We are sorry to see them go, but I know that Patrick's wife Germaine and their nine children--nine children--and Scott's wife Kim and their two kids must be happy to see what this next chapter has in store.  So we bid them farewell with gratitude for their time here and best wishes for the times ahead.                          ____________________
