The distinguished chairman and myself worked very, very hard on this. We tried to accommodate the concerns and desires of Republicans and Democrats alike in the Appropriations Committee and others who came to us with amendments. Those things that we could not agree on when we did it, we had votes in the committee on them.  We are now, on the 21st of September, 9 days before the end of the fiscal year, on one of the 13 major appropriation bills that have to be passed. Frankly, I would like to see--and I suspect the distinguished chairman agrees with this--I would like to see if sometime by early evening we could just vote and pass all of these; either vote these amendments up or vote them down, and then vote up or vote down on the final bill. And I urge our colleagues to work toward that end.  Frankly, my willingness to accept or accommodate amendments diminishes as the Dracula hour approaches. I yield the floor.
