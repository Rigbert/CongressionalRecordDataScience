Our amendment will provide $4 million through the Health Resources and Services Administration for the awarding of grants to community partnerships in rural areas to purchase automated external defibrillators and to train individuals in basic cardiac life support. These rural partnerships will also be required to evaluate the local community emergency response times to assess whether they meet the standards established by national public health organizations such as the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross. They must also submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require. I would like to ask my colleague from Wisconsin if he would like to add any additional comments.
