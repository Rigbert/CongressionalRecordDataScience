President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes asin morning business. However, I want to say if anyone comes down to speak on the motion to proceed to the highway bill, I will stop at that point so they can be recognized. I will yield to them. However, I want my entire speech to be printed in the Record as if given intact.
