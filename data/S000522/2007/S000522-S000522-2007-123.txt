Mr. Speaker, in light of the Vietnam Human Rights Act of 2007, H.R. 3096, which was debated on the House Floor yesterday, September 17, 2007, and which passed overwhelmingly this afternoon, I would like to include in the record portions of the trial proceedings for Attorney Nguyen Van Dai and Attorney Le Thi Cong Nhan who are referenced in this legislation. Both individuals were ruthlessly seized by the Government of Vietnam on March 6, 2007, in Vietnam's most recent crackdown on democracy and human rights advocates. The accused each received years of imprisonment after being found guilty of ``disseminating propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,'' I urge each and every one of my colleagues to read this chilling account of the Vietnamese justice system.  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam; Independence--Liberty--Happiness                    The People's Court of Hanoi City       Preliminary criminal sentence, No. 153/2007/HSST, May 11,      2007. In the name of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, The      People's Court of Hanoi City. The Preliminary Trial Committee      is composed of:       Presiding Judge: Mr. Nguyen Huu Chinh. People's Jurors: 1.      Mr. Nguyen Thanh Ha, 2. Mrs. Tran Hong Thuy. Court clerk/     recorder: Mrs. Nguyen Thi Huyen, cadre of the People's Court      of Hanoi City, Representative of The Hanoi City People's      Office of Procuracy: 1. Mr. Dinh Trong Nghia, Procurator, 2.      Mr. Dinh Quoc Thai, Procurator.       On May 11, 2007, the following defendants were      preliminarily tried by the People's Court of Hanoi City under      Criminal Docket No. 138/2007/HSST of April 24, 2007:       1. NGUYEN VAN DAI born 1969, in Da Trach, Khoai Chau      District, Hung Yen Province; domiciled at Apartment 302,      House Z8, Back Khoa Communal Building, Bach Khoa Ward, Hai Ba      Trung Precinct, Ha Noi City; occupation at the time of      committing crimes: Head Attorney of the Thien An Law Office;      educational background: Grade 12/12; born of Mr. Nguyen Van      Cap and Mrs. Nguyen Thi Thom; married to Vu Minh Khanh;      arrested and placed under temporary detention since March 6,      2007; is present at the trial.       2. LE THI CONG NHAN: born 1979 in Go Cong Tay, Tien Giang      Province; domiciled at Apartment 48 (currently Apartment      316), House A7, Government Office Employees' Communal      Building, Phuong Mai Ward, Dong Da Precinct, Ha Noi City;      occupation at the time of committing crimes: Staff Attorney      of the Thien An Law Office; educational background: Grade 12/     12; born of Mr. Le Minh Duc and Mrs. Tran Thi Le; arrested      and placed under temporary detention since March 6, 2007; is      present at the trial.       Defendant Nguyen Van Dai's trial attorneys: Mr. Tran Lam,      Hai Phong City Lawyers Bar (in attendance), Mr. Dam Van Hieu,      Attorney, Thong Nhat Law Office, Ha Noi City Lawyers Bar (in      attendance), Defendant Le Thi Cong Nhan's trial attorney, Mr.      Tran Lam, Hai Phong City Lawyers' Bar (in attendance).       BE IT JUDGED THAT: 1. Relative to defendant Nguyen Van Dai.      At both the investigative offices and the trial, defendant      Nguyen Van Dai admitted that he had written a number of      articles, e.g. ``Freedom to Form a [Political] Party'' and      ``Vietnamese People Have the Ability to Build a Multi-Party      System''. The defendants had distributed these articles      through the media of reactionary Vietnamese organizations      overseas, and participated in interviews via the Internet      with overseas anti-socialist elements. The contents of      these articles were meant to smear and degrade the leading      role of the VCP. He maintained that under current      circumstances, because the VCP did not have enough ability      to lead the Revolution Vietnam is in dire need of a change      of the ruling party or to a pluralistic, multi-party      system in order to emerge out of poverty.       As provided for in Article 4 of the SVN's Constitution, the      VCP--the vanguard of the worker class and loyal      representative serving the interests of the worker class and      the working people--is the leading force of the State and      society. That positively affirms that since the VCP is the      only preferred leader of the Vietnam Revolution all other      political parties and their activities are in fact in non-     compliance and illegal. Because of the fact that the      defendant is the one who drafted the ``Bylaws'' of the      Democratic Party and supported the platforms of Hoang Minh      Chinh's Democratic Party, and that he has also written a      number of articles, criticizing the VCP and advocating a      pluralistic and multi-party regime, Dai has obviously      committed a serious violation of the Constitution and laws of      Vietnam.       Based on the admissible evidences and Dai's own admissions      at the trial, from the time when the Thien An Law Office was      founded to his arrest, Dai had never served as a trial lawyer      and acted according to his duties, as specified in his      professional license. Instead, he had made contacts and      exchanged information regarding democracy and human rights      with a number of political opportunists who acted in      opposition to the VCP and against the SRV. The defendant had      joined and enthusiastically supported the platforms of the      so-called Vietnam Progression Party (VPP) and Bloc 8406, a      [political] organization founded illegally by Nguyen Van Ly      in Vietnam. The defendant had conferred and concurred with      Nguyen Van Ly on the platform of the VPP, as well as visited      Ho Chi Minh City to engage a number of Do Nam Hai's      supporters in various efforts to support both Bloc 8406 and      the VPP.       The defendant was also a member of the ``Independent Trade      Union''. He admitted to his contacts with such overseas      individuals as Nguyen Dinh Thang, Vu Quoc Dung, Tran Ngoc      Thanh, etc., which focused on ``democracy and human rights      issues''. However, seized documents and evidences have      attested to the intentions of these exiled Vietnamese who are      fiercely opposed to the State. The defendant's contacts with      these subjects have gone beyond the discussion of democracy      and human rights issues, and they have in fact intended to      form a number of organizations and political parties in      opposition to the VCP and the SRV. According to witness Tran      Van Hoa's statements, on September 2006 defendant Dai asked      the former to come to Hanoi so that they could together make      a trip to China, where they planned to meet with Tran Ngoc      Thanh, an overseas Vietnamese in Poland to discuss the      founding of the ``so-called'' Independent Trade Union.       Having searched the Thien An Law Office headed by Nguyen      Van Dai, and the residence of Nguyen Van Dai, the      investigative authorities seized numerous documents, among      which there were 121 stacks of documents. Some documents      containing contents of extremely reactionary nature are meant      to twist the facts about the VCP, and to smear the honor and      tarnish the reputations of the Party, President Ho Chi Minh      and the top leaderships of the Party and the State, e.g. a      document titled ``The Vietnamese Communist Party is Bad      Karma,'' and ``The Secrets of the New Vietnamese Prime      Minister.'' Another 475-page document, authored by a ``Quoc-     Quoc,'' is full of distortions with regard to the history of      the revolutionary struggle, the policies of the VCP and the      State throughout the different stages of the Revolution, as      well as blemishes and badmouthing against the high-ranking      officials and top cadres of the Party.       The document, titled ``Diary of a Victim of Injustice,''      contains the slants and distortions of facts, and false      allegations that the government and police brutally repressed      legal complainants. In addition, the authorities also      captured many documents written by other anti-State political      opportunists, notably ``Democracy and Human Rights in VN''      and ``Eternal Aspirations,'' authored by Nguyen Thanh Giang.      Scores of other documents and publications circulated by      overseas Vietnamese organizations include the bi-monthly ``Tu      Do Ngon Luan,'' (Freedom of Speech) the ``To Quoc''      (Fatherland) magazine, the ``Tu Do Dan Chu'' (Freedom &      Democracy) newsletter, the Bloc 8406-proclaimed ``The      Declaration of Freedom and Democracy for Vietnam''. Being      very reactionary in content, these documents are full of      distortions of the current realities of Vietnam and      allegations that all the inalienable rights of the Vietnamese      people are being brutally trampled upon and the contentions      that their goal is to struggle for a change of regime in      Vietnam.       At the trial, the defendant admitted to having contacts and      Internet direct-linked interviews with foreign newspapers and      radio stations regarding the issues of democracy and human      rights in Vietnam. However, documented evidences have      revealed that during these contacts and interviews the      defendant always provided untruths and distortions regarding      the democracy and human rights situation in Vietnam, and      provocative badmouthing against the socialist regime and the      VCP, and he called for a change of regime as well. At the      same time, he had received other documents calling for a      boycott of the 2007 National Assembly Election. Another      document ``Wear White on the 1st and 15th of the Month in      Support of Democracy,'' a campaign document published by Bloc      8406 proclaiming 10 conditions for a multi-party National      Assembly election. Another Bloc 8406 document initiated the      launching of a boycott of the 2007 One-Party National      Assembly Election.       Nguyen Van Dai held classes regularly at the Thien An law      office to provide propaganda on the subject of Democracy,      Human Dignity and Human Rights. Witnesses Dong Thi Giang,      Khong Van Thanh, Nguyen Ba Truc, and Giap Van Hieu that Dai      had invited to participate in the classes, all affirmed that      during those class lectures both Dai and Nhan had zealously      badmouthed the political and social state of the nation, the      Government of the SRV. Dai had alleged that the SRV does not      respect human rights and has employed torture and violence      against innocent citizens. The defendant, while maintaining      that the ``Party Nominates, Citizen Elects'' election trick      is undemocratic, called for a change of the socialist regime      that would deny the VCP its monopoly of power in order to      achieve social equality.       The defendant's criminal conduct has constituted the crime      of ``disseminating propaganda against the Socialist Republic      of Vietnam,'' as stipulated in Article 88 of the Criminal      Code and determined in the indictment of the Hanoi City      People's Office of Procuracy. :       2. Relative to defendant Le Thi Cong Nhan. At the      investigative offices and at the trial, the defendant      admitted that she was a member of the Vietnam Progression      Party (VPP) and that of Bloc 8406 (founded by Nguyen Van Ly).      Nhan participated as the VPP spokesperson. She indicated that      she had joined the party voluntarily. The Trial Committee is      of the opinion that the purpose of this organization is to      act against the VCP and the SRV in order to drastically      change the political regime of Vietnam. Her organization      appealed for a pluralistic, multi-party system and incited      the people to ``Wear White'' as a demonstration of support      for democracy. As such, the defendant's participation and      support of the VPP's platform is a violation of State laws.       The defendant herself wrote the article, ``The Truth about      the Repeal of Decree 31/CP of April 14, 1997''. The content      of her article indicates that the repeal of this decree was      phony with the intent to misdirect public opinion. In her      interviews, the defendant also commented on Directive 37      issued by the Prime Minister that this directive is      undemocratic as it prohibits freedom of the press. All her      articles contain fabrications, defamations, ridicules, and      attacks on the regime. The defendant maintained that the      Vietnamese political structure is dictatorial, infantile,      and uncivilized. Nhan's articles and documents were      distributed in the form of direct answers to foreign radio      networks such as BBC, RFA (Radio Free Asia), or Internet-     linked interviews with overseas Vietnamese exiles.       In a house search, the investigative authorities have      seized many stacks of documents which had been circulated by      both domestic and overseas political opportunists. These      documents contain bad-intent distortions of the facts and      protests against the current directions and policies of the      Party and the State. They include: appeals to ``boycott the      National Assembly Election of 2007; demands for a      pluralistic, multi-party system, etc.; instructions for the      populace to ``Wear White'' on the first and 15th day of the      month to support democracy in Vietnam; ``Let's Paint a      Portrait of a Free and Democratic Vietnam''; ``How to Fight      Fear'' (written by Nguyen Van Ly); ``The Declaration of      Democracy for Vietnam 2006''; ``The Preliminary Platform of      the Vietnam Progression Party''; ``The Founding of an      Alliance of National Forces for Freedom, Democracy and Human      Rights''; ``Bloc 8406 To Announce 10 Conditions for a Multi-     Party National Assembly Election and How To Boycott This      Election''; ``Bloc 8406 initiating a Campaign to Reject the      Single-Party National Assembly Election of 2007''.       The defendant has also provided her students with      propaganda in her so-called ``Democracy'' course. With great      discontent, she has criticized and smeared our regime,      falsified the history of the People's VCP-led revolutionary      struggle, as well as called for the replacement of the      current VCP by another political party or a pluralistic,      multi-party system.       The defendant's criminal conduct has constituted the crime      of ``disseminating propaganda against the Socialist Republic      of Vietnam,'' as stipulated by Article 88 of the Criminal      Code and charged with in the indictment of the Hanoi City      People's Office of Procuracy.       The crimes both defendants have committed are very severe.      They have taken advantage of their democratic rights and      freedom to produce, possess, and distribute various documents      meant to libel the People's Government and oppose the SRV.      Their conduct is deemed to be dangerous to society. It has      generated bad opinion both in and outside of the country, and      has directly damaged our national security interests, as well      as the benefits and achievements that the Vietnamese people      have made throughout our long struggle for building and      safeguarding the nation. Their conduct has resulted in the      tarnished reputations of the VCP, the socialist regime, and      our leaders among the populace. They, being Vietnamese      citizens, shall have the absolute obligations to abide by the      laws of Vietnam. Consequently, they are to be severely      punished, once found to be in violation, as provided for by      the laws of Vietnam.       Although still at young age and having yet made      contributions to the country, both defendants Nguyen Van Dai      and Le Thi Cong Nhan have committed serious crimes to the      detriment of our national interests and security. They need      to be severely punished before the court of law in order to      appreciate fully the effects of reform, education, and      deterrence. In this case, defendant Nguyen Van Dai has been      found to have actively engaged in carrying out his crimes      although his admissions were not truly sincere, Dai is to      deserve a heavier punishment. Defendant Le Thi Cong Nhan has      also actively committed her crimes. As she was found not to      be fully cooperative in her admission at the investigative      offices and at the trial, she is to be punished according to      the severity of her crimes.       House arrest shall be an additional requirement to their      main punishments, as stipulated by Article 92 of the Criminal      Code.       Evidential material: The investigative authorities have      seized numerous evidences from the Thien An Law Office, as      well as the residences of defendants Nguyen Van Dai and Le      Thi Cong Nhan. It is determined that these evidences were      used as a means to have committed their crimes, and therefore      shall be confiscated and kept in State's depositories. Other      captured evidences, of insignificant values, shall be      destroyed.       For the above-mentioned reasons, BE IT DECIDED THAT:      Verdict: Defendants Nguyen Van Dai and Le Thi Cong Nhan are      guilty of ``disseminating propaganda against the Socialist      Republic of Vietnam''.       Penalty: Nguyen Van Dai is sentenced to 5 (five) years of      imprisonment, effective as of his temporary detention which      began on March 6, 2007.       Penalty: Le Thi Cong Nhan is sentenced to 4 (four) years of      imprisonment, effective as of her temporary detention which      began on March 6, 2007.       Additional penalty: Defendant Nguyen Van Dai is sentenced      to 4 (four) years of house arrest upon completion of his      imprisonment term. Defendant Le Thi Cong Nhan is sentenced to      3 (three) years of house arrest upon completion of her      imprisonment term.

These evidential materials are currently stored at the      Hanoi Evidence Depository Locker (Executed per the receipt of      April 23, 2007).       Defendants Nguyen Van Dai and Le Thi Cong Nhan are to be      fined a court fee of 50.000 dongs each and are entitled to      filing appeals within 15 days of the pronouncement of their      preliminary sentences.       For the Preliminary Trial Committee, Nguyen Huu Chinh,      Presiding Judge.                          ____________________
