President, I listened to this whole debate on term limits with some interest. I am well aware of the fact that the Republican leadership has tried to set this up so that nobody can introduce any amendments. The Republican leadership has filed for cloture within 5 minutes of beginning proceedings and is apparently going to do everything possible to block anybody from raising questions.  I succeeded a Republican Senator. Everybody who has ever been elected from Vermont has succeeded a Republican Senator because I am the only Democrat our State has ever elected. We are the only State in the Union that has elected only one, and, for better or worse, that is me. My predecessor, a distinguished Republican, was elected the year I was born and served until I arrived here. This Republican Senator was considered the dean of the Senate. The fact that he served from the year I was born until I came here probably gives some sense of term limits in our State.  Frankly, I have a great deal of respect for our distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole. On term limits, I would have only gotten a chance to serve with him for one term, way back in the 1970's. Then he would have been gone. The distinguished President pro tempore, Senator Thurmond, who held elective office long before I was born, I would not have gotten a chance to serve with him at all. In fact, virtually the whole Republican leadership would have been long gone by now.  What I worry about when the amendment is written so as not to apply to current Members is that this is a little bit of a shell game on the American public. It is a bit of a con. It was probably not meant that way, but it amounts to this: You could have a Senator who has been here for, say, three or four terms and vote for term limits. They are up for election this year, knowing that a constitutional amendment cannot be ratified in time this year. That same three- or four-term Senator if reelected this year, could proceed to serve that 6-year term and two additional 6-year terms, 18 more years, after voting to impose a 12-year limit on all those who are first elected to the Senate after the amendment is ratified. Or somebody who had served five terms, say, a Senator who has been here for 30 years, could vote for term limits and, having served 30 years, serve 18 more. Then they would say, ``I am for term limits.'' Now, be honest. Vote for it or do not vote for it. Everybody has to make a determination.  There are, of course, term limits. Every 2 years in the House of Representatives there is a term limit. It is called an election. In my State, every 2 years there is a term limit for Governor, and virtually every other office has a term limits. It is called an election. Every 6 years is a term limit for Members of the Senate. It is called an election.  However, do not call this proposed constitutional amendment one of term limits when it is set up in such a way that most of the Senators in this place could vote for it, and no matter how many terms they had already served, could count on serving for 12 to 18 more years. You have Senators who served here before people were born, who could be serving here long after they are retired under these so-called term limits. Now, that is not term limits.  Make sure that the American public understands, under this proposal, any Senator, no matter how long he or she has been here, could vote for this, see it go into the Constitution and still be in office for another 12 to 18 years, even if they have already been here for 20 years, 30 years or whatever else it might be.  I hope, Mr. President, that even though the Republican leadership--all of whom have served here for many more than two terms--have done their best to block any chance for my amendment to come up, I hope they would change their mind and realize that blocking a vote on it might appear a tad hypocritical to those people who live in the real world. Those are the people who do not rely on their elective office, who do not, as the distinguished Senator from Missouri said, live inthink tanks, but the men and women of the streets of Vermont, Missouri, or anywhere else. Those people may see a bit of hypocrisy if they see somebody who has been here for 24 or 30 years, whatever, vote for a proposal which would still allow them to serve for another 12 to 18 years, and call it term limits.  I think the American public will see through that hypocrisy, especially when the American public knows that they can set term limits anytime they want, every single election. That is something to keep in mind.  Some say we do not have it in our power to pass term limits. We have it in our power. Every one of us has to file petitions or take steps in our States to qualify for election. Any one of us can say, ``I am setting term limits. I am leaving at the end of this term.'' No constitutional amendment is needed to that. It is term limits.  I wonder how many Senators are here who are now in their fourth, fifth, or sixth term, who every single time they run say, ``We need term limits, we need term limits, and I will keep on saying it for the next 20 years, we need term limits.'' They could limit it simply by leaving.  Do not call this amendment term limits, where a Senator in his third, fourth, fifth or sixth term could vote for this and still run for three more terms. That is not term limits. That is a bumper-sticker slogan. That is a political fundraising device. That is rhetoric for the campaign trail. But that is not term limits.  Term limits are imposed when Senators, and we have had a number on both sides of the aisle, who say, ``I came here to serve two terms, or one term, or three terms,'' and then leave when they say they would. We have had many, many Senators on both sides of the aisle who were facing an easy reelection, but said, ``This is the time to go. I leave.''  Ultimately, in my State, where my Republican predecessor was elected the year I was born and served until I arrived, enjoying greater popularity every year, this is reflective of what happened. I think every so often we have to make it clear what is really happening here. I would vote to bring this amendment up for a vote. I think we should. But we should bring up each aspect of it and not do as the Republican leadership has: Stack the deck and do everything possible to block the chance that somebody might bring up an amendment that would raise a real question. Let us test whether those who claim they are for term limits would be for such limits being applied to them. Let them vote on something that might limit them at the end of this term, not at the end of this term plus another 18 years.  What this is, this amendment is an incumbent's protection limit bill, not real term limits. This is saying that somebody elected in the future will have term limits, but those of us who are already here after several terms, we are protecting ourselves for another 18 years. If you are brandnew out there, a few years from now, we will term limits for you, but, boy, we are sure protecting us. Because if we have been in the Senate for 24 years or 30 years or 36 years, we are going to make sure we can stay around for another 18 years. We have protected ourselves in this.  No one who votes for term limits should stand up and say, ``See how brave I am.'' Go back to the American public and say, ``We are so brave, we limited somebody else to two terms, but for those still there, we have another three terms.''  We will limit the men and women out there who have not yet run to two terms, but we will protect every single term we have already served and give ourselves another two to three terms. That is not term limits, that is campaign fodder, that is a bumper sticker, that is sloganeering rhetoric, but it is not term limitation at all.                          ____________________
