 President, I rise to bring to the attention of my colleagues an issue which I believe is of importance in the FY 2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill: U.S. assistance to Egypt. Before I begin, however, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee for their expert and sound guidance on this bill. They deserve our commendation for working with such tight 302(b) allocations.  Egypt is a country that many in the Senate hold in high regard. Egypt is a dependable and steady ally in the Middle East. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of peace between Israel and Egypt, a peace which has served and continues to serve as a benchmark of the end of hostilities between Arabs and Israelis. Since peace between Egypt and Israel was established in 1979, Congress has recognized that in America's relations with these two allies that fair treatment of both Israel and Egypt in the provision of foreign assistance is a key feature in preserving peace and stability in the region.  The administration requested as part of its FY 2000 budget that a portion of Egypt's military assistance held in reserve to pay for the potential termination of contracts accrue interest. This proposal, known as an interest bearing account (IBA), would allow interest to accrue on approximately $470 million in the termination liability account for Egypt. Israel's military assistance has been treated in this way for some time, treatment that I and many others here support. The net impact of granting Egypt this treatment would be about $20 million in interest to Egypt, without any additional cost or outlay by the U.S. taxpayer.  Like many of my colleagues, I support the administration's request for an IBA for Egypt, and I feel very strongly that Egypt should have thesame terms as Israel. The Department of State has made a commitment to Egypt on this issue, and I think it is important that this commitment be kept.  Despite our support for an IBA, the Congressional Budget Office has told us that the IBA would be scored as a $470 million outlay--despite the fact that it actually costs nothing--and would thus break the Senate's tight outlay ceiling for this bill. Although support for an IBA for Egypt is strong--I am confident that on the merits an Amendment proposing an IBA would have the support of the vast majority of my colleagues--the Senate is confined at this time in our actions by budgetary pressures.  I am hopeful that we might still be able to resolve this scoring issue and perhaps address the question of an IBA for Egypt in Conference.  Again, I thank the subcommittee chairman and ranking member for their work on this bill. I look forward to continuing to work with them on this issue.  bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement and the state                                department
