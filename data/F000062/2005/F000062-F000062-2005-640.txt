 President, what I would like to do is say a few words on behalf of this amendment which is submitted on behalf of both Senator Bingaman, who will be on the floor shortly to speak on it, and myself.  As the legislation has been debated, Senator Bingaman has raised, I think, a reasonable, valid, and a real concern about whether certain national class action cases may be caught in a catch-22 when they were prohibited from having their cases heard either in State or Federal court, leaving the case to reside in oblivion.  This problem was best described by the Bruce Bromley Harvard Law Professor Arthur Miller in a letter he sent to Senator Bingaman. It is a lengthy letter, but I will read one part:       Under current doctrines, federal courts hearing state law-     based claims, must use the ``choice-of-law'' rule of the      State in which the federal district court sits.
