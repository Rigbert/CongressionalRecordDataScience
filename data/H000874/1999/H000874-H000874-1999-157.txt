Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I moved my place and I went over to the seat on the other side of the aisle so I would have a better opportunity to see this sort of monologue stand-up comedy routine that we had. It was a great routine. But I thought to myself, I wonder if the President calls up the comptroller at Stanford and says, ``By the way, can I send you a picture of Air Force One, and maybe you can even get a picture of the White House, because it's a worth a lot, for my tuition payment this semester.'' And the bursar at Stanford is going to say, ``Send money.''  My colleagues, with all due respect, let us look at what we are talking about. The President of the United States in 1969 had his salary set at $200,000. Now, hear me now, my colleagues. The Founding Fathers, not in the Constitution, but in their early legislation set the President's salary in 1789 at $25,000 cash money that he was paid. Twenty-five thousand dollars 210 years ago. In today's dollars our Founding Fathers set the President's salary at $4 million per year.  Frankly, when I go to the grocery store, I do not say, ``Hey, I am a Congressman. I have a heck of a good office, I've got a great view there and all kinds of things, so can I get my groceries for that?'' No. They say, ``Give me the money.''  We have an insurance executive in America who made last year $400 million. Now, my colleagues, Mr. Sununu, whose son is a Member of Congress, testified, and he is the one that, by the way, said that the President's salary effectively in 1789 was in today's dollars $4 million per year.
