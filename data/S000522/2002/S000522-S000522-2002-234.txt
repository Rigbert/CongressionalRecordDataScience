Mr. Speaker, today, I take the opportunity to let my colleagues know that October was National Spina Bifida Awareness Month. I think we should all pause for a moment and pay tribute to the more than 70,000 Americans--and their family members--who are currently affected by Spina Bifida. After all, Spina Bifida is the nation's most common, permanently disabling birth defect. The Spina Bifida Association of America (SBAA), an organization that has helped people with Spina Bifida and their families for nearly 30 years, works every day--not just in the month of October--to prevent and reduce suffering from this devastating birth defect.  The SBAA was founded in 1973 to address the needs of the individuals and families affected by Spina Bifida, and is currently the only national organization solely dedicated to advocating on behalf of the Spina Bifida community. As part of its service through 60 chapters in more than 100 communities across the country, the SBAA puts expecting parents in touch with families who have a child with Spina Bifida. These families answer questions and concerns and help guide expectant mothers and fathers. The SBAA then works to provide lifelong support and assistance for affected children and their families.  Together, the SBAA and the Spina Bifida Association of the Tri-State Region, which is based in Flemington, New Jersey, work tirelessly to help families meet the challenges and enjoy the rewards of raising their child. I would like to acknowledge and thank SBAA and the Spina Bifida Association of the Tri-State Region for all that they have done for the families affected by this birth defect, especially those living in my district. Their work is truly a labor of love.  For those colleagues who don't know, Spina Bifida is a neural tube defect that occurs when the central nervous system does not properly close during the early stages of pregnancy. Spina Bifida affects more than 4,000 pregnancies each year, with more than half ending tragically in abortion. Many times, unborn children with Spina Bifida are killed by abortion because of a false belief that nothing can be done to help victims of this disease. The truth is that today, approximately 90 percent of all new born babies diagnosed with this birth defect live into adulthood, approximately 80 percent have normal IQs, and approximately 75 percent participate in sports and other recreational activities.  With proper medical care, people who suffer from Spina Bifida can lead full and productive lives. However, they must learn how to move around using braces, crutches or wheelchairs, and how to function independently. They also must be careful to avoid a host of secondary health problems ranging from depression and learning disabilities to skin problems and latex allergies.  During this month of October, the SBAA and its chapters make a special push to increase public awareness about Spina Bifida and teach prospective parents about prevention through proper nutrition and pre-natal care. Simply by taking a daily dose of the B vitamin folic acid (which is found in most multivitamins), women of child-bearing age have the power to reduced the incidence of Spina Bifida by up to 75 percent. That such a simply change in habit can have such a profound effect should leave no question as to the importance of awareness and the impact of prevention.  While consumption of folic acid helps with prevention, we must do more to ensure a high quality of life for people already living with Spina Bifida so more families choose the blessing and joy of having a child. The challenges of raising a child with Spina Bifida are significant, but the challenges can be overcome. Fortunately, Spina Bifida is no longer the death sentence if once was, and now most people born with Spina Bifida will likely have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. The challenge now is to ensure that these individuals have the highest quality of life possible.  I call upon my House colleagues to provide $3 million in much-needed funding to establish a National Spina Bifida Program at the National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ensure that those individuals living with Spina Bifida can live active, productive, and meaningful lives. In addition, I urge the House to take up the recently passed Senate version of the ``Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities Prevention Act of 2002,'' (S. 2980), which takes many critical steps that will work to prevent Spina Bifida and to improve the quality of life for individuals and families affected by this terrible birth defect. I am hopeful that we will act shortly to pass the measure so it can be sent to the President for his signature.  I again wish to thank the SBAA and its chapters for all of their hard work to prevent and reduce suffering from this birth defect, and for their commitment to improve the lives of those 70,000 individuals living with Spina Bifida throughout our nation. Much more work still needs to be done, and I am confident this fine organization and its chapters will lead theeffort for decades to come. I wish the Spina Bifida Association of America and the Spina Bifida Association of the Tri-State Region the best of luck in their endeavors and urge all of my colleagues and all Americans to support their important efforts.                          ____________________
