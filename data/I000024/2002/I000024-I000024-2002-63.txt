President, again, we are saying let's not get emotional about this. Let's not come up with all kinds of accusations. Instead, let's let science decide. Right now, scientific studies subjected to an independent peer review is an appropriate way to determine if Federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing is necessary. The required National Academy of Sciences review of EPA's findings approves an independent verification of the study's results. When the study does come in, it does not necessarily mean EPA has to follow the dictates, the results of this study, but they can and they may decide to do another study. At least we are letting the scientists make a decision as to who is right.  I cannot overemphasize, as the Senator from Alabama talked about how clean natural gas is, how clean it is. That is not even debatable. It is in such plentiful supply. We need this.  Eighty percent of the wells that are done have to use this technique in order to produce the natural gas that is necessary to fully utilize that source. So I think this is a very balanced approach, and it is certainly bipartisan.  I applaud our Senator from New Mexico, along with others who have joined us in supporting this amendment.  I yield the floor.
