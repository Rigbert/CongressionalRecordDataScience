President, the Congressional Record will show the introduction of and prayer by our visiting Chaplain today, Father Claude Pomerleau of Portland, OR, a member of the Holy Cross priests. That is as much of a thumbnail as saying any one of us is a U.S. Senator, period. There is a lot more to it.  Claude Pomerleau has been nearly 50 years a priest. I know because he is my brother-in-law, and my wife Marcelle and I, as well as his wonderful parents, Phil and Cecile Pomerleau, joined him in Rome nearly 50 years ago when he was ordained a priest. My family--my parents, my brothers and sisters, and also our children--has always had such a wonderful relationship with Father Pomerleau. It is great now to see the young grandchildren come in and give him a hug and say: Hi, Uncle Claude.  I also look at his distinguished career. He is not just a brother and brother-in-law, an uncle and friend, he is a man who has taught, speaks many languages, and who has a Ph.D. from the University of Denver. He teaches now at the University of Portland even in semiretirement and also in Santiago, where he is a well-respected visiting professor, and where I am told his Spanish is like that of a native.  He was born in Vermont. His parents are French Canadians, two people who strongly practiced their religion, believed in it, and brought up their children speaking French at home. They instilled in him the values that really make our country great and make a human being even greater.  He has been a mentor. He has been a moral anchor for our family for decades. I think of him being on the altar as a young altar boy at the time Marcelle and I were married 52 years ago, and he has been part of our lives and our marriage ever since. He is the man we turn to when we want guidance. He is a man both of us love greatly. And I would like to say, as the longest serving Member of the Senate, what an honor it was to have him open with the prayer.  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing this.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
