 President, I rise to speak against the amendment of a good friend of mine, Senator Ensign from Nevada. He introduced an amendment that maybe I should have been aware of but was unaware of until just a few minutes ago that reads:       No funds appropriated or otherwise made available in this      Act for purposes of reconstruction of Iraq may be obligated      or expended to pay any person who is a citizen of a country      named in a subsection.  It goes on to name in the subsection France and Germany.  I don't want to speak for the Senator, but that view is an expression of the frustration of an awful lot of Americans and some anger at the failure of the Germans and the French to support our effort to disarm Saddam Hussein.  I begin by saying, I have just spoken with the White House and the State Department. They are adamantly opposed to this amendment. France and Germany are providing support for our effort to disarm Saddam that exceeds that of many countries who were formally members of the coalition. There are overflight and basing rights, and many of our wounded are being flown first to Germany before they come here, not to mention their absolutely critical support in the war on terrorism.  Again, I understand the motivation and the frustration and the anger that may be behind some who want to support the amendment. Our decision to use force in Iraq has created deep divisions within the Security Council. Nonetheless, America need not and cannot take sole responsibility for the challenges of postwar Iraq. That is exactly what this would produce. We can't allow the Security Council and our Atlantic alliances to become casualties of this war.  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?
