 Mr. President, this issue is very personal and very important. I know a little bit about this because many years ago, before coming to Congress, I was a trial lawyer. I spent many years defending doctors when they were sued for medical malpractice, and I spent as many years representing plaintiffs who claimed to be victims of medical malpractice. I have literally been at both tables in the courtroom. At least in a previous life, I knew a little bit about this field of legal practice.  What the Senator from Nevada is trying to do is to reduce the contingency fee that can be paid to a lawyer who represents a plaintiff.  Here is how it works. If you believe you or a member of your family has been a victim of medical malpractice, where you have either been hurt or someone in your family has died, you will go to a lawyer and say: I don't think I was treated right.
