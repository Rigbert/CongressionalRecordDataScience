President, one of the important items contained in the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill is the appropriation for the Census Bureau.  I think we all agree, a fair and accurate census is a fundamental part of our representative democracy and good government. As required by the Constitution, census results will determine how many members of the House of Representatives will come from each of the states. Those results will also determine how many federal dollars, funding a wide array of important programs, will return back to the state. We're talking about over $180 billion that will go to state and local governments and the distribution of additional billions in state funds. This same data is a vital component in determining where to build roads, hospitals, schools; even your local Wal-Mart or McDonald's location is based on this same information.  The Census Bureau projects that the U.S. population will near 266 million in2000. Cost estimates for administering Census 2000 were projected to be anywhere between $4 and $4.8 billion. Those projections were based on the assumption that ``sampling'' would be used to provide the fairest and most accurate count to date.  The U.S. Supreme Court, however, this last year ruled by a narrow 5-4 majority that the use of sampling was prohibited by law for the purpose of apportioning seats in the House of Representatives. Since the Court decided the case on statutory grounds, it found no need to decide whether the Constitution also barred the use of modern statistical methods for purposes of congressional apportionment. The Court went on to affirm that the law requires the Secretary of Commerce to use modern statistical methods, where feasible, for all other purposes.  As a result of the Court's decision, the Administration is required, if feasible, to release two sets of population figures in 2001: one set of adjusted, unsampled numbers to be used for apportioning seats to the States, and a second set of adjusted or sampled, numbers to be used for all other purposes. The Court's decision has added the potential of $1.7 billion to the cost of the census. These funds will be used to hire census takers to handle the 50% increase in the number of households that must be visited.  This includes $954 million for non-response follow-up. To get responses from all households that don't answer the mail survey, the Census Bureau will hire more enumerators and will expand follow-up to any unprecedented 10 weeks. Training will be increased to sustain quality with a larger workforce that will total over 800,000 employees.  The Census Bureau will need an additional $268 million for data collection infrastructure, $229 million for coverage improvement efforts, and $219 million for a variety of data collection operations, things like rural area data collection, the ``Be Counted Program,'' enumeration of soup kitchens, shelters, and redeliveries.  Every single dollar the Administration is asking for is necessary. Without it, we will have a highly inaccurate census count. I believe we're on the path to another census nightmare similar to the 1990 experience. Nationwide, we missed 8.4 million people, mostly inner city and shanty town minorities; they double counted 4.4 million Americans, most of whom were white college students. My home State of Illinois suffered the eighth highest undercount in 1990; in the city of Chicago alone, they somehow didn't count 2.4 percent of the population. If you said they counted 97.6 percent of the population, it sounds good. But missing 2.4 percent is crucial. That's an astonishing figure considering the national average for undercount hovers around 1.6 percent. That may not sound like a lot but that 0.8 percent differentiation equals almost 70,000 people. The city of Chicago estimates that the undercount was significantly higher: maybe as much as 250,000 people. The Census Bureau missed 114,000 folks for the whole state.  What does that mean for my constituents back home in Illinois? The city of Chicago did a study last year and, if you follow the premise that the Bureau missed 68,000 people, estimated revenue loss for the city of Chicago would have totaled just under $100 million. If you follow the 250,000 undercount figure, the city of Chicago would have lost over $327 million. Let me give some figures that show why we're trying to raise awareness about this topic.  Head Start in the city of Chicago, a program to provide early education for kids, lost over $28 million because of the census undercount. The Older Americans Act for senior citizens lost over $5 million. WIC funds, nutrition funds for children, lost over $2.5 million. Child care funding, we lost over $3 million. This is no small affair. We have to remedy the situation.  I have a letter, dated May 7, 1997, from my colleagues Senator Lott, Senator Nickles, then-Speaker Gingrich, and House Majority Leader Armey. In this letter, the Republican leadership in both Houses state:       We are firmly committed to working with the House and      Senate Budget Committees and Appropriations Committees to      provide a level of funding sufficient to perform the entire      range of constitutional census activities, with a particular      emphasis on accurately enumerating all groups that had      historically been undercounted.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 1997.     Dr. Martha Farnsworth Riche,     Director, Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce,          Washington, DC.       Dear Dr. Riche: We are writing about one of the most      critical constitutional functions our government performs:      the decennial census. Based on recent media reports, we are      concerned that a misunderstanding of congressional priorities      is driving the Census Bureau's plans for the 2000 census.      Consequently, we fear that the Bureau is on the verge of      formalizing plans that do not reflect the House and Senate's      goal to perform the most accurate census possible that is      consistent with the Constitution. We would like to take this      opportunity to clarify the three main principles that      comprise the congressional mandate for Census 2000 and which      should guide the actions of both Congress and the Bureau as      you finalize census preparations in coming months.                           increased accuracy       Accuracy and completeness are absolutely essential if the      census is to provide the reliable data necessary to support      the business of government. Despite criticism, the 1990      census was the most accurate in history. Still, we expect to      improve on its success in 2000. To reach the level of      accuracy we expect, to ensure that communities that have been      undercounted in the past are fully and accurately counted in      the future, we must physically count each and every American.       We cannot rely on statistical schemes that compromise      accuracy for the sake of economy. Despite the Bureau's      insistence that statistical estimation is more accurate than      actually counting Americans, the fact remains that if      statistical adjustment had been allowed in 1990, Pennsylvania      would have erroneously lost a congressional seat to      California. Voters should not be disenfranchised through the      use of statistical guessing.       Census data must also be as valid at the census tract and      block level as they are at the state and national levels.      Under sampling, as the area gets smaller, the margin of error      grows wider. Individuals who rely on accurate census data for      reapportionment will receive census counts with a range of      possible numbers to choose from in drawing lines for      congressional, state and local elections. The result will be      chaos in government, uncertainty for voters, lawsuits lasting      for the better part of a decade, and worst of all, the      further erosion of our citizens' confidence in their      government's ability to do its job and do it right.                           constitutionality       Equally important is the constitutionality of Census      methodology. Taxpayers are investing a minimum of $4.2      billion to conduct Census 2000. We must protect their      investment by using only methods that are clearly and      undisputably allowed by the Constitution. If the Census is      conducted with methods that are later ruled unconstitutional,      taxpayers will not only have lost their original investment      in Census 2000, but will likely be asked to spend an      additional $6 billion or $7 billion to do the entire census      over again.       Legal experts who testified recently before the Senate      Governmental Affairs Committee agreed that it would be      calamitous if the Supreme Court were to declare Census 2000      unconstitutional. The Court has not addressed the      constitutionality of statistical sampling in the Census,      however the Constitution clearly states that the Census      should be an ``actual Enumeration'' of the population, and      Title 13 U.S.C., Section 195 states that sampling cannot be      used for purposes of the apportionment of the U.S. House of      Representatives. We strongly believe that the Bureau's      proposed use of statistical sampling exposes taxpayers to the      unacceptable risk of an invalid and unconstitutional census.     allocation of sufficient resources to conduct an accurate and                          constitutional census       Recent news reports have quoted you and other Census Bureau      officials as citing a congressional mandate to spend less      money in the 2000 Census. While we certainly seek to promote      economy and efficiency in all aspects of government, the      constitutional requirements governing the census leave us no      choice when it comes to cutting corners in order to save      money; we cannot do it. On the contrary, the census must be      funded at levels necessary to comply explicitly with the      Constitution.       We are firmly committed to working with the House and      Senate Budget Committees and Appropriations Committees to      provide a level of funding that is sufficient to perform the      entire range of constitutional census activities, with a      particular emphasis on accurately enumerating all groups that      have historically been undercounted. Towards this end we are      eager to see aggressive and innovative promotion and outreach      campaigns in hard-to-count communities, the hiring of      enumerators within those localities, and maximizing Census      employment opportunities for individuals seeking to make the      transition from welfare to work.       We look forward to working with you on these and other      issues to ensure that the 2000 decennial Census is the most      accurate and     Constitutionally sound census ever conducted.           Sincerely,     Newt Gingrich,                                             Speaker of the House.     Richard K. Armey,       House Majority Leader.     Trent Lott,       Senate Majority Leader.     Don Nickles,       Senate Assistant Majority Leader.
