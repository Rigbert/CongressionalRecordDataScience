President, I am pleased to be the original cosponsor of the Savage Rapids Dam Act of 2000, introduced by my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith.  This legislation is another good example of the Oregon way: bringing together varied interests to get win-win results for all stakeholders. Born out of controversy concerning the detrimental effects of the Savage Rapids Dam on fish passage and survival, this legislation is now supported by the Grants Pass Irrigation District, Waterwatch, Oregon's Governor Kitzhaber, Trout Unlimited, and various Oregon river guide and sport fishing concerns.  The winners under this legislation are Oregon's environmental and agricultural interests. The legislation begins the important process of restoring salmon habitat on the Rogue River, while retaining access to necessary irrigation water from the Rogue River for the Grants Pass Irrigation District. The legislation authorizes the acquisition by the Secretary of Interior of the Savage Rapids Dam for the purpose of removing the Dam to promote the recovery of coastal salmon. But prior to that acquisition, the legislation directs the Secretary of Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation, to design and install modern electric irrigation pumps for the Grants Pass Irrigation District so they may continue to access Rogue River water for crop irrigation, as they have done since 1921.  This legislation is good for irrigators: by maintaining water accessibility, it will help sustain local agricultural businesses. It is good for fish because it takes important steps toward habitat restoration by authorizing Dam removal as well as the monitoring, mitigation, and restoration activities necessary to restore the fish population in on the Rogue River.  I look forward to continuing to improve the legislation with my colleagues in the Senate and the stakeholders at home. As I work over the recess and on into the next Congress on this issue, I know, eventually, we will have another win for the Oregon way.                          ____________________
