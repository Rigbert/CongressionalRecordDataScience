They were reported unanimously from the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 21. They were cleared that day on the Democratic side. We were perfectly willing to bring them up and voice vote them that day or the next day or the day after. We were perfectly willing to have a vote in August before we went out. We were perfectly willing to have them voted on in September. We were perfectly willing to have them voted on early, in early October because of the Senator's support and Senator Casey's support. For some reason, that was not cleared on the Senator's side of the aisle. I will be happy to work with my friend from Pennsylvania--after all, we each have the same first name--and we will try to clear them. What the Senator said about them is absolutely true. These are the kind of judges--whether we have a Republican or Democratic President, they would be proud to have them on the bench, and I pledge to work with both Senators from Pennsylvania to get them through.
