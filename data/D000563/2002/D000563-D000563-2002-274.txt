We cannot establish standards and say to school districts across America that we want you to have accountability and testing and the very best teachers in the classroom, we want you to prove you can educate our young people so they can produce for the 21st century, and then have the President send us a budget that doesn't provide the resources.  We had the press conferences. Everybody was patting one another on the back and smiling and saying we were all committed to education. Now comes the sorry part of the picture, when the budget itself is not presenting the resources the school districts need. As I see it, over the past several years we have made dramatic increases in education, increasing our commitment as a nation to better schools and better students. Now we seem to have taken a dramatic step behind. I might add, the Senator from Massachusetts understands, as I do, that to do this is terrible, but to do it in order to generate another tax cut for the wealthiest people in America makes no sense at all in terms of investing for our future.  I ask the Senator, haven't we had a long run here of increases in spending for education that is now, in the Bush budget, being broken?
