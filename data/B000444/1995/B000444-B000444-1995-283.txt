 President, I rise today to commend the House Appropriations Committee for its vote yesterday to restore the moratorium on off-shore oil and natural gas drilling. A bipartisan coalition of coastal State members led the successful fight to rightly reverse the subcommittee's recommendation to lift this needed ban.  Mr. President, our Nation's coastline is perhaps our most beautiful and cherished natural resource. With the Fourth of July weekend fast approaching, many American families are planning to head to the beech to escape the heat, walk along the boardwalk, and swim in our oceans. When they look out to sea, the only sight should be the Sun melting into an endless horizon. They do not want to see gigantic oil and gas drilling rigs and most importantly they do not want to expose their children to pollution.  Mr. President, for 14 years the Congress has stood behind the off-shore ban, which strikes a fair balance between the need for development of natural resources and environmental protection. Yesterday, the full Appropriations Committee recognized the necessity of this balance and I again commend committee members of both parties for their foresight.  I remain deeply concerned, however, that there may be yet another attempt to lift the ban as the appropriations bill moves through the legislative process. I will watch this situation closely and will oppose vigorously any attempt to open our shoreline to needless exploitation.                          ____________________
