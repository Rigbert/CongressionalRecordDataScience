  Mr. DeFAZIO. We have an obligation to the future to stop borrowing and spending, and actually, today, we're going to meet emergency needs across America and we are going to stop borrowing, but we are going to do something the Republicans really hate. We are going to close some unbelievable, abusive, foreign tax loopholes. They're called daisy chain hopscotch dividends that are deemed in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, among other exotics.  You know, when we built the greatest country on Earth, corporations paid 40 percent of the taxes in this country. Today, Republicans are paying 7 and Republicans think that's just too much. Well, we've got a choice: cut $10 billion in abusive foreign tax loopholes and fund our kids' education so we don't have the shortest school years and the largest class sizes in America, or continue business as usual to subsidize those corporations and allow them to hide money overseas.  I know how the Republicans vote. I'm voting with the kids.                          ____________________
