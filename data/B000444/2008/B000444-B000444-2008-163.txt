 Obama, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Reid, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 445       Whereas, on October 18, 2007, former Prime Minister of      Pakistan Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan after more than      8 years in exile, and was welcomed by supporters numbering in      the hundreds of thousands;       Whereas hours after her return, a suicide bomb attack on      her convoy in Karachi killed 145 people and narrowly missed      killing Benazir Bhutto herself, in one of the most violent      terrorist attacks in Pakistan's history;       Whereas Members of Congress and other friends of Pakistan      wrote to President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf weeks prior      to the October 18, 2007, attack on Benazir Bhutto, urging      support for the democratic process and the provision of      adequate security for democratic leaders such as Benazir      Bhutto;       Whereas Members of Congress and other friends of Pakistan      wrote to President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf immediately      after the October 18, 2007, attack, urging that a specific      set of security measures be taken to protect Benazir Bhutto,      and that a full investigation into the October 18 attack be      undertaken;       Whereas, on November 3, 2007, President Musharraf, in his      role as Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan, declared a state of      emergency, suspended the Constitution of Pakistan, dismissed      Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and other      justices of the Supreme Court and provincial High Courts,      replacing them with candidates willing to take an oath to      uphold his actions during the suspension of the Constitution,      and initiated a nation-wide crackdown on political      opposition, the media, and the courts of Pakistan that      resulted in the arrest of more than 1,000 political      opponents;       Whereas, on December 15, 2007, President Musharraf lifted      the State of Emergency, but did not reinstate the dismissed      Supreme Court and High Court justices, allow full freedom of      the press, or release all political prisoners arrested during      the crackdown;       Whereas President Musharraf justified his actions in      November 2007 on the grounds of more effective      counterterrorism efforts, beginning his November 3      proclamation with the statement, ``Whereas there is visible      ascendancy in the activities of extremists and incidents of      terrorist attacks, including suicide bombings, IED      explosions, rocket firing and bomb explosions and the banding      together of some militant groups have taken such activities      to an unprecedented level of violent intensity posing a grave      threat to the life and property of the citizens of      Pakistan'';       Whereas, on December 27, 2007, Benazir Bhutto was killed in      the garrison town of Rawalpindi;       Whereas video footage, backed up by eyewitness testimony,      shows at least 1 gunman firing shots at Benazir Bhutto      instants before her death, and a second terrorist detonating      a bomb near her vehicle shortly after the firing of the      gunshots;       Whereas the precise circumstances surrounding both the      October 18, 2007, attack and the December 27, 2007,      assassination remain unclear, and those responsible for both      terrorist attacks remain at large;       Whereas President Musharraf has accepted the assistance of      Scotland Yard in his government's investigation of the      assassination of Benazir Bhutto, but has rejected calls for      an independent investigation under the auspices of the United      Nations;       Whereas President Musharraf has used the turmoil following      the assassination of Benazir Bhutto to delay elections from      their scheduled date of January 8, 2008, to February 18,      2008;       Whereas Benazir Bhutto's political party and the other      major opposition parties had opposed this delay, and have      expressed concern that it was motivated by an intention to      shape the outcome of the election through poll-rigging or      other improper means;       Whereas the current political crisis in Pakistan has a      grave impact on the national security of the United States,      in that it seriously undermines the ability of the Government      of Pakistan to devote adequate resources and attention to the      fight against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other extremist      forces;       Whereas the political crisis in Pakistan cannot be resolved      without a speedy return to the democratic path, including      free and fair elections and restoration of an independent      judiciary in accordance with the express wishes of the vast      majority of the people of Pakistan;       Whereas the United States has provided Pakistan with      approximately $10,000,000,000 in assistance over the past 6      years; and       Whereas, on December 26, 2007, President Bush signed H.R.      2764, an omnibus spending bill which limited United States      military aid to Pakistan to counterterrorism and law      enforcement activities directed against al Qaeda and the      Taliban, and which withheld $50,000,000 in military aid until      such time as the Secretary of State reports that Pakistan has      restored democratic rights and an independent judiciary, and      is making concerted efforts to fight al Qaeda and the      Taliban: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) conveys the deep condolences of the people of the      United States to the people of Pakistan on the tragic loss of      former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and conveys special      condolences to the families of Benazir Bhutto and the other      victims of this terrorist attack;       (2) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the murder      of Benazir Bhutto on December 27, 2007, and the slaughter of      at least 165 other Pakistani citizens in this attack and the      prior attempt on Benazir Bhutto's life in Karachi on October      18, 2007;       (3) calls upon the Government of Pakistan to do everything      in its power to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to      justice, and to permit investigators to follow their      inquiries in whatever direction they may lead;       (4) calls upon the Government of Pakistan to support and      facilitate an independent inquiry into the assassination of      Benazir Bhutto;       (5) strongly urges the Government of Pakistan to ensure      that free and fair elections are held on February 18, 2008,      as scheduled, and that independent election monitors are      allowed to monitor the elections;       (6) calls upon the Election Commission of Pakistan to      remove all of the restrictions it     recently placed on election observation activities, which      included efforts to restrict observer movement and the      conduct of exit polling on Election Day;       (7) urges President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan to replace      the partisan caretaker governments at the federal,      provincial, and district levels with neutral administrations      acceptable to all major political parties, and to      reconstitute the Election Commission as a genuinely      nonpartisan body;       (8) calls upon the Government of Pakistan to provide      adequate security, including the provision of adequately      armored vehicles and properly functioning jamming equipment      to help prevent the detonation of explosive devices, to all      senior opposition political leaders;       (9) calls upon the Government of Pakistan to release those      individuals still being detained without charges and to end      the ongoing harassment of judges, opposition party activists,      and lawyers;       (10) calls for the restoration of Pakistan's independent      judiciary and an end to all restrictions on the media and      freedom of speech;       (11) calls upon the President to review all existing United      States aid to Pakistan, to ensure that all assistance      furthers the common goals shared by the people of Pakistan      and the United States, with specific reference to combating      violent radicalism and promoting a free and democratic      Pakistan; and       (12) if the President's review concludes that the      conditions described in paragraph (11) are not met, calls      upon the President to suspend (until such time as such      conditions can be met) the transfer to Pakistan of weapons      systems primarily designed and manufactured for combat      against a rival state rather than counterterrorism or      counterinsurgency.
