President, if I can get the attention of the Republican leader, I understand on the Republican side there is a wish for a rollcall vote on this nomination but not on the next; is that correct?  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, yes. The thought was that we would have another rollcall on the second nominee and a voice vote on the third.
