President, recently The New York Times ran another profile of Bob Newhart. I say ``another'' because it is one of so many glowing articles written about him over the years.  Marcelle and I are fortunate to know Bob and his wife Virginia, known by everyone as Ginnie. Bob is a wonderful family person who enjoys being with his wife, children, and grandchildren, but still has time to bring joy to everyone who comes in contact with him. As many times as I have heard some of his comedy routines, I still find myself convulsed in laughter, though nothing can equal the quiet times Marcelle and I have been able to spend with the Newharts.  Bob is extraordinarily well read and well informed and brings a wry and insightful view to whatever is happening. I can think of no one who is his equal, and I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From The New York Times, Mar. 25, 2006]             The Button-Down Comic, Still Standing Up at 76                            (By Ben Sisario)       Los Angeles, March 24: Hidden behind a wide black gate,      with a fountain in front and a big pool in back that the      grandchildren love to dive into, and with the bookcases      inside cluttered with the likes of David McCulloch and Joseph      J. Ellis, Bob Newhart's house in Bel Air would seem a      perfectly comfortable spot for a man of 76 to cocoon and      write his memoirs.       But a comedian craves the sound of laughter, and Mr.      Newhart, though happily deep into his golf-playing years,      cannot stay away from the stand-up circuit. He does about 30      dates a year, mostly on short weekend trips. (He will perform      tonight at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts.)       ``I can't imagine not doing it,'' he said, sitting on an      overstuffed sofa in his living room, in crisp gray slacks and      a fuzzy blue sweater, with his narrow reading glasses resting      at a steep angle almost at the tip of his nose. ``It's      something I've done for 46 years, and at 5 o'clock I'll start      pacing up and down to get the adrenaline going. It's like      Russian roulette--you're out there and it's working and      you're saying, `Thank God the bullet's not in the chamber.'      ''       Mr. Newhart built his career on a persona that would avoid      tension and thrills at all cost. He emerged in the early      1960's as a former accountant and copywriter who acted out      the mundane and ridiculous details of great moments in      history through brilliantly minimalistic one-sided telephone      calls, like a gigglingly skeptical Englishman talking to Sir      Walter Raleigh about his discovery of tobacco. (``You take a      pinch of tobacco and you stuff it up your nose and it makes      you sneeze? Yeah, I imagine it would, Walt!'') And on two      long-running sitcoms, he played versions of the same      character, a slightly grouchy pragmatist always just a breath      away from losing his cool over the neurotic foibles of his      supporting cast.       ``The Bob Newhart Show'' ran from 1972 to 1978 and is now      finding a second life on DVD; its third season is being      reissued April 11.     And since his second sitcom, ``Newhart,'' ended in 1990 after      eight seasons, Mr. Newhart has lent his almost-unflappable      deadpan to a handful of films and television shows, most      recently ``ER'' and ``Desperate Housewives.'' But his      favorite activity remains simply standing in front of a crowd      with a microphone.       ``I'm proudest of being a stand-up,'' he explained,      ``because it's harder. The degree of difficulty is 3.85      instead of 3.5.''       It was also his baptism. Sitting in his spacious living      room, dressed like the frumpy innkeeper of ``Newhart'' and      speaking with a strategic stammer that sets up every punch      line, he is comfortingly recognizable as one of his      television characters. His naturalistic technique of relying      on his own personality to fill out his characters, he said,      is a skill he picked up early in his stand-up career.       ``You start out doing somebody else,'' he said. ``I'd watch      the Sullivan show and I'd watch the Paar show, and a comedian      would be on, and I'd be laughing but at the same time      analyzing him. When I started, I was doing all the good      comedians I'd ever seen. Then I developed my own voice. My      routines are my natural way of looking at the world.''       Mr. Newhart discusses his performance like a serious method      actor. He said: ``With the stand-up comic on TV, whether it's      Seinfeld or Cosby or Roseanne, more important than their      knowledge of how to tell a joke is their knowledge of      themselves, or the persona they've created as themselves. So      that when you're in a room with writers you can say, `Guys,      that's a funny line but I wouldn't say it.' ''       As a stand-up, he draws from a lifetime of routines, and      for his oldest fans he always includes a few numbers from his      first albums, like the conversation between Abraham Lincoln      and his public relations man, who urges him not to shave his      beard because it plays so well in focus groups. Reading      recently about the Zacarias Moussaoui trial, his ``button-     down mind'' found an angle on the 9/11 pilots, and he has      been toying with it as a possible stand-up bit.       ``They didn't want to learn to take off and land,'' he      said. ``They just wanted to fly. Some have criticized the      F.B.I. because that should have been a red flag. But I saw it      as a case of--'' he studied his coffee table it as if it were      a weekly planner--`` `O.K., well, I don't have to come in      Monday; I can come in late Tuesday; Wednesday and Thursday,      O.K., that's flying; and then I don't have to come in      Friday.' ''       His understated style has been widely influential, often in      surprising ways. One of his biggest fans is Bernie Mac, who      says he is but one of a generation of black comedians who      were inspired by Mr. Newhart.       ``A lot of people define courage as being out front and in      your face,'' Mr. Mac said, ``but Bob didn't come out of his      picture frame for anybody. That bland style, that plaid      jacket, with the hair combed to one side over the bald spot--     that was Bob. And there's nothing wrong with that. Because it      takes courage to be yourself, and he showed everybody that.''       Working on his memoir, to be published in the fall by      Hyperion, Mr. Newhart was reminded of the time he was on      David Susskind's talk show with a panel of comedians,      including Buddy Hackett and Alan King, and Mr. Susskind asked      him about his background.       `` `You went to college?' he asked,'' Mr. Newhart said.      ``And I said, `Yes, I went to Loyola University and I got a      degree in accounting.' And Buddy said--'' here Mr. Newhart      did a remarkable imitation of Mr. Hackett's voice--``  `You      mean you didn't have to do this?' ''       ``And now I can say, `No, Buddy, I had to do this.'                          ____________________[Pages S3206-S3207]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    NATIONAL AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH
