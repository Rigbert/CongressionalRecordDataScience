Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, H.R. 3811, the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act of 2014.  Security and transparency are both critically important to every American, and the public expects and deserves to have them both when it comes to health care.  Sadly, I believe the administration has failed to deliver. This important bill seeks to provide peace of mind to folks in Michigan and across the country who have submitted personal information to a Federal health insurance exchange. Americans have the right to know in the event that their sensitive personal information provided to an exchange is compromised, especially as it is the law's individual mandate that forces them to purchase the government-approved health care coverage. Why wouldn't we want the public to know and be alerted right away?  Just this morning on CNBC's ``Breaking News,'' the CEO of Target apparently is indicating that as many as 70 million Americans--their customers--may have had their private information stolen. Would it have been right for Target just to sit on that information? Or was it appropriate for them to try and put the word out so that at least the consumers would have the right information?                              {time}  1000  Let me tell you what this bill does. It is a commonsense bill. It is going to require that the administration promptly inform individuals within 2 business days if their personal information has been stolen or unlawfully accessed through an exchange. Through the Energy and Commerce Committee's thoughtful oversight, we have uncovered troubling information regardingthe security of the health insurance exchanges. What this bill does is preventive medicine. Do we want to wait until the horse is out of the barn before we take action? I don't think so.  We found that the administration did not perform a full security control assessment before healthcare.gov opened for business on October 1. We have also learned that just days before healthcare.gov went live, senior officials at HHS expressed serious concerns regarding the protection of personally identifiable information that was entered into their Web site.  These facts, on top of the fact that the administration has repeatedly misrepresented the functionality and the readiness of the health care law, raise significant questions regarding the security of healthcare.gov and the information available in the exchanges.  A few weeks ago, the administration was willing to let millions of Americans lose their health insurance, despite the President's solemn promise that they could keep their health plan if they liked it; and it took the House, acting in a bipartisan legislative manner, for the administration to confess that, yes, they had broken their promise.  Now the administration is saying it opposes this requirement that it notify Americans when personal information is stolen.
