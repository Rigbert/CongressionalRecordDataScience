'  Mr. President, that was a song, sung to the tune of Randy Newman's ``You've Got a Friend in Me,'' written by a former lawyer for Dream Center Education Holdings about the prospects for their for-profit college enterprise under a Trump administration.  Earlier this month, House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott sent a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos which revealed damning new details about just how far Dream Center's ``friends'' at the Trump/DeVos Department of Education would go to assist as they collapsed.  Details, including that catchy little ditty, were later reported by the New York Times in an article entitled, ``Emails Show DeVos Aides Pulled Strings for Failing For-Profit Colleges.''  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, July 23, 2019] Emails Show DeVos Aides Pulled Strings for Failing For-Profit Colleges                  (By Erica L. Green and Stacy Cowley)       Washington.--Dream Center Education Holdings, a subsidiary      of a Los Angeles-based megachurch, had no experience in      higher education when it petitioned the federal Education      Department to let it take over a troubled chain of for-profit      trade schools.       But the organization's chairman, Randall K. Barton, told      the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, that the foundation      wanted to ``help people live better lives.''       The purchase was blessed despite Dream Center's lack of      experience and questionable finances by an administration      favorable to for-profit education. But barely a year later,      the company tumbled into insolvency, dozens of its colleges      closed abruptly and thousands of students were left with no      degree after paying tens of thousands of dollars in tuition.       Making matters worse, the college is accused of enrolling      new students and taking their taxpayer-supported financial      aid dollars even after some of its campuses had lost their      accreditation, which rendered their credits worthless.       Company emails, documents and recordings show that part of      why Dream Center kept going is that it thought the Education      Department, which under Ms. DeVos has rolled back regulations      on for-profit education, would try to keep it from failing.      Mr. Barton emailed other Dream Center executives that the      department's head of higher education policy--Diane Auer      Jones, a former executive and lobbyist for for-profit      colleges--had pulled strings to help the company's schools in      their effort to regain a seal of approval from an accreditor,      despite their perilous positions.       In another instance, Dream Center's chief operating officer      told faculty at an endangered campus that Ms. Jones was      changing departmental regulations to help the schools obtain      accreditation retroactively.       Although the Trump administration did eventually cut off      federal aid to the chain of colleges and precipitate their      collapse, Democrats say the department failed to respond to      warning signs.       Representative Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat who is      the chairman of the House Education Committee, unveiled a      trove of documents, including internal communication between      executives from Dream Center, in a letter to Ms. DeVos this      month. He said the documents suggest that Ms. Jones misled      Congress about her efforts to help shield Dream Center from      its misdeeds.       ``The actions of Dream Center and the Department of      Education's execution of its responsibility to protect      students raise grave concerns,'' Mr. Scott wrote.       Instead of requiring Dream Center to take action, ``the      department informed Dream Center executives that it would      work to retroactively accredit the institutions during the      periods they had lied to students--rewriting history to erase      Dream Center's deceptive marketing practices,'' Mr. Scott      wrote.       The Education Department has maintained it did nothing      wrong.       ``This story is based entirely on a wrongful premise,'' the      department wrote in a statement. ``The full and complete      timeline shows Dream Center did not receive any unique      benefits from policy decisions made by the department. We      simply worked to try and get as many students into a new      program as possible. While we did not achieve a perfect      outcome, our actions helped thousands of students land on      their feet.''       In a response letter to Mr. Scott on Monday, the      department's acting general counsel, Reed D. Rubinstein,      submitted documentation that he said contradicted the      committee's ``unfair suggestions'' that the department      tailored its policies to assist Dream Center and was not      forthcoming with Congress. ``The Department categorically      rejects these allegations,'' he wrote.       ``Dream Center's management received no special      treatment,'' he said.       President Trump has moved to deregulate any number of      industries, from mining and offshore oil exploration to      chemicals and Internet providers. But Ms. DeVos's efforts to      get the government off the backs of for-profit colleges have      come under particular scrutiny, in part because of the      spectacular implosions of for-profit college chains only a      few years ago, in part because people who once worked in the      sector have led the DeVos deregulatory push.       Dream Center's collapse was the first of the new      deregulatory era. Yet Education Department officials      insisted, repeatedly, that its demise had nothing to do with      the administration's policies or efforts. Ms. Jones told      Congress that she did not even know of Dream Center's      accreditation problems at the time the company said she was      working to get it out of its jam. She also told lawmakers the      policy change extending retroactive accreditation had      ``nothing to do with the Dream Center.''       Those assurances are now being questioned.       ``The documents further suggest that department officials      were not forthcoming to Congress and the public about the      information they had about Dream Center's status and      practices,'' Mr. Scott wrote. He is requesting emails, text      messages and interviews with several department officials,      including Ms. Jones.       The letter and documents ``raise questions about whether      the department took steps to allow Dream Center to mislead      students,'' Mr. Scott said.       From the start, the Education Department overlooked red      flags when, in late 2017, Dream Center took control of more      than 100 campuses with 50,000 students from a for-profit      higher-education company, Education Management Corporation.      Around that time, Dream Center's accreditor, the Higher      Learning Commission, notified the organization that it was      about to change two of its schools' accreditation status. Two      Education Department officials, including the agency's      director of accreditation, were copied on the letter.       In January 2018 the accreditor published a notification on      its website stating that the two Dream Center schools were      not accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It ordered      Dream Center to tell students that their courses and degrees      ``may not be accepted in transfer to other colleges and      universities or recognized by prospective employers.''       Yet for five months, Dream Center kept advertising, ``We      remain accredited.''       By July 2018, Dream Center was running out of cash and knew      its accreditation problems could worsen its financial strain.      Emails from that month obtained by the House Education      Committee indicate that Dream Center officials believed that      the Education Department was maneuvering to help it stave off      catastrophe.       In written responses to questions from Congress, the      Education Department said Ms. Jones was first made aware that      the two Dream Center institutions were not accredited on July      10, 2018. She was unaware of the public notice that the      Higher Learning Commission had issued nearly six months      earlier, according to the agency. She was notified a week      later that the institutions were misrepresenting their      accreditation status and ordered them the next day to stop,      the department said.       Ms. Jones was asked during a House Oversight Committee      hearing this spring whether a policy she had issued later      that month that allowed accreditations to be granted      retroactively was aimed at helping Dream Center. ``Absolutely      not. It had nothing to do with the Dream Center,'' she      answered.       But in company emails, Dream Center executives indicated      the Education Department tipped them off on July 3, 2018,      that a new retroactive accreditation policy was coming, a      week before Ms. Jones said she even knew Dream Center had a      problem.       ``We just got off the phone with DOE,'' Mr. Barton wrote.      ``It appears HLC is in sync with retro'' accreditation.       He said Ms. Jones--whom he directly cited by name--had      worked with accreditors, and ``they will all agree to one      plan with department blessing.''       Mr. Barton did not respond to requests for comment on his      emails.       On July 11, Dream Center's chief operating officer told      faculty in a meeting on an Illinois campus that the      department would allow the schools' accreditor to grant      retroactive accreditation. He said department officials      ``changed their regulation to open the door to letting it      happen,'' according to a recording of the meeting obtained by      the committee. He referred to a conversation with Ms. Jones      the week prior where ``she said everybody was going to be      accommodating.''       Weeks later, on July 25, Ms. Jones finalized the plan      allowing retroactive accreditation, which was a major win for      Dream Center.     While the schools were already slated for closure,      retroactive accreditation would have shielded the company      from legal action for making misleading statements about its      accreditation status.       Ms. Jones said she had begun to revise that guidance months      earlier to allay longstanding concerns about the department's      policy stemming from a dispute involving an accreditor of a      nursing program. The retroactive policy would have also      allowed students to more easily transfer their credits if      they were earned at an accredited institution.       In response to Mr. Scott's accusations, Ms. Jones said, in      a written statement to The New York Times, ``The retroactive      accreditation policy--which had been under discussion long      before I arrived at the department--decided not whether Dream      Center would live or die, but whether or not students could      transfer their credits for the hard work they had      completed.''       In August, after it became public that the two schools      would close, Dream Center's head of regulatory and government      affairs wrote an email to other Dream Center officials      reminding them that communication should be kept confidential      because ``Diane is really working behind the scenes to help      guide us and keep the accreditors aligned.''       Ms. Jones did not directly address the July 3 and July 11      communication from Dream Center officials, but acknowledged      that she had worked with accreditors. She called the Dream      Center accreditation issue a ``messy and complex situation''      and said the accreditor had sent mixed messages about the      status of Dream Center's schools.       Ms. Jones had acknowledged to Congress that she had      concerns about the organization's capacity to manage its      closures, and was in regular communication with a group of      accreditors to devise a plan to allow Dream Center students      to complete their degrees, known as a ``teach-out,'' after      their campuses closed.       ``My goal was to get as many of the more than 8,000      students to new institutions where they could complete their      programs,'' she said. ``I stand firm in my decision to work      collaboratively with accreditors to hold Dream Center      accountable. That Dream Center executives characterize this      as being about them is disingenuous but not surprising. They      were trying to make it appear they had control of the mess      they had made.''       A group of students, represented by the National Student      Legal Defense Network, filed a lawsuit last year, saying      Dream Center issued ``false and misleading'' statements about      its accreditation status, which broke state laws and caused      ``substantial harm'' to more than 1,000 students.       Mr. Scott also pointed to emails documenting the steps the      Education Department took to help Dream Center get hold of      some much-needed cash to prop up its failing campuses.       In an October 2018 email, Dream Center officials were      preparing to request funding from an escrow account managed      by the department.       The funds were intended to offset taxpayer liabilities if      some of the chain's schools closed or failed. Dream Center      wanted to use part of the money to pay for expenses      associated with closing campuses and helping current students      complete their degrees. The department had in August agreed      to release up to $50 million; Dream Center wanted more.       Dennis Cariello, a Dream Center lawyer, sent an email to      company executives before a meeting with A. Wayne Johnson,      who headed the department's office of financial aid. At the      meeting, Mr. Cariello planned to deliver a ``list of the      asks'' that amounted to $75 million.       Mr. Cariello communicated that Mr. Johnson ``asked that I      review the draw requests--there are a few we can't have in      there--bonuses and future rental payments were issues for      him.''       Mr. Cariello declined to comment on the exchange. The      department had released a total of $40 million from the      escrow account to Dream Center by the end of last year,      according to records it sent in response to questions from      Congress.       Education Department officials have maintained that they      worked tirelessly to mitigate the fallout of the Dream Center      collapse. The department restricted the schools' cash flow      from federal student loans after Dream Center went into      receivership in January, barely a month before it cut off      federal student loan funds to Argosy University. That final      move was considered the death knell for the company.       But until then, Dream Center executives had reason to      believe they had friends at the Education Department. In      January 2018, just as Dream Center's schools lost their      accreditation, Ronald L. Holt, a regulatory lawyer on the      Dream Center team, sent a presentation to Dream Center      executives on the state of higher education a year into the      Trump administration.       It Included a song he wrote titled, ``You've Got a Friend      in Trump,'' to the tune of Randy Newman's ``You've Got a      Friend in Me,'' used in the movie ``Toy Story.''     We've got a friend in Trump     He's lifting us out of our slump     We were down--and life was rough     Too many regs, were way too tough     After so many years     We'd just had enough, but     Now, we've got a friend in Trump
