Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6190, the Airport and Airway Extension Act, Part III. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund taxes and spending authority are scheduled to expire on September 30. This bill extends its authority through December 31, 2010, while we work together on a long-term solution.  This extension is critical for our airports and communities across our country. Our aviation system is also key for our economy and jobs. For example, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, located in my congressional district, is the busiest passenger airport in the world. Over 250,000 passengers travel through the airport each day. The Atlanta airport has a direct impact of more than $32 billion on Georgia's economy and employs almost 60,000 people throughout our State. Extending this authority provides the necessary revenue to maintain our Nation's airports and air traffic control system.  Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to come together and support this very simple, commonsense, necessary legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.
