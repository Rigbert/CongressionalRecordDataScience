Our committee members have developed substantial expertise and experience in these areas, and we have a duty to continue to oversee these concerns. I thank the distinguished Ranking Member of the Governmental Affairs Committee for working with us to ensure that the Board's work on privacy and civil liberties matters be under the jurisdiction of both these committees so that we can continue to provide effective oversight.
