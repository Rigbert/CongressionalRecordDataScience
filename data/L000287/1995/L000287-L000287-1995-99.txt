Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight at this hour during this special order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the voting rights campaign of 1965. Thirty years ago this day, March 7, 1965, was a turning point in the struggle for the right to vote in the American South.  In commemorating the voting rights campaign of 1965, we honor the great sacrifices many people made to secure voting rights for all Americans.  Now, Mr. Speaker, you must keep in mind that during another period in our history, during the 1960's, there were certain political subdivisions in the 11 Southern States of the old South, from Virginia to Texas, where 50 to 80 percent of the population was black, and there was not a single black registered voter. The practice used by whites to keep blacks out of their political process ranged from economic retaliation to outright murder. In many instances brutal acts of violence were directed against those who tried to register to vote. Those few who were allowed to register were harassed, intimidated, and even beaten when they tried to exercise their precious right to vote.  One State, the State of Mississippi, had a black voting-age population of more than 450,000, and only 16,000 blacks were registered to vote. In one county in Alabama, Lowndes County, between Selma and Montgomery, AL, the county was more than 80 percent black, and there was not a single registered black voter.  In the little town of Selma, the county seat of Dallas County, AL, majority of black population, only 2.1 percent of blacks of voting age were registered to vote.  The drive for the right to vote came to a head in Selma in the heart of the Black Belt after a series of nonviolent protests and after people had been shot, beaten, and killed. A small band of citizens on March 7, in an effort to dramatize to the Nation and to the world the need for voting rights legislation, decided to march from Selma to Montgomery.  Young black children, some elderly black men and women, left the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church on Sunday afternoon, March 7, 1965, walking to twos, It was a silent, nonviolent, and peaceful protest, walking through the streets of Selma.  Crossing the Alabama River, crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge, when they reached the apex of the bridge, they saw a sea of blue, Alabama State troopers.  The Governor of the State, at that time Gov. George Wallace, had issued a statement the day before saying the march would not be allowed. The sheriff of Dallas County, a man by the name of Jim Clark, on the Saturday night before the march on Sunday had requested that all white men over the age of 21 to come down to the Dallas County Courthouse to be deputized to become part of his posse to stop the march.  Sheriff Clark was a very big man who wore a gun on one side, a nightstick on the other side, and he carried an electric cattle prodder in his hand. He did not use it on cows. He used it on peaceful, nonviolent protesters.  As we continued to walk on that Sunday afternoon, we came within the hearing distance of the State troopers and a man identified himself and said:       I am Maj. John Cloud of the Alabama State Troopers. I give      you 3 minutes to disperse and go back to your church. This is      an unlawful march, and it will not be allowed to continue.  In less than 1\1/2\ minutes, Maj. John Cloud said, ``Troopers advance,'' and you saw these men putting on their gas masks. They came toward us, beating us with nightsticks, bullwhips, tramping us with horses, and using tear gas.  That Sunday, March 7, 1965, became known as Bloody Sunday. There was a sense of righteous indignation all across the country. People could not understand what they saw on television. They could not understand the picture they saw in the paper the next day coming from Selma.  Lyndon Johnson, 8 days later, came before this hall and spoke to a joint session of the Congress on March 15, 1965, to urge Congress to pass a strong voting rights law.                              {time}  2100  In that speech President Johnson started off the night by saying:       I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of      democracy.  He went on to say:       I urge every member of both parties, Americans of all      religions and of all colors, from every section of this      country, to join me in that cause.  President Johnson continued by saying:       At times, at times history and fate meet at a single time      in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending      search for freedom.  He went on to say:       So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a century ago      at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.  And the President went on to say:       There long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the      denial of their rights as Americans. Many were brutally      assaulted. One good man, a man of G-d, was killed.  A few days between March 7, 1965, and March 15, 1965, a young white minister by the name of James Reed, who came down from Boston to participate, was beaten by the Klan and later died.  In that speech here in this hall Lyndon Johnson said that night over and over again, ``We shall overcome.''  [[Page H2796]] In a matter of a few months, Mr. Speaker, the Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, and it was signed into law on August 6, 1965. Because of the March from Selma to Montgomery, because of the leadership of Lyndon Johnson and the action of the Congress on August 6, 1965, we have witnessed what I like to call a nonviolent revolution in American politics, especially in the South. Today in Selma more than 75 percent of blacks of voting age are not registered to vote, and you have a biracial city council. In a State like Mississippi today there are more than 300,000 registered black voters, and the State of Mississippi has the highest number of elected black officials. In 1965, on March 7, 1965, there were less than 50 black elected officials in 11 Southern States. Today there are more than 7,000.  So, Mr. Speaker, we have come a distance. We made a lot of progress. But I think what happened 30 years ago as we meet here tonight tends to dramatize the distance we must still travel before we create a truly interracial democracy in America.  So, Mr. Speaker, at this time I am going to yield to some of my colleagues that are willing to participate in this special order in memory, not just in memory, but in commemoration, I guess, in celebration, of what happened in that little town of Selma, what happened in other parts of Alabama, but also in Mississippi, and Tennessee, and Louisiana, North and South Carolina, and Texas, all across our country really, to make democracy real.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California [Mr. Becerra].
