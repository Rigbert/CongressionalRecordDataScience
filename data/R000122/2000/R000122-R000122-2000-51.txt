President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Jeffords today to introduce the Health Care Consumer Assistance Act. This important legislation seeks to address a significant problem that currently exists in the health insurance market, the lack of a reliable source of information and assistance for health care consumers.  In 1997, President Clinton's Health Quality Commission identified the need for consumer assistance programs that allow consumers access to accurate, easily understood information and get assistance in making informed decisions about health plans and providers. Earlier this month, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Consumer Reports magazine released the results of a survey they conducted on consumer satisfaction with their health plans. Their survey is part of a larger project looking at ways to improve how consumers resolve problems with their health insurance plans. The survey found that while most people who experienced a problem with their plan were often able to resolve them, the majority of those surveyed were confused about where to go for information and help if they have a problem with their health plan. Eventhough a growing number of states have taken steps to give patients new rights in dealing with their health insurance plans, most consumers are either unaware or do not know how to exercise those rights.  The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Jeffords seeks to remedy this information gap by providing grants to states that wish to establish health care consumer assistance programs. These programs are designed to help consumers understand and act on their health care choices, rights, and responsibilities. Under this bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will offer states funds to create or contract with an independent, nonprofit agency to provide a variety of information and support services for health care consumers, including the following: educational materials for health care consumers about strategies to resolve problems and grievances; operate a 1-800 telephone hotline to respond to consumer inquiries; coordinate and make referral to other private and public health care entities when appropriate; conduct education and outreach in the community; and collect and disseminate data about nature of inquiries, problems and grievances handled by the program.  The concept of a health care consumer assistance program has already received considerable support and several states have taken the initiative to create these programs. Governors and state legislatures in many states including, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin have introduced or enacted health care ombudsman legislation. While some states have successfully launched their programs, other state initiatives have faltered due to a lack of sufficient funding.  While important strides are being made to enhance health care consumer information and resources, clearly more needs to be done to expand access to these simple and cost-effective services to all Americans.  Mr. President, I believe that Americans deserve access to the information and assistance they need to be empowered and informed health care consumers. As the health insurance system becomes more confusing and complex, it is critically important that as consumers navigate this system, they have a place where they can go for information, counseling and assistance. As health plan options become more complicated and the web of policies and principles governing those plans becomes more enmeshed, people need a reliable, accessible source of information, and state health care consumer assistance programs have proven their ability to meet this challenge. I look forward to working with my colleague, Senator Jeffords, in advancing this important and timely legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of my bill printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2819       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care Consumer      Assistance Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) People with health care insurance or coverage have many      more options with respect to coverage of, payment or payments      for, items, services or treatments. Also, their health plans,      coverages, rights, and providers are frequently being      reorganized, expanded, or limited.       (2) All consumers need information and assistance to      understand their health insurance choices and to maximize      their access to needed health services. Many do not      understand their health care rights or how to exercise them,      despite the current efforts of both the public and private      sectors.       (3) Few people with health care coverage have independent      credible sources of information or assistance to guide their      decisionmaking or to help resolve problems.       (4) It is important to maintain and strengthen a productive      working relationship between all consumers and their health      care professionals and health insurance providers.       (5) Federally initiated health care consumer assistance and      information programs targeted to consumers of long-term care      and to medicare beneficiaries under title XVIII of the Social      Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) are effective, as are a      number of State and local consumer assistance initiatives.       (6) The principles, policies, and practices of health care      providers for delivering safe, effective, and accessible      health care can be enriched by State-based collaborative,      independent education, problem resolution, and feedback      programs. Health care consumer assistance programs have      proven their ability to meet this challenge.       (7) Health care consumers want and need reliable      information about their health care options that integrates      data and effective resolution strategies from the full range      of available resources. Health care consumer assistance      programs can provide that reliable, problem-solving      information to help in navigating the health care system.       (8) Health care delivered to individuals and within      communities can be improved by collecting and examining      consumers' experiences, questions, and problems and the ways      in which their questions and problems are resolved. Health      care consumer assistance programs can educate and inform      consumers to be more effective, self-directed health care      consumers.       (9) Many states have created health care consumer      assistance programs. The Federal     Government can assist the States in developing and      maintaining effective health care consumer assistance      programs.     SEC. 3. GRANTS.
