 President, the last amendment I am going to propose on this bill states that subsidized carriers must provide U.S. flag and U.S. crews for the entire defense sealift voyage. This amendment is responding to the desire, presumably, behind the bill, presumably behind cargo preference legislation for 50 years, a necessity of having American ships and U.S. crews delivering our products, our materiel, to the war zone. So it requires that we have U.S. flag and U.S. crews for the entire defense sealift voyage.  Most believe that if we pay these U.S.-flag carriers this billion dollar corporate welfare subsidy over the next 10 years, they will carry out their obligation to deliver military sustainment cargo all the way into the war zone with their U.S.-flag commercial vessels with U.S. crews. Unfortunately, neither the VISA program, which is already in place, nor this bill, H.R. 1350, guarantees this. So the legislation purports that it is necessary, for our own national security, to have our own U.S. ships and our own U.S. crews to deliver to the war zone our war materiel. Yet, there is no guarantee from this legislation and no guarantee from VISA that this will be the situation.  What typically is the practice is that U.S.-flag vessels will deliver war sustainment materiel to its commercial hub--that hub could be Rotterdam, as an example--and then unload it onto foreign-flag, foreign-crewed vessels, which will then carry the materiel into the war zone.  But this bill does not correct this situation, the practice of using foreign vessels and foreign crews feeders. Now, as you have heard me say, that doesn't bother me so much because, as a practical matter, that is the way we get our goods there. But it seems to me that if we are going to have this subsidy of $2.1 million of corporate welfare for each ship and they get paid that just for the obligation they have to the United States to be available in case of war, or to provide equal service in the case of war, then they ought to be delivering the product to the war zone.  So this practice of transferring to foreign ships and foreign-crewed vessels caused us a lot of confusion about the extent of U.S.-flag support during the Persian Gulf war. Some believe that these U.S.-flag commercial container vessels, which will be subsidized under H.R. 1350, delivered 79 percent of our military cargo into the war zone. This is just not accurate.  We must not confuse the difference among the cargoes and the ownership of vessels. Although much of the Persian Gulf cargoes were carried by U.S. flags, many were Government-owned vessels, not the commercial-owned container vessels that seek these taxpayer subsidies. In reality, Government-owned and Government-chartered vessels deliver 50 percent of these cargoes--primarily ammunition and military equipment. The remaining 29 percent of cargoes, which was primarily sustainment--that included food, clothing, and things like that--was transported by U.S.-flag container vessels to some hub port around the world. From there, most of the military sustainment cargoes were unloaded onto foreign-flag, foreign-crewed vessels, which made the deliveries into the war zone. In short, virtually all of the military sustainment cargoes carried by U.S.-flag container vessels were transferred to foreign flag/foreign crews to be delivered into the war zone. Foreign flag/foreign crews made about 500 voyages into the gulf war zone. About 300 were feeder vessels that picked up cargo from U.S.-flag containers at a hub port. This practice will not change under this bill and VISA, as it is currently written.  In fact, this legislation will allow U.S.-flag carriers to meet its stage three obligation by substituting its U.S. flag/U.S. crews with foreign flag/foreign crews for the entire voyage, not just to the hub.  Now, what is even more incredible is the fact that these subsidized U.S.-flag carriers will be able to charge U.S.-flag premium rates, while providing the Department of Defense with foreign-flag/foreign-crewed vessels.  Although the inference in this legislation may be that we will have American crews with American-owned ships do the necessary job of transporting our war materiel, and that may be an intent of the bill, it is not a certainty with the bill. It seems to me that we ought to nail that down for that $2.1 million corporate welfare subsidy.  Now, our distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, on July 30, 1996, stated this:       Our military needs a U.S.-flag merchant marine to carry      supplies to our troops overseas. We cannot--in fact, we must      not--rely upon foreign ships and foreign crews to deliver      supplies into hostile areas.  That was our own distinguished majority leader a little over a month ago, speaking of the importance of this. My amendment, then, to H.R. 1350 is necessary if we hope to achieve the objective stated on July 30, 1996, by Senator Lott.  My amendment requires subsidized carriers to provide Uncle Sam with U.S.-flag vessels and U.S. crew members to carry the war materiel, and to carry it clearly into the war zone, not just to a commercially convenient drop-off point, such as Rotterdam. In other words, if we are paying a $2.1 million subsidy to have these ships available, with the responsibility to get the stuff to the war zone. If the philosophy behind this legislation is that we should have this stuff carried to the war zone on American ships with American crews, then obviously the bill ought to do that. Otherwise, it ought to be made very clear that what this bill is supposed to do, it really does not do that.  So you want to remember that maritime unions and carriers are constantly arguing that we cannot trust foreign flag and foreign crews, and they say that is why we must subsidize American companies' ships with this corporate welfare program that is before us.  So then it seems to me that, under this philosophy, taxpayers should be able to insist that U.S.-flag carriers that receive this billion-dollar corporate subsidy over 10 years put their national defense responsibilities ahead of their commercial interests in times of war.                           Amendment No. 5395   (Purpose: To provide that United States-flag vessels be called up    before foreign flag vessels during any national emergency and to prohibit the delivery of military supplies to a combat zone by vessels                 that are not United States flag vessels)
