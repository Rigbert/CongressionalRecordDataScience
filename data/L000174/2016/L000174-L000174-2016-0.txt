President, Congress has now passed the bipartisan Promoting Travel, Commerce, and National Security Act. In 2015, I hailed the signing of a new agreement between the United States and Canada designed to improve cross-border travel, commerce, and security between our two countries. Since then, there has been legislation introduced in both the Senate and the House to allow for full implementation of that expanded Canada preclearance agreement. Thirty business associations both in the United States and Canada support this legislation, and the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security and Justice fully support its passage.  Let's be clear about one thing: U.S. preclearance operations are already under way, in Canada and elsewhere. Preclearance facilities allow travelers to pass through U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP, inspections on foreign soil, prior to traveling to the United States. Preclearance operations relieve congestion at U.S. destination airports, facilitate commerce, save money, and strengthen national security. The United States currently stations CBP officers in select locations in Canada to inspect passengers and cargo bound for the United States before departing Canada. This legislation will pave the way for additional U.S. preclearance facilities in Canada in the marine, land, air and rail sectors. In particular, this legislation will advance important projects in Vermont: the creation of a preclearance facility at Montreal's Central Station, reestablishing train service between Vermont and Montreal; and improvements to air service between Burlington International Airport and Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport.  This legislation will promote two key national goals: enhancing our national security and increasing efficiency for travelers and commercial exchanges. With respect to national security, by placing CBP personnel at the point of departure, screening occurs before a person boards a flight, increasing our ability to prevent those who should not be flying to the United States from doing so. In 2014, preclearance stopped more than 10,000 inadmissible travelers worldwide before they left foreign soil. And with respect to commerce, the United States and Canada enjoy one of the largest bilateral economic relationships in the world, with $1.4 trillion in bilateral trade and investment and two-way trade in goods and services valued at $759 billion in 2014. Each day, more than $1.8 billion in goods and services and nearly 390,000 people cross the U.S.Canadian border. Preclearance helps further facilitate this important economic relationship.  Preclearance is an issue about which both Democrats and Republicans can and do agree. It will enhance border security and stimulate economic growth. I look forward to the President signing this bill into law.                          ____________________
