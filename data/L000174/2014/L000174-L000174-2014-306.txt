President, 1 year ago today, the Senate came together in the best tradition of the Chamber to pass the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, including the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, with a strong bipartisan vote. It marked the culmination of years of collaboration with survivors and the victim services professionals who work with them every day. It also marked an historic step to protect all victims, regardless of their immigration status, their sexual orientation or their membership in an Indian tribe. As I have said countless times on the floor of this Chamber, ``a victim is a victim is a victim,'' and the bill the Senate passed 1 year ago today was a reflection of that truth.  In passing this historic VAWA reauthorization, the Senate showed that we still can act in a bipartisan way and put crime victims above politics. Senators Crapo and Murkowski were steadfast partners in that effort and listened to the call from thousands of survivors of violence and law enforcement by supporting a fully-inclusive, lifesaving bill.  In the year since its passage, the important changes we made to the Violence Against Women Act have made lives better. The new nondiscrimination provisions included in the law are ensuring that all victims, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, have access to lifesaving programs and cannot be turned away. I was discouraged by the opposition of some to these inclusive provisions last year, especially when the research so clearly underscored the need to update the law to protect the most vulnerable populations. I am proud, however, that after all was said and done, we stayed true to our core value of equal protection and these provisions were enacted.  We also made vital improvements to the law to address the epidemic of violence against Native women. Three out of five Native women have been assaulted by their spouses or intimate partners. On some reservations, Native American women are murdered at a rate more than 10 times the national average. Think about those statistics for a minute. They are chilling. Native women are being brutalized and killed at rates that shock the conscience. We simply could not continue to ignorethis ongoing and devastating violence, and I am proud that as a country we said ``enough.''  A key provision in the Leahy-Crapo bill, now law, recognizes tribes' special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indian offenders who commit acts of domestic violence against an Indian on tribal land. This provision also faced strong opposition by some but we held firm in the belief that a tribal government should be able to hold accountable those who commit these heinous crimes against its people on its land. I was so proud when voices from around the country--Indian and non-Indian--joined our message that this was a VAWA to protect all victims and refused to give in. With their unified support, we beat back efforts to strip out this critical provision. That is why I was particularly pleased to see the launch of the new pilot project last week in which three tribes--the Umatilla, the Pascua Yaqui, and the Tulalip--will begin to exercise this authority we fought so hard to protect. I ask unanimous consent that a recent Washington Post article highlighting this project be printed in the Record.  Other key provisions of the new law include funding to help law enforcement and victim service providers reduce domestic violence homicides, including in my home State of Vermont. It is leading to more investigation and prosecution of rape and sexual assault crimes and a greater focus on these issues on college campuses. It is also helping eliminate backlogs of untested rape kits to help those victims receive justice and security promptly.  Unfortunately, one provision that was not included in the final VAWA bill was a modest increase in the number of U visas available to immigrant victims of domestic violence and other crimes. These visas are an important law enforcement tool that encourages immigrant victims to report crime, making us all safer. I reluctantly agreed to remove this provision and instead ensured its inclusion in the comprehensive immigration reform bill the Senate passed last year. As the House considers ways to move on that important issue, I urge them to include an increase in U visas so that all victims of domestic violence will be protected.  The Violence Against Women Act is an example of how the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local communities, can help solve problems. By providing new tools and resources to communities all around the country, we have helped bring the crimes of rape and domestic violence out of the shadows. There is much we can learn from that effort as we consider legislation that should similarly rise above politics.  After the Senate passed the bill last year, I mentioned a tragic incident that had just occurred. A man shot and killed two women waiting to pass through metal detectors at a courthouse, where he was stalking another victim. Two male police officers also were struck by bullets but were saved by their bulletproof vests. At that time, I urged this body to reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program so that more of our law enforcement officials can be protected. Sadly, a year later, that effort remains incomplete.  Before I came to the Senate, I spent years in local law enforcement and have great respect for the men and women who protect us every day. When I hear Senators say that we should not provide Federal assistance, we should not help officers get the protection they need with bulletproof vests, or that we should not help the families of fallen public safety officers, I strongly disagree.  In our Federal system, we can help and when we can, we should help. That is what programs like the Violence Against Women Act are all about. Despite our different political perspectives, most of us came to the Senate with the goal of helping people. We must be able to find common ground to do that. I hope that this body can again come together to protect the American people and support law enforcement like we did 1 year ago today when we passed the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 8, 2014]       New law offers protection to abused Native American women                           (By Sari Horwitz)       White Earth Nation, Minn.--Linda Davidson. Lisa Brunner      remembers the first time she saw her stepfather beat her      mother. She was 4 years old, cowering under the table here on      the Ojibwe reservation, when her stepfather grabbed his      shotgun from the rack. She heard her mother scream, ``No,      David! No!''       ``He starts beating my mother over the head and I could      hear the sickening thud of the butt of the shotgun over her      head,'' Brunner said. ``Then he put the gun back on the rack      and called her a bitch. He slammed the bedroom door and sat      down on the squeaky bed. And then I heard the thud-thud of      his cowboy boots as he laid down, squeaking again, and he      went to sleep.''       There were many more beatings over the years, Brunner said.      Twenty years later, she said, she was brutally assaulted by      her own husband on this same Indian reservation, an enormous      swath of Minnesota prairie that has seen its share of sorrow      for generations.       An estimated one in three Native American women are      assaulted or raped in their lifetimes, and three out of five      experience domestic violence. But in the cases of Brunner and      her mother, the assailants were white, not Native American,      and that would turn out to make all the difference.       Lisa Brunner of the Ojibwe tribe in Minnesota speaks on the      cycle of sexual violence Native American women, including      herself, have faced.       For decades, when a Native American woman has been      assaulted or raped by a man who is non-Indian, she has had      little or no recourse. Under long-standing law in Indian      country, reservations are sovereign nations with their own      police departments and courts in charge of prosecuting crimes      on tribal land. But Indian police have lacked the legal      authority to arrest non-Indian men who commit acts of      domestic violence against native women on reservations, and      tribal courts have lacked the authority to prosecute the men.       President Obama, joined by Vice President Biden, members of      women's organizations, law enforcement officials, tribal      leaders, survivors, advocates and members of Congress, signs      the Violence Against Women Act in March.       Last year, Congress approved a law--promoted by the Obama      administration--that for the first time will allow Indian      tribes to prosecute certain crimes of domestic violence      committed by non-Indians in Indian country. The Justice      Department on Thursday announced it had chosen three tribes      for a pilot project to assert the new authority.       While the law has been praised by tribal leaders, native      women and the administration as a significant first step, it      still falls short of protecting all Indian women from the      epidemic of violence they face on tribal lands.       The new authority, which will not go into effect for most      of the country's 566 federally recognized Indian tribes until      March 2015, covers domestic violence committed by non-Indian      husbands and boyfriends, but it does not cover sexual assault      or rape committed by non-Indians who are ``strangers'' to      their victims. It also does not extend to native women in      Alaska.       Proponents of the law acknowledge that it was drawn      narrowly to win support in Congress, particularly from      Republican lawmakers who argued that non-native suspects      would not receive a fair trial in the tribal justice system.       For their part, native women say they have long been ill-     served by state and federal law. U.S. attorneys, who already      have large caseloads, are often hundreds of miles away from      rural reservations. It can take hours or days for them to      respond to allegations, if they respond at all, tribal      leaders say. Native women also have to navigate a complex      maze of legal jurisdictions.       ``There are tribal communities where state police have no      jurisdiction and federal law enforcement has jurisdiction but      is distant and often unable to respond,'' said Thomas J.      Perrelli, a former associate attorney general who was one of      the administration's chief proponents of the amendment.      ``There are tribal communities where the federal government      has no jurisdiction but state law enforcement, which has      jurisdiction, does not intervene. And there are still other      tribal lands where there is a dispute about who, if anyone,      has jurisdiction. All of this has led to an inadequate      response to the plight of many Native American women.''       More than 75 percent of residents on Indian reservations in      the United States are non-Indians. In at least 86 percent of      the reported cases of rape or sexual assault of American      Indian and Alaska native women, both on and off reservations,      the victims say their attackers were non-native men,      according to the Justice Department.                             `Not enrolled'       The loophole in the American Indian justice system that      effectively provides immunity to non-Indians is the story of      a patchwork of laws, treaties and Supreme Court decisions      over generations.       At the root of the confusion about Indian jurisdiction is      the historical tension over Indian land. As American settlers      pushed Native Americans off their tribal lands and then      renegotiated treaties to guarantee tribes a homeland, large      areas of the reservations were opened for white families to      homestead.       That migration led to the modern-day reservation, where      Indians and non-Indians often live side by side, one farm or      ranch home belonging to a white family, the next one      belonging to an Indian family. It is a recipe for conflict      over who is in charge and who has legal jurisdiction over      certain crimes.       ``The public safety issues in Indian country are so      complicated,'' said Deputy Associate Attorney General Sam      Hirsch, one of the Justice Department officials who focus on      tribal justice issues. ``No one would have ever designed a      system from scratch to look like the system that has come      down to us through the generations.''       Over the past 200 years, there have been dramatic swings in      Indian-country jurisdiction and the extent of tribal powers.       In 1978, in a case widely known in Indian country as      ``Oliphant,'' the Supreme Court held that Indian tribes had      no legal jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indians who committed      crimes on reservations. Even a violent crime committed by a      non-Indian husband against his Indian wife in their home on      the reservation--as Brunner said happened to her on the White      Earth Nation reservation--could not be prosecuted by the      tribe.       The court said it was up to Congress to decide who had that      authority.       ``We are not unaware of the prevalence of non-Indian crime      on today's reservations, which the tribes forcefully argue      requires the ability to try non-Indians,'' the court said.      ``But these are considerations for Congress to weigh in      deciding whether Indian tribes should finally be authorized      to try non-Indians.''       Congress took no action for 35 years.       As a result, native women who were assaulted were often      told there was nothing tribal police could do for them. If      the perpetrator was white and--in the lingo of the tribes--     ``not enrolled'' in the tribal nation, there would be no      recourse.       ``Over the years, what happened is that white men, non-     native men, would go onto a Native American reservation and      go hunting--rape, abuse and even murder a native woman, and      there's absolutely nothing anyone could do to them,'' said      Kimberly Norris Guerrero, an actress, tribal advocate and      native Oklahoman who is Cherokee and Colville Indian. ``They      got off scot-free.''       In 2009, shortly after taking office, Attorney General Eric      H. Holder Jr. was briefed by two FBI agents on the issue of      violence on Indian reservations.       They told him about the soaring rates of assault and rape      and the fact that on some reservations, the murder rate for      native women is 10 times the national average.       ``The way they phrased it was, if you are a young girl born      on an Indian reservation, there's a 1-in-3 chance or higher      that you're going to be abused during the course of your      life,'' Holder said in an interview. ``I actually did not      think the statistics were accurate. I remember asking, `check      on those numbers.' ''       Officials came back to Holder and told him the statistics      were right: Native women experience the highest rates of      assault of any group in the United States.       ``The numbers are just staggering,'' Holder said. ``It's      deplorable. And it was at that point I said, this is an issue      that we have to deal with. I am simply not going to accept      the fact it is acceptable for women to be abused at the rates      they are being abused on native lands.''                             Measuring tape       Diane Millich, left, joins Attorney General Eric H. Holder      Jr. and Deborah Parker, vice chairwoman of the Tulalip Tribes      of Washington state, at the bill-signing ceremony in March.       Diane Millich grew up on the Southern Ute Indian      reservation, nestled in the mountain meadows of southwestern      Colorado. When she was 26, she fell in love and married a      non-Indian man who lived in a town just beyond the      reservation.       Not long after they were married, Millich's husband moved      in with her and began to push and slap her, she said. The      violence escalated, and the abuse, she said, became routine.      She called the tribal police and La Plata County authorities      many times but was told they had no jurisdiction in the case.       One time after her husband beat her, Millich said, he      picked up the phone and called the sheriff to report the      incident himself to show that he couldn't be arrested, she      said. He knew, she said, there was nothing the sheriff could      do.       ``After a year of abuse and more than 100 incidents of      being slapped, kicked, punched and living in terror, I left      for good,'' Millich said.       The brutality, she said, increased after she filed for a      divorce.       ``Typically, when you look backwards at crimes of domestic      violence, if less serious violence is not dealt with by the      law enforcement system, it leads to more serious violence,      which eventually can lead to homicide,'' said Hirsch, the      deputy associate attorney general.       One day when Millich was at work, she saw her ex-husband      pull up in a red truck. He was carrying a 9mm gun.       ``My ex-husband walked inside our office and told me, `You      promised until death do us part, so death it shall be,' ''      Millich recalled. A co-worker saved Millich's life by pushing      her out of the way and taking a bullet in his shoulder.       It took hours to decide who had jurisdiction over the      shooting.       Investigators at the scene had to use a measuring tape to      determine where the gun was fired and where Millich's      colleague had been struck, and a map to figure out whether      the state, federal government or tribe had jurisdiction.       The case ended up going to the closest district attorney.      Because Millich's husband had never been arrested or charged      for domestic abuse on tribal land, he was treated as a first-     time offender, Millich said, and after trying to flee across      state lines was offered a plea of aggravated driving under      revocation.       ``It was like his attempt to shoot me and the shooting of      my co-worker did not happen,'' Millich said. ``The tribe      wanted to help me, but couldn't because of the law. In the      end, he was right. The law couldn't touch him.''                              Section 904       Last year, Millich and other American Indian women came to      Washington to tell their stories to congressional leaders.      They joined tribal leaders in lobbying for the passage of the      288-page reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act,      which included language proposed by the Justice Department      that for the first time would allow tribal courts to      prosecute non-Indians who assaulted native women on tribal      lands. It would also allow the courts to issue and enforce      protective orders, whether the perpetrator is Indian or non-     Indian.       Opponents of the provision, known as Section 904, argued      that non-native defendants would not be afforded a fair trial      by American Indian tribes. In the case of Alaska, the Senate      excluded Native Alaskan women because of especially      complicated issues involving jurisdiction.       At a town hall meeting, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa)      said that ``under the laws of our land, you've got to have a      jury that is a reflection of society as a whole.''       ``On an Indian reservation, it's going to be made up of      Indians, right?'' Grassley said. ``So the non-Indian doesn't      get a fair trial.''       Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), another opponent, said the      Violence Against Women Act was ``being held hostage by a      single provision that would take away fundamental      constitutional rights for certain American citizens.''       The bill passed the Senate last February but was held up by      House Republicans over Section 904. They argued that tribal      courts were not equipped to take on the new responsibilities      and non-Indian constituents would be deprived of their      constitutional rights without being able to appeal to federal      courts.       ``When we talk about the constitutional rights, don't women      on tribal lands deserve their constitutional right of equal      protection and not to be raped and battered and beaten and      dragged back onto native lands because they know they can be      raped with impunity?'' Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) argued on the      floor.       Underlying the opposition, some congressmen said, was a      fear of retribution by the tribes for the long history of      mistreatment by white Americans.       With the support of Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a member of      the Chickasaw Nation, the House accepted the bill containing      Section 904 on a vote of 229 to 196. On March 7, President      Obama signed the bill with Millich, Holder and Native      American advocates at his side.       The Justice Department has chosen three Indian tribes-- the      Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona, the Tulalip Tribes of      Washington state and the Umatilla tribes of Oregon-- to be      the first in the nation to exercise their new criminal      jurisdiction over certain crimes of domestic and dating      violence.       ``What we have done, I think, has been game-changing,''      Holder said. ``But there are still attitudes that have to be      changed. There are still resources that have to be directed      at the problem. There's training that still needs to go on.      We're really only at the beginning stages of reversing what      is a horrible situation.''       Lisa Brunner and her daughter, Faith Roy, fold clothes at      home on the White Earth Indian reservation in Minnesota.                         Sliver of a Full Moon       Last summer, several Native American survivors of domestic      violence from around the country put on a play, ``Sliver of a      Full Moon,'' in Albuquerque. The play documented the story of      the abuse and rape of Native American women by non-Indians      and the prolonged campaign to bring them justice.       Using the technique of traditional Indian storytelling,      Mary Kathryn Nagle, a lawyer and member of the Cherokee      Nation in Oklahoma, wove together their emotional tales of      abuse with the story of their fight to get Washington to pay      attention.       Millich and Brunner played themselves, and actors played      the roles of members of Congress, federal employees and      tribal police officers who kept answering desperate phone      calls from abused native women by saying over and over again,      ``We can't do nothin',?'' ``We don't have jurisdiction,'' and      ``He's white and he ain't enrolled.''       Brunner portrayed herself in a play that told the story of      the abuse and rape of Native American women by non-Indians      and the campaign to bring them justice.       By that time, Brunner's intergenerational story of violence      and abuse had taken a painful turn. Her youngest daughter,      17, had been abducted by four white men who drove onto     the reservation one summer night. One of them raped her,      Brunner said.       It was the real-life version of author Louise Erdrich's      acclaimed fictional account of the rape of an Ojibwe woman by      a non-Indian in her 2012 book, ``The Round House.'' In both      the real and the unrelated fictional case, the new      congressional authority would not give the tribe jurisdiction      to arrest and prosecute the suspects, because they were not      previously known to the victim.       Last week, inside her home on the frigid White Earth      Nation, which was dotted by vast snowy cornfields and      hundreds of frozen lakes, Brunner brought out a colorful      watercolor she had painted of three native women standing in      the woods under a glowing full moon. The painting was the      inspiration for the title of Nagle's play, she said, but it's      also a metaphor for the new law.       ``We have always known that non-Indians can come onto our      lands and they can beat, rape and murder us and there is      nothing we can do about it,'' Brunner said. ``Now, our tribal      officers have jurisdiction for the first time to do something      about certain crimes.''       ``But,'' she added, ``it is just the first sliver of the      full moon that we need to protect us.''                          ____________________
