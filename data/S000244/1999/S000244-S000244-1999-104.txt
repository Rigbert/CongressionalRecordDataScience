Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello), which would add nearly $27 million to the bill's already generous fiscal year 2001 authorization level.  This bill recommends an increase of $61.1 million, or 4.6 percent, above the fiscal 1999 appropriated level for fiscal year 2000, then an additional increase of $67.1 million, or 4.8 percent, above the fiscal 2000 recommended level for fiscal year 2001.  It is consistent with the administration's request, and also consistent with my pledge to provide stable and sustainable R funding over the next 5 years for programs under the Committee on Science's jurisdiction.  I would just point out that I have been talking about 3 percent increases overall for science. This bill has 4.6 percent in the first year and 4.8 percent in the second year, which is over that recommended amount.  While I understand the gentleman's amendment is well-intentioned, I also believe it is unwise, while we are trying to sustain the balanced budget caps in order to preserve and protect social security. I simply cannot be a party to an amendment that threatens the well-being of our senior citizens, and consequently, I urge rejection of the Costello amendment.
