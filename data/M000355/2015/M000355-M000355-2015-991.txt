 President, I rise to recognize and congratulate the Pikeville Independent Schools system in Pikeville, KY, on the occasion of its 100th anniversary. Under the leadership of Superintendent Jerry Green, it is one of the best public school systems in the Commonwealth.  Before the founding of Pikeville Independent Schools, in the early 20th century, the region contained only a scattering of small, one-room schoolhouses. In 1915, the first public high school in Pike County opened under the system's first superintendent, Tobias J. Kendrick. There were approximately 150 students and 9 teachers and administrators. Courses taught included geometry, advanced algebra, physics, German, rhetoric, and 4 years of Latin. The first senior class contained only one graduate, a man named Vernon Stump.  Today, Pikeville Independent Schools includes Pikeville Elementary and Pikeville Junior High/High School. The district boasts some 1,280 students from preschool to the 12th grade, and all go by the nickname ``Pikeville Panthers.'' Both Pikeville Elementary and Pikeville High are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and the school district has been chosen as one of only 17 Kentucky school districts to receive the What Parents Want Award.  Pikeville Independent Schools is constantly evaluating and creating programs to serve the needs of the students in the district. Pikeville Elementary, which serves preschool through grade 6, features full-time humanities teachers for art, music, and band. It has transition programs for both new students entering preschool and exiting students graduating into the seventh grade. It has many volunteer programs, and Pikeville Elementary volunteers log an average of 3,000 volunteer hours per year. It features a fully equipped science lab, an active and supportive parent-teacher organization, small class sizes, and individual instruction and tutoring.  Pikeville High School, which serves grades 7 through 12, offers its students 8 honors courses and 10 advanced placement courses, as well as unlimited opportunities for students to earn dual credit at the University of Pikeville. Currently, 45 percent of Pikeville High juniors and seniors are taking one or more dual credit courses through the university.  Pikeville High offers five vocational school programs and four career majors--business management, business technology, web development and administration, and information support services. A wide variety of extracurricular activities are available, including Key Club, Pep Club, Future Business Leaders of America, and the National Honor Society, just to name a few.  Pikeville Independent Schools ranks second in the State for college and career readiness. The district's juniors place sixth in the State on the ACT test composite score. And the high school placed in the 97th percentile this past year among all schools in the State. The district's graduation rate for the 2012-2013 school year was over 96 percent. Athletics and artistic achievement are also highly valued in the district, and Pikeville Independent Schools have a long tradition of outstanding music groups, basketball, and football teams.  For 100 years, Pikeville Independent Schools has excelled at its mission to prepare students to become productive, contributing, valuable members of society who have pride in their school and their community. Kentucky is proud of the Pikeville Independent Schools system, and I congratulate the many men and women who work there for their service. I wish them the very best as they embark on a new century of representing the very best of Kentucky public education.                          ____________________
