 President, I, along with my colleague, Senator Kerrey, encourage all Senators now who have amendments that we might be able to clear and agree on between us, that they come down here and discuss them with Senator Kerrey and me, because we are working off of a list. We have already worked four or five off in the last 30 minutes. Perhaps we can, if they will come on over--it is just a few minutes after 12--in the next hour or two we can perhaps work 8 or 10 off this list. I think it would be helpful and constructive, and we would be moving forward on this bill.
