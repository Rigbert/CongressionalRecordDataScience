Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Davis), one of the members of the Committee on House Administration who, as a freshman, was the Democratic leader with the Republican leader that worked together on election reform. He has been one of the most tenacious and effective advocates of meaningful election reform.
