It used to be crystal clear. In 23 debates we heard Republican candidates say, one after another after another: First day in office ObamaCare is gone. But I heard the same thing the Senator did, and I have tried to understand it.  I do give Governor Romney some credence in this regard. I have said, when asked, he is the baby daddy of ObamaCare because it was Governor Romney who created the first version of ObamaCare in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and he understood--I hope the Senator from Iowa can help me to understand, and those listening--he understood the concept of insurance. If everyone who bought an insurance policy wrecked their car or got sick the next day, insurance would not work. The only way it works is most people are safe drivers. They buy insurance and a small percentage use it. So there is a pool of money collected from premiums creating a reserve for accidents.  Here we have a situation where Governor Romney has agreed with us--I commend him--that people with preexisting conditions when it comes to health care should not be discriminated against. But the Senator from Iowa, as chair of the committee that dealt with ObamaCare, knows what adverse selection means. It means if people wait until they are sick to buy health insurance the whole system falls apart. So in Massachusetts they required everybody to buy health insurance.
