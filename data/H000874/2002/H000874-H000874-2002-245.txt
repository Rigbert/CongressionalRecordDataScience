Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I know the two commissioners and I have a lot of dealings with the FEC, but they must have had a very quick reading. The fact of the matter is section 441(b) of the Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits what they assert the bill allows, and the transition rule to which they refer does not affect this provision. So that I fear what has happened is they have analyzed the transition provision without analyzing existing law which is not changed, which prohibits that which the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) and others have asserted would happen.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Barrett) and apologize for not having more time to yield.
