Mr. Speaker, millions of dollars for a partisan investigation into campaign finance abuses, millions of dollars for an investigation intended to intimidate organized labor, hundreds of thousands of dollars to harass and intimidate a Hispanic woman Member of Congress.  It is not right, it is not fair, it is a shame and a disgrace. Defeat the previous question and defeat this rule.
