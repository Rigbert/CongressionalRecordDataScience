President, as I noted earlier when the majority leader offered this amendment, I support the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and other youth organizations. The Frist amendment seeks to ensure that government resources are not arbitrarily denied to youth organizations, while, at the same time, not limiting judicial review of the constitutionality of government actions.  I want to thank the distinguished majority leader for working with me to address my concerns regarding section 2, in which his amendment had provided a guaranteed funding level for youth organizations.  Together, we now have added flexibility to address cases where youth organizations no longer deserve the funding level they had previously received. For example, if a youth organization is convicted of a criminal offense or a senior officer of a youth organization is convicted of a criminal offense relatingto his or her official duties, under this modification, the head of a Federal agency would be able to waive the guaranteed funding level. Federal agencies also would have the ability to waive this funding level if the youth organization is the subject of a criminal investigation relating to fraudulent use or waste of Federal funds. It is my expectation that Federal agencies will use ths discretion wisely.  Our modification also clarifies that the support that a Federal agency is required to provide youth organizations is subject to the availability of appropriations, which Congress can revisit each year.  I also want to take this opportunity to reaffirm the importance of our Nation's strong tradition of religious liberty, our tolerance of the religious beliefs of all people, and our respect for those who do not believe in God or a higher authority. This amendment respects the significance of religious liberty by not limiting the jurisdiction of Federal courts in determining the constitutionality of government support for youth organizations.  Therefore, I support this amendment, as modified.
