 President, I would like to engage my good friend, the Senator from Iowa and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations in a colloquy.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend my good friend on his strong support for the education andtraining of America's workers. As you know, I serve as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety. The Senator and I have worked together on many initiatives on behalf of our workforce. That is why I would like to clarify certain provisions contained in the bill before us today that pertain to job training for U.S. workers.  First, is it the Senator's understanding that the additional funding provided through the Workforce Investment Act formula grants for adults and dislocated workers will be used predominantly for the direct delivery of services to those who are the most heavily impacted by this recession--the unemployed and the underemployed?
