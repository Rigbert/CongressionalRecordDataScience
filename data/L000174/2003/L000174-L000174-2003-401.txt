President, I rise today with Senator Hatch to introduce legislation to reauthorize and improve the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, and to extend the authorization of the Missing Children's Assistance Act. We would extend both laws through 2008. This bill follows in the footsteps of the recently enacted PROTECT Act legislation, and presents another milestone in our efforts to safeguard all of our children.  In the 29 years since it became law, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act has helped some of the most vulnerable children in our country. A Justice Department report released last year estimated that 1.7 million young people either ran away from home or were thrown out of their home in 1999. Other studies have suggested an even higher number. This law and the programs it funds provide a safety net that helps give these young people a chance to build lives for themselves. It is slated to expire at the end of this fiscal year, and Congress should not allow that to happen.  Under the Act, ever State receives a Basic Center grant of at least $100,000 to provide housing and crisis services for runaway and homeless youth and their families. Community-based groups around the country can also apply for funding through the Transitional Living Program, TLP, and the Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach grant program. TLP grants are used to provide longer-term housing to homeless youth between the ages of 16 and 21, and to help them become self-sufficient. The Outreach grants are used to target youth who have engaged in or are at risk of engaging in high-risk behaviors while living on the street.  In my State, the Vermont Coalition for Runaway and Homeless Youth and Spectrum Youth and Family Services in Burlington receive grants under these programs and have provided excellent services both to young people trying to build lives on their own and to those who are struggling on the streets. Reauthorizing this law will allow them to continue their enormously important work.  This bill would improve the TLP by extending the period during which older homeless youth can receive services, to ensure that all homeless youth can take advantage of TLP services at least until they turn 18. It would also amend the grant allocation formula to allow between 45 and 55 percent of funding to be used for TLP services, an increase from the current statutory maximum of 30 percent. In practice, TLP services have proven so critical that the appropriations committees already allocate 45 percent of the fund to TLPs, and this change will bring the authorizing statute in line with reality.  The bill would also make permanent the Secretary of Health and Human Services' authority to make grants explicitly to help rural areas meet the unique stresses of providing services to runaway and homeless youth. Programs serving runaway and homeless youth have found that those in rural areas are particularly difficult to reach and serve effectively, and this bill recognizes that fact.  In addition, we take steps in this bill to ensure that runaway and homeless youth are aware of the educational opportunities available to them, and to increase coordination between HHS and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The improvements proposed in this bill to the Missing Children's Assistance Act build on provisions included in the PROTECT Act legislation that we enacted earlier this year. In that bill, we authorized National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, ``NCMEC'', activities through 2005 and authorized the Center to strengthen its CyberTipline to provide online users an effective means of reporting Internet-related child sexual exploitation in distribution of child pornography, online enticement of children for sexual acts, and child prostitution. The legislation we introduce today would extend NCMEC through 2008. Now more than ever, it is critical for Congress to give the Center the resources it needs in order to pursue its important work. A missing or abducted child is the worst nightmare of any parent or grandparent, and NCMEC has proved to be an invaluable resource in Federal, State, and local efforts to recover children who have disappeared.  Although this is a very good bill on the whole, I am disappointed that Senator Hatch did not agree to remove a provision that was included in the House bill that prohibits grantees from using any funds provided under this program for needle distribution programs. This is a superfluous provision that simply repeats what is already law. In addition, it is unnecessary because no grantee under this program operates needle exchange programs or has expressed interest in doing so. The inclusion of this needless provision, however, does not change the fact that this is still a good bill.  These programs have received tremendous bipartisan support over the years, and the House has already passed this bill by a vote of 404-14. The Senate should consider this bill as promptly as possible.                                 ______                                       By
