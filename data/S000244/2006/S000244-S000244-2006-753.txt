Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I include at this point in the Record a section-by-section analysis of H.R. 4472.

Mr. Speaker, when I was first elected to the Wisconsin legislature in 1968, one of my mentors warned me against making the perfect the enemy of the good, because if the perfect ends up defeating the good, then bad will prevail.  What we have heard from the opponents of this motion to suspend the rules is that the bill is a good one, but it doesn't do enough, and we ought to add this and this and this and this. But we tried that last year. We passed the core bills of three separate components of this bill, and they ended up getting stuck in the other side of the Capitol Building.  Honestly, our children, our judges, and all Americans can't afford to wait any longer. The gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Pomeroy), I think, summed it up perfectly, that is, that the victims and their families cannot afford to wait any longer because of parliamentary objections to this, that and everything else.  Now, let us look at what this bill does. It allows a national registration of sex offenders so that we can get the over 100,000 convicted sex offenders who slipped through the registration cracks on the Internet so that people will know if they are in their neighborhood. If you defeat this bill, that is not going to happen.  This bill also prevents the sale of date-rape drugs over the Internet. If you defeat this bill, that is not going to happen.  The bill has a number of provisions to protect Federal judges and their families and courthouse personnel and buildings so that we don't have the tragedy that happened to Judge Lefkos in Chicago when two members of her family were murdered. You defeat this bill, our judges are going to be vulnerable.  Practically every community of over a quarter of a million in this country has faced the scourge of gangs. There is comprehensive gang law in this bill that will help our law enforcement get to the ringleaders of these gangs and to arrest them and throw them into jail. That is going to make all of us safer. You defeat this bill, and that is not going to happen.  I want to see a law made, and those who have spoken in support of this motion to suspend the rules want to see this bill become law as quickly as possible. We have a commitment from the majority leader on the other side of the Capitol, if this bill passes today, to schedule it quickly. In the name of our children and all Americans, vote to suspend the rules.                                         House of Representatives,         Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, March 7,                                                          2006.     Hon. Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon,     Chairman, Committee on Education and Workforce, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman McKeon: I am writing to confirm our mutual      understanding regarding H.R. 4472, the ``Children's Safety      and Violent Crime Reduction Act of 2005,'' which is scheduled      for consideration on the House floor on Wednesday, March 8,      2006. I agree that Title XI of the manager's amendment      implicates the jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and      Workforce, and appreciate your willingness to forego      consideration in order to facilitate floor consideration of      this legislation. I agree that your decision to waive      consideration of the bill should not be construed to limit      the jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and Workforce      over H.R. 4472 or similar legislation, or otherwise prejudice      your Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees      to this or similar legislation.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2006.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to confirm our mutual      understanding with respect to the consideration of H.R. 4472,      the Children's Safety and Violent Crime Reduction Act of      2005. Title XI of the manager's amendment to be considered      under the suspension of the rules, contains the CHILDHELP      National Registry Act and is within the jurisdiction of the      Committee on Education and the Workforce.       Given the importance of this legislation and your      willingness to work with me in drafting the final language of      Title XI, I will support the inclusion of this provision in      the manager's amendment without consideration by my      committee. However, I do so only with the understanding that      this procedural route should not be construed to prejudice      the Committee on Education and the Workforce's jurisdictional      interest and prerogatives on these provisions or any other      similar legislation and will not be considered as precedent      for consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to my      committee in the future. Furthermore, should these or similar      provisions be considered in a conference with the Senate, I      would expect members of the Committee on Education and the      Workforce be appointed to the conference committee on these      provisions.       Finally, I would ask that you include a copy of our      exchange of letters in the Congressional Record during the      consideration of this bill. If you have any questions      regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to call me. I      thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                        Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon,     Chairman.                                  ____                                          House of Representatives                                  Committee on Ways and Means,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2006.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: I am writing concerning H.R.      4472, the ``Children's Safety and Violent Crime Reduction Act      of 2005,'' which is scheduled for floor action on Wednesday,      March 8, 2006.       As you know, the Committee on Ways and Means has      jurisdiction over matters concerning certain child welfare      programs, particularly as they pertain to foster care and      adoption. Section 501 of the bill would require States to      conduct safety checks of would-be foster and adoptive homes      as well as eliminate the ability of States to opt-out of      Federal background check requirements restricting Federal      support for children placed with foster or adoptive parents      with serious criminal histories. Section 502 would require      States to check child abuse registries for potential foster      and adoptive parents. Thus these provisions fall within the      jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. However, in      order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the      Committee will forgo action. This is being done with the      understanding that it does not in any way prejudice the      Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or its      jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar      legislation.       I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming      this understanding with respect to H.R. 4472, and would ask      that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be      included in the Congressional Record during floor      consideration.           Best regards,                                                      Bill Thomas,     Chairman.                                  ____                                          House of Representatives                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2006.     Hon. Bill Thomas,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Thomas:        I am writing to confirm our mutual understanding regarding      H.R. 4472, the ``Children's Safety and Violent Crime      Reduction Act of 2005,'' which is scheduled for consideration      on the House floor on Wednesday, March 8,     2006. I agree that sections 501 and 502 implicate the      jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means, and      appreciate your willingness to forego consideration in order      to facilitate floor consideration of this legislation. I      agree that your decision to waive consideration of the bill      should not be construed to limit the jurisdiction of the      Committee on Ways and Means over H.R. 4472 or similar      legislation, or otherwise prejudice your Committee with      respect to the appointment of conferees to this or similar      legislation.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,                                                         Chairman.
