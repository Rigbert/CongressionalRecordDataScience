President, I am very pleased to join with my Senate colleagues from Vermont and New York as we introduce the Lake Champlain Heritage Act of 2002. With this legislation, we will take an important step in recognizing the importance of the Lake Champlain Valley in the history of America.  I want to thank Senator Jeffords and his staff for all the work they have put into this effort. I know that many hours have gone into the research, discussion and editing to get where we are today. I also want to thank Senators Clinton and Schumer who are our valuable New York partners in all things related to Lake Champlain.  Over the July 4th recess, I was able to participate in the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum's opening of a new exhibit featuring artifacts recovered from the 1776 Revolutionary War Battle of Valcour. It was just 1 year ago that Senator Clinton and I were at the site of the Battle to take part in the recovery and beginning of the conservation process of those artifacts.  The Valcour Bay Research Project followed the 1997 discovery of the missing American gunboat from the Battle. I bring this up because our purpose today as we introduce this legislation underscores to the rest of our Nation a message we Vermonters and New Yorkers have long proclaimed: the role of Lake Champlain in the cause of American independence cannot be overlooked.  The evidence of the struggle for this strategic waterway from the days of Native American excursions, through the colonial rivalry between Britain and France, our War of Independence, until the end of the War of 1812, constantly surrounds those of us who make our homes in this Valley.  This act is intended to advance the cultural heritage goals of ``Opportunities for Action,'' the comprehensive plan developed under the Lake Champlain Special Designation Act by the Lake Champlain Basin Program with broad public input and support as well as with the involvement of local, State and Federal Governments.  We envision activities such as locally planned and managed heritage networks and programs, a management strategy for the Lake's underwater cultural resources and strengthening the links between cultural resources and economic development. This legislation will also help provide assistance as the 400th anniversary of Samuel De Champlain's arrival in the Valley is commemorated in 2009.  Today, we are taking a significant step in helping all Americans better appreciate the full history of the Lake Champlain Valley which holds such an extensive collection of historic sites and artifacts.  As Vermonters and New Yorkers the stewards of Lake Champlain, we have a serious responsibility to conserve this evidence for future generations. We believe that what we do here, how we manage the cultural heritage of the Valley, can contribute to the growing debate on how present generations can live and prosper on the same ground that we conserve as our natural and cultural heritage.  Our Vermont and New York Champlain Valley communities share this heritage and have helped us develop a vision to enhance the conservation, interpretation and enjoyment of our shared history and to make it more readily available to residents and visitors alike. We can help revitalize local economies and promote heritage tourism as we improve the stewardship of the Valley's cultural legacy by making additional resources available to communities and organizations through the Lake Champlain Basin Program.  I think it is most fitting that we have come here together to introduce this long-awaited bill, reasserting our partnership for Lake Champlain: Vermont and New York engaged in a cooperative effort to conserve, interpret, and honor our common heritage.                                 ______                                       By
