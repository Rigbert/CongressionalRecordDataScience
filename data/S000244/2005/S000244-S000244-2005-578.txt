Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I wish there were time to have committee consideration of this. However, there are certain legislature provisions in the Violence against Women Act that expire on September 30, and, if we keep on talking and talking and talking, you are going to see a good part of the VAWA end up disappearing. That is why we have to deal with this issue today.  I would urge adoption of the manager's amendment to remove the cloud of the constitutional challenge over the money that is to be sent to underserved racial and ethnic minorities.
