 A majority of the Senate has voted repeatedly over the last few weeks to advance legislation that would, if enacted, prohibit the Department from implementing the policies reflected in those memoranda. I and my colleagues in the majority who voted to fund the Department today did so to avoid a shutdown of its operations, many of which are necessary to safeguard our Nation. In voting to fund the Department, we were also mindful of the fact that the policies and directives that are embodied in these memoranda, and to which we object, are the subject of a preliminary injunction issued by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which is preventing the Department from implementing them.                          ____________________
