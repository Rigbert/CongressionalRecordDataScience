Leader, there has been a lot of discussion, and I have read some things in the newspaper and heard discussions, about the child tax credit bill which has been pending for some time in conference.  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not there is an intention to move that out of conference; and, if so, what condition will it be in in terms of what will there be in the bill, if the gentleman knows, in addition to the originally passed child tax credit? I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. We have been working to extend the child tax credit, the 10 percent tax bracket, and the marriage penalty tax relief provisions from the 2001 and 2003 tax bills. I would anticipate that the bill, well, I cannot say what else might be in the bill. The conference has yet to be called into a meeting, but in discussions with the other body, it seems to be that most want to keep this bill as simple as possible; and I hope we can find a way to send these tax measures to the President before the August recess.
