That is all, when I go around the State, people are talking about now.  Many different economic studies show gasoline prices rising significantly under this bill. Madam President, $1.50 is just an estimated range. One of the Government EPA studies shows gasoline prices going up by $1.40. Another independent agency study, the independent Energy Information Administration, predicts it will go up by 41 cents a gallon to $1 a gallon by 2030.  As gasoline prices continue to rise and set new record highs every day, this bill would only keep prices rising. The Energy Information Administration study predicts that gasoline prices will increase anywhere from 41 cents per gallon to $1 per gallon by 2030.  We are waiting for a Senator. How much more time on the opposing side do we have at this point?
