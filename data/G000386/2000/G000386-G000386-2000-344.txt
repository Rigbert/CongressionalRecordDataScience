 There are a number of Senators who have expressed a desire to speak with respect to those nominations.  Under a previous order, at 5 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday, the Senate will vote on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 423, the nomination of Julio Fuentes. Senators can, therefore, expect the next vote to occur at 5 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. Votes are expected each day and possibly evening this week as the Senate attempts to finish its business prior to the upcoming adjournment.                          ____________________
