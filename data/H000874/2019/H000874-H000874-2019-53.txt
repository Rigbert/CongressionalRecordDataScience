But that was on the thought that we would rationally get past the only bills we really have to pass, and that is appropriation bills.  By the way, Madam Speaker, the way that should work is we pass a bill, theSenate passes a bill, and, yes, they require 60 votes. Well, what does that mean? It means they have to come to a compromise at a higher number.  We didn't have to do that. We got some Republican votes for some of the bills. But the fact is, we did our business and, frankly, we did it before--it has been done since I have been here--96 percent of the government funded, and we sent them to the Senate.  The Senate has not considered a single one of those bills because they had no stomach for compromise, which was why we are negotiating with Mr. Mnuchin and not the Senate leadership to listen to what, apparently, the President will accept.  I agree with the minority whip that considering the administration's views is important because, of course, we want the bills signed. But we have known for a very long time that the Republicans could not--on this floor--neither Speaker Ryan, nor Speaker Boehner could negotiate with Mr. Mulvaney.  The minority whip knows that, Madam Speaker. As a matter of fact, a lot of the Republicans have talked to me, Madam Speaker, about how difficult Mulvaney is to deal with. But we waited for checkoff, either from Chief of Staff Mulvaney or the President himself. But we waited. Not we in the House, in the Senate.  So I tell my friend, the Senate was not prepared to bring their bills, not our bills, to the floor to try to achieve that bipartisan agreement of which the minority whip speaks. Not a single bill was brought to the floor before the end of the fiscal year.  You are not going to get any kind of an agreement if you don't try to move forward, if you just wait for what Mr. Mulvaney wants us to do.
