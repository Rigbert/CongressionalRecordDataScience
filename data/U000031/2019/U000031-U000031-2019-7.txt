Speaker, here is the beef: Tomorrow marks the third anniversary of the enactment of 21st Century Cures, a bill that passed this House at 392-26. In looking back at that legislation now, 3 years later, we have made wonderful strides in finding the cures for the diseases that have impacted every family, be it cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's and pancreatic cancer, just to name a few.  And just last week, a number of us met with a young girl who had been in a trial for SMA. That is often a fatal disease known as spinal muscular atrophy. She was in a wheelchair, barely able to talk. But after 15 days on this trial, she could actually move her head and her neck for the first time in more than a decade, all really because of what we did on 21st Century Cures.  The CBO/CEA and Scott Gottlieb, in today's ``Wall Street Journal'' writes that H.R. 3, the underlying bill: ``The price-control approach would increase uncertainty and reduce returns from biotech investment, raising the cost of capital for these invaluable endeavors.''  You know, we are on the cusp of gene therapy for deadly inherited diseases like MS, literally, finding cures to solve blindness. But let's not stop. Let's build on what we did.  The language in this motion to recommit assures that cures will not be slowed down, because we have the requirement that unless the Secretary of HHS certifies the implementation of such provisions are not projected to result in fewer new drug applications. That is what this amendment is about.  We want to make sure that we have the resources to develop the cures that all of us want for the thousands of diseases where we don't have a cure.  Mr. Speaker, I would yield to the gentleman from Texas to talk about his personal story, that many of us did not know until this bill came up in the last couple of days.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Wright).
