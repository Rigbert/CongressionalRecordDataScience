Speaker, in concluding this first hour this evening in honor of our dear colleague Stephanie Tubbs Jones, let me just say that Stephanie Tubbs Jones was a true mother of this Republic. Let the record show that. Let the record comfort her son in years hence.  And I want to say to our dear, dear friend and colleague Congressman Regula, whose district sort of held Stephanie's up on the southern side, I want to thank him so very much, the dean of the Republican side of the aisle, for being here throughout this evening and through the wonderful participation of her colleagues of various persuasions here on the floor. The friendships went beyond party, and I thank the gentleman for his participation.
