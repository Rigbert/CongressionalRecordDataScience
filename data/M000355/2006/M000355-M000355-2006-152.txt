 President, we may not see it on the front page, but there is good news. Last Friday, the U.S. Army met its annual recruiting goal more than a week ahead of schedule. This will cap the Army's best recruiting year since 1997.  Let me repeat that. The Army will be completing its best recruiting year in almost a decade--this despite all the gloom and doom we have heard about young people not wanting to serve their country in the war on terror.  On Friday, in New York City, Shirley Salvi, a 23-year-old graduate of Rutgers, joined the Army as the 80,000th soldier to enlist this year. That is 80,000 soldiers this year. She will report to Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri to become either an Army linguist or intelligence analyst.  In spite of all the danger and all the hardship and sacrifice involved, thousands of young Americans, such as Ms. Salvi, are stepping forward to say: I will defend my country.  We have an All-Volunteer Army, and it is the best in the world. While the enemy fights solely to instill fear and death, our soldiers fight for the hope and opportunity that only comes with liberty.  Before the fiscal year is over, the Army anticipates having a total of 504,000 soldiers--an increase of 12,000 from last year. The Army Reserve and Army National Guard also expect to meet their recruiting goals for this year. This increased recruiting comes even as administrators in a number of institutions of higher learning and even some high schools remain openly hostile to military recruiting on campus.  Retention in the Army also shows encouraging signs. In July of this year, GEN Pete Schoomaker, Chief of Staff of the Army, noted that the reenlistment rate for two of the divisions deployed in Iraq was over 140 percent. One of those divisions, I am proud to report, is the 101st Airborne located in my home State of Kentucky.  I think what this good recruiting and retention news reflects is basically three things:  First, it reflects the patriotism and commitment of today's youth. The generation coming of age today has grown up with the war on terror, and they understand its importance. They understand the need to defend America's values. They understand what is at stake, and they want to do their part by volunteering to protect the Nation from al-Qaida and others who would do this Nation harm.  Second, I think this good Army recruiting news reflects the recognition by today's youth that a career in the military is, indeed, a noble calling. In fact, it is hard to think of anything more honorable than serving and protecting America.  Third, the achievement of the Army's recruiting goal a week early sends a strong signal to our allies and our enemies in the war on terror. It shows that the American people are resolute in defending our Nation and in defending freedom.  I must say, I take some pride in this good news about recent recruiting numbers since the U.S. Army recruiting command is located at another base in my State, Fort Knox. The command is doing a great job for America.  I salute Ms. Salvi and the thousands of other volunteers like her who have joined the Army this year. I thank them for their patriotism and for their future service on behalf of our country.                          ____________________[Page S10052]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            ARMY RECRUITING  Mr. McCONNELL.
