Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New York, my friend, has gotten carried away in referring to this bill as the 21st century version of the Fugitive Slave Act. First of all, let it be plain. This bill only involves a minor crossing State lines in order to evade a parental involvement statute. Nobody over the age of 18 is caught in by this bill whatsoever.  Secondly, since Roe v. Wade, abortion has been legal in every State in the country, so it is not a way to shut off access to abortions in any State. That has been settled law since Roe v. Wade. But the Supreme Court has also said that as long as there is a judicial bypass, parental involvement statutes are legal. So what is wrong with keeping the parents involved when a decision is made to give an abortion to a minor when the parents, by law, have to be involved when a doctor treats that minor for a hang-nail?  Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).
