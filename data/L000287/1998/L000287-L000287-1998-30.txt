Mr. Speaker, I was deeply saddened and chagrined to read in the paper the remarks of our colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the Majority Whip, regarding slavery and the President's remark on the subject.  According to my colleague, and I quote, ``Here is a flower child with gray hair doing exactly what he did back in the '60s. He is apologizing for the actions of the U.S.'' While there is nothing wrong with apologizing, that is not what the President did.  What President Clinton did on his recent trip to Africa was express his regret over slavery. He said slavery was wrong, something we should all be able to agree on. At a time when the President and others are trying to nurture racial healing and reconciliation, it is unfortunate that there are those who would use the issue of race as a wedge to divide us.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) owes this House, the American people, and the President an explanation and an apology. He has said that the President cannot tell the truth about his mistakes and own up to them.  Mr. Delay should admit his own error of judgment and apologize.                          ____________________
