 Now, having said that, we didn't pursue the regular order on the Labor-Health bill. The gentleman is correct there are five bills which have passed, and I would reiterate that I have not yet, from my standpoint, concluded that we're not going to consider appropriation bills on the floor this year.  So I want to make it clear. I'm not sure exactly what Mr. Obey announced. There was an article that said I was supporting Mr. Obey's position. I went a little further. What I supported of Mr. Obey's position was that regular order was not being followed in the appropriations committee, not the representation that you say he made with reference to no bills coming to the floor.  I think he's correct that regular order is not being pursued, and very frankly--and I'm going to talk to you about that, talk to my friend about this, because I think it is unfortunate that we have come to this place where the consideration of these bills last year became very politicized, and this year the announcement clearly was very early on out of your conference or your retreat and subsequently that it wasn't going to be a very happy process this year. I don't mean an agreement process. No reason why there should be an agreement. But Mr. Obey has concerns that it would simply be impossible for him to get the bills through.
