 President, let me commend the Senator from Florida and the occupant of the chair for their extraordinary leadership on this difficult issue the Senate has been wrestling with for the last couple of weeks. I join the Senator from Florida and the occupant of the chair, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, in hoping that this issue will come back before the Senate and we will be able to deal with it in a comprehensive manner sometime in the very near future.                          ____________________
