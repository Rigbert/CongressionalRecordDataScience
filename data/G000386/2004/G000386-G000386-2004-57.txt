 President, I rise today in honor of a fellow Iowan and a dedicated serviceman, Sergeant Joshua J. Skvor, of Cedar Rapids, IA. It is my sad duty to inform the Senate that Sgt. Skvor, a member of the Iowa National Guard, lost his life when the truck he was driving was involved in a collision with another vehicle north of Amana, IA. My deepest sympathy goes out to his family and friends. Sgt. Skvor was assigned to the Iowa Army National Guard's Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 234th Signal Battalion, stationed in Cedar Rapids. He is survived by his mother and father, Rachel and Joseph Skvor. They can be very proud of their son.  Though not currently serving on Federal active duty, Sgt. Skvor had recently returned from a 14-month deployment in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. As we mourn his tragic loss, it is fitting that we pay tribute to his service to his country. He will be missed by his fellow soldiers as well as all those who knew him.                          ____________________
