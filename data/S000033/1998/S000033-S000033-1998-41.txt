 Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for his perceptive remarks. He is right on the money, and I would again reiterate that since 1974 the Federal Government has put in over $15 billion in fossil energy research while we are shortchanging rural America.  According to the CBO, the beneficiaries of the Petroleum Research and Development program are some of the largest multinational corporations in the world, including Exxon, Chevron, Conoco, Texaco, Amoco, Phillips Petroleum, etc., shortchanging rural America, providing corporate welfare for large corporations that do not need it.
