Speaker, I thank the majority leader for yielding. We are now getting down to a time when, of course, the fiscal year ends on Monday at 12 midnight. I would hope the majority party, along with the leadership in the minority party, is considering the contingency to ensure the operations of Government for Monday and Tuesday, maybe only 48 hours or 72 hours.  I know; I have been in some of these negotiations. They are tough. Everybody has an opinion. I think everybody is working honestly and hard to try to get to resolution. I would hope that we are providing for the contingency that for whatever reasons we do not get to closure prior to midnight on Monday.
