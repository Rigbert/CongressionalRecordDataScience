 President, as every one of our colleagues knows, so much of what we do depends on the hard work and commitment of the dedicated staffers who toil behind the scenes on behalf of us and the constituents we represent. I wish to take a few minutes to recognize a member of my own staff who has been with me for many years, through good times and bad, and whose work ethic, competence, intelligence, and passion for public service is truly deserving of admiration and recognition as she now moves on to a new job, after more than 10 years of service in my office.  Alex Glass came to work for me on April 2, 2001. We hired her on as the deputy press secretary. She had graduated from Bryn Mawr the year before and had gone to work for the Gore for President campaign before joining my staff. Alex was similar to many young people who make their way to our Nation's Capitol after college. She was passionate about public service, wanted to make a difference, and cared deeply about her country and the serious issues we faced.  From the start, I knew Alex was a strong addition to my team. But just a few months later, it became clear to me she was much more. It was a Tuesday morning. We were right here in the Nation's Capitol. My communications director happened to be traveling that week. So even though Alex had just joined my staff, she was my only press staffer here that day.  As we all remember, a little bit after 9 a.m., we got word in the Capitol that planes had struck the World Trade Center. Shortly after that, I looked out the window of the Capitol and saw black clouds of smoke filling the sky above the Pentagon. It was September 11, 2001, a day of unspeakable tragedy and devastating loss for our Nation. For those of us here in Washington, DC, and those in New York, and for families across America, it was a day of great confusion, uncertainty, and fear.  On that day, Alex stepped up for me, she stepped up for our office, and she stepped up for our constituents. Alex felt the same way every one of us did that day. But right away, she realized families in my home State of Washington were going to want to hear from their elected official in this time of national crisis. She was calm, she was collected, and she was already thinking ahead to what we were going to need to do that day.  So before we even evacuated, she quickly scribbled down the phone numbers of the major press outlets in Washington State, and then throughout that dark day and into the night, Alex and I stayed together and, through our State's press, I was able to reach out to families who were desperate for news and who needed to know that, despite this tragedy, their government remained strong. That day, I knew what Alex was made of, and I saw that spirit and dedication again and again over the next 10 years because Alex always knew what this job was all about--it was about helping people and solving problems.  I remember so many times I was in the room with my staff, where we were discussing one issue or another. Every once in a while, we would hear a soft voice from the chair to my left--Alex only talks when she has something to say--and in the clearest and most concise way, she would help bring our discussion from the theoretical to the practical: How does this affect families in our State? How will these policies help the people I was sent to represent? These were the questions that were always on Alex's mind because she knew those were the most important questions to me.  So many times over the years I would wake and check my e-mail and see an article Alex had forwarded to me--stories about veterans who weren't getting the care they deserved, workers who couldn't find a job or families falling through the cracks. She didn't include a comment with those stories. She knew she didn't have to. She just passed them along because she knew I would want to see them. She understood it was those people, the ones in those stories, whom I came to DC to fight for. Alex isn't from Washington State, but she dove into her adopted State with gusto, and within a few months she knew more about the issues facing our local communities than most people from Washington.  I remember one time--and I never thought I would tell this story out loud--Alex and I were in Port Angeles, and someone thought it would be a good idea for us to travel in a helicopter to our next event. It may havebeen a good idea, but Alex and I--5 feet tall, both of us--had to put on these huge bright orange flight suits that were made for someone much bigger than either of us. I just remember catching her eye and we started laughing at each other and at ourselves. She and I had so many moments such as that together because Alex is very serious about her work, but she doesn't take herself seriously. She is much fun to be around, and she has a fantastic sense of humor, which is good for me because I don't think there is anyone I have spent more time with in my car traveling around Washington State than Alex.  On a particularly stressful or long day on the road, Alex always made sure we had cookies in the car, which I very much appreciated. Once, during a busier day than usual, I remember Alex and I having a conversation about all the fun places we had to pass by in the car as we drove to the next events but never had time to stop and visit.  We resolved to find the time to visit some of those when things got a bit slower, and I haven't forgotten about that. One day Alex and I are going to visit that alpaca farm up in Skagit Valley.  Alex also knew there was nothing I liked more than doing events where I could wear my jeans and tennis shoes, and I know she fought hard to make sure that happened as often as possible; and, Alex, I appreciate that.  Alex always had my back. She was always ready to get done what needed to get done. Back in 2004, I was facing a tough reelection campaign in my State. Alex had a life here in DC, but I went to her and I asked her to move back to the State to help me. I wanted her there, not because she is just good at her job and knows my voice so well--though she certainly is and does--but because she shares values, and I had every confidence that she would know exactly how I would want to tell my story and get my message out to the people in Washington. And Alex, without blinking, said yes. She packed up her bags and boxed up her apartment, she put her pet bunny in the car--I think this may be one of the most well-traveled rabbits in all of America--and she drove all the way across the country to fight by my side in Washington State. I don't know if I could have done it without her.  Alex then, after that election, came back here to DC and spent 6 years as my communication director. Then she did it all over again--uprooting her life, packing up that bunny, and driving all across the State when I needed her out in Washington State again last year. After she finished that job, I asked Alex to come back here to Washington, DC, to serve as my senior adviser and provide me with counsel and advice as I took on new challenges, and I was grateful when she accepted and got to work.  But 10\1/2\ years after Alex Glass first started working for me, the moment came that I knew was always going to come but never looked forward to. Alex knocked on the door of my office and walked in, and before she could say a word I knew exactly what she had come to tell me. I gave her a hug. We talked. There may have been a few tears shed. But I always knew that Alex has the skills, the talent, and the experience to do absolutely anything she wants to do, and I am proud that she has chosen to continue working in public service and has accepted a job at USAID.  Although she is moving on, her amazing work and strong influence in my office will continue. Her words and her ideas have helped shape so much of what I have done and how I have communicated with my constituents. I can't tell you how many Washington State reporters have come over to me to thank me. They told me how helpful Alex was, how responsive and how good she was at connecting the policy debates here in Congress to the struggles of families and communities in our State.  Alex didn't just keep this to herself. She helped build and mentor a strong team in my office that knows what we are trying to do and understands my voice and how I want to communicate with the people I represent.  I have had many members of my staff come and go in my time here in the Senate. Many of them have been outstanding. Every one of them has added value and done good work for me and my constituents. But there are very few I have come as close to as I have to Alex.  Over the last 10 years, Alex, you have been like a member of my family, truly like a daughter to me. You have gone to the mat time and time again for me. You have been through thick and thin with us. You have sacrificed so much for me and my office, and I can't express enough how deeply I appreciate it. I know there is nothing you wouldn't do for me, and I hope you know I feel the same way about you. So on behalf of everyone in my office, all the constituents I represent, I want to thank you for the years of service to Washington State and to the Nation. You have been my voice, my adviser, my confidante and, most importantly, my friend. It has meant so much to me. And although I know it will continue, you aren't going away very far, I am going to miss seeing you in the office and hearing your voice almost every day.  So, Alex, as you start this exciting new chapter in your professional life, remember what Rob and I would say to you when times got tough out in the State: Shoulders up. Shoulders up. You have helped me keep mine up for more than 10 years, and I wish you luck now as you tackle your next challenge with the same heart, gusto, and good humor that you brought to our office every day.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
