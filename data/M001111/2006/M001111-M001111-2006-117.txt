 President, I believe the Senator from New Jersey just wants to call up his amendment and speak for a few minutes, if I am not incorrect.  I say to the Senator from New Jersey, if you could just tell us--I believe it has been shared on both sides.  I say to the Senator from Maine, I know your staff has a copy of it.  But if the Senator could just explain his intentions.
