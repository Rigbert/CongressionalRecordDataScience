Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, Senate Joint Resolution 13 confers honorary U.S. citizenship on the Marquis de Lafayette in recognition of his many contributions to and sacrifices for the cause of American independence and his lifelong crusade for the principles of representative government.  American citizenship is the highest honor that we as a country can confer upon the citizen of another country. The granting of honorary citizenship is the admission and welcoming of that person into our national family.                              {time}  1430  The granting of honorary U.S. citizenship has only been given to individuals four times in our history.  The Marquis de Lafayette's role in the fight for this country's freedom justifies adding the Marquis to this select group of individuals.  This resolution acknowledges the many efforts made by the Marquis de Lafayette that are the basis for granting him honorary United States citizenship.  Although the Marquis de Lafayette was granted citizenship by Maryland and Virginia before the Constitution was adopted, it has been determined that citizenship conferred by those States did not confer U.S. citizenship on the Marquis.  Because of the many ways in which the Marquis played a major role in the creation of our great Nation, it is appropriate to bestow the rare distinction of honorary U.S. citizenship upon the Marquis de Lafayette.  No other foreign national involved in this country's independence contributed so much to the cause. The Marquis de Lafayette certainly deserves this tribute for his role in creating a free America.  Unfortunately, the resolution passed by the Senate states the Marquis's name incorrectly. This motion that I have made amends the joint resolution to grant honorary citizenship to the real Marquis de Lafayette and, thus, the resolution must go back to the other body for its consideration. I hope that the other body will move quickly and not cause any further delay in granting this much overdue honor to the Marquis de Lafayette. I urge the House to pass this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
