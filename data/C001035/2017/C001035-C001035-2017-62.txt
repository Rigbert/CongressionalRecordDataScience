President, I would like to express the sentiments of all of us who were stunned and saddened to learn first thing this morning of the attack on our colleagues and their staff on the House side as they practiced for the Republican team for the annual Congressional Baseball Game.  Senator Rand Paul, who was present, told us at lunch about what happened. He emphasized time and again the absolutely heroic behavior, the extraordinary bravery of the Capitol police officers who were part of Representative Scalise's detail. He said that, without these two police officers, he has no doubt that many more people would have been injured and likely killed.  So I think it is important for us to pause and express our gratitude to the men and women of the Capitol Police Force, and, indeed, to the first responders and law enforcement officers everywhere, who, day after day, put their lives on the line for our country. Without their help today, the terrible attack would have been far, far worse. So I thank them.
