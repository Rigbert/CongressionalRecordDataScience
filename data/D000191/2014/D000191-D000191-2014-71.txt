The gentleman is wrong. The Bush-Cheney energy act preempted the States--preempted the State authority. It gives a faceless, nameless Federal bureaucracy, which on every other day is opposed by the other side of the aisle, the authority to grant eminent domain for a private company, for private profit, for the export of natural gas, which may well drive up the gas prices of the property owners adjacent to or who have been penetrated by that line.  This amendment doesn't delay anything. It doesn't give any significant new authority. It just requires the simple disclosure that if this terminal is built, a new pipeline is going to be required, and that pipeline, under section 3, with the faceless, nameless Federal bureaucrats behind it, is going to be granted eminent domain authority to take people's property. That is the bottom line. You can try and dance around it and say, well, I am against Kelo because that was another kind of development, but no, I am against this amendment because we wouldn't want people to know that they were going to lose their property rights to eminent domain because of faceless, nameless Federal bureaucrats.  I yield back the balance of my time.
