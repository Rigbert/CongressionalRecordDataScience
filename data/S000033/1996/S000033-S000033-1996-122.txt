 Speaker, all over this country, family farms have been disappearing in great numbers as a result of the failure of our current agricultural policy. In Vermont, in 1977, we had 3,300 farms. Today we have less than 2,000. All over the country this is happening. This is an American tragedy.  In 1989, some people in New England got together to figure out how we could save the family farm in our region, and they came up with a concept called the Northeast Dairy Compact. This compact could provide dairy farmers in New England finally with a fair price for their product, a fair price which they are not getting today. It is an opportunity to save the family farm. All six legislatures in New England overwhelmingly approved the compact; all six Governors, liberal and conservatives, approved the compact.  Mr. Speaker, originally when we voted on the bill, the compact was not in the farm bill, but today it is in the farm bill as a result of the work the conferees did. Mr. Speaker, the Northeast Dairy Compact could become a model for farms all over this country for regions all over this country. It is good for New England. It is good for America.  There is a lot in this bill that I do not support, but I certainly fervently support the Northeast Dairy Compact section.
