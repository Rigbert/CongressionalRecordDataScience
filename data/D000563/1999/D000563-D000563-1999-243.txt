 The fact of the matter is, I managed to complete college because of the National Defense of Education Act, a bill passed by Congress, signed by President Eisenhower, that allowed me as a student from a working family to borrow money from the Federal Government to pay my college education and pay it back over 10 years at 3 percent interest. What a deal. I would sign up for it again.  I hope those who were supporting it and reflecting on it believe that investment in this kid from East St. Louis and a lot of other children like me paid off for the country in the long haul.  I think President Eisenhower and Congress were correct in calling this the national defense. When you talk about the national defense of America, I think it has a lot more to do with the people who live here than the hardware we purchase. The investment in education is such an investment. Think back to the turn of the century. If you had to go back 100 years and ask, Will America be a dominant country in the 21st century, most would guess no because in the 19th century we were a minor power.  The European powers captured the attention of the world. We made some threshold decisions at the turn of the century that made a difference. I love this statistic: Between 1890 and 1920, on average, we built one new high school every day in America. For 30 years, a new high school was built every day in towns across the country--no Federal mandate, just the understanding that if you had a town that was worth its salt, it would have a high school. High school wasn't just for rich kids; high school was for all kids. The kids of immigrants, the kids of farmers, and the kids of small business people all went to school together in a public school system.  What happened? We went from 6 percent of 17-year-olds graduating high school in 1900 to 1930, 30 percent, and today, over 75 percent. Make no mistake, that commitment by America to education, which created high schools, which were then called ``people's colleges'' because this was a chance for education beyond the eighth grade for just average kids, led to college education and a dramatic increase in the number of scientists, engineers, and doctors. It took America from Kitty Hawk to the space program.  The obvious question is, Do we have the same commitment to education in the future that the leaders in the 19th century, looking to the 20th century, had? I don't hear it as I listen to the debate in the Congress. I don't hear men and women of vision standing upand saying in the 21st century our kids will have the same opportunities.  There are some things we have to commit ourselves to as a nation. That isn't being done here. Instead, we languish in this debate, lost in the minutiae about local control and forgetting the big picture. The American people expect Congress to understand the challenges our Nation faces for the next century. It is not reflected in the debate on the budget or in the appropriations bills.  We have talked about school modernization, we talked about smaller classroom sizes in K through 4. Let me discuss another critically important topic: Quality teachers, men and women who will become professional teachers who are good at it--not to take what is left over from college or high school, but to take the very best and brightest and put them in a classroom to spark in each kid that feeling of creativity and learning which those who are blessed to have such teachers have experienced. Yet we don't have that commitment.  The President has said: Invest in teachers. Make sure they have a chance to have their skills improved. Hold them accountable for what they do in a classroom. But make sure to bring these young men and women into the teaching profession.  We can turn on the television almost any night and see the exposes about education in America where, unfortunately, some people are in classrooms and they shouldn't be there. The vast majority of teachers are good, hard-working men and women. We can help them improve their skills and keep those who are not good out of the classroom with a commitment in Washington that we just haven't seen during the course of this year.  The last point I will make is on afterschool programs. I have been mystified by the fact we are still caught up in a mindset that is, frankly, old fashioned, a mindset that says children start school at the age of 6 and school lets out at 2:30 or 3:00 in the afternoon and we take 3 months off in the summer. This might have made sense at some point in time. It doesn't make sense in today's America. Six years of age is a good age to put a child in a classroom, but 5 is better; 4 may even be better. There might even be learning experiences for those younger who are now in a day-care setting.  Ask any teacher, if they could add a year in education, where would they add it. It isn't at the end of 12th grade but at the beginning, kindergarten or before. The teachers say: Give me a chance to mold that child before they come into the classroom, and I will show you a better person and a better student.  Yet our commitment to preschool programs, our commitment to programs for the earliest ages, just isn't there. We ignore it. We act as if it isn't a reality. We know it is. A younger child in a learning situation is a child more likely to be a good student.  Classrooms adjourning each day at 2:30 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon made sense when Ozzie and Harriet were at home with milk and cookies waiting for the kids, but not in today's America. More parents are working; kids are going home to empty houses and getting in trouble after school.  One might ask, Why doesn't the schoolday reflect the family day where parents might get home at 5:30, 6 o'clock, or after? Some schools adjust to that. Some schools provide that. Some schools need help. We have yet to come up with any suggestion here on Capitol Hill about afterschool programs responsive to the needs of today's working families. I suppose taking summer vacations off was an idea that made sense in my home State of Illinois. After all, the kids did have to go work on the farm. But out of a State of 12 million people, we only have 75,000 farm families. Those children should be in another learning experience, another supervised experience so they are better students. If they are falling behind in reading and math, let them have remedial work during the summer. If they are good students, give them enrichment courses, teach them a musical instrument, or something new about science. Introduce them to computers. All the options and possibilities are there. Yet when you bring that up on Capitol Hill, you would think you were speaking a foreign language. People just cannot quite understand what we have to do with it.  I think we have a lot to do with it. That this Congress has been so derelict when it comes to the issue of education is a suggestion to me that we just don't get it. We are not listening to American families who identify education as their highest priority. We certainly are not reading history, which tells us education made the 20th century the American century because of our commitment to education.  Make no mistake about it; other countries around the world, in Europe, in parts of Asia, are starting to move forward. These are tomorrow's competitors. These are the people with whom our children will have to be ready to do business and with whom they will have to compete. If we are not prepared, they will pass us by. I don't want to see that happen to my children. I don't want to see that happen to this country.  The honest question we have to ask ourselves is, Does Congress get that message? If you look at the budget debate, it is pretty clear to me we have missed the point completely. We are now entangled in this terrible budget debate with the President. Thank goodness the Republican Party has abandoned this $750 billion or $800 billion tax cut for wealthy people. They took that out in August. They were going to go home with it and explain to the American people why this was the real important thing to do for America's future. It fell on its face. It had about as much popularity as the new Coca-Cola. They came back and said: We have given up on that idea. Maybe we will do it next year.  I hope they have walked away from it. But in abandoning that bad idea, why don't they pick up on a good idea like education? Why don't they join us in making certain the education funding bill is one that really is a source of pride rather than a source of embarrassment. At this point, unfortunately, we have seen that bill delayed. There have been absolutely no hearings on it and absolutely no effort being made, no initiative being shown, when it comes to improving education for the next generation.  I think the American people rightly give us that responsibility and ask us to meet it. It is a responsibility that should be shared on a bipartisan basis. The things I have suggested are not radical Democratic ideas. The things I have suggested I think would appeal to families of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--all families who care about the future of their children.  I yield the floor hoping the debate soon will turn to these issues such as education, issues which most American families consider to be one of our highest priorities.                          ____________________
