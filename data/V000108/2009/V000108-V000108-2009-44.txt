Martha Morgan-Naylor on a momentous milestone, her 100th birthday, which will be on January 22, 2009. Martha will be celebrating this milestone with family and friends on Sunday, January 18, 2009, at the First Baptist Church of Gary, Indiana. For 42 years, Martha's presence in the Gary school system allowed her the opportunity to touch the lives of countless members of her community.  Martha Morgan-Naylor was born on January 22, 1909, in Auburn, Alabama. She was the youngest of five children born to Clem and Amy Morgan. In 1917, the family relocated to Gary, Indiana, in search of better employment opportunities and school systems for their children. In 1926, Martha graduated from one of only a few integrated high schools in the state of Indiana: Froebel High School. Martha's passion for education led her on to graduate with a bachelor of science degree in physical education from Indiana State Normal School, now known as Indiana State University in Terre Haute, Indiana. Martha then decided to return to Gary to pursue a teaching career. She went on to teach physical education for 32 years at Roosevelt High School. Her career continued and she went on to teach for 11 years at Beckman Middle School until her retirement in 1974. Martha's many years of service as an educator have been a blessing to the youth and families in the Gary community, and she is worthy of our deepest admiration.  In addition to her impressive career, Martha serves her community as an active member and deacon at First Baptist Church of Gary. Fully devoted to her congregation, she serves as Chairman of the Scholarship Committee at First Baptist, and is also a member of the Matron's Welcoming Committee. A lifelong teacher, Martha participated in the Purdue University/Hammond High School Oral History project in October 2008. The students involved researched ``The Great Depression'' and interviewed Martha on her reflection of living during that time. The interview was recorded and transcribed for historical records. Martha believes that she is blessed by God's grace and has always felt compelled to help others. It is this belief that has enabled her to enrich the lives of many people throughout the community.  Martha has many friends and loved ones who share a common respect for her commendable qualities, including her energy, wisdom, sharp mind, and her calmness in stressful situations. Martha's selfless devotion to education and the community of Gary is to be commended. She is truly an inspiration and a role model for us all.  Madam Speaker, Martha Morgan-Naylor has always given her time and efforts selflessly to the youth and the community in Gary throughout her illustrious life. She has taught her friends and members of her community the true meaning of service to others. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in wishing Martha a very Happy 100th Birthday.                          ____________________
