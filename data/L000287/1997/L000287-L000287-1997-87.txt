Mr. Speaker, today is the 100th day of this Congress. Today marks 100 days of doing nothing.  The Republican leadership has no agenda. The Republican leadership has no budget, no education bill, no children's health care bill. Why do we not have a budget? Why do we not have a children's health care bill? What can be more important? Instead of doing the people's work, we are spending our time on busy work and political posturing.  What have the Republicans done about a budget? Nothing. What havethe Republicans done about children's health? Nothing. What have the Republicans done about education? Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Mr. Speaker, 100 days of nothing is enough. It is time to address the concerns of American working families. It is time for this do-nothing Congress to do something. Get to work.                          ____________________
