 President. I rise today to recognize and honor a respected leader in the law enforcement community and a friend. Jim Freeman has graciously served our Nation for over 30 years as a Special Agent at the FBI.  Mr. Freeman began his career by receiving his appointment as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] in July 1964, following his receipt of a bachelor of arts degree from San Francisco State University that same year. He has served as special agent in charge of the San Francisco Division of the FBI since August 1993, where he is responsible for approximately 650 employees and a territory that extends from Monterey to the Oregon border. The majority of his assignments in this area deal with organized crime and drugs, white collar crime, violent crimes, terrorism and foreign counterintelligence.  In 1995, Mr. Freeman was named as the FBI's official adviser to the Technology Theft Prevention Foundation, which is comprised of insurance and electronic industry executives with the mission of reducing high-technology crimes through a variety of initiatives awareness training and law enforcement support. During his tenure, the San Francisco Division of the FBI has created a high-tech crimes squad in San Jose which investigates crimes ranging from robbery of components and semiconductors, to the theft of intellectual property, as well as a computer intrusion squad in San Francisco which investigates serious computer hacking crimes. His other assignments have included the development of the Crimes Against Children Task Force in San Francisco in February 1994, and assuming the leadership of the UNABOM Task Force on April 1, 1994.  Mr. President, Mr. Freeman's previous postings were as a special agent in the Oklahoma City and Los Angeles bureau divisions; a supervisory special agent in Los Angeles; assistant special agent in charge in Miami; an inspector in FBI Headquarters' Inspection Division; and special agent in charge of Honolulu Division of the FBI.  In 1986, he was elected as the FBI's representative to the U.S. Department of State's Senior Seminar at the Foreign Service Institute in Rosslyn, VA, for the 1986-1987 session. On November 20, 1988, Mr. Freeman was selected as a member of the Senior Executive Service.  Mr. President, in conclusion, I want to commend Agent Freeman for his leadership and hard work he has demonstrated during his active years as law enforcement officer. His service to the State of California is greatly appreciated and will not be forgotten. I wish him all the best in years to come.                          ____________________
