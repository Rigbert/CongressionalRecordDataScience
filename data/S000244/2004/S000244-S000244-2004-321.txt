Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 657, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 83) proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States regarding the appointment of individuals to fill vacancies in the House of Representatives, and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.  The text of House Joint Resolution 83 is as follows:                              H.J. Res. 83       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of      each House concurring therein), That the following article is      proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United      States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as      part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of      three-fourths of the several States within seven years after      the date of its submission for ratification:                              ``Article --       ``Section 1. Prior to taking the oath of office, an      individual who is elected to serve as a Member of the House      of Representatives for a Congress shall present to the chief      executive of the State from which the individual is elected a      list of nominees to take the individual's place in the event      the individual dies or becomes incapacitated prior to the      expiration of the individual's term of office. The individual      shall ensure that the list contains the names of not fewer      than two nominees, each of whom shall meet the qualifications      for service as a Member of the House of Representatives from      the State involved. After the individual takes the oath of      office, the individual may present revised versions of the      list at any time during the Congress.       ``Section 2. If at any time a majority of the whole      membership of the House of Representatives are unable to      carry out their duties because of death or incapacity, or if      at any time the House adopts a resolution declaring that      extraordinary circumstances exist which threaten the ability      of the House to represent the interests of the people of the      United States, the chief executive of any State represented      by any Member who is dead or incapacitated at that time shall      appoint, from the most recent list of nominees presented by      the Member under section 1, an individual to take the place      of the Member. The chief executive shall make such an      appointment as soon as practicable (but in no event later      than seven days) after the date on which Member's death or      incapacity has been certified. An individual appointed to      take the place of a Member of the House of Representatives      under this section shall serve until the Member regains      capacity or until another Member is elected to fill the      vacancy resulting from the death or incapacity. The State      shall provide for an election to fill the vacancy at such      time and in accordance with such procedures as may be      provided under State law, and an individual appointed under      this section may be a candidate in such an election. This      section shall not apply with respect to any Member of the      House who dies or becomes incapacitated prior to the seven-     day period which ends on the date on which the event      requiring appointments to be made under this section occurs.       ``Section 3. During the period of an individual's      appointment under section 2, the individual shall be treated      as a Member of the House of Representatives for purposes of      all laws, rules, and regulations, but not for purposes of      section 1. If an individual appointed under section 2 is      unable to carry out the duties of a Member during such period      because of death or incapacity, the chief executive of the      State involved shall appoint another individual from the same      list of nominees presented under section 1 from which the      individual was appointed under section 2. Any individual so      appointed shall be considered to have been appointed under      section 2.       ``Section 4. Congress may by law establish the criteria for      determining whether a Member of the House of Representatives      or Senate is dead or incapacitated, and shall have the power      to enforce this article through appropriate legislation.''.
