 President, I have a hard time remembering the last time I disagreed with my friend from Washington on an issue, but on this one, regretfully, I do. We had a vote a few moments ago to reduce the Colombian drug war money by $225 million. That was defeated 89-11. Now my colleague from Washington would take it all the way down to a mere $100 million for this effort. He would be the first one to agree that, in effect, eliminates this effort. I think that is a mistake.  I will make the motion to table the Gorton amendment which I would like to schedule for 4 p.m., if that is agreeable with Senator Gorton.
