Speaker, I rise today to honor the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division, for their large contribution to the Combined Federal Campaign. In particular, I want to thank Captain John Walsh, Commander Michael Donch and Chris Adams for their leadership, enthusiasm, dedication and ingenuity. the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division, raised over $116,000, a 31-percent increase over last year. They were also able to motivate 1,120 people to participate in the campaign.  Your contribution to enriching the Navy's culture of giving by planning and implementing a highly successful plan of action is most appreciated. Individuals will have better health, quality of life, education or a safety net because you took the time to care. Thousands will benefit due to your hard work. Your efforts are a positive reflection on yourself, the Navy and the Department of Defense. You demonstrate the military not only serves and protects but also is a positive force in the community, the Nation and the world. Congratulations on your fine success.                          ____________________
