President, June 23rd marks the 80th anniversary of Voidhupuha, or Victory Day, recalling Estonia's break from Russian control in 1920. On this holiday, Estonians commemorate the battles during the War of Independence in which military forces fought to regain Baltic control over the region. On Victory Day Estonians also celebrate the contributions of all who have fought for the cause of independence throughout their country's history.  Many lives were lost for the cause of Estonian independence. Three battles, Roopa, Venden-Ronnenberg, and finally Vonnu were the turning points that ultimately led to the defeat of the opposing army. The Tartu Peace Treaty in 1920 marked the end of centuries of struggle and finally granted independence to Estonia.  On Victory Day, Estonians also remember those who battled against the Nazis and the Soviets. From 1944 until 1991 the Soviets again occupied Estonia, and during this time those who voiced opinions against the government were typically sentenced to 25 years in a Gulag prison, and 5 years in exile. The designation of June 23rd as Victory Day signifies that all those involved in the crusade for freedom are remembered for their efforts, and that their messages live on.  Estonia has become a strong independent country since 1991 when it again rid itself of Soviet occupation. It is a free-market economy and has established a rule of law.  This year we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the refusal by the United States to recognize Soviet domination of the Baltic states. The recognition of Estonia as free and independent is positive, but does not go far enough. What we celebrate this year is what we must help to preserve next year and the year after that. We must be sure that Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia are admitted into NATO as an unequivocal statement of the West's support for Baltic freedom and independence.  Being the son of a Lithuanian immigrant myself, I take great pride in the accomplishments of the Baltic states. I support admitting the Baltic states into NATO and I hope my colleagues here in the Senate will support their entry also in the next round of NATO expansion.  That debate we will save for another day, but I am sure all of my colleagues can agree on the importance of Estonia's struggle for freedom and independence, and will join me in congratulating Estonia on the 80th anniversary of Victory Day.                          ____________________
