Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge an outstanding Rhode Islander, Justice Florence Kerins Murray, who is celebrating the 40th anniversary of her appointment to the bench.  Justice Murray was educated in the Newport, RI public school system and graduated from Syracuse University with a bachelor of arts degree. Following a brief teaching career at the Prudence Island School, she attained her L.L.B. from Boston University Law School and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar.  During World War II, Justice Murray enlisted in the Women's Army Corps and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1942. She served in various capacities and left the corps as a lieutenant colonel, but was later recalled for a special duty assignment in 1947.  Justice Murray returned to Rhode Island to practice law and raise a son with her beloved late husband, Paul. In 1948, she began her career in public service, serving with distinction on the Newport School Committee and in the Rhode Island State Senate concurrently until 1956. During this time, she displayed keen understanding of government policy and the legislative process and specialized in issues involving the welfare of children and the needs of the elderly. She served as master in the superior court and as chair of a special commission that led to the establishment in Rhode Island of the Nation's first family court.  In 1956, Gov. Dennis J. Roberts appointed Florence Murray as an associate judge of the Rhode Island Superior Court, the first women justice in the history of our State. Twenty-two years later, she was named the first female presiding justice of that court, and in 1979, she was elected to her present position on the Rhode Island Supreme Court, one of the first women to serve on a State supreme court.  The career of Justice Murray is an exemplary one, and she is renowned throughout the country as an outstanding jurist. She is a recipient of nine honorary doctorates and of the coveted Herbert Harley Award from the American Judicature Society.  She is respected for her leadership, personal integrity, love of the law, sense of justice, and for her unselfish contribution to the welfare of the community. She has been a champion of professionalism in the courts and an inspiration to furthering the careers of women in the field of the law. Her intelligence, reason, compassion, and sense of fairness have been an enduring presence in the Rhode Island court system.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring Justice Murray. She is a remarkable woman of impeccable character and reputation who honors all of us with her service. I urge you to recognize Justice Murray for her significant contribution to our legal system. This milestone is significant, and I am delighted to join in this most fitting tribute.                          ____________________
