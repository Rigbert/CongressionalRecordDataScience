President, on May 19, 2016, hundreds of guests flooded the Senate's Kennedy Caucus Room for the eleventh annual Taste of Vermont, an event that brings together over 60 businesses that showcase the best Vermont has to offer. From microbreweries to distilleries, farms to creameries, bake shops to chocolatiers, these business represent the best of Vermont's many unique, homegrown products. All of these businesses deserve acknowledgment for their contributions to our great State and for putting Vermont's business-friendly environment on the map. I want to take a minute to shine the spotlight on one company in particular.  On the eve of this year's Taste of Vermont, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, ESOP, Association named King Arthur Flour the 2016 Company of the Year. Founded in 1790, King Arthur Flour epitomizes Vermont values. A business leader within the community, the company is focused on providing quality products to its loyal customers. After relocating to Norwich, VT, in 1984, owners Frank and Brinna Sands sold their company to their employees. They became 100 percent employee-owned in 2004 and have helped numerous other Vermont companies transition to ESOP status, including Heritage Aviation, the most recent Vermont-based company to join the ESOP ranks.  King Arthur Flour has long been dedicated to bettering itself and its community, a laudable and often uncommon commitment from businesses. Currently in the midst of a large expansion of their facilities and programming, King Arthur Flour has adapted to meet the needs of their customers and introduced award-winning gluten-free baking mixes in 2010. The life skills bread baking program recently taught its 120,000th student, and classes from the baking education center have reached over 4,600 bakers.  In King Arthur Flour, I see a commitment to being on the cutting edge of new ideas and developments, whileremaining true to what their customers deserve. Congratulations to King Arthur Flour for this outstanding achievement and to everyone who was involved.                          ____________________
