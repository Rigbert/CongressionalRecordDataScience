 President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow morning there will be a joint meeting of Congress to receive a speech from Prime Minister Allawi of Iraq. We will convene following that speech for a short period of morning business. Following morning business, we hope to consider the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. We have been working on an agreement and we hope to have that language worked out by tomorrow morning. We would like to finish that legislation and consider the family friendly tax bill when that conference report becomes available sometime tomorrow. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout the day.
