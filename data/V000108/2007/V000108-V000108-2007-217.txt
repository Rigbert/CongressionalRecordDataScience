As is their annual tradition, the lodge will take this opportunity to celebrate with a Golden Member banquet, which will take place on Sunday, August 12, 2007.  This year, the Croatian Fraternal Union will hold this gala event at the Croatian Center in Merrillville, Indiana. Traditionally, the anniversary celebration includes a ceremonial appreciation of the Union's Golden Members, those individuals who have achieved 50 years of membership. This year's Golden Members include: Judith Marie Brefeld, Geraldine Brklevich, Shirley Bronikowski, Esther M. Fadell, Antone J. Giorgi, Joseph L. Haralovich, Madelin Kazmier, Juliana H. King, George Kirincic, Michael Kuchaes, Jr., Judith Kathleen Lavery, Frank Joseph Mosca, Sr., William Pulford, Elizabeth J. Sedey, Stevan J. Trtan, Phyllis M. Vician, Dean J. Wantland, Joseph Winkler, and Angela A. Yelusich.  These faithful and devoted individuals share this esteemed tribute with over 400 other Golden Members who have previously attained this prestigious designation.  This memorable day will begin with a morning mass at the Croatian Center's gazebo with the Reverend Father Stephen Loncar officiating. The Saint George Tamburitzans from Cokeburg, Pennsylvania will perform at the mass, which will be followed by a gala event and formal dinner featuring the DUNAV Orchestra.  Madam Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Lodge President Betty Morgavan and all the other members of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge Number 170 for their loyalty and radiant display of passion for their ethnicity. The Cmatian community has played a key role in elevating the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana. It is my hope that this year will bring happiness, good health, and success for all members of the Croatian community and their families.                          ____________________
