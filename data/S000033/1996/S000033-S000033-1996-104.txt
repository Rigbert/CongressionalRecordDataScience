 Speaker, this debate centers on two issues. At a time when the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider, when the real wages of American workers has declined by 16 percent over the last 20 years, when most of the new jobs being created are low wage jobs, part-time jobs, temporary jobs, we must raise the minimum wage so that, if somebody works 40 hours a week, they do not live in poverty.  Second, given the struggle that so many working poor are experiencing today, why would anybody want to raise the rents that low-income people have to pay in public housing? Why would somebody tell the elderly poor, who are barely surviving on Social Security, that they must pay higher rents than they are paying today? This is a bad rule. Let us defeat it.
