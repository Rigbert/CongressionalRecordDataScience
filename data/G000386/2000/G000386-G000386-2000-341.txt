 President, long-term tax credits may seem like a dull topic. But the expenses of caring for an ailing family member are shocking. Millions of people bear these expenses every day, without any help.  Here's a typical example: A state legislator from Ohio named Barbara Boyd testified before my Special Committee on Aging last year. Ms. Boyd cared at home for her mother who had Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. Her mother had $20,000 in savings and a monthly Social Security check. That went quickly. Prescription drugs alone ran $400 a month.  Antibiotics, ointments to prevent skin breakdown, incontinence supplies and other expenses cost hundreds of dollars a month. Ms. Boyd exhausted her own savings to care for her mother, and exhausted herself. She isn't complaining. Family caregivers don't complain. But we can and should use the tax code to ease their burden.  Yesterday a bipartisan group of legislators, and two prominent groups--AARP and the Health Insurance Association of America, announced a consensus agreement on a legislative package to help people with a variety of long-term care needs. Our bill contains a tax deduction to encourage individuals to buy long-term care insurance. We want to help people to prepare for their health needs in retirement.  The bill also contains a $3,000 tax credit for family caregivers caring for a disabled relative at home. Under this legislation, Ms. Boyd's mother could have purchased long-term care insurance long before she developed Alzheimer's. In addition, Ms. Boyd could have used the tax credit to help with the costs of the medications and medical supplies for her mother.  I'm pleased that we have so much agreement in Washington about helping people with long-term care expenses. The legislators sponsoring this legislation have pushed for long-term care relief for years. Today, my colleagues and I will introduce this bill. We'll work to get it passed into law as soon as possible. An aging nation has no time to waste in preparing for long-term care. Family caregivers need immediate relief from their expensive and exhausting work.  Joining me in introducing this bill is Senator Bob Graham of Florida, Representative Nancy Johnson, and Representative Karen Thurman.                                 ______                                       By
