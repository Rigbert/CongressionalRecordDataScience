Speaker, I rise to introduce our bipartisan Resolution condemning Russian transgressions against international law during the upcoming World Cup. I want to thank my counterpart, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen for her work with this important Resolution.  Russia will host the 2018 World Cup this June 14 to July 15.  And the games have an expected global viewership of 3 billion, granting Russia global prestige, a platform to spread disinformation, and a tourism windfall. All undermine global sanctions.  This trivializes Russia's malicious efforts to weaken democracies through disinformation, election meddling and other violent measures. Russia illegally invaded and occupied Ukrainian territories since 2014, resulting in 10,000 deaths.  A dark cloud hangs over these games with allegations of corruption associated with the selection of Russia for the World Cup.  I call on my colleagues to support this resolution, which would call out Russia's malign behavior, and on FIFA to justify holding the World Cup in a country internationally sanctioned for military aggression.  Ideally, sports should be used to unite people for peace, not bankroll corrupt and violent regimes and their oligarch patrons.                          ____________________
