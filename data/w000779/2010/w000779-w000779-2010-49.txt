President, this week marks the 50th anniversary of one of the most remarkable innovations in modern medicine. On September 21, 1960, at the University of Oregon Medical School, Dr. Albert Starr successfully implanted the first prosthetic mechanical heart valve. In 1958, Lowell Edwards, a retired mechanical engineer, approached Dr. Starr about the possibility of creating an artificial heart. Believing artificial heart technology to be a bit premature, Starr encouraged Edwards to consider valve replacement surgery. The valve they designed--a ball and cage mechanical valve--was successfully implanted in its first patient just 2 years later. For this achievement, Dr. Starr was the co-recipient of the Albert Lasker Award, for Clinical Medical Research in 2007.  Dr. Starr continues to contribute to the development of medical science as the director emeritus of Providence Heart and Vascular Institute, medical director of the Albert Starr Academic Center, and director of bioscience research and development for Providence Health & Services in Oregon.  Since the valve's first use in 1960, heart valve replacement surgery has saved millions of lives, giving hope to those with heart disease. Today, life saving heart valve replacement surgery is performed 300,000 times each year around the globe, with more than 90,000 of those operations taking place in the U.S.  Dr. Starr says he considers his legacy to be about the people he has trained and his patients. For him, the human interaction has been the most important aspect of his lifetime of achievements. I am grateful for his passion to help people and to help advance medical science.  It is an honor for me to recognize Dr. Albert Starr for his contributions to medical innovation and I am proud to have him call Oregon his home.                          ____________________
