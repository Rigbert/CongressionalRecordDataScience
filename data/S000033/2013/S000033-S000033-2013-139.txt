2 billion in discretionary funding and $2.2 billion in mandatory funding for community health centers in fiscal year 2014.  I believe that community health centers are the answer we are looking for to make health care work for everyone, and I am very grateful for the language included in this Budget that recognizes the value of health centers.  As the Senator knows, since enactment of the Affordable Care Act, budget cuts have significantly reduced discretionary funding for the Community Health Center Program. Current service levels for the Community Health Center Program have been maintained only by redirection of the ACA's mandatory expansion funding--which is not authorized beyond the year 2015.  In other words, beginning in fiscal year 2016, the community health center fund will expire. Unless we find a solution to this problem, community health center funding will be reduced by 69 percent. If adequate funding is not restored, the result will be dramatic reductions in the number of patients community health centers are able to serve. I believe that would be a serious mistake.  Would the Senator be willing to work with me and other Senators on resolving the funding cliff facing health centers in 2016 so we don't have a massive cut facing such a valuable program?  Mrs. Murray. I thank the Senator and I couldn't agree with him more on the value of the Community Health Center Program. I know very well about the value they bring to Washington State, and also to the country by controlling health care costs and delivering care to our Nation's most vulnerable people and communities. We have included language that recognizes the importance of adequately funding the Community Health Center Program and I look forward to working with the Senator and other Senators to try and find a solution to the community health center funding cliff before it occurs.
