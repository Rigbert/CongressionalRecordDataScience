President, I am going to speak in favor of the commonsense amendment brought to us by Senators Bingaman and Feinstein. Before I do, though, if I could make a couple personal comments.  I have been in the Senate for 31 years. I came at a time when there was a real effort for Republicans and Democrats to work together, and for White Houses to do so. I have been here during the administrations of President Ford, President Carter, both terms of President Reagan, President George H.W. Bush, both terms of President Clinton, and now into the second term of President George W. Bush.  I have seen terrific majority leaders in both parties, leaders in both parties. Senator Mansfield, Senator Scott, Senator Byrd, Senator Baker, Senator Dole, Senator Mitchell, obviously Senator Daschle. I think of all the times they would work so closely to bring people together. The President, whoever the President was, would do the same.  I can remember times Senator Dole, a partisan, tough-minded Republican, would reach a point as majority leader when he would call Senators from both parties into his office and say: OK, boys, let's see where we go from here. How do we get this legislation done?  Senator Baker would do that. Senator Mansfield was famous for coming out on the floor during evening sessions and picking a few Senators from both sides of the aisle and saying: Come up to the office. We have to chat and work things out. Senator Baker had the ability to do that. He would go down and speak to President Reagan and suggest to him which Democrats, which Republicans, he might call to make things work out.  You also had, during that time, the practice where the two great parties, the Democratic Party and Republican Party, would keep from attacking the leaders of the other party's caucus in either body. They did it because they knew that, while they might oppose each other on one issue today, they were going to have to work together for the betterment of the country the next day.  Now it has broken down. For some reason, something I never thought I would see, nor, I suspect, did any of those leaders I mentioned from either party ever think they would see, it stopped last session when the leader of one party went to the home of the leader of the other party and attacked him in a political campaign, and attacks were then mounted by the national party. I think it was a mistake.  In the years I have talked about, the 31 years of both Republicans and Democrats running the Senate--we have seen it go back and forth a half a dozen times since I have been here--it has worked very well, where you fight for your party, you fight for your majority or minority, but you do not go after the leaders.  I was hoping the last election might be an aberration. Now I see a difference when the Republican National Committee has come out with the most scurrilous, outrageous attack on the Democratic leader, Senator Reid.  It makes no sense whatsoever. Senator Reid spent his years as the deputy Democratic leader helping to get legislation through this place. He worked very closely with two different Republican deputy leaders, both when he was in the majority and in the minority, to move legislation through.  I can think of dozens of times, hundreds of times on this floor when legislation looked like it might not get through, and both Republicans and Democrats were going to Harry Reid as the deputy leader to say: How can we work this out?  He would say: Why don't you leave off these amendments, and I will talk to the Republicans and they will leave off these amendments. We will get it through.  It always worked. The legislation we have before us is not one that Senator Reid favors, but he worked in good faith with the Republican leadership to bring it up. Almost a day after he does that, he gets attacked by the Republican National Committee, a day or so after the President of the United States in his State of the Union message said how we must all work together, and on the day when the President invites Senator Reid down for a cordial family dinner, which is, of course, showing how bipartisan we can be, the Republican National Committee--controlled, of course, by the White House--sends out this scurrilous attack on Senator Reid.  It is a mistake. I would say the same thing if the Democratic Party was doing it to the Republican leadership. It is a mistake because ultimately the Senate consists of only 100 men and women who have the privilege to represent 290 million Americans at any given time. There are so many things we need to get done. We should be working together.  An example: During President Reagan's term, we were facing a real crisis--not a manufactured crisis but a real crisis in Social Security, not the manufactured one we see today, a real one--and we were stuck here on the floor. Neither side seemed to budge, and efforts to do something that might save Social Security seemed lost when two giants of the Senate--I know this for a fact because I was standing right here on the floor--Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Senator Robert Dole, the leaders on the Finance Committee where Social Security reform now seemed founded, were talking, and Pat Moynihan walks over to Bob Dole and says: We have to give this another try. It is far too important to let this fall apart in partisan bickering. Let us make this work. You know the two of us can do it.  I and a couple others who were standing there said: We are all with you.  When I say ``I and a couple others,'' Republicans and Democrats said: We are all for you. You can do it.  They went down and saw President Reagan, talked with him and said: Look, we are going to take another try at it, if you will work with us.  He said: Fine.  And they did. As a result of that, in the 1980s, Social Security was put in solvent standing for 70 years. If we do nothing with Social Security now, it will still be solvent in the year 2045, 2050.  Wouldn't it be nice if we went back to the days of giants in the Senate and Presidents of both parties who wanted to work with the Members of the House and Senate who actually want to get something done, not for partisan gain but for American gain, not for one political party but for all Americans?  Those who came up with the bright idea of attacking Harry Reid, a man who will get reelected his next term, I suspect by even a greater margin than the last landslide he had, ought to step back. They might raise money this way. They might stir up some of the true believers this way. They do nothing for the country. They do nothing for the Nation. All they do is deepen the divides instead of healing them. It would be nice if we could have leaderswho would try to be uniters, not dividers. We haven't had that for a few years. I wish we could.  I digress somewhat. I see the distinguished Chair, a man I knew before he came here, admired in his work as a member of the Cabinet. We are benefited by having him here. I hope that he might be one of those who will come in not with preconceptions but his enormous talent of bringing people together and work with us. I say this somewhat unfairly because under the rules he cannot respond, of course. I hope I have not damaged him irreparably with the Republican Party in Florida, but he has known me long enough to know I mean what I am saying.  This Bingaman-Feinstein amendment is a commonsense amendment. It seeks to rectify one of most significant problems of the class action legislation under consideration by the Senate. As we all know, this class action bill is going to sweep most class actions into Federal court. But then many of the Federal courts refuse to certify multistate class actions because the court would be required to apply the laws of different jurisdictions to different plaintiffs, even if the laws of those jurisdictions are quite similar.  Without this balanced amendment, members of important class actions that involve multiple-State laws may have no place to receive justice. In other words, they get removed from the State court to Federal court, but then the Federal court says: Well, because the State laws may be different, we can't do anything. But you can't go back to State court because you are removed here. It is probably as classical a legal Catch-22 as one could see.  According to 14 of our State attorneys general:       [I]n theory, injured plaintiffs in each state could bring a      separate class action lawsuit in federal court, but that      defeats one of the main purposes of class actions, which is      to conserve judicial sources. Moreover, while the population      of some states may be large enough to warrant a separate      class action involving only residents of those states, it is      very unlikely that similar lawsuits would be brought on      behalf of residents of many smaller states.  The Feinstein-Bingaman amendment would help citizens of States such as my own of Vermont. We have smaller populations. We are only the size of one congressional district, 610,000 people. But it would allow us to join with other injured plaintiffs from other States to have their day in court. Federal courts should be allowed to certify nationwide class actions by applying one State's law with sufficient ties to the underlying claims in the case. This amendment would give Federal judges that power and make it clear that they should not deny certification on the sole ground that the laws of more than one State would apply to the action.  If the Senate is truly interested in passing class action legislation that gives injured citizens from every State a place to seek relief, then all Senators should embrace this commonsense amendment. I hope my colleagues will support this important amendment.  I thank Senators Bingaman and Feinstein for their hard work on the amendment.                          Sad News for Vermont  On another issue, I spoke of my small State. I was born in Vermont, a precious State. We have had Leahys there since the 1850s. It is in my heart and soul. I read with pride but with sadness an article on the front page of the Washington Post today about Vermont and the number of our brave men and women who have been called up in the Guard and Reserves. Two States have the highest per capita callup in the Nation--Hawaii and Vermont, two of the smaller States. We also have the very sad distinction of having the most fatalities, the most soldiers killed per capita of any State in the Union.  I mention this because in our State, everybody knows everybody else. If one person dies, everybody in the State feels it. I have been to those funerals where I have seen people with whom I was in kindergarten, people I grew up with, neighbors of mine or my sister's, people my parents knew. You go to the funeral, you walk into a church, not as a member of the congressional delegation from Vermont--we have all done that--but you go as a friend and neighbor, and that is what you see, friends and neighbors. I will later today put the full article in the Record.  It struck me as to what this means. We have one small town that is about the size of a small town in which my wife and I live in Vermont. They have one country store. It is a small store, but it is important to the town. Everybody goes there. A mother and a son run the store. The son gets called up. He goes bravely, of course. The mother cannot handle the store by herself, and the store closes. The community in many ways has lost its center.  These are the realities of what is happening. Several of us met earlier today from both bodies, both parties, to introduce legislation to increase health benefits for those in the Guard and Reserves who are called up, to improve their retirement situation, make sure they stay healthy, make sure if they have a solely owned business and they get called up, they can at least have health care for their family.  I mention this again not because it is apropos to the legislation--I do not see anybody else seeking recognition; I am not taking away from others' time--but I hope those who are watching or listening to this will read this article about what happens in rural America with these callups.  In my State, the largest community is only 38,000 people. The town I live in has about 1,500 people. They know everybody. I live on a dirt road on the side of a mountain with magnificent views. Again, everybody is on a first-name basis. When somebody gets called up, you know it, you feel it.  This is not a question about whether somebody is for or against the war. In my State, everybody has supported those who have gone. Even though I would suspect the majority of the people in Vermont are opposed to the war, they are all supportive of our troops. But it hurts. It is real. I hope we can bring them home soon.  I was heartened by the elections in Iraq. I was heartened by the efforts of those who would brave in some cases death to go out and vote. I hope those of us in our country who say it is going to be a hard time to vote today because it is raining or it is snowing or it is cold or it is hot or it is inconvenient to go those extra five blocks, or whatever the reason, look at what they did.  I hope that country will soon be able to take care of itself. We are going to spend huge amounts of money in this budget to build schools, improve police forces, build communications, roads, and hospitals all in Iraq. We have those same needs at home. I hope soon they can be on their own. I hope soon our men and women can come home, as many safely as possible.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
