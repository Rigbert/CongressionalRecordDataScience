 I thank the Senator from New York.  Lucy is just 12 years old, but she knows the fear of watching someone you love go to work and the worry that you might never see them again. Lucy's dad, her hero, John Kuelper, is also a State trooper.  When Lucy learned about the number of State troopers who had been hit and killed recently, she asked her dad: What can I do?  Together, they came up with an idea. With help from her mom, Jessica, Lucy created a Facebook page to raise awareness about Scott's Law. She calls her page the Move Over Project.  She posted the photo, shown here, of herself standing next to her dad, holding up a sign that says hashtag ``move over . . . for my DAD.''  She asked other loved ones in the police force and other emergency services to post similar photos with hashtag ``move over for . . .'' and fill in the blank.  In 5 days, Lucy's Facebook page received more than 14,000 ``likes.'' People have sent in photos from all over the country. They want people to move over for their dads, moms, sisters, brothers, uncles, and friends. There are photos of firefighters, police officers, EMTs, and tow truck drivers standing next to spouses, children, infants, parents, friends, and pets.  This week, the State of Illinois Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service honored Lucy with its Volunteer of the Week Award. She deserved it, but Lucy says the only reward she wants is for people to follow the law and move over, so her dad and others like him who do dangerous jobs will be able to come home to their families at the end of the day.  I want to thank Lucy for her efforts in starting the Move Over Project. Look at the faces and the families involved. Remember them the next time you see an emergency vehicle on a highway with its lights flashing parked along a roadway. Move over and save lives.  I yield the floor.
