 President, I encourage my colleagues to take the time to read this speech and consider this important message and its application today.                               Exhibit 1 Justice Served, Lessons Learned: Robert Jackson, Thomas Dodd, and the                             Nuremberg Trials       It's a privilege to be with you in the Supreme Court      Chamber, where cases that have changed the course of our      nation's history have been argued and decided.       As a United States Senator, it's not often that I make my      way across the street to this building and to this branch of      government.       Two years ago, I was here to observe oral argument in      Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs. That case      considered the constitutionality of the Family and Medical      Leave Act. I was interested because I authored the Family and      Medical Leave Act in the Senate.       The bill had survived two Presidential vetoes and had taken      seven years to become law. But in this institution, these      facts were of little consequence. Nothing is quite as      humbling as Justices deciding whether or not to strike down a      law you labored over for years. I was relieved when the      Court, by a margin of 6 to 3, upheld the Act.       But that visit, and others I've made over the years,      prompted me to think about the differences between the Senate      and the Supreme Court.       Senators show up to work in suits; Justices wear robes.       Senators are under the constant scrutiny of television      cameras; Justices have somehow managed to keep them out of      this Chamber.       And, of course, Senators have to run for re-election every      six years; Justices of the Supreme Court have the best job      security in the world.       So it's understandable why no fewer than 13 United States      Senators later served on the Supreme Court. That number      includes three Chief Justices--Salmon Portland Chase, Edward      Douglass White, and Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut.       I tried to comfort myself by finding what I assumed would      be an equally long list of Justices who resigned their seats      on the Court for the honor and privilege of serving in the      U.S. Senate. But that list was exactly one name long.       That lone individual, I discovered, was David Davis, U.S.      Supreme Court Justice, and later Senator from Illinois. He      was appointed to the Court by Abraham Lincoln in 1862, and      served here for 15 years before resigning in 1877 when he was      elected a Senator by the Illinois state legislature.       It should be noted, though, that the U.S. Senate wasn't his      first choice. He was a candidate for the presidential      nomination five years earlier in 1872. He sought the      nomination of what was then known as the ``Liberal      Republican'' party. Some might suggest it was that      characteristic that would make him most unique today.       I'd like to recognize, of course, Justice Souter, who has      joined us this evening. And though he isn't here today, I'd      also like to recognize Chief Justice Rehnquist.       Justice Rehnquist is a wonderful student of history who has      done so much to educate our nation and the world about this      unique institution. And as I'm sure many of you know, from      1952 to 1953 he served as a law clerk for Justice Robert      Jackson.       Last month I had the honor of participating in the      inauguration of President Bush. I don't think anyone watching      the ceremony on that day could fail to be moved by the      courage and fortitude displayed by Chief Justice Rehnquist. I      think I speak for everyone here, and countless others, as      well, in wishing him well this evening.       I'd like to thank Barrett Prettyman of the Supreme Court      Historical Society for his kind introduction, and I'd like to      thank Professor John Barrett for his historical notes as      well.       I'd also like to thank Greg Peterson of the Robert H.      Jackson Center for his remarks, and for the invitation to      speak to you this evening. And I'd like to welcome members of      the Jackson family who have joined us this evening.       If Nuremberg was the most profound experience that      influenced my father's life, there were few individuals whose      words and ideas carried greater weight with my father than      those of Robert H. Jackson.       Justice Jackson was truly an extraordinary man whose life's      journey took him from a farmhouse in upstate New York, to the      U.S. Department of Justice, where he served as Solicitor      General and Attorney General, to the Supreme Court, to a      courtroom in Nuremberg, Germany. Following Nuremberg, he      returned to this very chamber where, less than five months      before he passed away, he and his eight colleagues voted to      end racial segregation in schools across our land.       Robert Jackson graduated from neither college nor law      school.       And prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court, he had      never served as a judge. Yet he became one of the most      respected jurists of his time, one known for his      thoughtfulness, his fairness, his courage, and his      eloquently-written opinions. He was an ardent defender of the      freedoms articulated in our nation's Bill of Rights.       Of particular relevance today, Justice Jackson defended      these freedoms even during times of war, and even when he was      at odds with many of his fellow justices. He was one of only      three justices to dissent in Korematsu v. United States,      which allowed the detention of Japanese-Americans in      internment camps during World War II--a decision we now      regard as a stain on our nation's historical commitment to      freedom and justice.       Most of all, Justice Jackson was committed to promoting and      enforcing the rule of law, not only here in the United States      but around the globe, as well.       Having witnessed the horrors of Nazi Germany, he had a deep      and abiding belief that the law is humanity's strongest and      noblest weapon against tyranny and oppression.       We gather here this evening two days after the 113th      anniversary of Justice Jackson's birth, and just a few months      after the 50th anniversary of his passing on October 9, 1954.       It's fitting, as well, that we assemble here two weeks      after the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.       More than any other events, the liberation of Auschwitz and      the Nuremberg trials were the two events that laid bare      before the entire world the horrors committed by the Nazi      regime.       At liberation, the Western world saw, for the very first      time, the gas chambers, the cattle cars, and the crematoria.      They saw gruesome piles of corpses, and the emaciated few who      had survived the largest and deadliest of Hitler's death      camps. At Nuremberg, the war and the Final Solution were      painstakingly and meticulously documented and recorded so the      existence of these horrific events would never, ever be in      doubt.       With each passing day, there remain fewer and fewer of      those who can personally bear witness to the atrocities of      the Nazi regime. As a result, our generation's responsibility      becomes even greater--to ensure that the lessons we learned      six decades ago do not fade away into the mist of history.       This responsibility was one that my father took very, very      seriously--and it was reflected in how he raised his six      children. From a very early age, he would tell us about Adolf      Hitler and Heinrich Himmler, and describe places like      Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Dachau.       My father believed firmly that the value of the Nuremberg      experience would not only be in the individual sentences      meted out to the named defendants--but, in a larger sense, in      the legacy the trial would leave to future generations.       In hindsight, some might think it was inevitable that      nations like ours would judge criminals like the Nazis      according to the rule of law. In reality, there was great      debate, both here in the United States and among our allies,      over how to handle the Nazi leaders.       We know today that as many as four Supreme Court Justices,      and many others including the powerful Senator from Ohio,      Robert Taft, felt that the trials at Nuremberg would be a      case of ex post facto judgment, and would therefore be      illegal under our own Constitution. The Chief Justice at the      time, Harlan Stone, called Nuremberg a ``high-grade lynching      party.''       A great many in our nation and around the world advocated a      different treatment for captured Nazi officials--one that had      long been practiced by nations victorious in war: summary      execution. Winston Churchill was said to have supported such      a policy.       Why, so the argument went, should we show any mercy to      these criminals--men who were responsible for the ruthless      slaughter of six million Jews, and five million other      innocent men, women, and children?       Men who razed to the ground entire villages and towns and      massacred those who lived in them.       Men who launched an aggressive war that eventually claimed      over 54 million lives, and turned the European continent into      a mass graveyard.       The argument was a compelling one. But a different one      would win the day. That case was the one advocated by men      like Justice Robert Jackson and a young lawyer named Thomas      Dodd. These two and others believed that the best way to      judge these crimes against humanity, and to deter future      crimes, would be a fair, legal trial.       They insisted on the rule of law, rather than the rule of      the mob.       And so in the summer of 1945, Justice Jackson assembled not      a team of executioners, but a team of legal professionals who      would meticulously use the Nazis' own documents, records, and      testimony to prove their guilt. My father was one of the men      he chose to be on that team.       During his fifteen months at Nuremberg, my father wrote      daily letters to my mother. These beautifully written letters      always began with the words ``Grace, my dearest one.'' They      fill up this volume I hold in my hand--and a second volume of      equal length.       I had no idea that these letters even existed until the      early 1990's. Before reading these letters I, arranged them      in chronological order. I finally completed this long process      in the summer of 1995.       Without any prior awareness, you can imagine my shock when      on the evening of July 28, 1995, I sat down to begin reading      the letters and realized that the first letter to my mother      was written on July 28, 1945--50 years earlier, to the day.       My father arrived in Europe on that day with mixed      feelings. He knew that he had an opportunity to be part of a      historic occasion. But he was reluctant to leave my mother      and their children. I was only a year old at the time--and a      very active child according to my mother. Sometimes I wonder      if I was the reason my father decided to go to Nuremberg.       Ultimately, the decision was made to see the job through.      As he explained it, ``Sometimes a man knows his duty, his      responsibility so clearly, so surely, he cannot hesitate--he      dare not refuse it. Even great pain and other sacrifices seem      unimportant in such a situation. The pain is no less for this      knowledge--but the pain has a purpose at least.''       He threw himself into a job he expected would last only a      few months. In July 1945,     this 38-year-old attorney had no idea that he would be      promoted from staff counsel to trial counsel, then to senior      trial counsel, and then to Executive Trial Counsel--the      deputy prosecutor for the United States.       The Nuremberg trials themselves were an absolutely massive      undertaking, with so many questions that had to be answered:       Who would be the judges?       Who would be the lawyers?       Would the defendants be tried together or separately?       Would the trials be conducted under American or European      legal customs?       Would they be military or civilian trials?       And perhaps the most pressing practical question: Where      would the trials be held?       My father, like many, expressed reservations about holding      the trial in Nuremberg. The city, he said, was ``probably the      worst in Germany'' in terms of destruction. He suggested that      Heidelberg, which had survived the war essentially intact,      would have been a better alternative.       But for reasons of principle--if not practicality--he knew      that Nuremberg was the right choice. It was, after all,      Nuremberg where the Nazis met on September 10, 1935 to codify      into law their regime of oppression, terror, and hatred. And      so it was totally fitting that in Nuremberg, these Nazis were      brought to justice.       My father's ambivalent outlook towards his participation in      the trial changed dramatically on August 14th, 1945. On that      day, he and his fellow prosecutors began interrogating      prisoners. He described it as ``a day I shall never forget,''      and the day that followed as ``the most fascinating day of my      life.''       From August through November 1945, my father spent much of      his time face to face with some of the most vital cogs in      Hitler's murderous Nazi machine. William Keitel. Hans Frank.      Rudolph Hess. Hermann Goering. One by one, each of them would      do his best to deflect blame and to deny. My father remarked      that ``It would be relieving to hear one of them admit some      blame for something. They blame everything on the dead or      missing.''       Throughout the course of the investigation and trial, my      father became one of Justice Jackson's closest associates--     and one of his closest friends, as well.       There's no question that my father viewed Justice Jackson      as much more than a professional colleague. ``I am proud of      my association with him,'' he wrote, ``and even more proud of      his friendship.''       My father admired Jackson greatly for his keen intellect,      his quiet dignity, and for his steadfast dedication to seeing      the trial through to the end. In a letter he wrote to Justice      Jackson's son on the occasion of the Justice's passing in      1954, my father called him ``one of a very few great men whom      I have been privileged to meet in my lifetime.''       I will not go into much detail discussing the proceedings      of the trial itself. Much of the trial was actually fairly      tedious. For the most part, anyone expecting tearful      admissions of guilt was sorely disappointed.       My father, for his part, presented several aspects of the      prosecution's case, including those on concentration camps,      on economic oppression, and on slave labor. He cross-examined      numerous witnesses, including six of the defendants. Four of      those defendants were ultimately sentenced to death. The      other two served lengthy terms in prison.       For my father, though, Nuremberg was about much more than      the defendants, the evidence, and the sentences. It was about      the opportunity, as he put it, ``to write a record that will      mark a new point in man's relation with man.''       My father returned from Nuremberg with a deep commitment to      the rule of law and its role in upholding the basic human      rights and human dignity of every man, woman, and child.       That commitment is the reason why--as a Congressman and a      Senator--he was such a staunch supporter of the civil rights      movement. It's the reason he was such an ardent opponent of      Communism. And it is the reason why he embraced bold new      efforts to eliminate poverty in our nation and throughout the      world.       My father also left Nuremberg as an ardent believer in the      need to create and use law to preserve and promote human      dignity.       Nuremberg was essentially a trial without precedent. As I      mentioned earlier, when Justice Jackson and others were      developing the guidelines for the Nuremberg trials, there was      a great deal of debate and disagreement over the legality of      the proceedings.       Justice Jackson spent a great deal of time arguing why, in      fact, there was legal precedent in international law for the      crime of waging aggressive war.       But beyond those legal arguments, there was another, far      more fundamental point--a point that Robert Jackson and my      father shared. That the crimes committed by the Nazis were so      heinous, so unthinkable, that they violated the basic rules      by which all of humanity must abide.       As Justice Jackson said in his opening statement, ``The      wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so      calculated, so malignant and so devastating, that      civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it      cannot survive their being repeated.''       This idea of a natural law, rooted in basic standards and      norms of human behavior, was a powerful argument in favor of      the Nuremberg trials. Perhaps no document embodies the idea      that such basic standards exist more than our own Declaration      of Independence, which affirms that ``all men are created      equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain      inalienable rights, that among these rights are life,      liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''       Natural law was a concept for which my father was a      strenuous advocate. I can remember a story he told me about a      paper he wrote at Yale for a professor of his, Harold Lasky,      a renowned socialist. In the paper, my father argued      passionately in favor of natural law theory. When he got the      paper back, a note was written on the front page: ``I      disagree with everything you have written. A Plus.''       The Nuremberg trials' lasting legacy, my father believed,      would be in international institutions that could punish      crimes against humanity, and more importantly, deter those      crimes in the future.       As he put it, ``By a declaration of criminality against      these organizations, this tribunal will put on notice not      only the people of Germany, but the people of the whole      world. Mankind will know that no crime will go unpunished      because it was committed in the name of a political party or      a state; that no crime will be passed by because it is too      big; that no criminals will avoid punishment because there      are too many.''       Regrettably, my father's and Robert Jackson's vision has      not yet been fully realized.       Over the last six decades, we have not witnessed the level      of horrific destruction and carnage perpetrated by the Nazis.      But we have seen, time and again, terrible crimes against      humanity in places like Cambodia, Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda, and      today in the Darfur province of the Sudan.       Tragically, many of the individuals involved in these      crimes--people like Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, and Idi Amin--     were never brought to justice. In some of these cases, the      world did eventually create tribunals--but always, like      Nuremberg, temporary, ad hoc courts that were established      after the fact.       To truly be called effective, a court must not simply      punish the guilty, then disband. It must serve as a permanent      reminder to any potential criminals that they, too, will be      held accountable. Such a court can not only punish crimes--it      can deter them.       In my view, there is only one kind of institution that can      ensure the kind of accountability that can prevent future war      crimes--and that is a permanent court empowered to indict,      prosecute, and judge international criminals.       After many, many years of effort, the International      Criminal Court came into existence on July 1, 2002.      Unfortunately, rather than lend its support to this effort,      the United States has walked away from it.       I'm aware that there are complex issues that need to be      resolved regarding our nation and the International Criminal      Court. But I strongly believe that our nation's interests,      and the world's interests, would be far better served if we      worked to address those issues rather than abandoning the      entire process.       What, after all, does it say about a nation that prides      itself in upholding freedom, justice, and human rights when      it simply disengages itself from an institution whose goal is      to promote those values? And what does it say about an      institution's power to bring criminals to justice when the      most powerful nation in the world refuses to play a part?       The tragic events in Darfur today represent exactly the      kind of situation in which people like my father and Robert      Jackson envisioned international courts playing a prominent      role. It is my hope that the current administration will see      the Darfur genocide as an opportunity to participate in this      institution in some way, rather than simply standing on the      sidelines. Otherwise, the cry of ``never again'' will ring      tragically hollow.       There is another legacy of Nuremberg that is just as      powerful as its role in the development of international law.      As I mentioned earlier, the decision to hold a trial at      Nuremberg--rather than summary executions--was not an easy      choice.       We rejected the certainty of executions for the uncertainty      of a trial. We turned away from violence that was certainly      within our ability, and, many would argue, within our right.       But what we learned is that our nation became stronger, and      more respected, because we took the course that we did.       At the heart of that decision was the idea that this nation      will not tailor its eternal principles to the conflict of the      moment--and the recognition that if we did, we would be      walking in the very footsteps of the enemies we despised.       This is a principle I believe we would all do well to      remember today.       This past year, we all were horrified at the images and      stories of abuse of prisoners held in places like Abu Ghraib      in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.       The abuse itself was shocking. In my view, though, even      more troubling are the comments on this issue that we've      heard from some who occupy positions of great power in our      government.       Legal justifications for the use of torture by American      troops;       For turning over individuals to other nations known to      torture detainees;       And, perhaps most egregiously, legal justifications that      would explicitly exempt any executive branch official from      prosecution for torture ``if they are carrying out the      President's Commander-in-Chief powers.''       Sixty years ago at Nuremberg, the United States and our      allies considered the defense     ``I was just following orders'' to be so cowardly that it was      prohibited under the rules of the trial.       Perversely, there are some who consider that defense      acceptable for Americans today.       The proponents of these rationalizations tell us that we      are living in different times.       That we are facing enemies who show blatant disregard for      human life, and whose organizations transcend international      borders.       As a result, the argument goes, we must re-evaluate certain      conventions and practices that we have long respected.       I wonder how men like Robert Jackson and my father would      respond to these arguments. Would they be swayed by them?      Would they be persuaded somehow that the followers of Osama      bin Laden and Saddam Hussein are fundamentally different from      the despicable and depraved defendants who swore allegiance      to Adolf Hitler?       Would these men, who prosecuted the Nazis based on      testimony and documentary evidence, be heartened by the      argument that the best responses we can muster against evil      today are attack dogs and water-boarding?       I truly, truly think not. On the contrary, I believe that      Robert Jackson and my father would be tremendously      disappointed and saddened at some of the actions taken by      Americans on behalf of our nation--and by some of the      official legal arguments made in support of those actions.       I believe that Robert Jackson and Thomas Dodd would see      these actions as a reflection of a government that has turned      away from the lessons of history and stepped back from the      very values of due process and equal justice that we expect      of others worldwide.       Is the threat of international terrorism a dangerous one?      Unquestionably. But we cannot allow that danger to compromise      bedrock principles which have stood since the birth of our      nation--values like the right to be free from torture or from      indefinite detention without a charge.       We enshrined these values in our Constitution not simply      because we believe Americans are entitled to them. We did so      because they affirm a basic sense of human dignity in each      and every man and woman. And because we, as a nation, are      committed to upholding that dignity--even if others do not.       If we cavalierly toss aside those values in response to a      particular enemy or threat, it is not our enemies, but we who      will pay the ultimate price.       As Justice Jackson said at Nuremberg, ``we must never      forget that the record on which we judge these defendants      today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow.      To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to      our own lips as well. ``       A century and a half ago, in his second State of the Union      address, Abraham Lincoln said that in giving or denying      freedom to slaves, ``We shall nobly save or meanly lose the      last, best hope of earth.''       The issue then was how our nation treats the enslaved.      Sixty years ago, the question was how to treat Nazi war      criminals. Today, we face the same choice with regard to the      way we treat international terrorists.       If we heed the example set at Nuremberg by people like      Robert Jackson and Thomas Dodd, if we treat our enemies      according to our standards--not theirs--we feed the flame of      liberty and justice that has rightly led our nation on its      journey for these past two and a quarter centuries.       And we set a shining and lasting example for a true global      community--one grounded in the principles of justice,      freedom, and peace.       And we live up to the great memory of Robert Jackson and of      a young counsel named Thomas Dodd.                          ____________________[Pages S2474-S2477]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            MORNING BUSINESS  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be a period for morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
