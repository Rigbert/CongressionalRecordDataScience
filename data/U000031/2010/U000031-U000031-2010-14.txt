Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I just want to say, this is an issue that we sat down together for the last, actually, couple of years examining the facts. Many of us that particularly live in areas--for me, the Midwest, coming from Michigan, we had a devastating tornado come through this weekend, and for many of us, myself included, our electricity went out for a number of hours. And then a number of times, particularly during the winter and even in the summer where these electric storms that come through, sometimes the electricity may be out for a couple of days.  We look to our friends down in Haiti who, many of them still may not have electricity after the devastating earthquake that hit there a number of months ago. Can you imagine if that happened here in this country, where, because of our grid vulnerabilities, you could be perhaps out of electricity for a year or 2, trying to get gasoline to get out of there, trying to get refrigeration for your food, trying to have a job, take care of your family?  Some of us read the book ``The Road.'' Lots of different scenarios that are out there. We need to be prepared. This bill moves us down that road.  And I again want to compliment my friend, Mr. Markey, to make sure that this legislation did move through. We had a lot of bipartisan support, a lot of eyes opened and ears too, particularly as we sat through some of those classified briefings. Let's hope that the Senate moves quickly, the President signs it swiftly, and, in fact, we can see legislation move to make sure that those scenarios remain that way and don't become realities.
