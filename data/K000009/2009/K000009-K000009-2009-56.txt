 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the 2010 budget resolution conference report, and I commend the chairman for his diligent work, as well as the other conferees, to produce a budget to grow our economy and to restore discipline, finally, to America's accounts.  The key to our Nation's future is a strong, robust economy, and this budget leads us in that direction. It also meets our commitments to our veterans by including a substantial increase from the 2009 veterans' services.  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. Again, I thank the very able Budget chairman, Congressman Spratt of South Carolina, for his incredible work.  I rise today in support of the 2010 Budget Resolution Conference Report. I wish to applaud Chairmam Spratt and the other conferees for their diligent work on behalf of our nation.  The key to our nation's future is a a strong, robust economy built on the foundation of resilient citizens working hard to produce goods and services. The Budget Resolution supports revitalization of our economy through investing in education and energy independence, both of which keep us competitive globally while protecting our national interests.  In addition, this Budget Resolution aims to cut the deficit by nearly two-thirds while maintaining our commitment to our nation's veterans by including an 11.7 percent increase from 2009 for veteran's services. This is critical as we address our aging veterans and those who struggle with PTSD and other war-related injuries.  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.
