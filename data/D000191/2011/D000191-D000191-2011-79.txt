  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, article I, section 7.2 of the Constitution says that both Houses, this House and the Senate, must pass a bill identical and the President must sign it before it becomes a law.  Now, wait. The Republicans have a bill, we are going to take it up tomorrow, H.R. 1255, that deems that a bill that only has passed the House of Representatives, H.R. 1, has become law. Now, what happened to the fact that we were going to have to prove the constitutionality of every bill that came before the House? This blatantly violates the Constitution.  I was totally outraged, outraged, when I saw this. But then I realized, guess what? What is tomorrow? April Fool's Day. Hey, guys, you got me. Congratulations. Happy April Fool's Day. What are we really going to be doing tomorrow?                          ____________________
