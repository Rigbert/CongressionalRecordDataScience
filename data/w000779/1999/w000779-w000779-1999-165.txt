KERRY. I want to make this clear, Mr. President. Under the McCain bill, if a party is induced by fraud to enter into a contract, they can't recover damages for that. So what if in a conversation they say to the salesperson of the company: Is your product Y2K compliant? And the person says: Oh, absolutely, our product has been Y2K compliant. We are terrific, blah, blah, blah.  If they intentionally were to induce them into the contract on misrepresentation and they lose business as a result of that, they are being denied the ability to sue for that by S. 96.  I think that is wrong. I don't know, again, what public policy interest is served by suggesting that fraud and misrepresentation ought to be protected. Why should they be protected?
