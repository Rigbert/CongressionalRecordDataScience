 President, it is my sad duty today to pay tribute to a fallen Kentucky hero, Louisville Metro Police Department Detective Deidre Mengedoht. Dee Dee, as her friends called her, was tragically killed in the line of duty on Christmas Eve. Her family and our community are left to mourn this painful loss and to recognize her incredible service to Louisville.  A graduate of Eastern High School and the University of Louisville, Detective Mengedoht chose to dedicate her life to the service of her community. In 2011, she joined the LMPD's training academy. Since the day she took her oath, Detective Mengedoht proved herself worthy of the trust placed in her. With real love for the community under her protection, she worked as a beat officer before earning the rank of detective.  For 7 and a half years, Detective Mengedoht served the department and the people of Louisville. She quickly gained the respect of her colleagues, who recognized a passion for law enforcement and for community engagement. According to those who had the privilege to know her, Detective Mengedoht displayed the attributes of a true public servant. Police Chief Steve Conrad said she ``would fight tirelessly to seek justice for victims whose cases she was investigating.'' In her important work for the city of Louisville, Detective Mengedoht would always give more of herself than was asked.  While families throughout Kentucky and the Nation celebrated Christmas Eve, Detective Mengedoht was at her post, protecting the community. That afternoon, she conducted a traffic stop, a routine procedure for any member of law enforcement. Tragedy struck without warning as a semi-truck hit her police cruiser. Detective Mengedoht was killed at the scene,  The heartbreaking incident left the community shaken. The LMPD lost a critical member of its force, and Detective Mengedoht's family--especially her 9-year-old son, Preston, will never be the same. Almost immediately, expressions of condolences and support poured into the city. Downtown, the city hall clock shone with a blue light, in honor of the incredible sacrifice our men and women of law enforcement undertake each and every day to protect the public. The Louisville Metro Police Foundation also established a fund in Detective Mengedoht's name to support her family.  At a funeral service filled with tributes to her character, bravery, and integrity, the Kentucky State Police volunteered to take over the shifts of her colleagues so they could attend. More than 3,000 law enforcement officers traveled from around the Commonwealth and the Nation to join the LMPD in saluting Detective Mengedoht. Even in the rain, hundreds of Kentuckians lined the streets to pay their respects.  To Detective Mengedoht's family, including her brothers and sisters at the LMPD and her parents, her sister, and Preston, I would like to extend my sincere condolences. Her sacrifice bestows great honor onto all those who wear the LMPD uniform. During this difficult time, Elaine and I hope that the memories of Detective Mengedoht's life and her selfless service can provide much-needed comfort. It is my privilege to remember Detective Deidre Mengedoht's exemplary service to the people of Louisville, and I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring this Kentucky hero.                          ____________________
