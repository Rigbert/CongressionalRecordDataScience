Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I do not rise to oppose this nomination. I do want to make, however, some observations.  This process has been ongoing for a long period of time. Frankly, the Democratic leadership was severely criticized in the 102d and the 103d Congress for the administration of the House of Representatives. In fact, in Congresses before that.  The fact of the matter is in the 102d Congress, there was a discussion about reform. The present Secretary of Agriculture made a very strong recommendation that we adopt a position of administrative officer for the House of Representatives. He made that recommendation to Speaker Foley. In bipartisan meetings between the Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership, there was a discussion of how that would be formatted. Sequent those discussions in the next Congress, we did establish in fact a position of administrative officer for the ministerial duties, that is, the nonpolicymaking, nonlegislative duties of the House. That was the appropriate and correct step in my opinion to take.  At the urging of the Republican minority in the 103rd Congress, and in the 102d, the selection of that administrative officer was established in a bipartisan fashion, so much so that the minority leader in effect had a veto over the selection of the administrative officer. The committee selecting that administrative officer was made up of the Speaker, the majority leader and the minority leader and it had to be a unanimous choice, thereby giving the minority leader essentially a veto. That was done to assure that we would have a bipartisan agreement on an administrator for the business of this House.  All of us love this House and want it to be respected by the American public. I think all of us want to have this House run in as effective, businesslike fashion as we can accomplish. That benefits everybody in this House and it benefits all of America. Our differences should not be on how we efficiently operate the House, it should be on the policies that we adopt, that we contend for both in elections and on this floor.  In the 104th Congress, that policy that was adopted was changed and the administrative officer was created as a partisan officer. I frankly did not necessarily disagree with that, as I said in committee, as the gentleman from Ohio will recall. Because effectively what the new majority said was that the Speaker was responsible for the administration of the House. I think that is basically correct. Frankly, on our side I had argued that proposition in the 102d and 103d Congress but I had lost and we had created the bipartisan mechanism for selecting the administrator.  In the 104th Congress, though, the change resulted in a committee being established with the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Nussle], I believe, as the transition officer, I suppose. And an administrative officer was selected, in my opinion not in a bipartisan fashion, not with input from the minority, and in my opinion frankly without much discussion perhaps in the majorityparty as well. We have a report pending on that, on the performance of the administrative officer in the last Congress and for the first few months of this Congress. We will be discussing that at some time in the future.  The selection of this administrative officer, I think, was done in a proper fashion to the extent that it was done in a bipartisan fashion with input from the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, who has been at the administration of the House for many, many years because he has been in the leadership for over a decade. I have had the pleasure of serving with him in the leadership for over a decade.                              {time}  1715  I do not know Mr. Eagen. The gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio] has indicated that he is a man of ability and integrity, and the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Kildee], for whom I have great respect indicates a man of fairness. That is the kind of administrative officer this House needs.  So, as I said, I have no intention of opposing the selection of this administrative officer. Suffice it to say, however, that the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas] has indicated that there was a national search for an officer. I think that was appropriate because what this House needs in a bipartisan and effectively nonpartisan way, to assure ourselves and the American public that the business of the House, the paying of our bills, the managing of our information system, all of that which has nothing to do with the formulation of policy but everything to do with the effective management of the people's House is being done in a proper fashion. I would hope and expect that that will be the result from this appointment.  With those few words, Mr. Speaker, unless there is anybody who wants additional time, I yield back the balance of my time.
