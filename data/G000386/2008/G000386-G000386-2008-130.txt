 That is not true. Recall that      64 judges were confirmed in 1980, 44 in 1984, 42 in 1988 when      a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed Reagan nominees      and, as I have noted, 66 in 1992 when a Democratic majority      in the Senate confirmed 66 Bush nominees.  That is the end of the Leahy quote in regard to the Thurmond rule.
