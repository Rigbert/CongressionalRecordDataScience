Chairman, the gentleman has given the most classic conservative argument I have ever heard. He is asking for us to protect our rights as individuals against forces that otherwise would prevail, whether they are the power of government or the power of wealth. The reference he has made to ``a man for all seasons'' is one of my favorites. I thank the gentleman for bringing it into this debate.
