Speaker, reserving the right to object, I object to being summarily sat down by the withdrawal. There are all sorts of things you can object to, I say to my good friend, the chairman of the committee, and he is my good friend.  I ask, under my reservation, does the gentleman intend to renew, and I would ask for a notice and the comity if you are going to renew the motion; you are not going to renew it because I happen to walk off the floor. We are not going to play that way, ladies and gentlemen.
