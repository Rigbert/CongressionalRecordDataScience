President, today I am pleased to introduce, for myself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Smith of Oregon, the Capital Construction Fund Qualified Withdrawal Act of 2002.  The groundfish fishery in Oregon and adjoining States in the Pacific Northwest continues to face daunting challenges as a result of the groundfish fishery disaster, resulting in a more than 40-percent drop in the income of Oregon fishers since 1995. To assist in rebuilding healthy groundfish stocks, my goal remains to reduce overcapitalization in the groundfish fishery. We want to get the right number of fishers out there, at the right time, catching the right number of fish. This legislation supports this effort by reforming the Capital Construction Fund in a way that will ease the transition for groundfish fishers away from fishing.  The Capital Construction Fund, CCF, was created by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended in 1969, 46 U.S.C. 1177. CCF has been a way for fishers to accumulate funds, free from taxes, for the purpose of buying or refitting fishing vessels. The program has been a success; however, the CCF's usefulness has not kept up with the times, and today the CCF is exacerbating the problems facing U.S. fisheries, including the West Coast groundfish fishery.  CCF works like an Individual Retirement Account, IRA, in that deposits to the fund earn interest and are deducted from the fishermen's taxable income. But unlike IRAs, there is no limit on contributions to the CCF; so fishers are able to accumulate funds quickly. In Oregon, the amounts in the accounts range from $10,000 to over $200,000.  The problem my legislation will address is that fishers lose up to 70 percent of their funds in taxes and penalties if they withdraw funds from the CCF for purposes other than buying new vessels or upgrading current vessels. Because of the environmental problems plaguing commercial fishing, as well as the overcapitalization of the fishing fleet, fishermen who want to opt out of fishing are penalized for doing so.  This bill takes a significant step towards helping fishermen and making the West Coast groundfish fishery and the commercial fishing industry sustainable by amending the CCF to allow non-fishing uses of investments. This bill amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and the Internal Revenue Code to allow funds currently in the CCF to be rolled over into an IRA or other types of retirement accounts, or to be used for the payment of an industry fee authorized by the fishery capacity reduction program, without adverse tax consequences to the account holders.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation, and I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  The bill follows.                                S. 1962       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
