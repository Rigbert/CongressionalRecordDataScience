President, yesterday in the Senate Judiciary Committee, there was a historic vote, avote that relates to an issue America has grappled with almost from the beginning. That is the issue of immigration. It is interesting as we reflect on our history that we are a nation of immigrants. But for the Native Americans who were here on our shores when the first White men arrived, we have all come to this country either directly or indirectly through our parents, grandparents, or previous generations. It is that immigration which has made America such a unique and diverse place. We take great pride in our roots, where we came from, and even greater pride in where we have planted those roots in American soil. That is a fact of life in America. It brings a special quality to this country.  Think of the people who have decided to come to our shores, men and women who walked away from a comfortable life in a familiar place with a familiar church, with family, a culture, a language, to embark on a journey to a place they had never seen before, to come to a country where they could not speak the language, to live in a place where they were not certain what their future would hold. It takes an extraordinary person to make that leap of faith into the future. It takes an extraordinary family to decide that their future is going to be here in a new place.
