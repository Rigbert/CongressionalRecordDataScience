President, today, Senator Bond and I are joining together in submitting a resolution commemorating the 60th anniversary of the International Visitors Program next year. The International Visitors Program is the State Department's public diplomacy initiative that brings distinguished foreign leaders to the United States for short-term professional programs under the authority of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961.  The International Visitor Program has been wonderfully successful in meeting its public diplomacy mission. Thousands of rising leaders from other countries in government, business, labor, academia, and the arts have come to this country and met with their counterparts and with everyday Americans from all walks of life. They have learned about our democratic values and institutions, our entrepreneurial skills, and our culture.  Future foreign leaders have learned much about this country that has helped them shape their own, or that simply helped them understand this country's point of view. I wonder how many people in this country know the story of F.W. de Klerk's visit to the United States under the International Visitor Program, and how influential that visit was in his realization that apartheid in South Africa had to end. Perhaps more well known, at least in my part of the country, were the visits of Polish Solidarity Labor leaders who played a pivotal role in transforming Poland to the democratic country it is today. I am sure there are many more stories--most not so dramatic--but with tangible results all over the world. We will never know how many problems have been prevented because rising leaders had a better understanding of democracy, of our policies, and our culture.  Many up-and-coming political leaders come to visit Members of Congress and Senators while they're here. These meetings take a few minutes of my time, and I learn as much from my visitor as I hope he or she does from me. Volunteers always tell me that they, too, have learned much from their visitors, and we should not underestimate the value of this program as a two-way street that helps educate the volunteers, their children, and other people in their communities.  But I want to commend and thank those thousands of Americans who have opened their homes, their businesses, and their hearts to international visitors with such a tremendous impact on furthering international understanding. I deeply appreciate it that international visitors do not just come to Washington, but that the program takes them into our country's heartland so they can get a real education about our country, outside the Beltway, as they say. That means that volunteers from all over the country are critical for the success of the program.  I know in my own State of Illinois, there are six such volunteer groups in Chicago, Freeport, Geneseo, Paris, Sterling, and Springfield. I have heard first-hand the deep commitment many Illinoisans have to this program, because I know many enthusiastic volunteers. Because of the commitment of Illinois volunteers, our State is among the most active in the Nation in hosting international visitors, along with the much larger States of California and Texas.  But when we commemorate this anniversary I want to be sure that we're celebrating the contribution and commitment of the thousands of volunteers that make the program meaningful and successful.                          ____________________
