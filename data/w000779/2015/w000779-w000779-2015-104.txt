' Unfortunately, as the signers of the legislation will report, these concerns were not adequately addressed in the committee markup.  Shortly after the committee markup, a group of 65 technologists and cyber security professionals wrote to Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein expressing their opposition to this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record as well.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    March 2, 2015.     Chairman Richard Burr,     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate.     Vice Chairman, Dianne Feinstein,     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate.       Dear Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Feinstein, and Members of      the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: We the      undersigned civil society organizations, security experts,      and academics write to explain how the Cybersecurity      Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA), would significantly      undermine privacy and civil liberties. We now know that the      National Security Agency (NSA) has secretly collected the      personal information of millions of users, and the revelation      of these programs has created a strong need to rein in,      rather than expand, government surveillance. CISA disregards      the fact that information sharing can--and to be truly      effective, must--offer both security and robust privacy      protections. The legislation fails to achieve these critical      objectives by including:       Automatic NSA access to personal information shared with a      governmental entity;       Inadequate protections prior to sharing;       Dangerous authorization for countermeasures; and       Overbroad authorization for law enforcement use.       For the following reasons, we urge rejection of CISA in its      current form:       Automatic NSA Access to Personal Information and      Communications: Since the summer of 2013, NSA surveillance      activities, such as the telephony metadata bulk collection      program and the PRISM program, have raised nationwide alarm.      CISA ignores these objections, and requires real time      dissemination to military and intelligence agencies,      including the NSA. Congress should be working to limit the      NSA's overbroad authorities to conduct surveillance, rather      than passing a bill that would increase the NSA's access to      personal information and private communications.       Automatic sharing with NSA risks not only privacy, but also      effectiveness. During a recent House Intelligence Committee      hearing, NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers stated that sharing      threat indicators without filtering out personal data would      slow operations and negatively impact NSA's cyber defense      activities. Further, in the wake of revelations regarding the      PRISM program, major tech companies stated that they would      not voluntarily share users' information with the NSA.      Automated NSA access could thus disincentivize sharing,      undercutting the key goal of the legislation.       Inadequate Protections Prior to Sharing: CISA does not      effectively require private entities to strip out information      that identifies a specific person prior to sharing cyber      threat indicators with the government, a fundamental and      important privacy protection. While the bill requires that      companies ``review'' cyber threat indicators for information      that identifies a specific person and sometimes remove it,      the bill contains no standard to ensure that this review      effort is--at a minimum--reasonable.       Further, the bill requires companies to remove that      information only for individuals that it knows are ``not      directly related to a cybersecurity threat.'' This could      encourage companies to retain data by default, unnecessarily      exposing the information of innocent bystanders and victims      to the government, and making it available to law enforcement      for a myriad of investigative uses. Legislation should      instead require that prior to sharing, companies make at      least a reasonable effort to identify all personally      identifiable information and, unless it is necessary to      counter the cyber threat before sharing any indicators with      the government, remove it. The default should be to preserve      privacy, rather than to sacrifice it.       Dangerous Authorization for Countermeasures: CISA      authorizes countermeasures ``notwithstanding any law,''      including the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. As      amended by CISA, federal law would permit companies to      retaliate against a perceived threat in a manner that may      cause significant harm, and undermine cybersecurity. CISA      provides that countermeasures must be ``operated on'' one's      own information systems, but may have off-networks effects--     including harmful effects to external systems--so long as the      countermeasures do not ``intentionally'' destroy other      entities' systems. Given the risks of misattribution and     escalation posed by offensive cyber activities--as well as      the potential for misappropriation--this is highly      inadvisable. CISA permits companies to recklessly deploy      countermeasures that damage networks belonging to innocent      bystanders, such as a hospital or emergency responders that      attackers use as proxies to hide behind, so long as the      deploying company does not intend that the countermeasure      result in harm. CISA's authorization would not only      inadvisably wipe away the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act's      current prohibition against these activities, it would be      dangerous to internet security.       Overbroad Law Enforcement Use: Law enforcement use of      information shared for cybersecurity purposes should be      limited to prosecuting specific cyber crimes identified in      the bill and preventing imminent loss of life or serious      bodily harm. CISA goes far beyond this, and permits law      enforcement to use information it receives for investigations      and prosecutions of a wide range of crimes involving any      level of physical force, including those that involve no      threat of death or significant bodily harm, as well as for      terrorism investigations, which have served as the basis for      overbroad collection programs, and any alleged violations of      various provisions of the Espionage Act. The lack of use      limitations creates yet another loophole for law enforcement      to conduct backdoor searches on Americans--including searches      of digital communications that would otherwise require law      enforcement to obtain a warrant based on probable cause. This      undermines Fourth Amendment protections and constitutional      principles.       Cybersecurity legislation should be designed to increase      digital hygiene and identify and remediate advanced threats,      not create surveillance authorities that would compromise      essential privacy rights, and undermine security.      Accordingly, we urge that the Committee not approve this bill      without addressing these concerns.
