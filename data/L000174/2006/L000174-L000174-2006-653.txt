President, any Senator can object. I have been told that there are those on the Republican side who would object to a Democrat offering an amendment, so I suspect there would be similar objections here. But any Senator can speak about his or her amendment. Any Senator can offer an amendment. Any Senator can make an objection. But insofar as there are going to be objections on the Republican side to some Democratic amendments, and vice versa--there is aDemocratic amendment pending, of course, that of Senator Mikulski--I thought, until we get to the caucus, at least we could accomplish something by talking about the amendments we want to offer.  I will again make a unanimous consent request that after the two distinguished Senators from Florida speak about the Gators, there be 15 minutes a side to talk on the bill or amendments Members wish to offer. And if we do that, again, I realize we would alternate. On the Democratic side it would be Senator Nelson of Florida, Senator Menendez, Senator Lieberman, Senator Salazar, Senator Durbin, and Senator Kennedy.  I renew that request.
