 Senators should anticipate additional votes during tomorrow's session as we work through these last must-do items for this session. Executive items will also be considered as we work to complete action before breaking for the Christmas holidays. We will likely be in session through the weekend.  I thank Senators for their patience and hard work to get through the final stretch of activity for this session of the 109th Congress.                          ____________________[Page S13687]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
