Mr. Chair, I want to compliment the gentleman on his amendment. This is long overdue.  We have the technology. The imposition of putting bodies on board ships that don't really do anything, and I don't think make a great count, can be done better through technology. So I compliment the gentleman on his amendment, and I will be supporting his amendment.
