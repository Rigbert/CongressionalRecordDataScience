President, first, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. He and I share a passion and interest in the continent of Africa. He has traveled there many more times than I have. We have talked about the situation on that continent. I give special accolades to him for continuing to raise questions relative to that continent and the people who live there. It is an important part of the world, and for far too long it has been exploited.  I am glad, on a bipartisan basis, we both believe the United States should focus more attention on that important continent. I thank the Senator.                          ____________________
