 It seems to me what we should be doing in the Senate is become more aggressive, more bold in combating greenhouse gas emissions and not support amendments that slow down the growth of such sustainable energies as wind. That is what, unfortunately, the Alexander amendment would do.  In contrast to the direction Senator Alexander wants us to go, let me quote from a BBC article that appeared the other day. This is what that article says:  Wind ``could power all UK homes.'' All UK homes could be powered by offshore wind farms by 2020 as part of the fight against climate change, under plans unveiled.''  What they are doing in the UK, at the highest levels of Government, with support of the Tory Party--the conservative party--in the UK, is they are developing plans that would significantly increase the number of wind turbines. Some 7,000 wind turbines could be installed by the year 2020 to provide all the homes in the UK with electricity.
