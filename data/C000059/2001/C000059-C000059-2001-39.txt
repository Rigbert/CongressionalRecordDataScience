Speaker, the tragedies that befell our country on September 11, 2001 claimed many lives. The impact of this loss of life rippled out across this great land of ours. These ripples brought back waves of support from our friends and allies across the world. However, the sweat and labor of those who toiled to rescue our fallen, take care of the injured and clean up the destruction left behind in the aftermath belong primarily to the good people of America.  The communities of Riverside County, California, have always had a giving spirit. The attacks of September 11 brought out the members of the Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Task Force 6 from our own communities of Riverside County. One of eight task forces commissioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and coordinated through the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, Riverside USAR Task Force 6 consists of highly motivated and expertly trained search, medical, rescue and technical specialists and are utilized as resources to local communities and work directly for the local fire department commanders.  Riverside can be proud of its USAR Team, which was part of the first Task Force groups to arrive at ``Ground Zero'' in New York City. They departed from March Air Reserve Base at 10:45 the evening of September 11 to assist the rescue efforts. Riverside USAR arrived at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey and were immediately escorted by police to New York City.  These men and women belong to a very special group, and the memories unique to their experience at Ground Zero will remain with them all their lives. They will always remember those who paid the ultimate price. I pray that we will never forget the profound debt of gratitude we owe to them, and to all who responded by giving their best in this time of the Nation's great need. Their acts of bravery and their commitment to the Nation and to their fellow men exemplify the highest and best tradition of fire and rescue workers everywhere.  Now that they are safely home in Riverside County, I join the community in paying them special tribute. We as a nation commend Riverside USAR Task Force 6 and thank them for their selfless courage. They have made us proud.
