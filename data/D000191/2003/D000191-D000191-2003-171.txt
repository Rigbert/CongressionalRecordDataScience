Speaker, after the passage of the largest tax cut in history 2 years ago, the President began to talk about a little glitch in that, and a glitch that no one could have anticipated, not the Republican White House which wrote it, the Republican Senate which passed it, and the Republican House which passed it who deliberately wrote the glitch in, which was, gee, the estate tax would only expire for 1 year and then if you did not die during that 1 year, you would be subject to the full estate tax again. And a number of other taxes were phased back in.  Well, it was not a glitch. They knew about it. They had to do it so they would not bust the bank and that was when they were predicting a surplus. But guess what now? Whoops, here we go again. There is a little glitch in the second largest tax cut in American history passed at the time of the largest deficit in American history 2 weeks ago in the dark of the night, personally written and negotiated by Vice President Cheney and the Republican leadership of the House and the Senate.  How could they have known that they left out half of the American people? I mean, after all, it was Ari Fleischer who said, ``And, of course, for people in the 10 percent bracket, they benefit the most and that's the lowest income workers in America.'' He went on to say that it certainly does deliver tax relief to the people who pay income taxes. The President surrounds himself with waitresses. But unfortunately it is all a lie because those people are not going to get tax cuts under this bill. In fact, 51 percent of income-tax-paying Oregonians will get no cut under this bill and about 49 percent of income-tax-paying Americans will not get any cut under this bill. 7.6 million people who are in this 10 percent tax bracket that Mr. Fleischer referred to who were supposed to get a lot of benefits are going to get zero, zilch, nada under this bill. But every millionaire is guaranteed $93,500 or more under this bill.  To even heap more irony on top of the injustice, the $93,500 for each millionaire will come from FICA taxes, payroll taxes paid by wage-earning Americans. Wage-earning Americans pay about 7 percent of the first dollar they earn and every dollar they earn up to about $88,000 on FICA tax. In fact, more than half of American workers pay more in FICA taxes to the Federal Government than they do income taxes. No relief for them. And, hey, guess what? We have really suckered you, because we are going to borrow every penny of the FICA taxes youhave paid that you thought was going into a trust fund, in fact, a lockbox, passed seven times while the Republicans have been in charge of this House. Seven times we passed a lockbox for Social Security. Well, we cannot afford a lockbox anymore. It is busted open and robbed. Empty. That money is going to be used to finance the tax cut and replaced with IOUs. So the millionaire who gets a $93,500 benefit under this bill, they pay a FICA tax at the rate of .7 percent, one-tenth of the rate at which a wage-earning teacher or sales clerk pays that same tax, because they do not pay it on any income over $88,000 a year.                              {time}  1845  So $912,000 of their income is exempt from FICA tax, and the poor person who works for minimum wage or for a decent wage is paying FICA tax of 7 percent on every penny earned.  Finally, they made much hay on the fact that they were going to do so much with the child credit. Of course, it was temporary and going to expire in 2 years, but that is probably a glitch and they would have discovered that later.  But there was another little glitch. Most Americans, in fact, all Americans who earn between $10,500 and $26,625 will not get the child care credit. That is an awful lot of people who have an awful lot of need. That includes 11.9 million children.  So, all in all, what we have here is one of the biggest scams in history. Never before has this country in a time of huge deficit borrowing, and that is how this is being paid for, borrowed so much money from so many wage-earning Americans to give to so very few at the top under the premise that somehow those really rich people might invest or spend that money in a way to give those working people jobs so they can pay more FICA taxes that can be transferred to them in next year's tax cuts, which the President has already targeted toward those who earn over $1 million a year, to help them have more to contribute at election time in what is expected to be a record expensive Presidential election.  The system is incredibly corrupt.                          ____________________
