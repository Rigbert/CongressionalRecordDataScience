. 2638, the Continuing Resolution for Fiscal Year 2009.  1. Advanced Drivetrains for Enhanced Mobility and Safety.  Department: Defense.  Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation--Army.  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Eaton Corporation.  Address of Requesting Entity: 19218 B Drive South, Marshall, MI 49068.  Description of Request: This request is to provide funding for the final phase of an on-going three phase program between Eatonand the US Army. Eaton Corporation, which produces truck components in Galesburg, Michigan, has successfully worked with the Army over the past several years to develop specialized torque-modifying differentials for the HUMVEE to improve the vehicle safety. Phase I and II of the project was structured to first adapt commercial Eaton side-to-side torque modifying differentials to HUMVEES. These programs have proven very successful in quantitatively demonstrating improved vehicle safety by increasing mobility and stability on rough terrain and drastically reducing vehicle rollovers. Prototype systems will be delivered to the Army for additional testing in May 2008. Military-hardened systems will be subsequently designed.  The third and final phase of the program is to develop a front-to-rear transfer case to modulate the driving torque between the front and rear axles. In conjunction with the side-to-side system developed in Phases I and II, this will provide the soldier with the ultimate system for HUMVEE stability and mobility through complete 4x4 active torque management.  Amount: $1,600,000.  Financial Breakdown:  Allocation of Funds  15% = $240,000--Model hardware function and vehicle maneuvers.  25% = $400,000--Materials-modifications to transfer case and addition of differential.  10% = $160,000--Preliminary Bench test and vehicle functional tests.  50% = $800,000--Labor-Design/procure hardware, develop preliminary controls software.  Justification for the use of taxpayer dollars: This program addresses a key military need for tactical wheeled vehicle stability and mobility. The technology will greatly improve soldier safety and survivability and mission effectiveness. Eaton Automotive is a commercial company serving non-military customers. Taxpayer dollars are requested for this program to adapt Eaton commercial technology to military vehicles.  2. Advanced Digital Hydraulic Hybrid Drive Systems.  Department: Defense.  Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation--Army.  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Eaton Corporation.  Address of Requesting Entity: 26201 Northwestern Highway, Southfield, MI.  Description of Request: The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate a hybrid hydraulic drive system on military 4x4 vehicles. This compact drive system will enable vehicles to be operated more safely and effectively on even the harshest terrains, and also save a substantial amount of fuel. Having seen firsthand the challenges vehicles currently face with respect to immobilization, roll-over or forced-slow speeds due to weight, the value of such a system is very apparent. The additional weight of important armor results in increased problems with maneuverability, so the reduced weight of the new hybrid system. In addition to reducing the weight of the drive system, this project will also increase fuel efficiency by roughly 60 percent. The increased fuel efficiency will provide clear logistical benefits by increasing vehicle range and decreasing vehicle re-fueling requirements. This is not at the expense of vehicle performance, however, as the reduced weight will actually add to vehicle traction and performance.  Amount: $2,000,000.  Financial Breakdown:  Allocation of Funds  20% = $400,000--Advanced component testing--Full Authority Pump Motor demonstration.  20% = $400,000--System Testing--Lab scale test for insertion advanced technologies.  10% = $200,000--Materials--Full Authority Pump Motor & Next Generation Accumulators.  50% = $1,000,000--Labor--Design to develop a retrofit system, Next generation accumulators proof of concept, Develop detailed vehicle model, Develop supervisory control architecture, Develop preliminary controls software.  Justification for the use of taxpayer dollars: This project will dramatically increase fuel efficiency in military vehicles, and hence, provide logistical benefits as well as preserve fuel. The new hybrid system will also reduce vehicle weight, which will add to vehicle performance and allow for vehicles to carry increased armor or supplies.                          ____________________
