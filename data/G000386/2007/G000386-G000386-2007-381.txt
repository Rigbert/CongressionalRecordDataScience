 President, every year hundreds of thousands of Americans come to our Nation's Capital for what will be for many a once-in-a-lifetime vacation. A highlight of that visit for most families is seeing the Smithsonian museums.  The Smithsonian, as everybody knows, is home to many of our Nation's treasures, from Lincoln's top hat to the Hope Diamond. I have a picture of the Hope Diamond here. The Smithsonian receives over 70 percent of its support from the Federal taxpayers, over $700 million a year of taxpayers' money just in the last year. In addition, the Smithsonian receives over $200 million in donations each year. These donations are tax deductible, so the taxpayers also subsidize these charitable gifts as well. Thus, Federal taxpayers either pay for or subsidize almost the entire Smithsonian budget. Given that money is fungible, when taxpayers' dollars are paying for one thing at the Smithsonian, that frees up other money for the Smithsonian to spend elsewhere.  Despite the strong support the Smithsonian receives, the Government Accountability Office recently found in a record that there was significant damage to Smithsonian buildings and some exhibits because of water leakage. In fact, one of the Smithsonian buildings on the Mall, the Arts and Industry Building, has been closed to the public because of damage to the roof.  The Smithsonian seems, on one hand, to have recognized the need to tell their employees they need to pinchpennies. The Washington Post, in a story in this morning's paper, cites a Smithsonian memo sent to employees urging them to save energy by turning off decorative and accent lighting.  Unfortunately, while the rank-and-file at the Smithsonian and the strength of this great institution were told to count the pennies and turn off the lights, the Secretary of the Smithsonian, Mr. Lawrence Small, was throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars out the window. Money was thrown at his house, his office, and first-class travel for Mr. Small and his wife.  One of the great treasures in the Smithsonian is Dorothy's ruby slippers from ``The Wizard of Oz,'' as shown in this picture. What Dorothy learned in that classic movie is that ``there is no place like home.''  Just like for Dorothy, for Mr. Small, there is no place like home. The Secretary of the Smithsonian has taken that sentiment to heart, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on paintings, repairs, house cleaning, lawn service, even his cable, and presenting the bill to the Smithsonian for payment.  The Smithsonian Board of Regents wants to justify the million-dollar-plus in expenses paid for at Mr. Small's house, which he owns, because the Board of Regents claims he does official Smithsonian entertainment at his home.  What are some of the expenditures at Mr. Small's house? Perhaps most incredible is that the Smithsonian has paid for roof repairs for the Small's house at a time when the Smithsonian can't find the money to fix the roof at the Smithsonian museum. But along with the roof, let me list some other items we are paying for: a chandelier cleaning for $2,535; a pool heater for $4,225.77; three new French doors for $14,525.  Having the taxpayers and the Smithsonian donors pay for what I describe as a champagne lifestyle? Priceless.  Let me turn now to Mr. Small's office at the Smithsonian castle because he has turned that castle into a palace. Again, the Smithsonian tells its hard-working employees that they need to save every cent possible by turning down the lights but wasted every dollar possible on Mr. Small's office suite.  We have just one example here. These chairs reported in the Washington Post this morning are ``probably some of the best quality chairs you can buy.'' Those are the words of the Washington Post. These chairs are $2,000 each. There is a conference table for $13,000, thousands of dollars on carpeting and upholstery, and even finding the money to spend $1,502 on a wall sconce. I don't know if they turn that off, as he has told the employees to turn off lights.  In addition, Mr. Small has decorated his office suite with enough paintings and artifacts from the Smithsonian collection that it would be the envy of many museums. Making one's personal office a museum annex goes against the best practices of museum directors. The Smithsonian's collection is for the people's enjoyment, not for private enjoyment.  It is a sad statement of the Secretary and the board's priorities when one of the newest rooms at the Smithsonian is the Secretary's office--this at a time when the Smithsonian is struggling to keep the buildings open.  In addition to spending on his house and office, what hasn't been reported yet are the enormous amounts of funds spent on top-of-the-line travel by both Mr. and Mrs. Small. The accountant hired by the inspector general found example after example of Mr. Small and his wife traveling with expenses that far exceeded what Federal employees are allowed to spend. I will highlight just two trips for my colleagues, but I want you to know there are many more about which I could speak.  Mr. Small and his wife decided to take a trip to Las Vegas in 2002. The reason ostensibly was to attend the opening of a portrait and a press conference. That, of course, meant a $3,464.50 first-class airline ticket for each. They then stayed at one of the best hotels in Las Vegas, the Venetian, at nearly $500 a night, and enjoyed a $170.79 dinner for two at the Belaggio.  They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but I am going to make an exception. I posted on the Finance Committee Web site these travel vouchers.  While the Vegas getaway is bad enough, I think the trip to California in 2001 shows a real window into the problems at the Smithsonian. Mr. Small spent over $2,800 in chauffeured limousine service in 4 days, including a whopping $1,319 in 1 day. I want everybody to know I have a car I would be glad to sell to the Smithsonian for what they paid for that car service.  What is even worse, if that is possible, is the excuse given for this out-of-control spending.  In a memo justifying the car service in California, the claim is made that there would be ``a safety risk for [Small] to carry as much cash as would have been needed to pay for a taxi. . . .'' Even children who claim dogs ate the homework are embarrassed by that excuse. These are very serious problems, and I would say the more we look, the worse it gets in regard to the leadership at the Smithsonian.  I am pleased that the Smithsonian Board of Regents is announcing today the creation of two boards: one a group of outsiders to review the work of the board, and a second group, comprised I understand mostly of Board of Regents members to look at board governance at the Smithsonian.  I am pleased that the Board of Regents is taking these needed steps. I may not agree with the members of the board and how they have handled things, but let me say that I have looked at the governance setup, established over 100 years ago for the Board of Regents, and I feel that architecture is one of the biggest dinosaurs in the Smithsonian. We have to look at that architecture of that governance. The board structures and duties have clearly not kept up with the times in terms of the best governance practices in the nonprofit sector.  In addition, the board's actions of blessing, after the fact, of Mr. Small's expenditures and actions is extremely troubling. In my State of Iowa, we call this the legislature passing a ``legalization act,'' and it raises very real concerns in my mind of whether the board is running the Smithsonian and its secretary or whether the Secretary is running the board.  The actions of the Smithsonian Board of Regents calls to mind my work with some problems with the American Red Cross. This is another organization on which I have conducted oversight. I am pleased that the Senate recently passed legislation that I sponsored that reforms the governance of the American Red Cross. The Red Cross is a great American institution that also needed to modernize its governance, and I worked closely and successfully with the Red Cross leadership and was pleased that they recognized the need for fundamental change. I hope the Smithsonian Institution will look at the Red Cross's experience for guidance.  While the board has much to account for, that does not excuse where the responsibility lies--with the Secretary of the Smithsonian, Mr. Small. While the board should have been more vigilant in its work and overseeing its public trust, make no mistake, it is Mr. Small who ordered the champagne and handed the bill to the Smithsonian.  So let's put to rest this argument that I have heard from some that Mr. Small should not be held accountable for his actions because the board allowed it to happen. I think that excuse is way beyond the pale. We have a right to expect the Secretary of the Smithsonian to have the common sense to know if he wants Dom Perignon, he needs to pay for it out of his own pocket.  The other argument I hear is that Mr. Small should be excused of his taxpayer-supported lifestyle because he has raised money. First, let's remember that 70 percent of the dollars come from the Federal Government. Secondly, I think it is insulting that Mr. Small's supporters are trying to give him credit for every dollar raised at the Smithsonian. There are dozens of people being paid top dollar at the Smithsonian, including the museum directors, to help raise money as well. They are all helping to pull that very big weight.  Finally, Mr. Small's supporters act as if no one raised a dime before he showed up. The Smithsonian is our Nation's great museum. Many patriotic Americans want to show their support and give to this institution regardlessof who is in charge, if they have the confidence that the money is going to be spent wisely. For example, the Smithsonian received $123 million in donations in 1999, and that was more than double the amount the year before in 1998. This included, by the way, $60 million from Steven Udvar-Hazy to build the new Air and Space Museum near the Dulles Airport, as well as $10 million from Ralph Lauren to preserve the Star-Spangled Banner. All of this fundraising was done before Mr. Small's arrival.  Thanks to the growing economy and new tax laws that I have helped champion that encourage greater charitable giving, it should be expected that charitable giving will be up at the Smithsonian. In fact, charitable giving is up across the country.  The supporters of Mr. Small who want to point to fundraising to wash away the thousands of dollars spent painting Mr. Small's own house reminds me of the rooster who crows and thinks he caused the Sun to rise.  The Smithsonian is the people's museum, and it contains America's treasures. The American people have a right to have someone as a Secretary of the Smithsonian who enjoys their confidence. I believe the Secretary of the Smithsonian has lost the confidence of the American people with his actions, actions that have been contrary to the public trust that he has been given. It is proper and needed for the Board of Regents to take a hard look at itself and the actions from the board. More immediately, however, I would suggest the Board of Regents needs to consider whether the Secretary of the Smithsonian should continue in his position, a position that he should continue in only if he has the trust and confidence of the American people and their representatives.  I think the board itself has learned a lot recently, and if the Board of Regents looks closely at the facts and listens to what the people are saying, it will have to consider very hard whether the time has come to turn off the lights in the Office of the Secretary of the Smithsonian.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, first, I have had the opportunity to listen to my colleague from the great State of Iowa, and I want to tell Senator Grassley that I couldn't agree with him more in the speech he just gave concerning the leadership of the Smithsonian museum. I find it is not dissimilar to some of the problems we found from time to time with college presidents of public universities, that somehow we get off the beaten path in terms of taxpayer funding. I certainly commend him for the work he is doing in that area.  I rise this afternoon, however, to talk a little bit about something that is so close to the heart of our democracy, and that is the rule of law. As a very young lawyer out of law school, I was very blessed to have the opportunity to begin my legal career as an assistant prosecuting attorney in the courtrooms of Jackson County, in Kansas City, MO. I learned so much in those first few years that I toiled as an assistant prosecutor. I had a felony docket, and I was learning from great prosecutors. It is inspiring when I think back on the quality of legal work that was going on in those courtrooms on behalf of the public by the prosecuting attorneys who worked there for very little money.  I was mentored on the rules of evidence and on courtroom strategy, but, most importantly, I was mentored on the rules as they relate to the ethics of a prosecutor. Where is that line and how do you draw it? How does a prosecutor make the decision as to whether this is justice in terms of a sentence or this is not justice, and it must be put in the hands of a jury when you are trying to decide plea bargains. Charging decisions: how do you decide when someone is charged with a felony or whether you let it go with a misdemeanor, or perhaps not charge at all?  Those lessons were so fundamental to the work that was done. It was from that experience that I began to revere--revere the rule of law in the United States of America. It is fundamental to our democracy. It is the engine that runs our democracy. It is the envy of the rest of the world.  As I have traveled from time to time in other countries, I have seen this firsthand. I will never forget a time when I was in a foreign country and we got pulled over by a police officer. We asked the native who was helping us around the country that day: What is this? He said we have to pay him. I remember thinking to myself how fortunate we are in America that there isn't an ingrained system of bribery on the streets of our cities because we have this rule of law.  What is the heart of the rule of law? At its very essence, if you strip away everything else, what is core and central to the rule of law? It is the independent prosecutor. It doesn't matter if you become a prosecutor by election or selection. Once you take that oath, once you raise your hand and swear to the job that you are about to take, you must become blindfolded to any political considerations. You must see all lawbreakers as equal whether the lawbreaker is a Congressman, a police officer, or a high school dropout who is unemployed.  What is so offensive about the e-mail traffic that has been discovered at the Department of Justice surrounding the firing of eight prosecutors in the Federal criminal justice system has been their reference to loyalty--``loyal Bushies''--loyalty to the President and, by implication, to his party.  Prosecutors I have known, and I am lucky that I have known hundreds, have loyalty to only one thing, and that is to the law. Good American prosecutors are slaves to the facts of the case and loyal only to the law of this great country. They have great power, prosecutors in our country. The decisions they make, as they apply those facts to our law, can achieve justice. Those same decisions can also ruin lives.  What is happening right now in the United States as it relates to these eight U.S. attorneys, frankly, isn't that important in the grand scheme of things to those eight U.S. attorneys, or those eight prosecutors. Am I sorry that they have been caught up in what appears to be a political scandal as it relates to their firing? Am I sorry that they have been maligned, and it was said that they were underperforming when, in reality, this was about being a ``loyal Bushie''?  By the way, I am quoting the e-mail when I say ``loyal Bushie.'' That is the only reason I would use that term on the floor of the Senate, quoting that document.  What really is happening is very important to all the other prosecutors across the United States of America, particularly those prosecutors in the Federal system because, frankly, what the Justice Department is implying is if you still have your job as U.S. attorney, you are loyal to the President of the United States and that is why you kept your job; not that you were loyal to the law. The Attorney General's action implies they kept their jobs because they were loyal to the President.  It is not OK to judge a prosecutor through a prism of political loyalty. The facts show that these decisions included discussions of the prosecutor's loyalty to the President, and because of that fact, and that fact alone, the Attorney General owes them and the rest of America much more than an apology. He owes them his resignation.                 Tribute To Former Senator Tom Eagleton  Also, as a young prosecutor, I was very fortunate to have a man who was a mentor to me and continued to be a mentor until, very sadly, the end of his life just a few days ago. He was a great politician, and there is no place he would prefer to be called that than on the floor of the Senate.  There is a hole in the heart of Missouri with the death of Senator Tom Eagleton. He was a giant among leaders and leaves a legacy that should guide public servants and Senators for generations to come.  Beginning in 1956, at the age of 27, he also became a prosecutor. He was elected the prosecutor of St. Louis city, a circuit attorney. In a brief 12-year span, he became elected prosecutor of St. Louis, went on to be elected to the attorney general's position and then on to Lieutenant Governor and on to U.S. Senate--a whirling dervish of energy, intellect, and ambition.  In 1968, when Missourians sent our ``boy wonder'' to Washington, we knew he would achieve greatness, and he certainly didn't disappoint us. Within his first term, he had already begun to turn the tide on the environmental damage that had ensued within thehalf century after the industrial revolution by helping craft the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Clean Water Act of 1972. He was a strong advocate for children with disabilities and created the National Institute on Aging.  While much of what Senator Eagleton did in the Senate made a true impact on America and the world, no action may have been as great as his handwritten amendment that stopped the bombing in Cambodia. This courageous act changed the course of history by subsequently ending the Vietnam war. His complete grasp of the complexities of foreign policy continued until his death.  As he talked to me in February of 2005 and tried to convince me to run for the Senate, he said to me: Claire, this war in Iraq is a disaster and, believe me, it is going to get much worse before it gets better.  Even in the later years of his life, he was a virtual fountain of information about foreign policy across the world. Despite the fact that Senator Eagleton was a scholar at Amherst College in Massachusetts and Oxford and a cum laude graduate from Harvard Law School and prominent attorney and politician, he could relate to anybody. ``Just call me Tom,'' he would always say, with a warm grin and a firm handshake. That was his style--plainspoken, genuine, and usually the funniest man in the room.  His ability to be the voice of everyday Americans was the reason he was elected to three terms in the U.S. Senate and the same reason it was so hard for him to leave public service in 1986. But, characteristically, he left office with very modest words. He said:       There is no sadness in leaving public life while you still      have something worthwhile to do and the time and motivation      to do it.  And that he certainly did. In the famous style and personality that was Tom Eagleton, he went from public office but not from public life. A university lecturer, political commentator, writer, philanthropic fundraiser, community advocate, sports enthusiast, Tom continued to pursue dreams of a different kind.  While Tom shied away from claiming due credit, his good friend and colleague from the other side of the aisle, Senator John Danforth, summed up his amazing political career by saying:       What has set Tom Eagleton apart from the rest of us is not      his intellect and his energy, as impressive as they are. It      is his moral passion, his capacity for outrage, his      insistence that justice be done, that wrongs be made right.  More than what Americans gained from his victories, achievements, degrees, and accolades is the lessons we find in his words that we can take into the future:       Be civil and modest. Act with courage and integrity. Pursue      your dreams and do right by your neighbors. And most of all,      don't take yourself too seriously.  His memorial service was a wonderful tribute to Tom Eagleton. We all laughed and we cried. Some giants from the Senate were in attendance, and some Democratic ward workers from a nearby political ward who had been working the phones and putting up yard signs for 30, 40 years--all sat together and listened to great stories about a great man.  We all appreciated the fact that Senator Tom Eagleton wanted the last word. So, a year before his death, he wrote a letter--I would like to make it part of the Record today--that everyone who attended the memorial service was lucky enough to receive. It talks about his life, it talks about his service in the Senate, it talks about the things that were important to him, and about his family--which was most important to him. But you got the sense of the man even from his farewell address, and I will close today by using the last line he used in the letter he wrote that he wanted distributed at his memorial service:       So go forth in love and peace--be kind to dogs--and vote      Democratic.  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From STLtoday.com, Mar. 11, 2007]                  Thomas F. Eagleton Farewell Address       Senator Tom Eagleton wrote the following words of farewell      in May, 2006, with instructions that they be shared with his      family and friends at Saturday's memorial service.       Barbara, Terence, Christy, Michael, grandchildren Barbara,      James and Greg, and friends all:       This is my last audience and, thus, I think I am entitled      to the last word.       Using Lou Gehrig's famous quote, ``I consider myself the      luckiest man on the face of the earth.''       I have had a wonderful, understanding wife. She has endured      all of my foibles and I love her for it. I have been an      absentee father. Politics is an all-absorbing, all-consuming      profession. It takes a total, exclusive grip on one's life.      So I apologize to Terence and Christy and express how much I      love them.       I most fondly remember my mother. I was her favorite. I am      reluctant to use Nixon phraseology, but my mother was a      saint. She was a gentle woman and had the strength to put up      with such determined personalities as my father, my brother      and me.       From early days, I wanted to be a senator. My father would      have made a great one. He was a magnificent trial lawyer. He      was, in my mind, as great a speaker as FDR. He did not do so      well in politics because he insisted on making every campaign      decision by himself. I think, in a subliminal sense, I oozed      into politics because I knew I could not be as great a lawyer      as him and maybe I could prove to be a good politician.       My father was one of my three idols along with FDR and      Eugene Hecker, my English teacher at Country Day School. Mr.      Hecker thought every American should be able to read, write      and speak the English language--including his students.       My dad did not think in insular or parochial terms. He      thought a youngster should be exposed to all sorts of views.      Once he took me to the old Coronado Hotel to hear Norman      Thomas, the frequent Socialist candidate for president.      Another time he took me to see a Gerald L.K. Smith protest at      Kiel Auditorium. Smith was a racist ``preacher'' in the style      of Bob Jones of Bob Jones University.       Until 1944, dad was a Teddy Roosevelt Republican. He took      me to the 1940 Republican convention in Philadelphia where      Wendell Willkie was nominated. Dad thought Willkie was the      ``second coming'' of Teddy Roosevelt.       In 1938, dad drove me by a German Bund (pro Nazi) meeting      at Grand and Lafayette and explained the dangers of Hitler      and anti-Semitism.       He did not take me, but he arranged to have someone else      take me to Winston Churchill's ``Iron Curtain'' speech at      Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. I wrote up the      speech for the Country Day News, but left out the ``Iron      Curtain'' part as being lesser importance than other      portions of his speech.       Let me make it clear that my father did not push me into      politics. His advice to me was to first get established as a      lawyer and then consider politics. When I ran for Circuit      Attorney at age 26 he said, ``You are making a mistake. Wait      a few years.''       In the Senate, I tried my best to express and vote my      conscience. I confess to several ``hold your nose'' votes,      like support for the dreadful price support program for      cotton which, at one time, was the crop of choice in the      Bootheel of Missouri. I think Senator Phil Hart, Senator Mike      Mansfield, my wonderful friend Gaylord Nelson and Jack      Danforth were amongst senators who voted their true      conscience on every vote.       You may wonder why I mention Jack Danforth. There is a      possibility that God is a Republican, and at this point I      feel it best to cover all my bases.       I am most proud that the ``Eagleton Amendment'' was the      legislative act that finally ended U.S. participation in the      dreadful Vietnam War. I am proud of the original version of      the War Powers Act which, had it been enacted as the bill      left the Senate, would have re-established the shared powers      of the President and the Congress when our nation went to      war. This is what our Founding Father envisioned.       I am proud that, when Senator Muskie ran for President in      1972, he directed me to take over our Environmental      Subcommittee and we passed the first major Clean Air and      Clean Water Acts. By Muskie's anointment, I was the first      Vice Chairman for a standing committee in the Senate.       After leaving the Senate, I never missed being there--     except for the debate on the nomination of Bork and the      horrible, disastrous Iraq War. That war will go down in      American history as one of our greatest blunders. It will be      remembered, in part, as a curse to our Constitution when      Attorney General John Ashcroft attempted to put a democratic      face on torture. Vice President Richard Cheney and Secretary      of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also will go down in history for      their total lack of planning for post-war Iraq.       I think, frankly, people stay too long in Congress. The      world changes so rapidly that I think there should be a      consistent and continuing infusion of new blood and fresh      brain power into the legislative process. Eighteen years for      me was enough.       I set forth my own critique of my Senate service. I could      and should have done more. I had the energy. I had the      desire. In analyzing myself, I blame it on my quickly moving      attention span. Ted Kennedy has spent 30 plus years on      National Health Insurance. I could not do that. I was too      impatient. I wanted quick action and if I didn't get it in a      few years, I would move on. That is a major fault for any      legislator.       Finally, a word about the Catholic Church. This may seem to      be a strange topic to be raised by me, but we are here in      church and this is my final word. I do not pretend to be the      world's greatest Catholic. Nevertheless, I think the Catholic      Church is a vital part of American life, conscience and      thought. Just as our Constitution is a remarkable, living      code of governance and made relevant to the time in which we      live, so too the doctrine of the Catholic Church is a living      code of moral behavior and belief which must be relevant to      the time in which we live. Its timeliness relies upon its      capacity to adapt.       I am a Pope John XXIII and an Archbishop John L. May      Catholic, believing in what they said and what I believe they      would have said had they lived longer.       The outreach of the Catholic Church from Pope Pius IX to      Pope Pius XII was not the outreach of Pope John XXIII. It is      John XXIII who made the Catholic Church relevant to the 20th      Century and future popes must make it relevant to the 21st      Century. It was Archbishop May who made the Catholic Church      relevant to the 20th Century in St. Louis. In the era of a      Christian right, we seem to have merged God's power into      political power.       I am an optimist about death and believe there is a there      there. Somehow, in some manner, I will be meeting my parents,      my brother and my friends. Somehow, Bob Koster will be      waiting for me to tell me where I can buy everything 10% off.       So go forth in love and peace--be kind to dogs--and vote      Democratic.       Tom E.
