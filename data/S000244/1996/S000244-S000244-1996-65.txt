Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Secretary Ron Brown, an American who distinguished himself as a leader in the Democratic Party and an outspoken supporter of free trade while serving as Commerce Secretary.  During his youth, Mr. Brown excelled in school. His success led him to Middlebury College in Vermont, which he attended on a ROTC scholarship. After graduating in 1962, Mr. Brown entered the Army and rose to the rank of captain.  Throughout his life he held many important positions in both the private and public sectors. Secretary Brown ably assisted Senator Kennedy on his staff and with the Judiciary Committee. In addition, he was a highly sought lobbyist with Patton, Boggs & Blow.  Mr. Brown impressively unified the Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis supporters at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. His efforts propelled him to chairman of the Democratic National Committee, where he ably served for 4 years, culminating in Bill Clinton's 1992 election. Ron Brown deservedly received much of the credit for his work with the Clinton campaign.  Over the past 3 years, Mr. Brown had directed his efforts toward improving trade and commerce for the United States. He served as a proud emissary for American interests.  Mr. Brown was a talented and tireless adversary on the campaign trail as well as a distinguished member of the Clinton administration serving on behalf of the American people. I offer my condolences to the family and friends of Secretary Ron Brown.                          ____________________
