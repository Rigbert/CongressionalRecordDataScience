Today, I am introducing the Nurse Education, Expansion, and Development (NEED) Act to provide schools of nursing with grants for faculty, equipment, and clinical laboratories. The proposed grants give colleges of nursing the flexibility to use federal funds to address the very problems that keep nursing schools from hiring more teachers today.  The healthcare crisis is complicated and the challenges are immense, but the runaway costs and inefficiencies in our health care system are no longer sustainable. So as we begin to look at healthcare reform in this Congress, let's keep in mind one lesson we learned from Massachusetts' recent experience. After a landmark healthcare reform law to extend healthcare coverage to every person in the State, the sudden demand for primary care professionals outpaced the supply.  Nurses can help fill that primary care gap. Today, nurse practitioners are already taking over at the helm of primary care in many areas that don't have any primary care physicians. Nurses are staffing health care clinics, and many are opening their own practices. Increased standards of training have opened new doors for nurses who want to further their careers but do not want to attend medical school. The numbers tell the story. In 2000 there were roughly 90,000 nurse practitioners in the U.S. By 2015, it is estimated there will be as many as 135,000.  Unfortunately, the number of nurses is not keeping pace with the growing health care needs of our Nation. In 2000, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that the U.S. is 110,000 short of the number of nurses we need. By 2005, the shortage had doubled to 219,000. By 2020, it is expected we will be more than 1 million nurses short of the need.  Contributing to this shortage is a lack of faculty to teach and train future nurses. In a survey of more than 400 schools of nursing last year, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing found that 63 percent of the schools reported vacancies on their faculty. An additional 17.8 percent saidthey were fully staffed, but still needed more faculty to handle the number of students who want to be trained. Last year, nursing colleges across the Nation denied admission to 49,948 qualified applicants because there were not enough faculty members to teach the students.  Statistics paint a bleak picture for the availability of nursing faculty now and into the future. The median age of a doctorally prepared nursing faculty member is 56 years old. The average age of retirement for faculty at schools of nursing is 65 years. It is expected that 200 to 300 doctorally prepared faculty will be eligible for retirement each year from 2005 through 2012, reducing faculty even though more than 1 million replacement nurses will be needed.  The number of qualified students turned away from nursing schools in Illinois reflects the national trend and continues to grow. In 2002-2003, 502 qualified students were rejected from Illinois nursing schools. In 2008, 2,523 students were turned away because of lack of faculty and resources--over 1600 more students than in 2007. To avoid the vast shortage HHS is projecting, we have to figure out how to make a significant increase that we can sustain in the number of nurses graduating and entering the workforce each year.  My hope is that the bill I am introducing today can be part of the answer. Nursing schools need the resources to teach and train a new generation of nurses and nurse educators. Let's not take on health care reform without considering the more than 2.9 million nurses in our country today who are critical to our health care system. And as we look at improving our health care system, let's start by investing in the nursing pipeline today for the health care needs of tomorrow.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 497       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse Education, Expansion,      and Development Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds as follows:       (1) While the Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205)      helped to increase applications to schools of nursing by 125      percent, schools of nursing have been unable to accommodate      the influx of interested students because they have an      insufficient number of nurse educators. The American      Association of Colleges of Nursing estimates that--       (A) in the 2008-2009 school year--       (i) 62.8 percent of schools of nursing had from 1 to 16      vacant faculty positions; and       (ii) an additional 17.8 percent of schools of nursing      needed additional faculty, but lacked the resources needed to      add more positions; and       (B) 49,948 eligible candidates were denied admission to      schools of nursing in 2008, primarily due to an insufficient      number of faculty members.       (2) A growing number of nurses with doctoral degrees are      choosing careers outside of education. Over the last few      years, 20.7 percent of doctoral nursing graduates reported      seeking employment outside the education profession.       (3) The average age of nurse faculty at retirement is 62.5      years. With the average age of doctorally-prepared nurse      faculty at 55.6 years in 2007, a wave of retirements is      expected within the next 10 years.       (4) Master's and doctoral programs in nursing are not      producing a large enough pool of potential nurse educators to      meet the projected demand for nurses over the next 10 years.      While graduations from master's and doctoral programs in      nursing rose by 12.8 percent (or 1,918 graduates) and 4.5      percent (or 24 graduates), respectively, in the 2008-2009      school year, projections still demonstrate a shortage of      nurse faculty. Given current trends, there will be at least      2,616 unfilled faculty positions in 2012.       (5) According to the November 2007 Monthly Labor Review of      the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 1,000,000 new and      replacement nurses will be needed by 2016.     SEC. 3.
