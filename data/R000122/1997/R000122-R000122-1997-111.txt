President, this week the Senate has considered legislation to fundamentally change Medicare and other programs that are vital to millions of Americans. I realize that we must make difficult choices about these valuable initiatives as we move toward a balanced budget. However, as we seek to invest in our nation's future, we must also confront loopholes and subsidies that waste our limited resources.  The tax code contains many such loopholes, which fail to reflect our nation's true priorities. For example, the United States is subsidizing thousands of professional gamblers by allowing tax deductions for gambling losses to the extent of gambling winnings. The Joint Tax Committee reports that this deduction costs taxpayers $1.43 billion over five years.  The gambling loss tax deduction is an anomaly for individuals who frequent an industry that sells itself as providing entertainment. In general, the tax code does not allow deductions for discretionary spending on entertainment, and I believe that it is more than reasonable to hold gambling expenditures to this same standard. Repealing the gambling loss tax deduction merely increases the cost of one entertainment option, a factor that gamblers can consider in determining how to spend their discretionary income. Furthermore, while most business deductions are for investments--and even losses--that could have created needed job opportunities for our nation's citizens, this is not the case for the losses claimed by professional gamblers on their personal income taxes.  Perhaps more importantly, the gambling loss tax deduction primarily benefits professional gamblers and wealthy individuals who spend large sums on gambling. In 1994 alone, $2.78 billion in gambling losses was deducted on some 427,000 tax returns. Individuals with adjusted gross incomes of at least $75,000 claimed nearly 55% of these gambling losses, and people with adjusted gross incomes of at least $100,000 claimed an astounding 40% of these deductions.  When Congress is cutting essential programs to balance the budget, it is simply unsound policy to subsidize gamblers. I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Chafee, Senator Coats, and Senator Inhofe in supporting legislation to repeal the gambling loss tax deduction, and in taking a step to ensure that we balance the budget in a way that reflects our nation's priorities and invests in our nation's future.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation to repeal the gambling loss tax deduction be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 972       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON ANY DEDUCTION FOR GAMBLING LOSSES.       (A) In General.--Section 165(d) of the Internal Revenue      Code of 1986 (relating to wagering losses) is amended to read      as follows:       ``(d) No Deduction for Wagering Losses.--No deduction shall      be allowed for losses from wagering transactions.''       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section      shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 21,      1997.                                 ______                                       By
