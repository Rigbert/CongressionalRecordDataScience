 Rubio, and Mr. Reed) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 275       Whereas genome editing enables scientists to make changes      to the genome in organisms by removing, adding, or replacing      genetic material;       Whereas there is tremendous hope that genome editing      technologies will lead to new therapies and cures for      diseases;       Whereas unintended effects during the development of new      medical technologies can stop or delay the development of      successful new therapies;       Whereas pregnancies using genome-edited human embryos have      not been shown to be safe;       Whereas the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical      Association--       (1) was first adopted in 1964;       (2) has been revised over time; and       (3) has provided guidance to the international community on      ethical principles for medical research involving human      subjects;       Whereas there are media reports--       (1) of experiments carried out overseas in 2018 using      genome-edited human embryos in pregnancies;       (2) that those experiments resulted in the live birth of 2      babies;       (3) that the primary scientist responsible for those      experiments recognized that the experiments were carried out      too quickly and without necessary open dialogue with      regulators, the scientific community, and the public; and       (4) that an additional pregnancy with genome-edited human      embryos is underway;       Whereas the reported experiments in 2018 using genome-     edited human embryos in pregnancies failed to meet the      standards of human research ethics called for in the      Declaration of Helsinki;       Whereas the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and      Medicine has concluded that more research and broadly      inclusive public deliberation are needed before clinical      trials of germline editing of human embryos and gametes      should be permitted;       Whereas the National Institutes of Health has declared      support for an international moratorium on clinical      application of germline genome editing and is working with      other Federal agencies, international agencies, health and      science organizations, patient communities, and the public to      engage in a substantive debate about the benefits and risks      of germline genome editing research;       Whereas the World Health Organization has created an expert      advisory committee on developing standards for the governance      and oversight of human genome editing;       Whereas an international commission has been convened by      the National Academy of Medicine, the National Academy of      Sciences, and the Royal Society of the United Kingdom to      identify the scientific, medical, and ethical requirements      that should be considered before heritable human genome      editing should proceed; and       Whereas, as of July 2019--       (1) the use of genome-edited human embryos for reproduction      is prohibited in many countries; and       (2) no international agreement exists as to whether      clinical trials using genome-edited human embryos should      proceed: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) opposes the experiments that resulted in pregnancies      using genome-edited human embryos described in November 2018      media reports;       (2) recognizes that the question of whether to proceed with      heritable genome editing touches on all of humanity;       (3) supports the international commission convened by the      National Academy of Medicine, the National Academy of      Sciences, and the Royal Society of the United Kingdom to      develop an international framework regarding human germline      editing; and       (4) encourages the Secretary of State to work with other      nations and international organizations, including the United      Nations and the World Health Organization, to forge an      international consensus regarding the limits of ethical      clinical use of genome-edited human embryos.
