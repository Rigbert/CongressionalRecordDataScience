 President, I yield 30 seconds to myself. I ask unanimous consent that a statement of the Chemical Manufacturers Association be printed in the Record, as well as the list of those companies supporting this treaty.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Chemical Manufacturers                                                  Association,                                    Arlington, VA, April 18, 1997.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Biden: On April 24, the Senate will vote on      whether to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). On      behalf of nine organizations representing a broad spectrum of      chemical producers, consumers, and professionals, I urge your      strong support of this important treaty.       Opponents of the CWC contend that the treaty will have a      catastrophic impact on American business, including a      burdensome regulatory system, intrusive on-site inspections,      and losses of proprietary information. The facts, however,      bear out our belief that the CWC is the right thing to do:       Less than 2,000 facilities nationwide will have any      responsibilities under the CWC. Of these, ninety percent will      have to do no more than fill out a two-page report once a      year.       The chemical industry helped develop the procedures by      which fewer than 200 facilities will be inspected. We then      tested those provisions in a series of full-fledged trial      inspections at plant sites. We helped confirm that inspected      companies have a role in determining how inspections will be      conducted, and the extent to which inspection teams access      the facilities.       Industry representatives helped write the treaty provisions      that safeguard confidential business information. Chemical      companies worked closely with the Administration in drafting      the CWC implementing legislation that complements those      safeguards.       The chemical industry has continued its efforts to further      narrow the potential impact of the Convention on commercial      interests. We successfully advocated a complete exemption for      polymer and oligomer producers, which means that the plastics      and textile industries are not subject to the Convention. We      helped push an exemption for petroleum refineries and      explosives manufacturers. We have worked to develop      reasonable, low concentration limits that are commercially      practicable, yet provide the level of verification necessary      to assure that the CWC is not being violated.       On April 17, the Senate passed Senator Kyl's legislation,      S. 495. Although Senator Kyl's legislation would generally      expand the legal basis for domestic action against chemical      weapons proliferation, it is important that you know that S.      495 is not a substitute for the Chemical Weapons Convention.       For example, S. 495 provides no mechanism for multilateral      agreement to prevent or prohibit the production, storage,      development or use of chemical weapons. It provides no means      for investigating potential diversions to illegal weapons      uses. And it does not remedy the trade impacts that will      arise when the CWC's trade ban goes into effect three years      from now. CMA estimates that some $500 to $600 million in two      way trade will be at risk if this ban goes into effect.      Moreover, S. 495 does nothing to prevent trade barriers being      imposed by CWC Parties, aimed at U.S. trade in chemicals.       The chemical industry is America's largest exporter      surpassing agriculture, aerospace,     computers, etc. It is the world leader in technological      development, research and innovation. The industry works hard      to maintain that leadership. The industry has maintained a      trade surplus for 68 consecutive years. You can be assured      that the chemical industry would not be silent if the CWC      truly jeopardized commercial interests.       For your further information, I have enclosed a copy of an      advertisement that appeared in the April 14, 1997 issue of      Roll Call. I have also enclosed a copy of a letter signed by      members of CMA's Board of Directors, reiterating their      support for this important agreement.       In short, Senator, we need your vote in favor of the      Chemical Weapons Convention.       If you have any questions concerning the chemical      industry's support for the CWC, please call me or Claude      Boudrias, Legislative Representative for Tax and Trade at      (703) 741-5915.           Sincerely,                                              Frederick L. Webber,     President and Chief Executive Officer.                                                                    ____                                                   April 15, 1997.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Lott: We, the undersigned members of the      Chemical Manufacturers Association's Board of Directors, are      writing to ask you to support the Chemical Weapons Convention      (CWC).       We believe the Convention is a fair and effective      international response to the international threat of      chemical weapons proliferation. Ratifying the CWC is in the      national interest.       The CWC is a natural extension of existing U.S. policy. In      1985, Congress voted to end production of chemical weapons by      the military and to begin destroying existing stockpiles.       For years, the United States has imposed the world's      strongest controls on exports of weapons-making ingredients.      Our nation is the standard bearer in preventing the spread of      chemical weapons.       The CWC requires other nations to do what the United States      is already doing. That's why President Reagan proposed the      treaty to the United Nations in 1984. It's why President Bush      signed the treaty in Paris in 1993. And it's why President      Clinton is asking the Senate to ratify it.       The chemical industry has thoroughly examined the CWC. We      have tested the treaty's record-keeping and inspection      provisions. And we have concluded that the benefits of the      CWC far outweigh the costs.       Ratifying the CWC is the right thing to do. We urge you to      vote for the Convention.           Sincerely,         Frederick L. Webber, President & CEO, Chemical            Manufacturers Association; J.
