 President, I appreciate my distinguished colleague from Virginia, Senator Allen, raising this concern. I can assure him that he is correct that it makes perfect sense for provisions intended to encourage employers to fund their defined benefit pension plans by increasing the deduction limits to have the same effective date. I also agree that this should especially be true for provisions that update deduction limits for employers with a combination of plans. I look forward to working with my colleague on addressing this oversight.
