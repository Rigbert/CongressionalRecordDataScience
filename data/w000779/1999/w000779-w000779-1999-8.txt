President, and colleagues, this is the time of the legislative session when too many important bills and nominations are killed in secret through a process known as the secret hold. This session of the Senate was supposed to be different as a result of an agreement between the majority and the minority leaders. I am going to read from that agreement. On February 25, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle wrote all Senators:       All Members wishing to place a hold on any legislation or      executive calendar business shall notify the sponsor of the      legislation and the committee of jurisdiction of their      concern. Further written notification should be provided to      respective leaders stating their intentions regarding their      bill or nomination. Holds placed on items by a member of a      personal or committee staff will not be honored unless      accompanied by a written notification from the objecting      Senator by the end of the following business day.  Suffice it to say, colleagues, I suspect there are a few sponsors of legislation here in the Senate who have not been notified that there is a hold on their legislation.  I hope as we move towards the last hours of this session all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, will honor the policy set out by Senators Lott and Daschle. The secret holds are a breach of all that the Senate is supposed to stand for in terms of openness and public accountability.  I hope Senators will comply with that new policy set out by Senators Lott and Daschle.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
