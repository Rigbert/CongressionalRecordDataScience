 President, we are about to vote on cloture on the bankruptcy bill. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.  The conference committee that produced this Bankruptcy Conference Report had an even 3-3 ratio. Obviously with this ratio, Democrats on the conference held an absolute veto over the bankruptcy bill. But here we are voting on a conference report that has the support of conferees on both sides of the aisle.  What's at stake with this vote?  If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against bankruptcy protections for family farmers.  If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against targeted capital gains tax relief for family farmers in bankruptcy.  If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against a ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' for residents of bankrupt nursing homes.  If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against provisions that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Larry Summers say are crucial for protecting our financial markets.  There's a lot at stake with this vote. Let's vote for farmers. Let's vote for a ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' for residents of bankrupt nursing homes. Let's vote to protect our financial markets. Let's vote to protect our prosperity.  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.
