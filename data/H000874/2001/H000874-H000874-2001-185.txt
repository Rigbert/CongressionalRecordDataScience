Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to support this concurrent resolution introduced during Women's History Month by my distinguished friend, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur). The gentlewoman has consistently led this House on issues related to women. I want to thank her for introducing this resolution, highlighting the need to revise and reprint this important volume to which the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) has already referred.  I also want to thank the chairman for his strong support and for bringing the measure to the floor so quickly. Since the publication of ``Women in Congress,'' the number of women who have served has risen by more than 61 percent, from 129 in 1990 to 208 today. That is a remarkable rise in just 11 years.  It demonstrates, Mr. Speaker, the profound contribution that American women are now able to make to the public life of our great country, and indeed that they have made throughout the history of this Nation. We must remember that it was not always so.  There is an extraordinary woman whose name is Margaret Brent. Margaret Brent was one of the first women lawyers in the colony, one of the first women landholders. She comes from Maryland, St. Mary's County, and she was the adviser to our governor back in the 17th century.  She was made a member of the Governor's Council; added to the legislature, but they would not give her a vote. They would not give her a vote, of course, because she was a woman. She is not in this book; but if she lived today, she clearly would be.  We must remember that for too long we discriminated against women in this Nation. It is almost hard to believe that it was not until the third decade of the last century that women were given the vote in America by constitutional amendment.  Although the 107th Congress includes a record 74 women, Mr. Speaker, there were no women, not one, in the 1st Congress or the 14th or the 24th, or the 44th, or even the 64th Congress, 128 years into the history of the Congress of the United States.  Not until, Mr. Speaker, the 65th Congress, that met in 1917, during the 129th year, did a woman, Jeanette Rankin of Montana, take the oath of office as a Representative. It was not until 1922, during the 67th Congress, that a woman, Rebecca Felton of Georgia, took the oath as a Senator.  Of the more than 11,600 individuals who have served in the two Houses since 1789, fewer than 2 percent have been women.  Ironically, when Representative Rankin first took her seat in this House, women had not yet secured the right to vote nationwide.                              {time}  1645  This most cherished right of citizenship was not guaranteed for all American women until the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920. How stark a fact, Mr. Speaker, that is. We quote, and I do as well, Jefferson's historic observation that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. What a lesson it is for us that even in stirring rhetoric, our vision can be limited. Even at a time when we think we are reaching out to all, our rhetoric may exclude many. It is a lesson for us, because clearly Thomas Jefferson was one of the great democrats with a small ``D'' in the history of the world. But even Jefferson was blind to the discrimination that existed, not only against women, but against African Americans, most of whom when he intoned those words were still perceived as chattels, not human beings. How sad, but how instructive, that is.  Mr. Speaker, during the first 128 years under our present Constitution, no woman's voice could be heard in debate here. The experiences, perspectives, hopes and dreams of America's women were not voiced in this body by a woman. However, hopefully, and I believe they were expressed by men, but imperfectly so, because it is very difficult for us to walk in one another's shoes if we have a gender difference or a color difference, or even a religious or national difference. It is impossible to know how the absence of women may have affected the deliberations of the first 64 Congresses of the United States. Common sense, however, suggests the effect was not beneficial.  Fortunately, today, women not only can, but do, contribute in a direct, vital and historic way to the deliberations of this Congress and other policymaking bodies throughout the Federal, State and local governments. This is as it should be and as it should have been from the beginning.  As we move forward, Mr. Speaker, more women will have the opportunity to serve in Congress and other public offices throughout the land, strengthening and enriching our democracy. This, too, is as it should be. If I know anything about women in Congress, it is that there are not enough.  Mr. Speaker, a new edition of ``Women in Congress'' will gather in one updated volume useful, historical information for teachers, students and others, chronicling the careers of the 208 women who have served in either House to date. I am proud to support this resolution which is cosponsored by all of the women of this House. As we enter the 21st Century, we must continue to mark the progress and substantial contribution that women are making in this, the most democratic legislative body on Earth, but, I might observe, not the body that has the highest percentage of women. I am confident the new volume will quickly become, like the previous edition, a tremendous historical resource, inspiring young women across America to seek careers in public service that may one day bring them all, or many of them, to this hallowed hall.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members of the House to support this concurrent resolution unanimously.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
