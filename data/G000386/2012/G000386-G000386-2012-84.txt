 President, yesterday the Supreme Court overturned the mandatory Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act. As of yesterday, the States now have a choice to expand or not expand coverage to the poorest people in society without being subjected to harsh Federal penalties.  I would like to draw attention to a speech I gave on the Senate floor in December 2011 on the subject of the constitutionality of the Medicaid expansion. I expressed my concerns then about the potential impact of a Supreme Court decision on Medicaid expansion.  I said on the floor that day:       A Supreme Court ruling in favor of the States in this case      could not only jeopardize the mandated Medicaid expansion in      the Affordable Care Act but could challenge the fundamental      structure of Medicaid and have broader implications outside      of health care.
