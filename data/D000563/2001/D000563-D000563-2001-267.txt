President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I think it is perfectly reasonable, if someone is going to come along on the public lands owned by the taxpayers of this country and mine for profit, they should at least post a bond so if they should leave that land despoiled where there is a need for environmental cleanup there is money to do it and the taxpayers don't end up footing the bill.  The House version of this appropriations bill contains that provision. Hopefully, the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Nevada, will do everything in his power to make sure it is included as part of the conference.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
