President, reserving the right to object, this nomination for the Sixth Circuit, and the others that will be made by the majority leader, have not had the benefit of any hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe that hearing should take place before a lifetime appointment is given to any person to the Circuit Court. So, on behalf of Senators Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, I object.
