After four years, hundreds of volunteer hours given by dozens of volunteers, and many donations and financial contributions from generous sponsors, the citizens of Monclova will dedicate a reconstructed and renovated historical Post Office. Bill Strayer and Mary Kay and Connie Nuhfer of the Monclova Historical Society prepared a wonderfully descriptive history of the building and the effort to restore it, which I am pleased to submit for the Record.            A Brief History of the Monclova Old Post Office       By the late 1800s and early 1900s, Monclova Township      boasted a variety store, a mercantile, a drugstore and a      barbershop, as well as wagon makers, blacksmiths, and a      lyceum. Home mail delivery was also provided to area      residents following the Rural Free Delivery legislation      enacted by Congress. Ira Hinkle became the first mail carrier      in the Township, using a horse and covered wagon on good      weather days and riding the horse in snowy weather. Claire      Metzger became the first Postmistress of Monclova Township on      March 19, 1915; she served for 41 years before retiring on      October 31, 1956. Prior to Miss Metzger becoming      Postmistress, the Trapp Mercantile Store housed the Monclova      Post Office. Claire, however, had a cement block building      erected on property owned by her father, John Metzger,      creating the first stand-alone post office in the Township.      This one room building was unique in that it was the only      post office in the country to have a piano; Claire would      often entertain her customers by playing songs on it. The      post office continued to operate until December of 1961, when      the current Monclova Post Office opened on the corner of      Monclova and Waterville-Monclova Roads.       Within a few years after its creation, the Monclova      Historical Foundation was approached by the Kerscher family      to see if its members would like to have the old Post Office      building that now sat empty. The Kerschers, who owned the      land where the old post office was located, requested that      the building be moved from its current site and relocated on      the Community Center property. At that time, the Foundation      did not have the resources to take on the property and so the      project was put on hold.       In 2004, however, the Foundation was approached by retired      Master Carpenter and builder Ray Parker. He and friend Peggy      Brown were willing to take on the project of saving and      restoring the old building. In June 2004, a letter was signed      granting the Foundation ownership of the old Monclova Post      Office with the condition that it be removed from the      Kerscher property. In early fall 2004, a meeting with Ray      Parker, Peggy Brown, Bill Strayer, then president of the      Foundation, and Tom Meyer, architect and friend of Bill's,      met to discuss what had to be done to move the building. Ray      made detailed drawings of the building including noting where      each block was located. There were four different style      blocks used in the Post Office and Ray wanted to be sure it      would be reconstructed exactly as it was before it was taken      down.       A few weeks later a group of volunteers took apart the      building block by block. The blocks themselves were the only      part of the building that were salvageable, but small pieces      of trim were saved to be used as a pattern for creating new      trim work. The blocks were stored behind the Community Center      until plans, prints, permits and funds were ready. In late      summer 2005, reconstruction of the old Post Office began and      the building was under roof by winter. In early 2006, Ray      Parker died of cancer. Peggy, along with Bill and many other      volunteers, have worked to complete the building the way Ray      would have wanted. Over seventy volunteers have put in      hundred of hours of work on the project and contributors have      given both large and small donations in order to make this      restoration possible. On May 24, 2008, the building will be      officially dedicated; it will then be used as a museum for      area school-children and visitors to explore and to learn      about the history of this great community.                          ____________________
