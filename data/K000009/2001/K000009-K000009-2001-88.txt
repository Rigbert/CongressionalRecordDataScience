 I thought I would also like to place on the record a comment made by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) a little bit earlier. His time expired, but in other comments that Secretary Martinez made before the Subcommittee on Housing that the gentleman from Massachusetts is the ranking member of, he mentioned that Mr. Martinez said that, in terms of money available to HUD this year, that the Department of Energy estimated that utility costs would be going down; that before the Subcommittee on Housing he actually stated that the Department of Energy had told him to tell us that utility costs would be going down.  I find that incredible. The operating funds that exist in this bill will not be sufficient if you look at what is happening to utility rates across this country.  So this program is even more necessary in order to keep the cap on crime, keep arrests up, keep neighborhoods more safe and help with the prevention programs that the gentleman from West Virginia has so aptly described.  I thank him for yielding to me and for his support of this program.
