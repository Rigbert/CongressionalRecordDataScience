I try to think of things other people have not talked about. I do not even know right now whether I am going to be for or against this budget, but I had looked, and I was very alarmed. The minority staff on Armed Services did some research, and it came out that there are some parts of this act that we did not know were there. It would include an annual adjustment for retired pay and retainer pay for retired members of the Armed Forces under age 62. This penalizes current and future military members who have served our Nation for over 20 years.  Now, keep in mind, people go into the military quite young sometimes, knowing that the time they would serve would be for 20 years--many of them longer but most of the time 20 years. That is kind of a given. They do this predicated on the assumption that retirement benefits and all these things are going to be there. They are making a career decision, I say to the Chair, and that is very significant.  To come along with a bill that supposedly saves $6.2 billion--there are about 2 million retirees. Of those, just under half are under the age of 62. They would see a steady erosion of their retired pay, approaching 20 percent of their retirement pay by the time they reach age 62.  The 1-percent annual reduction to uniformed service retired pay cost-of-living adjustment--those are the COLAs--for those under age 62 will have a devastating, long-term impact for those who retire at the 20-year point. It implements an annual adjustment to retired pay of the ``Consumer Price Index -1%'' beginning in December of 2015. What that means in summary is that you could have a gunnery sergeant retiring at age 42, and by the time he is 62, this bill would cause him to receive in his retirement pay approximately $72,000 less than he would otherwise. So it is a big deal.  This has not been discussed on the floor, and I think that as we get into the discussion we are going to have on the budget, we have to keep these things in mind. Again, I have not decided yet because I know it is not an easy job. I know we had a Democrat and a Republican working very hard on it. But that is one thing that I believe can be changed. In fact, it would have to be changed before I would support it.                   National Defense Authorization Act  Well, we went through something, and I want to talk a little bit about the National Defense Authorization Act. Every year we have a National Defense Authorization Act. That act is more important than anything else we do around here, in my opinion.  If you read the Constitution, it will say that providing for the Nation's defense is our major concern. This is what we are supposed to be doing. So we have always had--in fact, for 51 consecutive years we have passed an NDAA bill prior to January. It has always been that way. This is a budget that must take place.  This is very disturbing to me because the House passed an NDAA bill some time ago. We in the Senate Armed Services Committee, way back--was it May or June--we passed the NDAA out of our committee, not unanimously but almost unanimously, and it was bipartisan, had strong bipartisan support to come to the floor. Well, it never came up. And why it never came up is not that important right now. The fact is that we are now in a position where we have to do it and have to have one come up, and it has to be this coming week.  So, anyway, we put together a bill. There is something a lot of people do not understand because it is not very often used, but when the House and the Senate are not able to put something together, they go to the big four. They get the committee of jurisdiction--in this case, the Senate Armed Services Committee. So they had the chairman and the ranking member--the ranking member is the one who has the most rank from the minority, and that is me in the case of the Senate--and then the chairman of the House and the ranking member of the House. Four people. We sat together 10 days ago here in Washington and put together a bill, taking the best parts out of the House bill, the best parts out of the Senate bill, and put together this thing, and it is one that I think--when people understand it--it is one for which I do not know of anyone who would really oppose it.  The problem we are having is that the way it was done was not the way it should have been done. It should have been done as it has been done in the past; that is, to take about--in the last 10 years, it has taken 9 days on average to pass this bill, where we have all of the amendments processed and people come forth with amendments. Well, that did not happen this time. So what we did in this bill is we took 79 of the amendments that people had in the House and the Senate--Republicans and Democrats--we did 79; that is, 41Republican amendments and 38 Democrat amendments. These are ones that had been submitted on the Senate floor, and we were able to go ahead and put these into the bill.  So we have a good bill. It is out there. We really need to do it. People are concerned about the process. I am concerned. We are going to get busy to make sure this does not happen in future years. We do not want it to happen. But we do not want our service people, who are in harm's way today, to be paying for the fact that we had a procedure that was wrong. We have a vehicle here. We have a bill. It will come up for consideration. It will come over from the House, and I anticipate in the first part of the week we will have this bill.  What does it do? First, it authorizes 37 special and incentive pays, including reenlistment bonuses and certain health bonuses. Here, we are talking about people who are considering reenlisting. Right now they are in the service.  I mentioned a minute ago some of the aviators. Well, this is mostly the Army and the Marines and the Navy. These people are making career decisions. They make career decisions predicated on what they anticipate is going to be out there, and what is going to be out there is what kind of a bonus they will get at the time. Of course, in the event this does not happen, they would not be entitled to these bonuses, if we do not pass this bill. That is how significant it is.  When you talk about certain health professional bonuses, they would expire also.  These health benefit bonuses are very significant, because these are the people who are the health providers for our Wounded Warriors, not just the ones that are in our hospitals today but also in hospice care. We cannot do that to them.  However, if we do not pass this bill, that is going to be a real serious problem. There has been a lot of talk about sexual assaults. We have two Senators, both Democrats, Senator Gillibrand and Senator McCaskill, who disagree with each other but who have amendments. So what we did is take parts of each one of those amendments--27 specific reforms to support victims and to encourage sexual assault reporting and an additional nine enhancements to the military justice system.  Arguably the one on the floor who knows most about this would be our friend Senator Graham. I think he has looked at these and agrees that these provisions are really very significant, and things that are not going to be there otherwise. These would have been in the House bill and in the Senate bill in the regular procedure to pass these bills, but they will not be there if we do not pass this one bill. They are there.  Gitmo. I look around the Chamber, and it seems like there is such a diverse attitude toward what we have done in the past and will do in the future with Gitmo. That is Guantanamo Bay down in Cuba. I have often said from this podium that is one of the few good deals that we have. We have had Gitmo since the year 1904. It costs $4,000 a year. Half the time Castro does not collect it. So it is a pretty good deal which you do not often get in the government.  It is very expensive to house people there. But it does perform a function that cannot be performed anywhere else. So last year in the National Defense Authorization bill, we put a provision in there, fortunately at that time, that would restore the 1-year prohibition on transferring Gitmo detainees to the United States and to prohibit constructing any type of facility to house them if they are successful in doing that.  That was not good. It should have been forever. But it expires now. That means if we do not have this bill, we will cede that to the President. The President will have total control. If he wanted to take every one of these terrorists out of Gitmo and send them to Yemen or put them in the United States, he could do it. So that is probably one of the most significant parts of this bill.  So this restores the 1-year prohibition on transferring Gitmo detainees to the United States, and it prohibits the construction or modification of facilities in the United States to house Gitmo detainees.  Our training ranges. This bill provides DOD with access to millions of acres of Federal land. Keep in mind, it does not cost anything; it is Federal land--for military tests and training ranges that are really absolutely necessary for the readiness of our combat forces.  We have all heard about end strength. The Obama administration I have often said I think will go down in history as the most antidefense President ever. One of the things that we know is going to happen is the end strength will continue to reduce. This bill allows the Army and the Marine Corps' top people to make the decisions as to where this end strength is going to be reduced and by what amount. By doing this, they can accelerate the strength reduction and save a considerable amount of money. So they will have the flexibility to draw down faster, save money, do it quicker and do it better. Without this bill, they cannot do that.  Military construction. You know, no other military construction can take place. But what is worse than that is, on military construction that has already been started, that is new construction, they would have to stop that military construction. When you do that then you come back later and start it again, it costs millions and millions of dollars more, a lot more money.  Here is another good example of another area that would be a huge savings. Right now we are working on several aircraft carriers. One is CVN-78, the USS Ford. It is a huge project. It is 75 percent completed. We have already spent $12 billion on it. In the absence of this bill, that construction would have to stop. Now, I know that we would come to our senses and maybe in a few months come up with a CR that might have money that would go toward this.  But that is still--when you stop and then start up again, it would be millions, hundreds of millions of dollars of cost. That is corrected in this bill. Not to say anything about the number of people who would be immediately released: 4,300 ship builders who work directly on the ships, and about 1,500 who work indirectly. So it is an economic issue for a lot of people. That is important but not as important as the fact that it is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars if we do not pass this bill.  The LCS. This allows the littoral combat ship construction to continue in the shipyards. That is in Alabama and Wisconsin. Again, it does not happen if this bill is not passed. That is not going to happen.  Special operations. I think we are all familiar with the special ops guys. I know the chair is very familiar with that. These are the ones who go out there in harm's way and take the risk and are specially trained. The commander there is Admiral McRaven. That is his No. 1 priority--the preservation of special operations forces and families after the 12 years of sustained combat by authorizing various human, resiliency and family care programs. In other words, these people, many of them have families. The families are cared for in a way that has been certainly well deserved by the fighter that they represent. Yet those programs would stop in the absence of this.  So I think that is very important. Just looking at the human end of it, the families, the mothers and the kids that are back there. They have special needs because of the sustained deployments that these great troops have. I would mention also, that in addition to some of the things that we have talked about in using some of the Federal land, this includes land use agreements to ensure special operations. That is what we were just talking about, so the special operations forces have sufficient access to training ranges, including the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range in California, which serves an indispensable role in training Navy seals.  In fact, when you go and you watch them, you see that you cannot train our Navy seals without this facility. So this takes care of that.  Lastly--I could mention a whole lot more--one of the significant things people are taking about is waste in the Pentagon. This provides for an audit of the Department of Defense. It requires a full audit of DOD no later than March 31, 2019. It will take a long time to do this. It has never been done before. This bill will call for the beginning of this process.  We all know about the nuclear triad. The nuclear triad gives us that nuclear capability in our bombers, ICBMs and our submarine-launched ballistic missiles. This bill prohibits the elimination of one of those three legs. We have seen a lot of programs. You could save so much money if you eliminate the submarine element of that.  But in order to adequately protect America, it is important that we have all three legs. So that nuclear triad--and remember that phrase. That is the one where one leg would be eliminated in the absence of this bill.  The prohibition on tech transfers with Russia. This would prohibit the transfer of some missile defense technology to Russia and strengthen the Congressional oversight of the administration's efforts with regard to the United States and Russia's missile defense cooperation.  You know, if we do not do it, the President is going to do it. I would hope that anyone who would be voting in this Chamber knows that is a key issue, and it should be a key issue. We recognize, if we do not continue to take control of that in the Congress, then that would automatically go to the President. I do not think we want that to happen. We all saw what happened in the first budget that the President had. I would never forget that, because I went over--I knew that he was going to be antimilitary, antidefense. So I went over to Afghanistan to respond to it, knowing full well that we were going to have to do something to let the American people know how bad that budget was on the military.  In that first budget of President Obama's, it was 4\1/2\ years ago, almost 5 years ago, he did away with our only 5th generation fighter, the F-22; did away with our new lift capacity, the C-17; did away with the Future Combat System, which is the only advancement we have had in about 30 years in our ground capability.  He did away with the ground-based interceptor in Poland. Now, let's keep in mind, the ground-based interceptor in Poland is one that we were putting there because we have currently 33 ground-based interceptors here in America, but they are on the west coast. That is where the threat was at that time. Now things have changed. We found out in the year 2007--it was not even classified. Our intelligence said that Iran is going to have the nuclear capability and a delivery system by 2015, and 2015 is just a little over a year away from right now.  So we knew that way back in 2007. We started building a ground-based interceptor in Poland, with a radar in the Czech Republic. I thought we were doing very well. We had to give them the assurance that we would not pull the rug out from under them if they would cooperate. Then that went out. That was withdrawn in the President's first budget 4\1/2\ years ago.  Now we are faced with that threat. Because if something comes into this country from Iran, it is going to come from the East. If there is a lucky shot from the west coast, that is fine. But I do not have that confidence that could happen. So I say that because it fits in with the missile defense. It directs the administration in this bill to make improvements and modernize the ground-based midcourse defense system. That is what we are talking about here.  Without this, that could probably--not probably, possibly--be the most significant thing that we have been talking about here, because now we are talking about an incoming missile to the United States.  The BRAC process, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. We have had five of them since 1987. Whether you are for a base closure or not, that is not as significant as it is that we are at a time in history where we have the greatest need to put back some of the money that has been taken out by this administration into our defense system. As good as a lot of BRAC systems are, the fact is that the first 3 to 5 years of the BRAC, it costs money, it does not save money. That is what we cannot let happen. So we restrict the use of funds to conduct a round of base realignment and closures for the coming year, because people are talking about that.  Here is a big one too that means a lot. It means a lot to my son, Jimmy, who is real big time into Second Amendment rights. We are from Oklahoma. We actually believe that stuff. We believe in the Second Amendment to the Constitution, I say to my friend in the chair.  There is a treaty called the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty that the U.N. has. I am the wrong one to talk about this, because I have never seen anything good come out of the United Nations. But in this case it is worse than usual. The UN Arms Trade Treaty is one that our Secretary of State has already signed onto. But it has to be ratified by the Senate.  Well, in this bill, it restricts the funding to implement the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty without the Senate's advise and consent on the treaty. Well, that is important. In fact, it reminds me a little bit of what happened when we had the budget vote a few months ago. At that time, I am trying to remember now, but I think it was 5 o'clock in the morning. You would be surprised the kind of amendments you can get passed at 5 o'clock in the morning.  So at 5 o'clock in the morning, I had an amendment that said that we would not allow the United States to join--to be a part of the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. That was good. But this reinforces that and says that--it restricts it. So if we were to do it, even if the Senate were to do it, it would restrict the funding so it cannot happen.  So I would say to all of my friends out there who believe in Second Amendment rights, who have been concerned that through a U.N. treaty you could lose the Second Amendment rights, do not worry about it because we would have it. If we pass this bill, you are going to be well taken care of.  So I feel very good about the provisions in this bill, I really believe that, when you stop and think about the fact that we actually had 79 amendments that were agreed to in this bill that we tried to pass before.  The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted its version of the NDAA by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in June, and yet we know what has happened. We know why it is necessary because this is the last shot we actually have at a bill.  The House, at 11 o'clock Friday morning, will go out of session. They will be adjourned for this year. The week after that the Senate will. That shows the time we have to get all of this done. That is why there are those individuals who say: You don't have to adopt a bill that the four of you put together. Even though it may be good, we want to have a lot of amendments and go through that process. Unfortunately, there is not time because if we did that it would have to go over to the House. They are already adjourned as of 11 o'clock Friday morning.  We are out of time and the only choice we have now is either to adopt this or not have a bill at all. As frustrated as I am about the process, we have a commitment to provide our military men and women the support that they require, and we have a bill that will do that. If we fail to pass the NDAA, it would send a terrible signal to all of our troops over there.  I have a card of some of the things that we would lose that I mentioned on that rather lengthy list may not happen until next year, may not happen until the first part of the year. Some of them would take place in February and some in March. What would happen is a question that was asked by our fine Senator Fischer from Nebraska.  She said: What would happen at the end of this year on December 31. What provisions would we lose if we don't pass this bill?  The answer is there are several of them, and I will highlight a few of them. One would be the bonus for new officers in critical skills, the incentive bonus for conversion to military occupational specialty to ease personnel shortages. For those of us who have been in the military, that is called the MOSs.  The incentive bonuses for transfer between armed forces. Someone who is transferred from one area to the other, we have the obligation to pay his expenses and without those bonuses, we wouldn't be able to do it.  Aviator officer retention. I mentioned a minute ago that one-third of the combat squadrons were deactivated, they were grounded and the pilots with them. I talked about that and how General Welch gave us a good documentation. That endured for 3 months. At the end of the 3 months theamount of that money that was saved by grounding that equipment was far offset by the amount to get people back up to the correct qualifications.  One of the things that would happen is the aviation officer retention bonus. This is to keep these pilots in the service, because it costs much less to retain a pilot than it does to retrain one and start from scratch. I know that. We have a couple of the Rangers in my State of Oklahoma in Vance Air Force Base where I will be tomorrow. That is one of the largest centers that we have training pilots.  Our problem is a pilot shortage. One of the reasons is because, as I just said, if they are grounding these airplanes these pilots finally say: If I can't fly, I am getting out of here.  There have been a lot of them who have left. The only thing that would hold them would be the existing aviation officer retention bonus. This gives a bonus for someone to re-up.  If anyone has been in the services, they will remember--as I do from the U.S. Army--that when they are trying to get people, to encourage people to re-up, it is a lot cheaper to retain someone than it is to retrain them. We give them bonuses. We did that when I was in the service. That is a bonus they would not get.  With already a serious problem with a shortage of pilots, we have to do something about that. That would abruptly stop December 31. That means the pilots making this decision may not even know this. They may decide they are going to do it and then they find out they don't have a retention bonus.  The assignment pay or special duty pay, this would be for transfers. This would be something you would not be able to do, as well as the hardship that would have to be borne by the military.  Healthcare professionals bonus. This is important. If we go out to Walter Reed and see the great job that is done by the professionals with our wounded warriors, it does impress people to see what is going on. I am very excited to see that program has been good. But these health care professionals operate on a bonus or special pay. That would stop December 31.  I know they are committed, they would stay as long as they could, but some of them couldn't afford to do that. This would stop on the January 31.  Reenlistment bonus for active members, that would stop also.  What I am saying is we are going to have to do this bill. It is absolutely necessary. I am not the only one who says that.  If we look at General Dempsey--talk about the deteriorating condition of our military now--keeping in mind that with this President over 4\1/2\ years ago, over this 10-year budget, he has taken over $487 billion out of the military, if we have Obama sequestration as it is designed now, that will be another $500 billion. That is a total of $1 trillion.  General Dempsey is the top military person in the military. He is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  He said:       But I will tell you personally, if ever the force is so      degraded and so unready, and then we're asked to use it, it      would be immoral to use the force unless it's well-trained,      well-led and well-equipped.  Admiral Winnefeld, the second in charge, the vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said: ``There could be for the first time in my career instances where we may be asked to respond to a crisis and we will have to say that we cannot.''  Secretary Hagel, I opposed his confirmation when he was in. Actually, I think he has improved so much more than I thought he would since that time. He is not afraid to talk about these things. He said: ``If these abrupt cuts remain, we risk fielding a force that over the next few years is unprepared due to a lack of training, maintenance, and the latest equipment.''  It is America he is talking about. This is the Secretary of Defense.  Another thing General Dempsey said--in fact, I carry a card around with me because a lot of people don't believe this. General Dempsey at one time in February 2013, this year, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that: We are putting our military on a path where the force is so degraded and so unready that it would be immoral to use force.  General Odierno, the Commander of the Army, said: Additionally, it is unlikely that the Army would be able to defeat an adversary quickly and decisively should they be called upon to engage in a single, sustained major combat operation.  When we talk about a major combat operation, we are talking about one they used to call the combat operations where major contingencies are on a regional basis.  Our policy, since World War II, has been able to do this to defend America on two regional fronts. That has gone out the window and we are not able to do that anymore.  Secretary Hagel also said: ``If sequester-level cuts persist''--which is what we are talking about, the second half trillion that Obama would be taking out of the military--``we risk fielding a force that is unprepared.''  I can't imagine hearing that from our own Secretary of Defense, but it is there.  I wish to show us why our choices are down to only one choice.  On this chart if we look at December, today is the 12th. The House leaves at 11 o'clock Friday morning. They are gone, they are gone for the rest of the year. Anything we do that has to go to the House, they won't be there. It can't be done. We work for 1 more week starting the December 16, this coming Monday, and we go all the way through the week where we will be in session. Anything we would do or pass or amend could not go to the House, and that means we would go into December 31 without any kind of advance authorization. On that basis it is significant and that shows we actually have to do it.  I think I mentioned this. I have a chart, but I don't have it in front of me--show since 1970 we always have had our Defense authorization done before January. The only two exceptions to that were when they were vetoed by the President on two occasions and we had to override the veto. Nonetheless, that is why this month is the last chance we have to do it.  I would mention that there is such popular support for this around the country that we have extremes--not really extremes--but publications generally considered to be on the progressive or moderate side and some conservative.  This is one where both the Heritage Foundation and the Washington Post say let's pass the defense deal. It has to pass.  The Heritage Foundation has an extra paper that if there is time later on I may make some quotes from that.  The Washington Post says:       With the end of 2013 rapidly approaching, Congress has an      opportunity to rise above a year of massive dysfunction and      prevent major disruptions in U.S. defense operations. The      leaders of the Senate and the House armed services committees      have managed to fashion a bipartisan version.  That is what we are talking about when I say the big four, so this is what we are talking about.  Continuing:       It's a decent compromise that the leaders of both chambers      ought to embrace and bring to a vote in the coming days.       A failure to do so would be a new political low for this      Congress. The NDAA has been passed 51 consecutive years, even      when much of the rest of government had to make do with      temporary authorities. But much more than political symbolism      is at issue. Though defense funding ultimately must be      provided by appropriators, the authorization bill extends      vital Pentagon authorities and ultimately sanctions new      operations.       If no bill is approved by Jan. 1, combat pay and bonuses      for U.S. troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere would be      suspended; work on major weapons systems, including a new      aircraft carrier, would be halted at considerable cost; and      support for the Afghan army and the disposal of Syria's      chemical weapons would be interrupted at a critical moment.       The bill also contains important measures to combat sexual      crimes in the military.  We talked about that, but this is being editorialized, not by me on the floor of the Senate, but by the Washington Post.  They talk about Guantanamo Bay and they say:       . . . advance the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison--  It could take place in the absence of this legislation.  Continuing:       Though a proposal was favored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand      (D-N.Y.), providing for the prosecution of sex crimes outside      the military chain of command, it was not included--did not      receive a Senate vote--some three dozen other reforms in      legislation would make the punishment of these crimes     more likely while providing more protections to victims.  Let me conclude this editorial by reading the next-to-the-last paragraph.  It says:       Other measures in the bill ought to attract broad      bipartisan support. The effects on defense of the so-called      sequester would be eased by transferring money to operations      and training from less essential accounts, such as      construction and staffing in office headquarters. The      Pentagon is still vulnerable to a $50 billion sequester cut      in January unless a separate budget deal can head it off. But      passage of the authorization act would prevent the worst      disruptions of ongoing operations.  It goes on to say that this is in the House and the House, very likely, is going to pass it, and send it over to the Senate, and they strongly support it.  We have letters from all of the Armed Services to us and to the leader, Senator Harry Reid. This one is from Martin Dempsey. He is urging us to pass this. It is not only me and a handful of Senators, this is the military speaking. He is the top military personnel.  He said:       I write to urge you to complete the National Defense      Authorization Act this year. The authorities contained      therein are critical to the Nation's defense and urgently      needed to ensure we all keep faith with the men and women,      military and civilian, selflessly serving in our Armed      Forces.  He goes on to say, ``This is the most significant concern we have right now,'' that we may not be able to pass this bill.  We have a letter from General Welsh. General Welsh, if you remember, is the chief of the Air Force. He is the one who is so upset with the fact we had grounded some of our combat squadrons. He says:       The FY14 NDAA contains critical authorities that enable us      to protect the American people while keeping promises to our      active duty, Guard, Reserve and civilian Airmen. If this      important legislation is not enacted I worry about      significant impacts to Air Force operations that could      jeopardize the missions we are tasked to perform.  He goes on to say how important that is; that it is a matter of life and death to many of the airmen who are out there.  We have the same thing from General Amos of the Marine Corps, who says:       . . . our hard-won gains on the Twenty-nine Palms land      expansion will be threatened, and the construction of the      next generation aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford,      will stop. Passage of the this vital legislation will prove      to our Marines and Sailors our unwavering support.  That is what we are talking about because those are the guys who are out there.  I see my good friend from Arizona Senator McCain, and I would say I have been talking about the degraded condition of our military right now and how much worse it is going to be if we are not able to do this bill that I have outlined in some detail. Hopefully, we will be successful in doing that.
