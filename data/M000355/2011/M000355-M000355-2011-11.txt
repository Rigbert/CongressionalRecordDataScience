 President, I stand today to honor an outstanding Kentucky hero and patriot, SPC John O. Berry, Jr. SPC Berry is a veteran of the Vietnam war who has received numerous awards and commendations for his heroism and bravery in serving his country.  John O. Berry, Jr., of Wayne County, KY, grew up a typical kid--he spent his time hanging out with friends, listening to music, and enjoying time spent with his brothers and sisters. On September 18, 1968, however, John answered a call to duty, and his life was forever changed when he joined the U.S. Army.  John received his introduction to the Army and basic training at Fort Knox, KY, before being sent to Fort Leonard Wood, MO, to complete his advanced training. Four short months later, John had achieved the honor of combat demolition specialist with Company A, 299th Engineer Battalion, and was sent to a fire base in North Vietnam.  John's job was especially dangerous. He was responsible for ensuring the roads were free of the many deadly land mines that were strategically placed by the Viet Cong. Although scores of Americans were killed by these mines, John and other courageous demolition engineers were responsible for saving thousands of additional lives by dismantling the mines throughout the war.  Over the years John has received many distinguished awards and honors for his bravery and service to our country. Included in these honors are two Purple Hearts, two Army Commendation Medals for heroism and exceptionally meritorious achievement in the Republic of Vietnam, two National Defense medals, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm, which was awarded by the Republic of Vietnam to those who display valor and heroic conduct in combat.  These awards only represent a small portion of the gratitude we owe John for his selflessness and courage. According to the Department of the Army's account of a rescue mission in which John's unit was sent to aid an ambushed team, ``John distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous action. . . . He demonstrated admirable courage and devotion to duty as he unflinchingly performed his task without regard to personal safety. His actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.''  Mr. President, I would ask that my Senate colleagues join me in thanking SPC John O. Berry, Jr. for his sacrifice and service. John's heroism is truly inspiring, and the people of our great Commonwealth are grateful for his selflessness and service. The Wayne County Outlook recently published an article thanking Specialist Berry and highlighting his accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:             [From the Wayne County Outlook, Nov. 9, 2011]            Berry Received Medals for Service to His Country                            (By Harlan Ogle)       Here's the way the Department of the Army tells the story:      He ``distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous action .      . . while serving as a member of a reactionary force sent to      aid the mine sweep team which had been ambushed. . . . When      he and other members of the reaction force dismounted their      vehicle they immediately came under heavy enemy fire. With      complete disregard for his own safety, [he] formed one line      with the other members of the force and moved towards the      front. He and the others laid down a base of fire which      enabled the trapped mine sweep to break contact. The reaction      force then advanced still further into the kill zone to      continue firing while Delta Company's casualties were carried      out. [He] demonstrated admirable courage and devotion to duty      as he unflinchingly performed his tasks without regard to his      personal safety. His cool-headedness in the face of      conditions which would unnerve a weaker man served to inspire      his comrades to follow suit. [His] actions were in keeping      with the highest traditions of the military service and      reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United      States Army.''       Could these words be a description of the bravery      demonstrated by such heroes as Sergeant Alvin York, who is      probably the most recognized veteran of World War I? Maybe      these words describe Audie Murphy, the most decorated      American of World War II?       No!       These words describe the man who could be Wayne County's      most decorated soldier of the Vietnam War.       These are words that depict the extreme bravery of a      veteran who still lives in our midst. These words describe      one of our country's real heroes.       These are words contained in General Order 847 that      officially awarded the Army Commendation Medal for Heroism to      John O. Berry, Jr., who presently lives in the Gap of the      Ridge community of Wayne County. John is the son of Willie      Lee (Sloan) Berry and Johnny Berry.       He spent his childhood as most any other boy would--going      to school, hanging out with his friends, listening to music,      growing up with his brothers and sisters: Ted, Fred, George,      Stella, Mae, Maggie, and Alene, and just generally enjoying      life.       Until.       Until September 18, 1968. That's when John became a soldier      in Uncle Sam's Army.       He took his basic training at Fort Knox and advanced      training at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. Just four short      months after entering the Army, he was sent to a fire base in      North Vietnam.       He had become a combat demolition specialist with Company      A, 299th Engineer Battalion.       His was a dangerous job because he had the responsibility      of clearing the roads of the deadly mines placed by the Viet      Cong.       Thousands of American service men were killed by these      mines. However, because of the sacrifice and courage of      soldiers like John O. Berry, Jr., thousands of lives were      saved as these demolition engineers dismantled the mines.       Specialist Four John O. Berry, Jr., served his country with      dedication and commitment. That service was continually      recognized as he received numerous awards and commendations.      Some of those distinguished awards include:       --Two Purple Hearts (a combat decoration awarded to members      of the Armed Forces who are wounded by an instrument of war      in the hands of the enemy).       --An Army Commendation Medal with first oak leaf cluster      ``for exceptionally meritorious achievement in support of the      United States's objectives in the counterinsurgency effort in      the Republic of Vietnam . . . . Through his outstanding      professional competence and devotion to duty he consistently      obtained superior results. Working long and arduous hours, he      set an example that inspired his associates to strive for      maximum achievement. The loyalty, initiative and will to      succeed that he demonstrated at all times materially      contributed to the successful accomplishment of the mission      of this command.''       --A second Army Commendation Medal with ``V'' device ``for      heroism in the Republic of Vietnam'' distinguishing himself      by meritorious achievement and service.       --Two National Defense medals.       --Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross w/Palm awarded by the      Vietnam Government to military personnel who have      accomplished deeds of valor and displayed heroic conduct      while fighting the enemy.       Eventually John was discharged from the Army, and when he      returned to Monticello, he continued serving his country by      joining the local National Guard.       Today, John lives in the Gap of the Ridge community and      walks among us as one of our nation's heroes. More      especially, John is one of Wayne County's heroes!       He shares that role with two of his brothers who also      served in the military during the Vietnam War: Ted in the      Navy and Fred in the Army.       A grateful community proudly recognizes John O. Berry, Jr.,      and salutes him and all the other men and women who have      sacrificed more than the average citizen will ever know.       Specialist Four John O. Berry, Jr., we salute you and thank      you from the bottom of our hearts for your service to our      country!       On Veterans Day 2011, we pray that you will be able to      accept the fact that you are, indeed, an American hero!       You are our hero!                          ____________________
