Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment and let me tell my colleagues why, basically. There are 2 million Federal employees. They work essentially from administration to administration. Every President, every administration will tell any one of us that one of the problems they have is making the Government work to its policies.                              {time}  1915  That is understandable, understandable from the standpoint of those whohave been there, who want to consistently follow the policies they have been following. And the frustration of getting the government to conform to the policies of the President is also understandable.  Now, the political appointees are committed to the President of the United States, whoever he might be, to carry out the policies of the administration. Frankly, that is what the electorate expects. Now, to pretend that political appointees are not necessary or that we can cut them down to an ever-increasing smaller number is to simply take from our Presidents the ability to effect their policies.  Now, George Bush in 1992, had 3,290 political appointees or 1,000 more than this amendment affects. President Clinton has less appointees than President Bush, not by a whole lot, 3,147, 150 or 5 percent less than President Bush had. Those folks are for the purposes of ensuring the President of the United States with the ability to carry out policy.  When the people vote for President in 1992 or 1996, they expect their President to be able to effect the policies in concert or in cooperation with and in concert with the Congress. Political appointees are not good or bad. They are necessary. They are essential in a democratic system for a democratically elected official to carry out their policies.  On the other hand, in the 1930's, we said, look, 100-percent patronage is wrong. It is debilitating. It leads to very bad policies. So we adopted a Civil Service system. Actually, we had adopted it long before that, about, I suppose, in the latter part of the last century. And we said, we are going to give to the overwhelming majority of employees Civil Service protection, because what we ask them to do is not to make policy but to carry it out in a ministerial function. Some of them obviously are very high level and they obviously have decisions to make. But the fact of the matter is, they are professional employees, expected by their government to carry out the policies of Republicans and Democrats irrespective of administrations. I suggest to my colleagues that they do just that.  This amendment undermines the ability of a President to effect policies and is, therefore, wrong. I will speak to it again.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
