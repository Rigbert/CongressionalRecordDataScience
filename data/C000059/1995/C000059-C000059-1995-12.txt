Chairman, I rise to join my colleagues in support of H.R. 70.  Whether or not the ban on Alaskan oil exports made sense in 1973, it is having harmful and unintended consequences today. This ban has effectively forced Alaska to sell the bulk of its production in my home State of California and has severely damaged our oil and gas industry.  Left in place, the ban will ensure a further decline in the production of crude oil in Alaska and California, resulting in thousands of lost jobs.  For the small businesses that make up the bulk of the oil and gas industry in California, this legislation is vital to their future. If they can sell heavy crude oil into a market that no longer is distorted by artificial restraints, they will have a future producing oil.  In recent weeks, prices have been edging down. Today, Kern County heavy crude was posted at $13.75 a barrel.  We need to do something to help get them back to the levels at which significant investments will be made.  Many of the independent oil producers have told me they will begin hiring the minute this bill is enacted. So the potential for job gains is quite real.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 70 and provide the oil and gas industry of my State with relief.
