President, today the Senate is considering the nomination of William Pryor for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. This is a nomination which I have considered many times in the Senate Judiciary Committee and outside the regular business of Congress. Senator Jeff Sessions and I occasionally get up early in the morning and go to the Senate gym. And on several occasions he has raised with me his heartfelt support for William Pryor. I have expressed to him my reservations and concerns about Mr. Pryor, and he has tried to assure me, in different ways, that the public image of this man is much different than who he really is. I struggle with this because I do count Senator Sessions as a friend despite our many political differences. I would like to give him the benefit of the doubt on this nominee who is so important to him personally.  Unfortunately, the debate that leads up to today's consideration on the floor has raised a myriad of questions that need to be resolved, questions which go to the heart of this nomination.  Mr. Pryor was recess-appointed by President Bush when both he and Judge Pickering of Mississippi were not approved by the Senate. It was historic. It was a decision by the President to use his recess appointment power to put Mr. Pryor on the bench, despite the Senate's decision on his nomination. I agree with Senator Kennedy that Mr. Pryor's recess appointment, which occurred during a brief recess of Congress, could easily be unconstitutional. It was certainly confrontational. Recess appointments lack the permanence and independence contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution. To confirm Mr. Pryor now would validate the President's regrettable decision to defy the Senate.  I am afraid that many aspects of the debate, relative to the Pryor nomination, mark a low point in Congress. Many of Mr. Pryor's supporters allege that those of us who questioned his nomination or opposed him did so because of his religious beliefs.
