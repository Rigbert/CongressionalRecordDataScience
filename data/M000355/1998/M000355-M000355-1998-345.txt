 President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary career of Mr. Anthony Higdon, who retired last month after 41 years of service to his country and the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky as a member of the U.S. Air Force and as an employee of the Social Security Administration .  After four years in the Air Force, Mr. Higdon spent the last 37 years working for the Social Security Administration, serving the needs of Kentucky's senior citizens. His career included 20 years as manager of the 3 Social Security offices in Louisville. Before that, he served in other capacities in the Louisville offices, as well as at the Social Security branches in Elizabethtown, Hazard and Hopkinsville, Kentucky.  One of Mr. Higdon's most important legacy will be his tireless work with national and community leaders in Kentucky to impress upon them an understanding of the dramatic importance of Social Security programs to all people throughout their lives.  Mr. President, Anthony Higdon will be sorely missed by all his friends and colleagues at the Social Security Administration offices across the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As he retires to the community which he has spent most of his life serving, we wish him best of luck and thank him for his service.                          ____________________
