 What we did with these dollars is, we focused them directly in an area where we know it makes a difference in the learning of children. In addition, unlike many other Federal programs, we made sure it was not spent on bureaucrats or paperwork or administration. These dollars are targeted directly to the classroom. That is why it has been so effective. That is why it is so well loved by so many districts.
