Mr. Speaker, as the chief sponsor of this legislation, I am pleased that the House is now considering H.R. 1420, a bill that will modernize the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966.  When I began this effort over 2 years ago, my goal was to enact an organic law that would ensure a bright future for our Nation's 92 million-acre refuge system. Our objectives also included creation of a statutory shield to ensure that hunting and fishing and other forms of wildlife dependent recreation could continue within the system and to facilitate those traditional activities, where compatible, with conservation. In my judgment, this legislation will accomplish these goals.  H.R. 1420 is the product of many long hours of thoughtful negotiations between the Department of the Interior, and I want to stress that, between the Department of the Interior, the original cosponsor of the bill, the staff of the gentleman from California, Mr. Miller, and those representing the hunting, conservation, and environmental communities. In particular, I want to compliment Secretary Bruce Babbitt for his personal commitment to this effort and for hosting these discussions. This process could well serve as a model to resolve other legislative differences.  I would also like to thank my good friend, I just noticed he was on the floor, I do not know where he went, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell], who was the father of the refuges. He worked very hard with me over the years developing these refuges and the refuge system itself. Without his leadership, I doubt if this could have taken place. And again I want to thank the staff for participating because they worked very hard.  But H.R. 1420 is not a perfect bill. It is not everything I wanted. I want to stress it is a compromise that has been endorsed by the Clinton administration and with such diverse groups as the Izaak Walton League, the National Rifle Association, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Safari Club International, Wildlife Legislative Fund of America, and the Wildlife Management Institute. I want to stress that these people support this legislation.  The major components of this new bill are that it statutorily defines the term ``compatible use.'' While the refuge manager will retain the power to determine what is compatible, this language should provide the necessary guidance to make the proper decision.                              {time}  1445  It defines the term ``wildlife dependent recreation'' to mean hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography, or environmental education and interpretation and expressly recognizes these as priority uses of the system. This bill neither mandates nor prohibits such nonwildlife-dependent activities such as grazing, jet skiing, or oil and gas development.  The bill will establish for the first time a mission for our Nation's 509wildlife refuges. This statement stipulates that the mission of the system is to administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation, management and, where appropriate, the restoration of fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.  When administering the system, it is the policy of the United States that compatible wildlife-dependent recreation is a legitimate and appropriate general public use of the system and will be given priority consideration in refuge planning and management. In addition, the Secretary is directed to ensure that opportunities are provided for compatible wildlife-dependent recreational activities within the refuge system.  Finally, Congress finds that these activities, including hunting and fishing, have been and are expected to be generally compatible with the mission of the system and purposes of the refuges.  The legislation contains an important requirement that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service make a determination, prior to land acquisition, whether existing wildlife-dependent uses may continue during the implementation of a management plan. By so doing, the citizens will know up front whether their favorite fishing and hunting spots will remain open and, if they are unhappy with the decision, they can lobby their congressman prior to the acquisition of the proposed refuge land.  H.R. 1420 requires the completion of a conservation plan for each of the 509 refuges within 15 years of the date of enactment. We should know what kind of natural or wildlife resources exist on these refuges.  Finally, this bill contains language that ensures that the act will not affect Federal, State, or local water rights and will not affect the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The key fundamental change between this legislation and H.R. 511 is the deletion of the six systemwide purposes. Under this compromise measure, the hierarchical structure will be the conservation mission of the system, the purposes of each individual refuge unit, compatible wildlife-dependent recreational uses, and then nonwildlife-dependent activities.  While States will retain primacy over the management of fish and wildlife, the mission of the refuge system will be satisfied and individuals will have an opportunity to enjoy compatible wildlife-dependent recreation. After all, it is the American people who have helped to pay for the acquisition of the 92 million acres of Federal refuge lands with their hard-earned tax dollars.  In the final analysis, this is a sound piece of conservation legislation that is true to the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt and reaffirms the vision of the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 1420, and again I want to thank all my colleagues that were involved directly in this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
