President, I rise to commend the Senator from Washington State for her dogged pursuit of a funding source for this bill. I agree with her that it is so important we have dedicated funding so the promise of this bill can become the reality.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to Senator Murray's amendment No. 4929.
