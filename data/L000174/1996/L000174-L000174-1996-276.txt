President, I also ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in support be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   United Nations,                               High Commissioner for Refugees,                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1996.     Re Special Exclusion Provisions of S. 269.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I wish to express UNHCR's sincere      appreciation for your efforts during the 14 March Judiciary      Committee mark-up session to remove the special exclusion      provisions of S. 269. These provisions, found in Sections      133, 141 and 193 of the bill, would almost certainly result      in the U.S. returning bona fide refugees to countries where      their lives or freedom would be threatened.       As noted in my 6 March letter to Judiciary Committee      Chairman Orrin Hatch, we offer our views regarding S. 269      with the hope that you and the other members of the Judiciary      Committee will seek to adhere to the standards and principles      set forth in the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of      Refugees, to which the U.S. acceded in 1968.       In particular, UNHCR is concerned with the following      special exclusion provisions:       (1) Lack of due process--Sections 133, 141 and 193 provide      few procedural safeguards to ensure that true refugees are      not erroneously returned to persecution.       (a) No administrative review--Under Section 141, special      exclusion orders are not subject to administrative review (p.      IB-4, line 19). Minimum procedural guidelines for refugee      status determinations specify that an applicant should be      given a reasonable time to appeal for a formal      reconsideration of the decision. This principle is set forth      in UNHCR Executive Committee Conclusion No. 8 (1977).\1\ The      ``prompt supervisory review'' provided for in Section 193 (p.      IC-36, line 12) does not meet these minimum procedural      guidelines.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ The UNHCR Executive Committee is a group of      representatives from 50 countries, including the United      States, that provides policy and guidance to UNHCR in the      exercise of its refugee protection mandate.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       (b) Limitation on access to counsel--Under Section 193,      asylum-seekers arriving at US ports of entry with false      documents or no documents are permitted to consult with a      person of their choosing, only if such consultation does      ``not delay the process'' (p. IC-36, line 25). Such a      limitation is in violation of the principle that applicants      for asylum should be given the necessary facilities for      submitting his/her case to the authorities, including the      services of a competent interpreter and the opportunity to      contact a representative of UNHCR (UNHCR Executive Committee      Conclusion No. 8 (1977)).       (2) Limitation on access to asylum--Section 193 provides      that individuals presenting false or no documents or who are      escorted to the US from a vessel at sea are not permitted to      apply for asylum unless they traveled to the US from a      country of claimed persecution and that the false document     used, if any, was necessary to depart from the country of      claimed persecution. UNHCR requests the US to remove this      limitation and to adhere to international principles which      provide as follows:       (a) ``[A]sylum should not be refused solely on the ground      that it could be sought from another State. Where, however,      it appears that a person, before requesting asylum, already      has a connexion or close links with another State, he may if      it appears fair and reasonable be called upon first to      request asylum from that State'' (UNHCR Executive Committee      Conclusion No. 15 (1979) (emphasis added)).       (b) When refugees and asylum-seekers move in an irregular      manner (without proper documentation) from a country where      they have already found protection, they may be returned to      that country if, in addition to being protected against      refoulement (i.e. protected against return to a country where      their lives or freedom would be threatened), they are treated      in accordance with ``recognized basic human standards''      (UNHCR Executive Committee Conclusion No. 58 (1989)). UNHCR      is prepared to assist in practical arrangement for the      readmission and reception of such persons, consistent with      these international standards.       (3) Credible fear standard--Sections 133, 141 and 193      create a new, heightened threshold standard that asylum-     seekers must meet before they are permitted to present their      claims in a hearing before an immigration judge. Under these      sections, asylum-seekers who are brought or escorted to the      US from a vessel at sea (Sections 133 and 141), who have      entered the US without inspection, but have not resided in      the US for two years or more (Section 141), who arrive during      an ``extraordinary migration situation'' (Section 141) or who      arrive at a port of entry with false documents or no      documents (Section 193) must first establish a ``credible      fear'' of persecution before they are permitted to present      their claims in an asylum hearing before an immigration      judge. UNHCR urges the adoption of a ``manifestly unfounded''      or ``clearly abusive'' standard which would reduce the risk      that a bona fide refugee is erroneously returned to a country      where s/he has a well-founded fear of persecution. This      international standard for expeditious refugee status      determinations is set forth in UNHCR Executive Committee      Conclusion No. 30 (1983).       We are hopeful that you will support the elimination of a      deadline for filing asylum applications. Failure to submit a      request within a certain time limit should not lead to an      asylum request being excluded from consideration (UNHCR      Executive Committee Conclusion No. 15 (1979)). Under this      international principle, the US is obliged to protect      refugees from return to danger regardless of whether a filing      deadline has been met.       Again, I thank you for your efforts to ensure that refugees      are protected from return to countries of persecution. Please      do not hesitate to contact my Office if UNHCR may be of any      further assistance to you, your staff or other members of the      Committee.           Sincerely,                                            Anne Willem Bijleveld,                                                   Representative.
