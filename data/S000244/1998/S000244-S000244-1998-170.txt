Licensing federally owned inventions       ``(a) Authority.--A Federal agency may grant an exclusive      or partially exclusive license on a federally owned invention      only if--       ``(1) granting the license is a reasonable and necessary      incentive to--       ``(A) call forth the investment capital and expenditures      needed to bring the invention to practical application; or       ``(B) otherwise promote the invention's utilization by the      public;       ``(2) the Federal agency finds that the public will be      served by the granting of the license, as indicated by the      applicant's intentions, plans, and ability to bring the      invention to practical application or otherwise promote the      invention's utilization by the public, and that the proposed      scope of exclusivity is not greater than reasonably necessary      to provide the incentive for bringing the invention to      practical utilization, as proposed by the applicant, or      otherwise to promote the invention's utilization by the      public;       ``(3) the applicant makes a commitment to achieve practical      utilization of the invention within a reasonable time;       ``(4) granting the license will not tend to substantially      lessen competition or create or maintain a violation of the      Federal antitrust laws; and       ``(5) in the case of an invention covered by a foreign      patent application or patent, the interests of the Federal      Government or United States industry in foreign commerce will      be enhanced.       ``(b) Manufacture in United States.--A Federal agency shall      normally grant a license to use or sell any federally owned      invention in the United States only to a licensee who agrees      that any products embodying the invention or produced through      the use of the invention will be manufactured substantially      in the United States.       ``(c) Small Business.--First preference for the granting of      any exclusive or partially exclusive licenses under this      section shall be given to small business firms having equal      or greater likelihood as other applicants to bring the      invention to practical application within a reasonable time.       ``(d) Terms and Conditions.--Licenses granted under this      section shall contain such terms and conditions as the      granting agency considers appropriate. Such terms and      conditions shall include provisions--       ``(1) retaining a nontransferrable, irrevocable, paid-up      license for the Federal agency to practice the invention or      have the invention practiced throughout the world by or on      behalf of the Government of the United States;       ``(2) requiring periodic reporting on utilization of the      invention, and utilization efforts, by the licensee, but only      to the extent necessary to enable the Federal agency to      determine whether the terms of the license are being complied      with; and       ``(3) empowering the Federal agency to terminate the      license in whole or in part if the agency determines that--       ``(A) the licensee is not executing its commitment to      achieve practical utilization of the invention, including      commitments contained in any plan submitted in support of its      request for a license, and the licensee cannot otherwise      demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Federal agency that it      has taken, or can be expected to take within a reasonable      time, effective steps to achieve practical utilization of the      invention;       ``(B) the licensee is in breach of an agreement described      in subsection (b);       ``(C) termination is necessary to meet requirements for      public use specified by Federal regulations issued after the      date of the license, and such requirements are not reasonably      satisfied by the licensee; or       ``(D) the licensee has been found by a competent authority      to have violated the Federal antitrust laws in connection      with its performance under the license agreement.       ``(e) Public Notice.--No exclusive or partially exclusive      license may be granted under this section unless public      notice of the intention to grant an exclusive or partially      exclusive license on a federally owned invention has been      provided in an appropriate manner at least 15 days before the      license is granted, and the Federal agency has considered all      comments received in response to that public notice. This      subsection shall not apply to the licensing of inventions      made under a cooperative research and development agreement      entered into under section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler      Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3710a).       ``(f) Basic Business Plan.--A Federal agency may grant a      license on a federally owned invention only if the person      requesting the license has supplied to the agency a basic      business plan with development milestones, commercialization      milestones, or both.       ``(g) Nondisclosure of Certain Information.--Any basic      business plan, and revisions thereto, submitted by an      applicant for a license, and any report on the utilization or      utilization efforts of a licensed invention submitted by a      licensee, shall be treated by the Federal agency as      commercial and financial information obtained from a person      and not subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5,      United States Code.''.       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The item relating to section 209      in the table of sections for chapter 18 of title 35, United      States Code, is amended to read as follows:``209.
