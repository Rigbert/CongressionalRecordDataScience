From a humble beginning as a student on a state scholarship at the University of Maryland, Jim rose to head one of the leading construction companies in the United States. Professionally, his lifetime has been filled with magnificent buildings and public spaces; his less-public achievements have been equally successful. Jim Clark is an individual of great kindness and generosity, exemplified by his philanthropic efforts. He has given generously and without reservation to his alma mater, his community and his country. By brilliant example, Jim Clark's flames of achievement have built a better world, and in so doing, have lighted the way for all of us. Jim also has been blessed with his wife Alice, his 3 children and 10 grandchildren. We wish this truly remarkable man all the love and happiness he deserves on this special occasion.                          ____________________
