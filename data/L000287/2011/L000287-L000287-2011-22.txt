Madam Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart at this moment of great sadness in our nation's history. The violence we witnessed last weekend in Arizona still seems so unreal, so shocking, so unbelievable. Only a few days ago, Representative Gabrielle Giffords stood in the well of the House reading the First Amendment, and today she is fighting to regain her ability to speak.  I keep hoping that in the midst of this great tragedy, we will say enough is enough. I keep hoping we will finally find it necessary to teach the way to love, the way of peace and non-violence, not only to our children, but that we will embrace it among ourselves as adults and as national leaders. We pray a special prayer today for all of the people of Arizona, but especially Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly.  Representative Giffords is one of the most hopeful, optimistic people you would ever want to meet. She is wonderful. She is smart, and she is beautiful. I hope that one day soon she will rejoin us in this chamber. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families of all those who were hurt, those who are still struggling to be made whole, and with the families of all those who were slain. May God bless them all in these difficult hours.
