 President, I would like to discuss the Kennedy amendment, which passed the Senate earlier today by unanimous consent. This amendment would require that the Director of National Intelligence submit to Congress a new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's security situation. At the outset, I would note that Senators Roberts and Stevens should both be applauded for their efforts to improve the original Kennedy amendment.  That said, I would like to make clear my understanding of the Kennedy amendment, as modified. I believe that the Kennedy amendment, if enacted, should be interpreted to mean that the intelligence community should undertake an objective analysis of the situation in Iraq.
