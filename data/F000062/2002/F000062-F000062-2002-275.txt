 President, I will quote from a March 5 letter of the American Public Gas Association by its president, out of Fairfax, VA:       As you know, Enron operated in what was essentially an      unregulated environment. While there will be much more to      come in the wake of Enron, one thing is perfectly clear      today--our Federal Government has an obligation to make sure      that no important trading activities fall between the cracks,      leaving some energy markets without a Federal agency with      oversight authority. Your amendment remedies this glaring      deficiency.       The American Public Gas Association is fully committed to      support our effort to reverse the action Congress took just      15 months ago in the Commodities Futures Modernization Act.      The Commodities Futures Modernization Act amended the      Commodity Exchange Act by allowing some energy contracts to      be traded with no Government oversight. We firmly believe      that the CFTC must have at its disposal the necessary      jurisdiction and authority to protect the operational      integrity of energy markets so that (1) transactions are      executed fairly, (2) proper disclosures are made to      customers, and (3) fraudulent and manipulative practices are      not tolerated.  I ask unanimous consent that the full letter be printed in the Record following my remarks.
