President, I wish to also ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, through the Chair: Is it true that the Senator limits the application of his modification of mortgages by the Bankruptcy Court to families earning less than 150 percent of State median income, which would be somewhere in the range of $60,000 to $70,000 a year in most States--annual income of most States--and would not cover those, for example, in the State of California and other States where they have higher incomes and higher mortgages?
