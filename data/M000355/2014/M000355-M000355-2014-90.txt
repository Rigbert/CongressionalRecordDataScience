 President, today I would like to begin by remembering two men to whom we owe so much: Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson. Exactly 16 years ago these Capitol policemen were shot in the line of duty, paying a terrible price in defense of every one of us--Senators, staffers, pages, fellow officers, and every American citizen who passes through these hallowed halls. These men knew the grave risk that came with the job. Yet they chose to wear the badge anyway. They made the decision to stand in defense of the democratic ideal this building symbolizes.  We owe these men a debt that can never be repaid. So let's never forget their lives or their final act of heroism. We are reminded every time we pass the Capitol Police headquarters, which bears both of their names. We are reminded every time we notice the plaque in the Capitol that commemorates them. We are reminded by observing today's men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police as they continue to protect this institution, honorably continuing the watch of these two fallen officers.  Today the Senate honors Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson for their sacrifice. We send our sincere condolences to the family and friends left behind.                          ____________________
