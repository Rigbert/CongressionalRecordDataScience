 President, I yield myself 1 minute or less. We are getting ready to vote on the Fair Credit Reporting Act. We were able yesterday to move it to where we are today. We believe we have put together a bipartisan bill. We expect a heavy vote on both sides of the aisle. It is a complicated piece of legislation.  I commend Senator Sarbanes, my colleague and the ranking Democrat, for his leadership in helping us to get where we are today.  I yield back the remainder of my time.
