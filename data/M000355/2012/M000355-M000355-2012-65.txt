 President, with the new year fast approaching, all eyes are on Washington and whether the two parties can come together and agree on a plan to avoid a massive year-end tax hike. I truly believe we can. I believe the two parties can avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, and in the process I even believe we can agree on a framework for a bipartisan plan to address the even bigger problem of our Nation's fiscal solvency.  But there are clear obstacles to success. If we are going to succeed, if we want to avoid a job-killing tax hike and put the country on a path to solvency, we need to be clear about what the obstacles are.
