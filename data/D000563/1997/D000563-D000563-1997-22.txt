President, I rise today with my distinguished colleague, Senator Grassley, to introduce the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1997. This sensible and bipartisan piece of legislation is designed to check many of the serious abuses in the Bankruptcy Code while maintaining a workable system.  Neither Senator Grassley nor I can ignore the evidence that there are some people who are taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Code. Their numbers may not be great, but every abuse undermines confidence in the code. As with all systems, the Bankruptcy Code is subject to abuse. People can and will manipulate it. Senator Grassley and I have introduced this legislation to attempt to curb many of these abuses. We have worked hard to craft a bill that is balanced--that corrects creditor and debtor abuses. It also attempts to catch abuses without being so harsh that it makes the system unworkable and without turning its back on the fundamental principles and good of the Bankruptcy Code.  Hovering in the background of all that we attempt to do in this legislation is the persistent news that personal bankruptcy filings are steadily increasing. Last year, personal bankruptcies broke the 1 million barrier. And this year will be worse. No one sitting in this room today can help but shudder at the prospect of 1.3 million personal bankruptcies this year.  The odds are that almost every American knows at least one person who has declared bankruptcy. Both Senator Grassley and I vividly remember the farm crises of the 1980's when good, hard-working people came to the end of the line and were desperately trying to save their homes and their children's future. So they declared bankruptcy. We also remember the floods that swept through our States not too long ago that left a financial catastrophe as deep as the natural catastrophe. We must not lose sight of these people.  This jump in personal bankruptcies in good economic times is distressing, in large measure because it is a sign that many people--people we know--are in trouble.  As distasteful as bankruptcy is, the fact remains that we need the system. We cannot dismantle or radically alter it without doing serious damage to our economy, to creditors, and to millions of individuals. The cold hard fact is that the bankruptcy system does not just help individual debtors. It helps the creditors too. And by and large, it works.  To see how, imagine a world where people could not declare bankruptcy when they were in financial straits. In this world, each individual creditor would have to file suit in State court when the debtor defaulted. Only the first unsecured creditor to the courthouse door could get garnished wages to pay off the debt. The secured creditors could repossess all of the secured property. Meanwhile, all of the remaining creditors would get nothing, and the debtor would be left without an automobile, a home, or any assets and with next to no money after wage garnishment. There would be very few winners in that situation.  In stark contrast, the Federal bankruptcy system offers creditors and debtors a comprehensive system--paid for at public expense--which attempts to protect the creditors while also giving the debtor a chance to restart hislife. Without our system, each creditor would be clawing his way through the State court system, racking up legal costs, achieving virtually nothing, and turning millions of debtors into financial outcasts.  Some people credit our voluntary individual bankruptcy system to the English author Daniel Defoe, who in 1697 proposed something akin to our current chapter 7. Defoe made some very wise distinctions. He felt there was a difference between the ``honest debtor, who fails by visible necessity, losses, sickness, decay of trade, or the like'' and the ``knavish, designing, or idle, extravagant debtor, who fails because wither he has run out his estate in excess, or on purpose to cheat and abuse his creditors.''  He also had something to say about creditors, praising the ``moderate creditor, who * * * will hear reasonable and just arguments and proposals'' while warning against the ``rigorous severe creditor * * * without compassion, full of ill language, passion, and revenge.''  It took almost 150 years for the American Congress to implement Defoe's suggestion, although many individual States had acted before then. In 1841, having experienced the Panic of 1837, Daniel Webster introduced and passed a bill that allowed individuals to voluntarily file for bankruptcy and discharge their debts. It is not surprising that the central subject of debate 156 years ago was whether debtors who could actually pay their debts would nevertheless try to avoid them by declaring bankruptcy. Some things never change.  Even as we focus on the Bankruptcy Code and its possible abuses, however, we should be very careful that we do not obscure a far more important and dangerous feature of our consumer economy--the proliferation of risky credit. Merely making bankruptcy abuse harder to get away with is only a small part of the equation. Another part is preventing bankruptcies in the first place by encouraging more responsibility from banks as well as consumers.  Let me make this clear, I am happy to root out abuses in bankruptcy and to encourage people to repay as much as possible within the bankruptcy system. But I insist that I be met half way--that banks and consumers do all they can to encourage healthy lending patterns and responsible money management.  Mr. President, we may never be able to fully understand why bankruptcies have jumped so much. But a few things are clear. First, personal bankruptcy rates are tied to increased consumer debt burdens. The higher the level of credit card debt a person has, the greater the chance that the person will declare bankruptcy. And individual consumer debt is very high. In 1996, consumers charged more than $1 trillion on credit cards. According to the Consumer Federation of America, an estimated $374 to $396 billion in debt was being revolved or incurring interest obligations.  To most people, accumulating credit cards seems easy and problem free. The waters look awfully enticing when someone sends you a credit card. But there is a dangerous undertow. And as people move further from the shore, they risk getting caught by the undertow. Essentially people are placing themselves on the edge and not leaving enough of a margin for dealing with an unexpected fiscal calamity.  Yet rather than trying to blame anyone for bankruptcies, let us try to find a way to avert future bankruptcies. Both halves of the bankruptcy equation can and should act more responsibly. For creditors, that means providing consumers with enough information to assess the risks. For debtors, that means taking a hard look at what they can and can't afford.  People need to know about the deadly undertow associated with credit card solicitations. Right now people know more about what is in a box of cookies by looking at the nutritional label than they know about their credit cards. We need something like nutritional labels for credit cards.  I have previously proposed four important changes to the way people get and use credit.  First, companies should include in each bill to current cardholders information that details how long it will take that person paying only the minimum to pay off the credit card debt. In addition, the information should indicate how much of the overall payment would be interest.  Second, companies soliciting customers should provide the potential cardholders with an easy-to-understand worksheet to help them determine whether they really can afford more debt. Such a worksheet might include calculations of a person's expenses--current unsecured debt, home mortgage, rent, and other costs--and a simple formula to help people see whether they can or can't afford another card.  Third, companies should tell people the basis of the offer of more credit. When a person gets a preapproved credit card, he or she should know that the credit card company has not fully evaluated how more consumer debt could affect their overall financial health.  Finally, credit card companies should provide people who accept their card a free copy of their credit report.  These simple things might help quite a bit. Too many people are walking into consumer credit counseling bureaus, bankruptcy lawyers' offices, and bankruptcy court without any real understanding of their financial situation.  Mr. President, let me conclude on this note: I am proud to join Senator Grassley in introducing this bill and in trying to prevent abuses of the Bankruptcy Code. But I believe that we must also work on something infinitely more constructive--we must try to help prevent financial catastrophes. What I propose is a small step in that direction which works on the principle that a well informed consumer is best able to protect himself.                                 ______                                       By
