Speaker, ``When the work underground stops, everything above pays the price.''  That solemn observation was made by a TV reporter one week ago in Boone County, West Virginia.  News was breaking that two local coal mines were soon going to be laying off workers--one preparing to layoff 116 miners in a matter of weeks.  On Tuesday this week, we learned of Alpha Natural Resources will be closing 8 mines and laying off 1200 workers.  I met with the Alpha CEO shortly after the announcement, and he lamented the administration's regulatory assault on coal.  Sadly, the list of layoffs goes on because of the administration's ``all of the above, but nothing from below'' energy policy.  Coal is the cornerstone of our economy--estimates suggest that every mining job creates an additional 3.5 jobs.  We are electricity independent--and we want to stay that way.  Coal is Abundant. Coal is Affordable. Coal is Reliable. Coal is Jobs.  Today, the House will stand up for jobs, families, and affordable energy.  We must Stop the War on Coal.                          ____________________
