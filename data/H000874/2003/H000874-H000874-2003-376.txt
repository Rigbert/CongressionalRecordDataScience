 Mr. Leader, as you know, there was great consternation and concern on our side of the aisle about how this massive tax bill was considered today, not only in terms of the fact that we did not get to offer a substitute but also in terms of the very abbreviated time that such a major piece, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. English) referred to it as the most important bill that we might consider during this session of the Congress, was given 1 hour of general debate.  Given that, can you give any assurances that when the pension bill comes to the floor that we will be given an opportunity to offer a substitute and that sufficient time to discuss such a major piece of legislation will be allotted?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate my friend yielding. Obviously we will work with you to do whatever we can to allow the minority side to have a substitute that is germane to the bill. We think it is important that you be allowed to debate these issues and have an alternative if you choose to offer one. The gentleman is correct, the pension bill is a very important bill and should have enough time to be fully discussed by this House.
