 President, I have said repeatedly--and I will say again today--the Senate needs to know whether the majority leader intends to uphold a commitment he has now twice made, and this commitment was that he would not break the rules of the Senate to change the rules.  Specifically, both at the beginning of the last Congress and at the beginning of this Congress, he committed to the Senate and to the American people that he would not use what is referred to as the ``nuclear option.'' These were very clear commitments. They were not contingent commitments or commitments made with caveats. They were not contingent commitments or commitments made with caveats.  Here we have the exact words of the majority leader on this chart. At the beginning of the previous Congress, on January 27, 2011, the majority leader said:       I agree that the proper way to change Senate rules is      through the procedures established in those rules, and I will      oppose any effort in this Congress or the next--and listen to this, I say to the Presiding Officer and my colleagues--     or the next--or the next, meaning the Congress we are in now--     to change the Senate's rules other than through the regular      order.  No contingencies, no caveats, no saying unless I decide I don't like certain behavior.  In this Congress there was an exchange between myself and the majority leader. Here is what I said on January 24 of 2013, this year:       Finally, I would confirm with the majority leader that the      Senate would not consider other resolutions relating to any      standing order or rules this Congress unless they went      through the regular order process?  At the beginning of this session, we passed a couple of rules changes, a couple of standing orders. We made some changes and we made those changes in return for the majority leader's commitment, which follows. The majority leader said:       That is correct. Any other resolutions related to Senate      procedure would be subject to a regular order process      including consideration by the Rules Committee.  In other words, an unequivocal, noncontingent commitment, so that everyone knew the rules of the Senate for the entire Congress. There was no sort of hanging a sword of Damocles over our heads and saying, if Members don't behave as I wish, I will break my word. Now the suggestion apparently is, Members have to behave in a certain way to satisfy me or my word doesn't mean anything.  This is a serious matter. We are only one-half of 1 year through a 2-year Congress, and the Senate and the American people deserve to know whether the word of the majority leader will be kept.                          ____________________
