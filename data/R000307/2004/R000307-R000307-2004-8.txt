President, this amendment simply clarifies language in the McConnell-Reid amendment regarding the staffing of the Intelligence Committee.  The amendment ensures that the professional staff of the Intelligence Committee and the personal staff now designated by Members to serve on the committee will be provided similar access to committee resources and information as determined by the chairman and vice chairman.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank Senator Kyl for his assistance. It provides modest but important clarity to the proposals of Senator McConnell and Senator Reid.  I yield the floor.
