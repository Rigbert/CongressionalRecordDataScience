We hope they will. We believe this is a very important and good piece of legislation, but we also know that there are discussions in the Senate with respect to the various provisions of that bill.                              {time}  1630  This House, as the gentleman knows, passed that bill pretty handily through the House last year, in the last Congress. So we are hopeful that the Senate will take action and the bill will be in a form that will be effected.  With respect to the Panama Canal Treaty, that has not been submitted by the administration yet, and we will have to wait to see when they will submit that bill. I do know, as you know, that Mr. Kirk has indicated that the administration has discussed the possibility of submitting that trade agreement.
