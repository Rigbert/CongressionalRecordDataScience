 Some of the programs offered are child care, Head Start, GED classes, job training, substance abuse prevention, delinquency prevention, teen centers, counseling, and health and fitness for all children, youth, families, and adults. They have partnerships with public housing projects, juvenile courts and schools. It is of utmost importance to me that the Congress not urge the IRS to change current IRS policies in a way that will hurt our communities and our families. The IRS has determined that adult fitness is a charitable activity as long as the organization serves a broad segment of the community. does the committee intend that this determination be changed?
