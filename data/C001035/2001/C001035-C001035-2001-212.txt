President, today, along with Senator Kerry, I am introducing the Mercury Reduction and Disposal Act of 2001. This bill addresses the very serious problem of mercury in the environment and mercury disposal. It takes special aim at one of the most common and widely distributed sources of mercury, and that is mercury fever thermometers.  Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that is widespread in the environment and particularly harmful to developing children and pregnant women. In fact, a National Academy of Sciences report released last year attributed mercury exposure to birth defects and brain damage in up to 60,000 newborn children each year.  Although mercury can be safe in an elemental form or in amalgamations such as dental fillings, mercury takes on a highly toxic organic form known as methylmercury when it enters the environment. Methylmercury is almost completely absorbed into the blood and distributed to all tissues, including the brain. This organic mercury can accumulate in the food chain and become concentrated in some species of fish, posing a health threat to those who consume them. For this reason, 40 States have issued public health warnings advising certain individuals to restrict or avoid consuming fish from certain affected bodies of water.  Mr. President, the largest sources of mercury in the environment include incinerated solid waste, powerplant emissions, and emissions from chlor-alkali plants, such as the now closed HoltraChem Manufacturing Company in Orrington, ME.  About 50 tons of mercury are estimated to enter the environment from medical and solid waste incinerators, about 45 tons from powerplant emissions, and a large but uncertain amount derives from chlor-alkali plants.  Of the 50 tons of mercury that enters the environment from medical and solid waste incinerators, mercury thermometers are one of the largest, if not the largest, source. The EPA has estimated that mercury thermometers contributed approximately 17 tons of mercury to solid waste per year in the early 1990s. Although this number may well be declining due to innovative efforts, such as those in towns like Freeport, ME--the first town in Maine to ban the sale of mercury fever thermometers--it is still a very large amount.  Mr. President, I have a mercury thermometer right here. It is very familiar to all of us. Many of us know from personal experience how easily it can be broken. I have broken a couple myself, and not realizing the dangers of mercury back then, I used my hands to gather up the various beads of mercury and throw them away, not realizing the danger I was creating.  In fact, in 1998, the American Poison Control Center received 18,000 phone calls from consumers who had broken mercury thermometers.  This one mercury thermometer contains about 1 gram of mercury. That does not sound like much, but let me tell you, despite its small size, just one of these thermometers per year contains enough mercury to contaminate all of the fish in a 20-acre lake.  Let me repeat that. The mercury in one of these thermometers is sufficient to pollute a 20-acre lake.  The bill I am introducing today calls for a nationwide ban on the sale of mercury fever thermometers such as the one I just showed. It will also provide grants for swap programs to help consumers exchange mercury thermometers for digital or other alternatives.  I have an example of an alternative right here. This is a digital thermometer. Digital thermometers like this one are easier to read, much quicker to use, they do not break easily, and, most important of all, they do not contain a toxic element such as mercury.  My bill will allow millions of consumers across the Nation to receive free digital thermometers in exchange for their mercury thermometers. By bringing mercury thermometers in for proper disposal, consumers will ensure the mercury from their thermometers does not end up polluting our lakes and threatening our health. It will also reduce the risk of breakage and contamination inside the home.  Another important component of my bill is the safe disposal of the mercurycollected from thermometer exchange programs. My legislation directs the EPA to ensure that the mercury is properly collected and stored to make sure it is kept out of the environment and out of commerce. This mercury will not reenter the environment, and it will not be sent, for example, to India, one of the largest manufacturers of mercury thermometers.  The mercury collected from thermometer exchange programs addresses only one part of the problem. The other aspect is the global circulation of mercury. When the HoltraChem chlor-alkali manufacturing plant in Orrington, ME, shut down last year, the plant was left with over 100 tons of unwanted mercury and no way to permanently dispose of it. In total, about 3,000 tons of mercury are held at similar plants across the United States.  In addition, large amounts of mercury are still being mined around the world. In 1999, Algeria mined 400 tons of virgin mercury and Kyrgyzstan mined 600 tons. In total, approximately 2,000 tons of new mercury are mined every year. Moreover, the Department of Defense currently has a stockpile of over 4,000 tons of mercury it does not want and does not know what to do with.  What can we do about these problems? What can we do about the situation where some countries are still mining large amounts of an element that is a known neurotoxin, while the United States and other countries are doing their best to remove this extremely toxic element from the environment? How will the United States dispose of the huge amounts of mercury at chlor-alkali plants and other no longer needed sources?  My legislation creates an interagency task force to address these very issues. This task force will be chaired by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and comprised of representatives from the States, other Federal agencies involved with mercury, and public health officials.  Specifically, my bill directs this task force to find ways to reduce the mercury threat to humans and the environment, to identify a long-term means of disposing of mercury, and to address the excess mercury problems from mines as well as from industrial sources.  In sum, this task force is directed to identify comprehensive solutions to the global mercury problem. In one year, the mercury task force will make recommendations to Congress for permanently disposing of mercury, for retiring mercury from chlor-alkali plants and other sources, and for reducing the amount of new mercury mined every year. At that time, it will be up to Congress to act on their recommendations.  In the meantime, this bill will make significant progress toward reducing one of the most widespread sources of mercury contamination in the environment, something that many of us still have in our medicine chests at home, and that is the mercury fever thermometer.  I thank the Presiding Officer for his attention. I urge support and cosponsorship of my colleagues for this initiative.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 351       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury Reduction and      Disposal Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) mercury is a persistent and toxic pollutant that      bioaccumulates in the environment;       (2) according to recent studies, mercury deposition is a      significant public health threat in many States throughout      the United States;       (3) 40 States have issued fish advisories that warn certain      individuals to restrict or avoid consuming mercury-     contaminated fish from affected bodies of water;       (4) according to a report by the National Academy of      Sciences, over 60,000 children are born each year in the      United States at risk for adverse neurodevelopmental effects      due to exposure to methyl mercury in utero;       (5) studies have documented that exposure to elevated      levels of mercury in the environment results in serious harm      to species of wildlife that consume fish;       (6) combustion of municipal and other solid waste is a      major source of mercury emissions in the United States;       (7) according to the Mercury Study Report, prepared by the      Environmental Protection Agency and submitted to Congress in      1997, mercury fever thermometers contribute approximately 17      tons of mercury to solid waste each year;       (8) the Governors of the New England States have endorsed a      regional goal of ``the virtual elimination of the discharge      of anthropogenic mercury into the environment'';       (9) mercury fever thermometers are easily broken, creating      a potential risk of dangerous exposure to mercury vapor in      indoor air and risking mercury contamination of the      environment; and       (10) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the      quantity of mercury in 1 mercury fever thermometer,      approximately 1 gram, is enough to contaminate all fish in a      lake with a surface area of 20 acres.
