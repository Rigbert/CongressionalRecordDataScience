Speaker, the President's revelation of his new budget last night was actually quite remarkable. Fiscal responsibility has finally penetrated inside the Washington, DC. Beltway. That is, Washington, DC. has finally, the policymakers are now all in agreement that the massive debt which will exceed $5 trillion in the near future, about $17,000 for each and every living American citizen from the tiniest baby to the oldest senior citizen, is a real problem and it must be dealt with. And we have to move toward fiscal responsibility. That is the good news.  Apparently, the President was very much affected by his joint appearance with Speaker Gingrich in New Hampshire last weekend, because his proposed budget is Gingrich-Lite, that is, it has the same priorities, the same misplaced priorities as the budget passed in this House 2 months ago, a budget written essentially by Speaker Gingrich and other senior Republicans. The President has adopted those same priorities, the same mistakes and the same peril to average Americans that is inherent in that budget.  They both start out balancing the budget by cutting taxes. Does that make sense? If you are in the hole, is the first thing you do to cut your income? No, I do not think so. But that is what the Republican budget, $350 billion slanted heavily toward people earning over $100,000 a year and the largest, most profitable corporations, that is the Republican budget.  Now, the President, certainly, it is better. It is only $93 billion in tax cuts, and it is a little more targeted, certainly, to middle-income people. But still it is giving away revenue when you are in the hole. This is not a time for tax cuts, if we are serious about balancing the budget.  Now we get to Medicare. The Gingrich Republican budget slashed Medicare by $288 billion. They said, there are problems with Medicare; we have got to fix it. Of course, they do not tell us what the fix is. They just tell us exactly how much we have to reduce benefits in order to fix it, and we will figure out later what it is we are doing.  It is a little bit like burning down the village   to save it, as we did in Vietnam a couple of decades ago.  Now, the President, of course, is only going to reduce Medicare by $125 billion, Gingrich-Lite. But it still is a reduction without a clear plan to deal with the problems of Medicare. Veterans? Gingrich, $9 billion; Gingrich-Lite, the Clinton budget, $6 billion.  Corporate agriculture, subsidies for large profitable corporate agriculture undertakings, like Sam Donaldson, a famous commentator, he gets $75,000 a year not to grow sheep on a ranch he does not live on. Is that essential? Well, apparently it is because there are small cuts in the Republican budget, even tinier cuts in Gingrich-Lite, the President's budget.  Corporate welfare? They are about the same there, tiny, tiny cuts, an estimated $40 to $50 billion that could easily be recaptured from the largest, most profitable corporations in the world, many of them foreign corporations who operate in this country without paying a cent in taxes except for the FICA taxes on their employees. They move their profits offshore, and they take the money to the bank.  The military? We just went through the Department of Defense markup here. We are looking at a massive increase in buildup in the military, a massive increase in buildup in star wars, 10 more B-2 bombers at $1.5 billion each, more than the Pentagon itself requested. They said, Do not buy more B-2 bombers. Transport planes, the Pentagon did not ask for, submarines that the Pentagon did not ask for, an increase, the President asked for an increase in the military of $25 billion over the next 7 years. And the Republican budget, $68 billion on top of the President's $25 billion.  Foreign aid, neither of them want to touch foreign aid. That is a little bit too hot of a political potato, even with the new fiscal realities of Washington, DC.  There is a better way to get a balanced budget, a much better way. We can do it without touching Medicare. We can do it without slashing veterans' benefits, but we have to go after corporate agriculture big time, like $50 billion cuts in their subsidies. We are going to have to go after corporate welfare and the large, most powerful multinational corporations that do not pay a penny of taxes in this country, we are going to have to ask them to pay their fair share.  Takes a little bit of will and guts, probably cuts big into the contributions of both a lot of Democrats and Republicans. But if we do not do that, then we are going to gut programs that are important to Americans instead of going after fairness and equity and a balanced budget that meets the priorities and needs of this country.                          ____________________
