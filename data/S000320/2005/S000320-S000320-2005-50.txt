 NOAA's National Weather Service has the unique expertise and responsibility to provide the nation with general weather and flood warnings and forecasts to protect life and property. The National Weather Service shall have the continued flexibility to disseminate these warnings and forecasts in all formats necessary to ensure timely delivery to the taxpayers. Furthermore, I want to commend the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for their exceptionally accurate Katrina forecasts.
