President, I am pleased to join Ms. Stabenow and my other colleagues today in offering this amendment to express the sense of the Senate that the final conference agreement on the budget resolution should not reduce funding for domestic nutrition programs below the current baseline levels. The reconciliation instructions included in the House Budget Resolution to cut mandatory funding in the areas of domestic nutrition assistance would be devastating to the children and families who count on these programs to meet their daily food needs. In these difficult economic times, we must not put the basic needs of low-income Americans--particularly children--on the chopping block in order to make room for an ill-advised tax cut package this country cannot afford. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment.
