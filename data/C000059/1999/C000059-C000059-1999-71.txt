Speaker, today my colleague, Mr. Brown of California, and I would like to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of the city of Riverside, CA, is unparalleled. Riverside was indeed fortunate to have such a dynamic and dedicated community leader who willingly and unselfishly gave of his time and talents to make his community a better place in which to live and work. The individual we are speaking of is Mr. Art Pick, who we were fortunate to have been able to call our friend. He died yesterday at the age of 68.  Born Joseph Arthur Pickleheimer, Jr., Art moved to Riverside from Kentucky in 1955. A fixture in the community, Art was a man who never shied away from community involvement. Art led the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce for 26 years, first as executive vice president, then as executive director and chief executive officer. He truly believed that Riverside was the best place in the world, and worked tirelessly to get that message across to others. In his position, he reached out to the Hispanic and African-American Chambers of Commerce to ensure that the area's diverse business community worked together.  Art knew education was key to job creation in his community. A graduate of the University of California at Riverside, he was an enthusiastic member and officer of the Alumni Association. Besides being an unabashed booster for his alma mater, Art also recognized the role that the private and community colleges in Riverside played in preparing the workforce for a recovering local economy.  He was also active in many community organizations, including serving as a Riverside City Councilman; serving as a La Sierra University trustee; founding member of the Inland Area Urban League; and, serving as a trustee for the Riverside Community College District. He was also a lifelong supporter of the Sherman Indian School. His good deeds and work in the community would fill pages and pages were we to try and list them all.  Art's forthright honesty and outspokenness rubbed more than a few politicians and journalists the wrong way. But we always remembered that his goal, first and foremost, was what was good for his city. And those of us on the receiving end of Art's comments were always better for the experience because Art was so often right; and, if he wasn't right, well at least he had made us think long and hard about the subject at hand.  Our deepest condolences go to his wife, Galina Mokshina; his daughter, Maria; and his brother, David. Art was a true patriot and an outstanding American who will be deeply missed by everyone in the community. We can best honor him by trying to meet the same high standard he set as a patriot, citizen, and friend.                          ____________________
