 President, 30 seconds, one to correct and one for thoughtful reaction.  The thoughtful reaction is this: When a new program has been in effect for only 9 months, is it unusual that only 5 percent of the people would take part in it? No, they are learning about it. They are going to get involved over a period of time. Only 5 percent in 9 months.  Second, as to the Business Roundtable supporting this amendment, I know the Business Roundtable has called some of the offices of various sponsors of this bill to tell them to quit saying the Business Roundtable supports this amendment.  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma whatever time he may consume.
