Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's comments and acknowledge his expertise as a fellow member of the Nuclear Security Working Group.  I am grateful that Mr. Foster has raised the important subject of nuclear smuggling and for his continued commitment to addressing nuclear security issues. We must be relentless in developing the technologies that will help us identify and counter nuclear smuggling before dangerous materials fall into terrorist hands.  The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review acknowledges the importance of nonproliferation and countering nuclear terrorism. But I do not believe the document is forward-thinking enough when it comes to developing a plan to address future threats. We must continue to invest in research and development of nonproliferation technologies so we will have the tools that we need to keep our Nation secure in an increasingly complex nuclear environment.  Again, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's raising it, and I yield back the balance of my time.                Amendment No. 25 Offered by Mr. Gallego  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 25 printed in House Report 115-785.
