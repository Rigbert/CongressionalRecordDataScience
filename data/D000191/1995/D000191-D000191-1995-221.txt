But guess what? This is sort of a miracle. This is a miracle of supply side economics, which we brought back to America last night.  They did not pay any taxes. In fact, they not only did not pay any taxes, with 26,898,000,000 in profits. Guess what? Working stiffs in this country gave them a $635.5 million tax credit. They did not pay any taxes, and they got a credit for the taxes they did not pay. So their tax rate was minus 2.6 percent. Not bad.
