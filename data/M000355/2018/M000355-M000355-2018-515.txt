 President, tomorrow morning, the Senate and the American people will hear from Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford under oath. We will hear sworn testimony from both of them regarding the allegation of 30-plus-year-old misconduct that Dr. Ford has raised.  It goes without saying, but it bears repeating: Sexual assault is completely abhorrent. Everyone deserves to be safe. So I am glad Dr. Ford will be heard.  I would like to particularly thank Chairman Grassley, who worked tirelessly to establish a fair process and a secure, comfortable setting for this to take place. He gave Dr. Ford the opportunity to testify in public or in private or to speak with investigators who would meet her anywhere she wished or to conduct the entire interview by phone. He has brought a patient professionalism to this process--one that stands in stark contrast to those on the other side of the aisle who self-describe as ``Spartacus'' and play to the television cameras. Dr. Ford will be heard, thanks to Chairman Grassley and despite the irresponsibility of Senate Democrats, who ignored her allegation for weeks and then discarded her request for confidentiality and leaked it to the press.  Let me walk you through this again.
