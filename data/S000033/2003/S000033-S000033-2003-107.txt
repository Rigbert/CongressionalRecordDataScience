 Speaker, I think the point the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) made and we all made is that over 1 million Americans now purchase their meds in Canada, and the number is growing every day.  The chairman and I and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Watson), we said to the gentleman from the FDA who was before the subcommittee, okay, you tell us you are very concerned about the safety aspect. We have a million Americans. Tell us how many of them have been made sick by receiving adulterated or counterfeit medicine. Out of 1 million people, the answer is zero.  Now, we are all going to sign or we are on a request to the GAO to do something a little different. I think that if the FDA is concerned about health and safety, they should do a study telling us how many Americans are dying or seeing a deterioration of their health because they cannot afford the prices that the industry is charging them today. I have the feeling we are going to see a number a heck of a lot larger than zero. So maybe the FDA should worry about health and safety in terms of prices, rather than hounding people who are buying affordable and safe medicines in Canada.
