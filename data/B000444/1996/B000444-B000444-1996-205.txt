 President, I have two comments I would like to make. I first would like to respond very briefly to a speech earlier in the day made by one of my colleagues before I discuss the foreign relations authorization bill pending before the Senate. I would like to address briefly the earlier comments of my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, regarding the President's involvement in resolving our trade impasse with Russia. The distinguished Senator suggests that it was inappropriate for the President to impress upon Mr. Yeltsin that the poultry industry is important to Mr. Clinton's home State, as well as to many other parts of America; I must say forthrightly, the single most important industry in my State.  Since Russia announced over a month ago that it was banning the import of all American poultry, I have been in daily contact with the White House, our Trade Ambassador Mickey Kantor, and our Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, to keep this $500 million market open to American poultry growers.  Fortunately, the hard work of the administration has paid off. Just this week the Russians announced that they are backing down. This would not, in my view, have been possible without the direct involvement of the President, the Vice President, Ambassador Kantor and Secretary Glickman.  Since 1982, Sussex County, one of our counties in Delaware, has remained the No. 1 broiler-producing county in the United States of America. The Delmarva peninsula is home to 21,000 poultry workers, and produces more than 600 million birds per year. It is a major supplier of the Russian poultry market.  Last year, for example, one major Delaware producer exported 1,300 tons of frozen poultry to Russia. Another exported $10 million worth of poultry products.  Those of us who understand this industry know that it is under increasing competitive pressure as grain prices soar and the price of other meats fall. But, they know how to prosper in a competitive environment. That is why we can ship higher quality poultry to Moscow and Saint Petersburg and still beat their prices. In turn, it is the responsibility of this and, I believe, every administration to maintain the open international markets that they need, not only for American poultry but for all American products. Keep in mind that Russia's market was closed as recently as 1991. Now, Russia purchases $500 million worth of poultry every year, and the market has been growing. This is just one of the many products they purchase.  This has been a real success story for American exports. Of American exports, the agricultural community is the only real success story in American exports of continuing, year-in-and-year-out consequence.  I, for one, think it is perfectly appropriate, as a matter of fact absolutely necessary, for the President of the United States, in this case President Clinton, to let President Yeltsin know just how important these exports are. I cannot think of any better way for a President to drive the point home than to make this issue personal.  I wanted very much for the President to successfully resolve this problem of the poultry industry. As any negotiator on the floor of this Senate understands, the one way in which, on a close call, we all appeal to our colleagues ultimately is we say: This is personal to me. This is personal to me.  Mr. Yeltsin is a politician. Every world leader is a politician. Politicians in international relations react no differently than politicians on the Senate floor.  I think it was perfectly appropriate and necessary for the President to use everything in his arsenal to convince the Russians not to violate international trade agreements with regard to poultry or anything else.  Mr. President, I believe that the people who disagree with the President acknowledge he is a master communicator. You can bet Yeltsin got the message.  So let us keep the big picture in mind and not get hung up on questions of style. The results, which are keeping 500 million dollars' worth of export markets open, speak for themselves. I think this is an important achievement on President Clinton's part and an important international trade issue. Had he failed, it would have set the precedent for significant trade consequences for the United States, and not just in poultry. I think most Americans, regardless of political party, feel the President did the right thing. I know I think he did the right thing.                          ____________________
