I do not remember a time in this body--and he has been here longer than I--a time under either the Republican leadership in the Senate or the Democratic leadership, under Republican Presidents or Democratic Presidents, that we were so derelict in the number of appropriations bills that have passed--certainly by the middle of November--passed and signed into law. I can remember sometimes we had continuing resolutions for a few. But I can think of sometimes, certainly in the last 3 or 4 years, when we had all thirteen passed.
