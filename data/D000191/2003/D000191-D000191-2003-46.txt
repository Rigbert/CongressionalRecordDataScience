  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the whining from the other side of the aisle is extraordinary. They can see all this waste, fraud, and abuse; but they control the White House, the Senate, and the House and yet they do not do anything about it. Puzzling.  Here is something else they do nothing about which is very puzzling. There are 4 million American workers who have exhausted their unemployment benefits and cannot find work. The President and the Republican majority say that we cannot afford to extend unemployment benefits to these people, despite the fact there is $20 billion sitting in the Unemployment Trust Fund of taxes paid by Americans.  No waste, fraud, and abuse here; there are just people who cannot find work and want it. Now, the Republicans say we cannot afford it, but they are borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars to pay Iraqis for no-show jobs. The anti-waste, -fraud, and -abuse crowd is happy to pay Iraqis for no-show jobs, but they will not give unemployed Americans benefits out of a trust fund. These are people who want to work and cannot find work because of the miserable economic record of this administration.                          ____________________
