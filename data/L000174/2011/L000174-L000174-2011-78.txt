After decades of doing this, I should have remembered, of course, we have to notify the President. I recall one day, when we went into the beginning of the session and swore in new Senators, one was the new Senator from New York, Hillary Clinton. The President of the United States was sitting in the gallery. When we convened as a Senate, the usual notice was said to notify the President that the Senate has convened for that session, at which point several of my colleagues rather honorably pointed out the President: You do not have to notify him. He is sitting right up in the gallery.                          ____________________
