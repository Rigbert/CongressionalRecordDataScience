In May of 2012 he graduated with honors from Berkeley with a 3.7 grade point average and a major in molecular and cellular biology. One month after he graduated, President Obama issued his Executive order, DACA, and now New was protected from deportation. As a result he was able to pursue his dream to become a doctor.  Last fall New went to medical school at the University of California in San Francisco. Now what does he do in his spare time as a medical student? He volunteers at a homeless clinic run by students at the University of California in San Francisco. He has cofounded Pre-Health Dreamers, a national network of more than 400 DREAMers who are pursuing careers in health care.  New and other similar DREAMers have so much to contribute to America. But if the Republicans have their way, this man is going to be deported. Instead of being able to stay in the United States as a doctor, to realize his life's dream and make this a better and stronger nation, he will be deported. Will America be better or worse if this young man leaves? I think the answer is obvious.  So why do the Republicans persist? Why are they determined to take this amazing young man and deport him? They have forgotten our legacy inAmerica. We are a nation of immigrants, and our immigrants have come to this country from all over the world because they appreciate the values and opportunity of America. I am lucky. My mother was an immigrant to this country, and I stand on the Senate floor representing the great State of Illinois. It is my story, my family's story, and it is America's story.  The time is clearly upon us to fund the appropriations of the Department of Homeland Security but not at the expense of this amazing young man. Let us fund this Department to keep America safe but also let us dedicate ourselves to passing legislation which fixes our broken immigration system and helps this young man and others like him to be a part of America's future.  I yield the floor.
