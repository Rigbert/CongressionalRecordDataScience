 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3196, the foreign operations appropriations bill. I further ask consent that a substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statement relating to the bill be printed in the Record. I further ask consent that the Senate insist on its amendment and request a conference with the House.
