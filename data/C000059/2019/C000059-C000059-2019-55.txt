For the past twelve years, my office and I have been extremely fortunate to have Patricia ``Tricia'' Evans on our staff.  Tricia is from Westchester, New York, and to say she is a proud New Yorker is putting it mildly. She's also an Irish Catholic through and through--all the way down to being a devout meat and potatoes eater--except, ofcourse, on Fridays during Lent. After graduating from Iona College, Tricia taught first grade at Good Shepherd School for a few years before shifting to politics. In the summer of 1979, Tricia launched her career on Capitol Hill as a staff assistant for conservative stalwart and fellow New Yorker Jack Kemp. Prior to joining my office, Tricia served a number of House Members, including dedicated tenures serving my former California colleague Elton Gallegly and Arizonan J.D. Hayworth.  In 2007, I was incredibly fortunate to have a seasoned staff member like Tricia join my office. When she first came on board, Tricia wasn't exactly a big fan of flying, especially cross county to our district in California. But after we introduced her to In-N-Out Burger she became more open to flying out West--it's amazing how a Double-Double can ease anxieties. We never quite converted her from a New Yorker to a Californian, but I'd like to think she will always carry within her a little piece of the Golden State.  As Tricia winds up her time in my office to take on a new opportunity, it's impossible to sum up her immense contributions. Of all my constituents whom she has helped, I think that the folks from the Monday Morning Group will miss her the most. I know Tricia rightfully takes great pride in her efforts to secure passage of the 9/11 Memorial Act into law. She was deeply and personally touched by the 9/ 11 attack as a native New Yorker and by the loss of her friend, Navy Captain Bob Dolan, who was killed at the Pentagon on that tragic day. Tricia took the ''Never Forget'' refrain and put it into action to honor her friend Bob and all who perished. Tricia has also been involved in helping the Capitol Concerts that take place on the Hill every year on Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. All Americans who enjoy these patriotic events can thank Tricia for working overtime to ensure their success.  Tricia loves her country and everything Disney. There is also no bigger fan of Bruce Springsteen, Tom Selleck or Joe Namath. But nothing in her life comes close to her love for her two children: Shannon and Patrick. They are an incredibly close and loving family, which can be attested to by me and my Chief of Staff who can't help but overhear regular calls from each of the kids that always end with, ``I love you.'' I won't say that these calls happen too frequently, but I have developed a nervous tick whenever I hear her cell phone ring tone. Seriously though, Tricia's love for and dedication to her children are a testament to her fine character. I will deeply miss her and her selflessness, loyalty and impassioned devotion to supporting me and my office. I look forward to my continued friendship with Tricia and wish her, Shannon, and Patrick, the very best in all their future endeavors. Godspeed.                          ____________________
