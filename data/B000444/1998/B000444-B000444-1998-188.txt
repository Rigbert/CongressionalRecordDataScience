 President, I would like to take a brief moment to thank some of the incredibly qualified staff we have here. I don't know whether the public realizes, but some of the young, and in the case of some of my staff not so young, women and men are incredible assets to this country. There are more Rhodes scholars, Marshall scholars, Ph.D.s, professors, former professors, and incredibly talented people who sit here in these seats, not only on treaties, but on every major thing we do and advise us.  On Chairman Helms' staff, as always, Admiral Bud Nance, a retired Admiral in the U.S. Navy, and close friend of the chairman's and a close advisor, did a terrific job in directing the entire staff and working closely with our staff, as did a man who was kind enough to stay with me, a man who is a significant and capable lawyer, as well as a staff director for the minority, Ed Hall. These two guys run that operation in a way, I say to the leader sitting here, that was almost like the bipartisan days, the old days, in large part because they get along so well and they trust each other so much.  Bud Nance is a gentleman who has already given decades of service to his country in the U.S. Navy, and continues to serve the chairman in his role as staff director.  Additionally, I thank Steve Biegun, Beth Wilson, and Alex Rodriguez, as well as Marshall Billingslea, of the majority staff, who did a first-rate job in pulling together our hearings last fall and in helping draft the resolution of ratification.  On my staff, I will start with this man. I worry about these guys who have one doctorate, but this guy has two. He came to me from a distinguished career as a professor, as well as working in the Library of Congress, Dr. Mike Haltzel. He is the minority staff member for European affairs. He traveled with me throughout the European capitals and to Russia in preparation for the hearings, and he wrote the major portions of the remarks given and rebuttals during this debate. It was a pleasure to have him at my side.  During this process, he has been ably assisted by Mark Tauber, a Pearson Fellow from the State Department; Ed Levine, the committee's arms control expert; and Erin Logan, a Javits Fellow who has honored the memory of our former colleague by her service to the committee.  In addition, Marnie Davidson, Ursula McManus, Dawn Ratliff, Mike Schmidt, and Marc Mellinger provided considerable assistance behind the scenes.  Finally, I thank my counsel on the committee, a young man who came to me out of Auburn, NY, 20 years ago to stay for a ``few days'' and stayed on, and while with me, he graduated from law school, clerked, and then came back and is the legal director for the committee, Brian McKeon.                         Thanking Art Rynearson  Lastly, I thank Art Rynearson, who is a senior legislative counsel and has served the Senate and the Foreign Relations Committee for over two decades. I know him as Art. I have known him all these years as Art. He is one of those guys behind the scenes, the legislative counsel here, who we take so much for granted, and who did an incredible job. In the 105th Congress, the committee has placed a lot of demands on Art, starting with the Chemical Weapons Convention, the CFE Flank Document, and then on the State Department authorization bill.  On NATO enlargement, he was enormously helpful, as he always is, in helping us draft the resolution of ratification.  Over the past few months--indeed over the past 15 months --Art has worked tirelessly in assisting the Foreign Relations Committee with its busy agenda. I would like to thank him for his competent professionalism and for always being there to help the committee staff.  Lastly, let me thank my colleagues. I believe it is not a presumption to say that the level of debate and the competence that they demonstrated was impressive. I have great respect for those who voted negatively on this because they thought about it long and hard.  I also find, I say to the President, in my 25 years here that when the very big, important issues are before us, almost everyone steps up to the ball, no matter what side they come out on, on those big issues. It is always a consequence of very thoughtful consideration and very engaging debate. It was an honor to be associated with the staff of the majority and the minority.  I thank, lastly, the minority leader for doing what he has been kind enough to do with me since he has been leader--entrusting to me the tactics, if not the strategy, of how to proceed on a major piece of legislation. I thank him for that. I thank him for his confidence.  I yield the floor.
