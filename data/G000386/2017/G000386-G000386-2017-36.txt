 President, I want to remind my colleagues that we annually commemorate National Domestic Violence Awareness Month in November. This is a time when we're called to increase public awareness and understanding of domestic violence. =========================== NOTE ===========================     On page S6972, November 1, 2017, in the second column, the following appears: . . . annually commemorate is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month in October . . .    The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . annually commemorate National Domestic Violence Awareness Month in November. ========================= END NOTE =========================   As noted by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, domestic violence is a crime that thrives when we remain silent. That's why the Senate today passed the resolution that I recently introduced with Senator Feinstein to commemorate National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.  As stated in our resolution, Congress should continue to raise awareness of domestic violence in the United States. We also should pledge our continued support for programs designed to assist survivors, hold perpetrators accountable, and bring an end to domestic violence.  Congress has made support to survivors a national priority for over three decades, through the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act, the Victims of Crime Act, and other Federal laws. Through the enactment of laws criminalizing domestic violence at the State and local level, we've also sent a strong signal to abusers that domestic violence is not a ``private'' matter.  We've come a long way, but we still have much work to do on this front. Even now, domestic violence affects millions in the United States, including women, men, and children of every age and socio-economic status. About one in five women will at some point in their lifetime become a victim of this crime, according to the Centers for Disease Control.  I applaud the many individuals and organizations in Iowa and elsewhere around the Nation that work around the clock to respond to victims in crisis. They include the hotline personnel who provide support 365 days a year. They include the staff and volunteers at shelters, who provide safe havens for those escaping abuse. They include the advocates who champion survivors' interests at the State and Federal levels. Last, but certainly not least, they include the first responders who compassionately respond to victims in crisis.  We applaud their continued service and we continue to support the goals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.                          ____________________
