 The doctors of America, at least the organized doctors of America, have said vote ``no'' on this bill because they know, we know, The Wall Street Journal knows, we have to fix this permanently, not patch it every year. It is a fraud. Both sides have committed that fraud, and we ought to stop it.  We ought to fix this. Americans ought to expect us to fix it. The doctors expect us to fix it. Seniors expect us to fix it. What a lamentable fact that we cannot summon the courage and the judgment and the wisdom to do just that.
