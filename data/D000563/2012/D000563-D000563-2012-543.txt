Judge William Hibbler had served with distinction as a Federal district court judge in the Northern District of Illinois since 1999. Bill Hibbler cared so deeply about Chicago that it sometimes surprised people to learn that he actually started life in a small town in Alabama.  His family moved to Chicago when he was a child. He graduated from St. Mel High School on the West Side and later from the University of Illinois at Chicago. He worked as a substitute teacher in the Chicago public school system to help pay his tuition at DePaul University School of Law. He started his legal career in private practice but soon felt the call of public service so he went to work as an assistant State's attorney in Cook County.  In 1986, he became an associate judge of the Cook County Circuit Court, and he served in that capacity for 13 years, until he joined the Federal bench. Judge Hibbler was active in community service throughout his career. He was a mentor to many young people.  During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I noted that some judges have an unfortunate tendency to look down on the people who come before them once they put on the judges' black robes, and I asked Judge Hibbler what type of temperament he would bring to the Federal bench. His answer said so much about the kind of man Bill Hibbler was and about his values. He said, ``The opportunity to serve is a wonderful opportunity, and we should never forget that.''  Judge Hibbbler died on March 19. He was 65 years old. The esteem in which he was held is evident in comments by other judges and by lawyers who appeared before him.  Chief Judge Jim Holderman of the Northern District praised Judge Hibbler as ``an outstanding jurist who cared deeply about our system of justice and displayed an unparalleled sense of fairness.'' Thomas Bruton, clerk of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, said: ``Judge Hibbler was a friend to everyone who met him. He was gracious, kind and a mentor to many in this court.''  U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said, ``He was a wonderful judge and wonderful person, who treated everyone who appeared before him with great respect.'' His friend, 7th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Anne Claire Williams, said that Judge Hibbler ``wasn't what you would call a man of many words, but each day, in his own quiet way, he made a difference in the world.''  I am proud to have joined then-Senator Carol Moseley-Braun in urging President Clinton to nominate Judge Hibbler to the Federal bench 13 years ago. His many years of distinguished service on the Federal bench only deepened my respect for him. William Hibbler loved the law, and he loved justice. He also loved his family very deeply, and I wish to offer my sincere condolences to his wife Regina, his son William, and his daughter Aviv. We are grateful for the service that their husband and father provided to the Chicago community, and we will miss him.                          ____________________
