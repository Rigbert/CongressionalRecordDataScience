Speaker, I rise today in advance of Memorial Day, to remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of this great Nation and the ideals for which it stands. It is fitting that before we Americans celebrate the arrival of summer, we set aside a special day in honor of all those brave and selfless individuals who have died to defend our freedom and security. Each of the patriots whom we remember on Memorial Day was first a beloved son or daughter, sibling, spouse and friend. Each had hopes and dreams not unlike our own.  The loss of these Americans--indeed, the loss of any life to war--fills us with sorrow and strengthens our resolve to work for peace. Yet it would be a great injustice to our fallen service members to observe this day solely as one of mourning. On this Memorial Day, our hearts should swell with thankfulness and pride as we reflect on our Nation's heritage of liberty.  Gen. James A. Garfield was the main speaker at the first national Memorial Day on May 30, 1868 at the National Cemetery in Arlington. He best expressed the utmost respect and reverence we as a nation should have for those who lost their lives in defense of our country, and its ideals.       I am oppressed with a sense of impropriety of uttering      words on this occasion. If silence is ever golden, it must be      here beside the graves of fifteen thousand men whose lives      were more significant than speech and whose death was a poem      the music of which can never be sung. With words we make      promises, plight faith, praise virtue. Promises may not be      kept; plighted faith may be broken; and vaunted virtue be      only the cunning mask of vice. We do not know one promise      these men made, one pledge they gave, one word they spoke;      but we do know they summed up and perfected, by one supreme      act, the highest virtues of men and citizens. For love of      country they accepted death, and thus resolved all doubts,      and made immortal their patriotism and virtue.  I, too, have no illusions about what little I can add to the silent testimony of those who gave their lives willingly for their country. Yet, we must honor them--not for their sakes alone, but for our own. And if words cannot repay the debt we owe these men and women, surely with our actions we must strive to keep faith with them and with the vision that led them to battle and to final sacrifice.  As one looks out across the rows upon rows of white crosses and Stars of David in military cemeteries in our country and across the world, the willingness of some to give their lives so that others might live never fails to evoke in me a sense of wonder and gratitude. They span several generations of Americans, all different and yet all alike, like the markers above their resting places.  And how they must have wished, in all the ugliness that war brings, that no other generation of young men would have to undergo that same experience. At this time each year we should instill in every generation, now and yet to come, a deep appreciation and full understanding of the meaning of why they died. The sacrifices we remember on Memorial Day must be made meaningful to every new generation of Americans, so that those sacrifices shall not have been made in vain.  The passage of years has dimmed the memories of many who have witnessed the destruction and tragedy of war, but we need only look at the ``reminders'' of the price of freedom paid in places such as Gettysburg, Omaha Beach, Normandy, and ``Hamburger Hill.'' Each is a name that invokes memories of patriotism and valor. Each reminds us that our Nation was founded on the belief that our democratic ideals are worth fighting for and, if necessary, worth dying for. We have a sacred obligation to remember for all time the names and the deeds of the Americans who paid that price for our freedom. Memorial Day has now become an occasion for honoring all those who died protecting that freedom. One reminder, engraved in the stone memorial at the Omaha Beach Cemetery, eloquently states, ``To these we owe our highest resolve, that the cause for which they died shall live.''  Mr. Speaker, Memorial Day is a day to honor Americans who gave their lives for their country. It is their deaths, not the wars which claimed them, that we honor today. This day is our way of keeping alive the spirits and accomplishments of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. It is a time of reflection, it is a time of honor, it is a time of renewal. Today, and every day, we must remember what was sacrificed for the many freedoms we enjoy today. We must honor those who made that sacrifice for us. And we must renew our commitment to the ideals which their sacrifices preserved, always with the hope that future generations of Americans will never need to make those same sacrifices.                          ____________________
