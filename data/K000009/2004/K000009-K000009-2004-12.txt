Chairman, I thank the fine gentleman from California (Mr. Baca) for offering this amendment, along with his distinguished colleagues, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee). I would like to compliment the gentleman from California (Mr. Baca) for his steadfastness in standing up for inclusion of all farmers in our country, regardless of racial background, of ethnic background, of regional background. I really want to help the gentleman.  I support his amendment. As we move to conference I hope that his dogged efforts today and those of his colleagues will help us find a better way forward. I hope that the chairman will work with us as we go into conference committee because what the gentleman is asking for here is not outlandish. He is asking for small increases in the office for civil rights, for tribal extension grants, for outreach to minority farmers and for Hispanic-serving institutions, all of which, along with Native Americans, deserve more attention in this bill.  It is true that there are tremendous suits against the Department of Agriculture now totaling over $1 billion. The gentleman's amendment is just infinitesimal in comparison to that. But we know the unmet need that is out there.  I just want to thank the gentleman. He has my support. He has my support not just here on the floor today but as we move to conference. I thank him for standing up for every farmer in America, regardless of where they might live, what their income or their background is. I commend the gentleman.
