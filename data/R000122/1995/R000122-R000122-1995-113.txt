So I do not want to shrink judicial review. I am a supporter of judicial review. I just want to make sure the review is efficient, cost effective, and reaches the merits on a final point and not several points in the process.  I believe with the gentleman's proffer of working together, we can work out these details. I hope I can persuade the gentleman this language or some version will be an improvement and not a detriment.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.
