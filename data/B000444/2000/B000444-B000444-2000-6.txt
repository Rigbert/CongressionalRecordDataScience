 President, I rise today to pay tribute to David B. Hermelin, former U.S. Ambassador to Norway, who passed away on November 22.  After a distinguished business and philanthropic career in his native Michigan, Mr. Hermelin was nominated as envoy to Norway by President Clinton in 1997 and confirmed by the Senate that same year.  Members of this Chamber know that, as might be expected with any large group, over the years the performance of our ambassadors, both career diplomats and political appointees, have varied widely. By any standard, David Hermelin's tenure was spectacularly successful.  In the short space of two years, Ambassador Hermelin managed a remarkable feat: strengthening the already close ties between our ally Norway and the United States. His diplomatic and personal charm led to unprecedented reciprocal visits within three weeks of each other last year--the Norwegian Prime Minister's to Washington, and President Clinton's to Oslo, the first ever visit of an incumbent President to Norway, in this case in pursuit of a Middle Eastern peace settlement.  But Ambassador Hermelin's accomplishments were not limited to such highly publicized events. Through behind-the-scenes daily efforts, he was directly instrumental in the success of Lockheed Martin's bid, as part of a consortium, to sell the Norwegian Navy five new frigates equipped with the Aegis missile system, a sale worth more than one billion dollars.  Ambassador Hermelin was recognized for his many contributions by being awarded the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit, the highest honor the country bestows upon non-Norwegians.  Even after Ambassador Hermelin was diagnosed with a terminal illness, he vigorously played a major role to help others through an international initiative to provide prostheses to victims of civil conflict, such as in Sierra Leone.  On his visit to Oslo in November 1999, President Clinton, in speaking of Ambassador Hermelin, reflected on this kind of behavior: ``I don't know anyone who has such a remarkable combination of energy and commitment to the common good.''  After diagnosis of his terminal illness, he and a group of friends donated ten million dollars to establish a brain tumor center at Henry Ford Hospital in Michigan.  Ambassador Hermelin felt deeply connected to Israel and to Jewish causes, raising millions of dollars for local Detroit and overseas needs.  After the Ambassador's death, the U.S. State Department's Norway desk officer offered this heartfelt testimony: ``David Hermelin was the kind of man who made a friend out of everybody he met, and the people who worked for him at the embassy regarded him with an affection that is unmatched by the feelings I've seen for any other ambassador at any time to any country.''  Ambassador Hermelin is survived by his wife, five children, and eight grandchildren. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him, particularly by his colleagues in the U.S. Government.                          ____________________
