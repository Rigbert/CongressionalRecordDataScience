Mr. Chairman, I want to take a couple of minutes, and I do not want to delay the consideration of this bill, but I want to advise the Members of the good work that was done by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), the chairman of the subcommittee.  This was a new assignment for the gentleman because of our term limit situation in the House. He did a really outstanding job, and he had a great partner in the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Dicks), the ranking member of the subcommittee. They worked closely together. They shared information all of the way through the process.  The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) can speak for himself, but I think we were both pleased when we attended the subcommittee markup and saw what a good bipartisan bill this was.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the Members to help us expedite the consideration of this bill today. It is a good bill. There will be some debate and discussion on a few issues that might stir up some controversy but, all in all, it is a good bill. It is a very good bipartisan bill, and the gentleman from New Mexico and the gentleman from Washington are to be congratulated for the work that they have done.
