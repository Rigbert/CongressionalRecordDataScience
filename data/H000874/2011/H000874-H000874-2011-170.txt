 I ask the previous speaker to go in his community to all those same institutions and see what they say.  I rise in support of this amendment as one who has supported this effort for all 10 years that we have been at it. In 2001, in response to the attacks of 9/11, the United States began a war in Afghanistan that targeted Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and the Taliban, which provided bin Laden with sanctuary and aid. I supported that effort.  We have been pursuing this conflict for nearly a decade now. The death of Osama bin Laden was a landmark moment in our ongoing struggle to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat the terrorist networks that intend to do Americans harm, and that struggle has not ended with bin Laden's death. But his death is a moment for reflection on that struggle and how we can best equip ourselves to win it. Many of the terrorists against which we are fighting are no longer located in Afghanistan but are in disparate locations, from Yemen to Somalia to southeast Asia. And bin Laden was found in Pakistan.  I support this amendment, because it focuses upon adjusting to a world of changing threats. It is essential that we fight the smartest war possible against terrorists--but it is fair to ask how a massive troop presence in Afghanistan continues to help us accomplish that goal.  We must plan to transfer responsibility for security in Afghanistan to the Afghan people and government after 10 years' presence there, and it is important to make an assessment of how that best can be done. That's what the McGovern amendment does.  Therefore, this amendment requires a national intelligence estimate of al Qaeda's current leadership, locations, and capabilities. It requires the President to convey to Congress how he intends to meet the goal he stated in December 2009 of a transition for lead security responsibility to the Afghan people, where it belongs. It also asks the President to clarify plans for advancing a political solution in Afghanistan, which all of our military leaders have said is the only ultimate solution.  Finally, nothing in this amendment limits or prohibits the President's authority to attack al Qaeda or gather or share intelligence, nor does it require the administration to modify its military strategy, as it should not. This amendment, however, helps to meet our shared goal of defeating terrorists who wish us harm.  I have no doubt that President Obama and every Member of this House believes that their very first duty is to keep our Nation safe. We must constantly challenge one another and our Nation to fight smarter and harder to ensure victory in this broader struggle.  I rise in support of this amendment and urge its adoption.                              {time}  1120  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).
