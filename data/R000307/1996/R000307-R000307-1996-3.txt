Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation which is vital to the future health of the Nation's livestock and poultry industry in rural districts throughout this country. H.R. 2508, the Animal Drug Availability Act, is a noncontroversial, bipartisan bill that streamlines and significantly improves the process by which animal drugs are approved. The bill expands the types of studies FDA can accept as proof of a drug's efficacy; requires FDA and drug companies to agree to test protocols before a company submits a drug application for approval; eliminates time-consuming field investigations, unless they are the only way to prove a drug's efficacy; eliminates some efficacy testing when a company seeks to use two individually approved drugs in combination; creates veterinary feed directive drugs which increase veterinarian involvement in dispensing animal drugs; and eliminates much of the licensing paperwork for feed mills that dispense animal drugs.  The bottom line: this bill is perhaps the most significant thing this Congress can do to help the livestock and poultry industry reduce their cost of production and become more competitive.  The cumbersome and lengthy process of getting animal drug approvals from FDA has led to several U.S. animal drug companies setting up plants overseas. Passage of this bill will also help stem the flow of jobs--well paying jobs--from this country.  I am pleased to finally get a chance to discuss and vote on this important piece of legislation and I would strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage.
