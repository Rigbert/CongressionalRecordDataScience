Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, if I could finally thank the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) for his sponsorship of this resolution. It is very timely and extremely appropriate. I thank him for his work on the subcommittee and, of course, thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), our ranking member, for all of his cooperation. We do things in partnership, and it is greatly appreciated, and I think the veterans benefit from that kind of bipartisanship.  The gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Simmons) made the point, and I think it was very well taken, about the great role the American Legion played in drafting this legislation. At the time, there was talk of maybe giving a $500 bonus to the returning GIs. Then out of the blue, pretty much, Harry Colmery, who was the American Legion National Commander in 1936, a World War I veteran, crafted, as the subcommittee chairman pointed out, on Mayflower stationery this fine concept and practically wrote the GI bill at the Mayflower Hotel. It was quickly grasped by Members of Congress and the President as an extraordinarily good idea, and it really did create the modern-day middle class.  One of the things I do when I wear my international affairs hat, as chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, is to strongly encourage the Eastern European countries, the Russians and others, that if you want a stable middle class, this landmark legislation crafted by the American Legion, and certainly pushed through to completion by the Congress at the end of the world war, is the way to go. It is historic and truly landmark legislation that has profound positive implications and consequences.  I think recognizing it the way we are today is very proper and fitting, and again I want to thank the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) for that.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
