 President, I, too, thank my good friend, Pat Leahy, for his marvelous cooperation and also extend my thanks to Steve Cortese, director of the full committee, who has been a joy to work with, and Tim Rieser of Senator Leahy's staff and, of course, long-time foreign policy adviser, now staff director of the subcommittee, Robin Cleveland, and Billy Piper and Will Smith, who have done yeoman service and outstanding work on this. I thank them.  I yield the floor.
