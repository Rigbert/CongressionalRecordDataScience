Speaker, our home community of Toledo and the state of Ohio lost a champion citizen and patriot with the passing of James Brennan, who passed from this life on August 11, 2003 at the age of 77.  Born in Chicago, Jim attended Drake University on a football scholarship. He left to join the Army, but upon his return from service, he attended the University of Chicago. While in Chicago, he began his lifelong career in politics in 1955. Two years later, Jim moved to Toledo and established himself as a businessman. He grew Freeman Material Handling, now Brennan Industrial Truck Inc, into a viable business, which he was able to pass down to his children. While a prominent successful business leader, Jim extended himself to the broader community, and served on Ottawa Hills Village Council from 1975 to 1979. He followed this service with three tenures as the chair of the Lucas County Republican Party. His chairmanship was marked by strong leadership, civility, honesty and cooperation across party lines, with his vision always directed toward the betterment of our region. In addition to his county chairmanship, Jim also served at the grassroots level as a precinct committeeman, state central committeeman, and convention delegate.  Jim did not limit his civic-mindedness to business and politics. He was a member of the Ohio Board of Regents and trustee of Defiance College. He served on the boards of the Salvation Army, Goodwill Industries, and St. Vincent Hospital and was president of the Toledo Opera Association. All the while Jim Brennan was first and foremost a devoted family man and caring father and grandfather. A good and kind man beneath a brusque exterior, Jim lent his talents to many endeavors, and our community will miss his wit, energy, bluster, intelligence, and devotion. He helped build the character and ethic of our community.  We extend our heartfelt sympathies to Jim's children James Jr, Christine, Kate, and Amy, his brother Robert, and his grandchildren. May they find some comfort in the gift of his life and their cherished memories. Jim Brennan will be missed.                          ____________________
