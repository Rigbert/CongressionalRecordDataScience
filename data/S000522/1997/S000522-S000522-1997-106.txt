Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, for yielding this time to me, and I rise in very strong support of the Fox amendment.  Romania's quest for NATO membership was given a significant boost when the democratic opposition, led by Emil Constantinescu, was elected to office last November.                              {time}  1830  The peaceful transfer of power following those internationally sanctioned elections was a genuine turning point for that country, a political development unimaginable not very long ago.  At home, the Romanian Government recently announced a bold package of economic reforms designed to check inflation, reduce the budget deficit, and accelerate privatization. If implemented, these important changes could attract much-needed foreign investment.  An anti-corruption campaign has also been initiated. A series of military reforms were adopted in December to ensure civilian democratic control and modernization of Romania's armed forces. While each of these initiatives will require months to realize, the new Romanian leadership has begun to show its courage in taking these important steps.  The first Central European country to join the Partnership for Peace and one of the most active participants, Romania has taken concrete steps to advance its candidacy for possible NATO membership. Of a particularly important note is the historic Treaty of Understanding, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness concluded with Hungary last September. Romanian troops played an active role in the NATO-led Operation Joint Endeavor, part of IFOR in Bosnia, and has continued to contribute to peacekeeping efforts through its participation in Operation Joint Guard.  These developments underscore the positive role Romania can play in fostering stability in NATO's southern flank. Romania's desire to join NATO was clear through its active participation with its Partnership for Peace as well as the ongoing intensified dialogue with the Alliance since April of 1996.  Mr. Chairman, again I want to thank my good friend for offering this amendment. It puts us squarely in line.  Let me just say finally as a footnote, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf] and I and others, going back to the 1980's, led the effort to remove the MFN during the Ceausescu regime, they have absolutely turned the corner, and I think with confidence we can say they will be a good partner as part of NATO.  Mr. Chairman, I submit the following letter for inclusion in the Record.                                            Commission on Security                                     and Cooperation in Europe                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1997.     Hon. William J. Clinton,     The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We urge that the United States actively      support the inclusion of Romania among the countries which      will be invited by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization      (NATO) to begin negotiations for accession to the Alliance.      The NATO summit meeting scheduled to be held in Madrid,      Spain, on July 8 and 9, 1997, will formally invite some      candidate states to commence such negotiations. We believe      that Romania deserves to be invited to accede to the      Washington Treaty because of both its recent progress in      meeting the criteria for membership and its strategic      location along NATO's future southeastern edge.       While NATO accession should not be extended to states that      do not meet the criteria set forth in the NATO Enlargement      Facilitation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-208), we believe that      Romania has demonstrated great progress in all areas and      should be favorably considered for inclusion in the first      round of enlargement. At a hearing of the Commission on      Tuesday, May 13, 1997, we heard testimony from Romania's      Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency Mircea Dan      Geoana, on the wide range of concerns the Commission and the      Congress have had with Romania in recent years. We believe      that the evidence supports Romania's claim to meet the      criteria for membership, especially in the areas of human      rights, national minorities, and freedom of expression and      media issues that have been troublesome in the past     and were particular subjects of Commission interest.       In light of the rapid approach of the Madrid summit, and      the intensive schedule of high-level NATO meetings leading up      to that summit, we believe the United States should promptly      and publicly clarify its position regarding the NATO process      for accession by all states which meet the criteria. An      announcement of U.S. support for such a process would lessen      diplomatic and media speculation about a possible delay in      the invitation for negotiation, supposedly to make more      credible a subsequent round of enlargement. We believe all      currently qualified states should be invited now to negotiate      for accession, and as other states meet the criteria, the      process whereby they, too, may be invited to join the      alliance should be clearly formulated. This is the only fair      way to manage Alliance enlargement and protect important      reform efforts underway in those candidate states not      included in the first group to be announced at Madrid.       We appreciate your kind attention to our views on this most      important matter.           Sincerely,     Christopher H. Smith, M.C.,       Co-Chairman.     Alfonse D'Amato, U.S.S.,       Chairman.
