 President, I rise in support of the DOD authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. This is a responsible bill that recognizes the national security threats we face, and properly funds the operations and modernization accounts needed to support the finest military in the world.  Over the past year, we have been constantly reminded that our military must be able to respond to a variety of threats all over the globe.
