President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is absolutely right; it will not be a party-line vote. I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania succeeds. It is interesting, the people who represent victims and people who don't have legal representation support the Senator from Pennsylvania. Just about every labor union supports the Senator from Pennsylvania, as veterans groups do. I will not go through the list again. Just about every veterans group that has spoken on this issue supports the Senator from Pennsylvania. There are a lot of others who support the Senator from Pennsylvania, but I mention veterans and labor as an interesting coalition. They are speaking for people who would not have a voice otherwise. They support what the Senator from Pennsylvania is doing, as do an awful lot of businesses, I might add. I hope he is successful.
