 President, too many times in our world today we settle for mediocrity, we settle for just enough to get by. But today, I rise to pay tribute to an Iowan who has never settled for anything less than excellence. I am referring to Dan Gable, head wrestling coach at the University of Iowa. Dan recently announced that he will be taking a year off and turning his coaching duties to others. I think this is the right time to look at the impressive record of Dan Gable.  Many of you may recognize Dan's name because of his legendary accomplishments in the sport of wrestling. Dan reached the very pinnacle of this sport in the late 1960's and has stayed there ever since. As a competitor, Dan compiled a nearly flawless record of 182-1 in his prep and college career. Dan was a three time all-American and three time Big Eight Champion.  After college, Dan went on to win titles at the Pan American Games and world championships. Dan also demonstrated his superiority in wrestling when he won a gold medal at the 1972 Olympics.  His accomplishments as a coach are no less stellar. Teams coached by Dan have an amazing 355-21-5 record. He has coached 152 all-Americans, 45 national champions, 106 Big Ten champions, and 10 Olympians, including four gold medalists. To say Dan is a living legend in his chosen field is not an overstatement.  But even more admirable is how Dan has handled being at the top of his field for nearly 30 years. We regularly hear about athletes involved in scandal after scandal--so much that we hardly raise an eyebrow when the newest controversy makes headlines. But Dan has always conducted himself with dignity and a refreshing lack of arrogance. Dan has imparted in the wrestlers he has coached an appreciation of hard work, perseverance, graciousness, and calm under pressure. If you believe there are no more role models, then you must not know about Dan Gable. I hope my statement might help correct that misbelief. Dan Gable exemplifies the notion that to be a true winner is not just about scoring the most points; it means carrying the title of winner with integrity and character. Dan Gable has certainly done that.  I thank him for the credit he has brought to his family, his community, his sport, and the State of Iowa, and wish him the very best in all his future plans. I know he will continue to approach whatever he does with the same commitment and hard work he always has in the past.                          ____________________
