 President, I thank the chairman and the Senatorfrom Florida for allowing me a few moments to make a statement.  I wish to begin by indicating my support for this bill. I believe it will be very helpful to every taxpayer throughout the Nation. I am very happy to support the bill, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for a few minutes.
