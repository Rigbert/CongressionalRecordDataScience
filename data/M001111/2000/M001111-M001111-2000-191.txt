 President, let me assure my colleagues, this issue is not about theater. It is about the very real issue of violence against women. I join with my colleague, the Senator from New York, and thank him for his work on this amendment and urge my colleagues to support it.  This amendment is not about abortion. This amendment is about violence against women. We cannot allow violent extremists to use the bankruptcy code to carry out their agenda of violence.  If anyone thinks this is simply another abortion or choice issue, let me point out to all of you, there are groups and individuals who teach violent protesters how to protect their financial assets in the event of a civil or criminal penalty.
