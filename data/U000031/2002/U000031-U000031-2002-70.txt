Speaker, Special Agent Gerard B. ``Jerry'' Alexander recently retired after 26 years of service to the communities of Southwest Michigan. An employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and assigned to the Kalamazoo field office, Jerry was an asset to the community that will sorely be missed.  A graduate of American University, Jerry boasts an impressive law enforcement record both in the United States as well as the world at large. Dedicated, intelligent, and responsible, Jerry is a well-rounded law enforcement official with experience working on numerous case genres. Jerry specialized in white-collar crime, an area of law enforcement that he found especially challenging and prevalent in our corner of the state of Michigan. His impressive talents and exemplary work ethic are just two of the qualities that come to mind when recalling Jerry's work with the Bureau.  A strong communitarian, Jerry spent much of his free time as a volunteer in the Kalamazoo area. His service as a coach and manager for the West Portage Little League will not be forgotten by the countless youngsters who enjoyed a rewarding athletic experience. Jerry's love for children also led him to take an active role in the Portage Central High School Band, which he supported in numerous fundraisers.  I would like to take this opportunity to echo the respect and admiration Jerry Alexander has gained within the communities of Southwest Michigan. His personal qualities and numerous skills are certain to facilitate success in all of his future endeavors.                          ____________________
