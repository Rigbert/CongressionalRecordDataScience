DeMINT. I will in a moment.  I will ask this: Could we include in your legislation the idea that whenever somebody wants to pass a bill by unanimous consent, they have to come to the floor and say: I, Senator Jim DeMint, want to pass this bill, a bill I have not read, which has not been online for 3 days, which has no score from the CBO, and I desire to pass this bill with no debate and no rollcall vote? If we would do that as individuals, I will be glad to give up my right to any secret hold.  I will yield to the Senator.
