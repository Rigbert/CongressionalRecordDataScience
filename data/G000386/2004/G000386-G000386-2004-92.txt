 President, I rise today to pay tribute to SSG Bruce J. Pollema, a fellow Iowan originally from Hull, IA. The Iowa National Guard regretfully announced the death of Staff Sergeant Pollema when he was killed on August 27, 2004 along with fellow soldier, Spc. Dustin S. Colby, when their military motor vehicle rolled over into a ditch near Camp Dodge. Staff Sergeant Pollema was a heavy vehicle operator with the 2168th Transportation Company, based in Sheldon, IA. Staff Sergeant Pollema is survived by his wife, Teri Winter, father and mother, Wilmar and Betty Pollema, his older brother, Waylon, and his twin brother, Brandon. This brave soldier was thirty years old.  The family of Bruce Pollema issued the following statement in response to the news of their son's death: ``Our hearts, minds, spirits and prayers are with the rest of the Troops and we wish them God speed. We will be there for them when they come back.''  It is fitting that we should honor Staff Sergeant Pollema today for his service to our country. My deepest sympathy goes out to his family and friends. I know his memory will live on in the hearts of everyone he knew.                          ____________________
