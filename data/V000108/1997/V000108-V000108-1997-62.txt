Speaker, I rise today to call for an end to the terror in Israel and to condemn those who seek to end the peace process by striking at innocent civilians.  Over the past month and half, the citizens of Israel have been the victims of several ruthless and cowardly acts of terrorism. On July 30, two suicide bombers killed 15 Israelis and wounded over 170 others in a popular marketplace. On September 4, bombers struck again at a busy pedestrian shopping mall, killing 5 people and wounding more than 150. The extremist Muslin group, Hamas, has claimed responsibility for both attacks, with the goal of derailing the Middle East peace process and destroying Israel.  While I believe that the peace process should continue to move forward, it cannot do so unless Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Yasir Arafat, and other Arab leaders, begin to take seriously their role in stamping out acts of terror throughout the region.  A main tenet of the Oslo Accords is that Israel will give land to the Palestinian people only if they can demonstrate their commitment to peace by taking an active role in putting an end to violence and terrorism. It is clear from recent events that Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority are not living up to this commitment.  While the Israeli government has taken active steps to adhere to the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority has cut off negotiations with Israel and violated the Oslo agreement by terminating security cooperation with Israel that was intended to crack down on terrorism. And in an act that says a great deal about Palestinian leaders' attitude about terrorism, within days of the July bombing that killed 15 Israelis, Arafat publicly embraced an extremist Hamas leader. These are hardly the actions of a man who is committed to ending terrorism and forging a lasting partnership with Israel.  I am encouraged by the fact that Madeleine Albright has undertaken her first visit to the Middle East since becoming U.S. Secretary of State. I call on Secretary Albright to tell Chairman Arafat and other Arab leaders that the United States is fully committed to pursuing a lasting peace in the Middle East, but will not back down in the face of those who would use terrorism as a weapon against peace.  Secretary Albright should also make it clear to Arafat that he cannot continue to inflame passions in this situation by blaming the Israelis themselves for these acts of terror. Following the bombing in July, and again this month, Arafat claimed that the Israeli government should be held partially responsible for these atrocities because it has created a hostile environment for Arabs living in the region. This type of irresponsible scapegoating only encourages further acts of terrorism and undermines the entire peace process.  Mr. Speaker, the Middle East peace process is at a genuine crossroads. At this tenuous time, the United States must recommit itself to moving the process forward while helping to protect Israel against those who are waging a war of terror against the Israeli people. I call on all of my colleagues to assist in this effort, and I offer whatever encouragement I can to the Israeli people at this difficult time.                          ____________________
