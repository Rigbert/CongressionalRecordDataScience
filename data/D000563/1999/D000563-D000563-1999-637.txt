I believe the Senator and I came away with the understanding from the majority leader, Senator Lott, that, yes, within 2 weeks we would have our opportunity to consider those issues and some legislation to deal with them.  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, there is a concern as well about teachers and the President's proposal to try to have more classroom teachers and a smaller student/teacher ratio in grades kindergarten, 1, 2, and 3; is that scheduled to be considered under any schedule that the Senator from Massachusetts has seen?
