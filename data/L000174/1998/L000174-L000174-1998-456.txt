President, I thank my two friends from Michigan for their efforts on this. The distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, is on the floor now. We have spent hours going back and forth. And we are good friends. We talked about this a great deal, as we did with Senator Levin, whose office is down the hall from mine. It seems we went back and forth and discussed this over and over again, and the way to do it.  I commend them because they have made it very clear they do not want in any way to hurt the ecology of the environment of Lake Champlain, which is a spectacular lake. They have tried to find a way that they can retain their own identity, a well-deserved identity, and with a remarkable geographic situation with the five lakes. And I think we have ended up with a win-win situation.  So, Mr. President, I thank them for their help. It is one of the nice things about being in the Senate--when you know each other, you can sometimes work out things that would be more difficult otherwise.  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.
