 President, my staff pointed out to me, as I sat down when I said we should keep that in mind, I said in jest that we should keep that in mind, my reference was to Judge Bork. I believe Powell does not support this, the Powell Commission would not support this, and that Justice Bork would. We should keep in mind the distinction.  But I would also like to point out, as my staff pointed out to me, in Wright versus West, the Supreme Court case decided a couple of years ago, where the Bush administration sought to ask the Supreme Court to rule on the standard of full and fair, which is what Senator Kyl is proposing, Justice Rehnquist, from his home State of Arizona, refused to adopt the standard that Senator Kyl is proposing. He is certainly no liberal. He refused to adopt the standard and insisted that there be access to the lower Federal courts. [[Page S7837]]   But I thank my colleagues for their indulgence.  I yield the remainder of my time.
