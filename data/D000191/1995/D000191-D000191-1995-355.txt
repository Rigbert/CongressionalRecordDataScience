Speaker, a young constituent from Oregon's Fourth District has expressed through her writing a deep and patriotic understanding of our Nation. The Veterans of Foreign Wars and its Ladies Auxiliary presented Ms. Jennifer Breyer with the state award of the Voice of America Scholarship program. I ask that her Vision of America be included in the Congressional Record.                         My Vision For America                          (By Jennifer Breyer)       ``I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the      harder I work, the more I live. Life is no brief candle for      me, it is a sort of splendid torch that I have got hold of      for a moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as      possible before handing it on to future generations.''--     George Bernard Shaw       This is my vision for America. Wouldn't it be wonderful if      each citizen of the United States of America could take their      candle and make it burn as brightly as possible for as long      as they live? Wouldn't it be exciting if every citizen in      this country could have this opportunity to make their dreams      come true?       In America we are known to live in a Land of Prosperity, a      Land of Hope, and a Land of Freedom, but are we truly free if      we have not had the opportunity to accomplish our dreams but      instead have been confined to small, everyday tasks? We are      free only if we are able to accomplish our dreams and make      our vision for America become reality.       My vision for America is to make this country be as strong      as it possibly can be and make it clear to the world that we      are truly the luckiest people on this earth. But in order to      do that, each citizen in this great nation has a      responsibility, not only to themselves but also to their      country. You see, all of us are given a candle, but it is up      to us, as individuals to take our candle and make it burn as      brightly as we can.       They say you can always tell where the lamplighter has been      by the path he has lit. But what if each and every one of us      didn't have to follow the lamplighter's course but instead      took our candles and made our own paths. We could make this      nation shine like a great star in the sky.       Wouldn't it be wonderful if each American citizen could      take their candle and pass it on to a newborn child, and      explain that he has one chance, and only one chance in his      lifetime to make his stand in this nation.       Can the people of this nation join together for one final      stand? Can they unite and join candles so that every      individual may feel as if they were part of another? Can we      put aside the race or religion of people and say, ``You are      my fellow citizen, you can stand next to me, and you can      fight with me for our country, the beautiful United States of      America.''       Ladies and gentlemen, my vision is one of a far off dream,      one that may never come true, but that has made my life worth      living for. My vision may not come true in reality but in my      mind and in my dreams it has always been. For if I accomplish      one thing in my life, it will be to pass my candle on to a      newborn child, and let the legacy for the next generation      live on. If the world is a better place for just one person,      then my life and yours has been a success.       I wish you all the best of luck in your quest for your      Vision of America. I have found my vision, and I hope you      will find yours as well. Thank you.                               ____________________
