. Supreme Court.  In the nomination process, a telling and inciteful statement by another Senator is most applicable and pertinent. During the Senate's debate on the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, then Senator Barack Obama stated:       . . . that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of      statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95      percent of the cases that come before the court, so that both      a Scalia or Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of      the time on those 95 percent of the cases--what matters on      the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly      difficult.       In those cases, adherence to precedent and rules will only      get you through the 25th mile of the marathon.       That last mile can only be determined on the basis of 1)      one's deepest values, 2) one's core concerns, 3) one's      broader perspectives on how the world works, and 4) the depth      and breadth of one's empathy.  I respectfully disagree with this rationale and find it troubling. Our judges must decide all cases in adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction.
