Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from Ohio and my colleague from Michigan, Mrs. Miller. This is not the perfect bill, but this is it. There is no plan B. This is not the original bill that Ms. Sutton and Mrs. Miller introduced, but this is the bill that passed our committee 50-4.  One in 10 jobs in America are auto-related. In the last couple of years now, particularly through this tough recession, we have lost one in five manufacturing jobs, and certainly the Midwest has been critically hurt.  The auto sector, we've seen auto sales plummet from 17 million car sales just 2 or 3 years ago to probably what will be less than 10 million, not only this year, but next year as well. Not only the Big 3 supports this, but Toyota, Honda, the Chamber, a whole number of different groups, the UAW, the Auto Manufacturers, the National Association of Manufacturers, the auto dealers as well. You know what this bill is? It's a jobs bill.                              {time}  1600  But more important than that, it's an American jobs bill, and it's time to stop the dominos from falling the wrong way and beginning to turn the switch from ``red'' to ``green'' for auto jobs and get something in the hands of consumers that will boost their confidence.  Now, who else has done this bill? Well, 16. And guess what? The sales are up. Germany, sales have increased by 40 percent; France, sales are up March through May; the UK, Japan, China, Korea, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Malaysia, Austria, Romania, Luxembourg, The Netherlands. Even Slovakia, auto sales have increased by some 18 percent.  Madam Speaker, this is a very good bill. It's one that has bipartisan support. It's time to put American jobs first and begin to move this process forward. We know we have a majority in this House for this bill. The question is do we have two-thirds. I would like to think we do. This is it. We're not going to have another bill. It's not going back to Rules. We need to pass this.  I reserve the balance of my time.
