Tebow. He's a great individual, a terrific athlete. The Wolverines enjoyed playing him. It was certainly the best bowl game of the year earlier this year. We wish him well in the future.  I might just also add as a footnote, again as a Michigan Wolverine, we enjoyed Rex Grossman too. We beat him at least once or twice in bowl games in the past. The only thing that I don't like is that he now plays for the team that I do like, the Chicago Bears.
