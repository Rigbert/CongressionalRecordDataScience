Speaker, on Thursday, March 1, 2001, the House is scheduled to consider H.R. 333, the ``Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2001.'' On February 15, 2001, the Committee on the Judiciary ordered reported favorably the bill H.R. 333 and the report thereon was filed on February 26, 2001. The Congressional Budget Office (``CBO'') cost estimate, however, was not available for filing on February 26. Therefore, I hereby submit the CBO cost estimate for printing in the Congressional Record.                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2001.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 333, the      Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of      2001.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Lanette      J. Walker (for federal costs), Erin Whitaker (for the revenue      impact), Shelley Finlayson (for the state and local impact),      and Paige Piper/Bach (for the private-sector impact).           Sincerely,                                                 Barry B. Andersen                                   (for Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE     H.R. 333--Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection          Act of 2001       Summary: CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 333 would      increase discretionary costs primarily to the U.S. Trustees      by $256 million over the 2002-2006 period. At the same time,      the bill would slightly increase the fees charged for filing      a bankruptcy case, and would change how some of these fees      are currently recorded in the budget. We estimate that      implementing the bill would increase the amount of bankruptcy      fees that are treated as an offset to appropriations by $279      million over the five-year period, resulting in a net      decrease in discretionary spending of $23 million over this      period.       In addition, CBO estimates that enacting this bill would      decrease governmental receipts (revenues) by $260 million      over the 2002-2006 period because bankruptcy fees that are      currently recorded as revenues would be reclassified as      offsetting collections and offsetting receipts. Finally,      enactment of H.R. 333 would result in filling additional      judgeships, and we estimate that their mandatory pay and      benefits would cost $18 million over the next five years.      Because the bill would     affect direct spending and governmental receipts, pay-as-you-     go procedures would apply. Assuming appropriation of the      necessary amounts to implement the bill, CBO estimates that      its enactment would reduce budget surpluses by $255 million      over the 2001-2006 period.       H.R. 333 contains several intergovernmental mandates as      defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), but CBO      estimates the costs would be insignificant and would not      exceed the threshold established in that act ($55 million in      2000, adjusted annually for inflation). Overall, CBO expects      that enacting this bill would benefit state and local      governments by enhancing their ability to collect outstanding      obligations in bankruptcy cases.       H.R. 333 would impose private-sector mandates, as defined      by UMRA, on bankruptcy attorneys, creditors, bankruptcy      petition preparers, debt-relief agencies, and credit and      charge-card companies. CBO estimates that the direct costs of      these mandates would exceed the annual threshold established      by UMRA ($109 million in 2000, adjusted annually for      inflation).       Major provisions: In addition to establishing means-testing      for determining eligibility for chapter 7 bankruptcy relief,      H.R. 333 would:       Require the Executive Office for the United States Trustees      (U.S. Trustees) to establish a test program to educate      debtors on financial management;       Authorize 23 new temporary judgeships and extend five      existing judgeships in 21 federal districts;       Permit courts to waive chapter 7 filing fees and other fees      for debtors who could not pay such fees in installments;       Require that at least one of every 250 bankruptcy cases      under chapter 13 or chapter 7 be audited by an independent      certified public accountant;       Require the Administrative Office of the United States      Courts (AOUSC) to receive and maintain tax returns for      certain chapter 7 and chapter 13 debtors;       Require the AOUSC and the U.S. Trustees to collect and      publish certain statistics on bankruptcy cases; and       Increase chapter 7 and chapter 13 bankruptcy filing fees      and change the budgetary treatment of such fees.       Other provisions would make various changes affecting the      bankruptcy provisions for municipalities and the treatment of      tax liabilities in bankruptcy cases.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: As shown in the      following table, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 333      would result in a net decrease in discretionary spending of      $23 million over the 2002-2006 period, subject to      appropriation actions. In addition, we estimate that      mandatory spending for the salaries and benefits of      bankruptcy judges would increase by less than $500,000 in      2001 and by $18 million over the 2002-2006 period. Enacting      the bill's provisions for adjusting filing fees would reduce      revenues by $260 million over the next five years. That      change in revenues would be more than offset, however, by      increased collections to be credited against discretionary      spending if future appropriation actions are consistent with      the bill.

Basis of Estimate: For purposes of this estimate, CBO      assumes that H.R. 333 will be enacted during the third      quarter of fiscal year 2001 and that the amounts necessary to      implement the bill will be appropriated for each fiscal year.     Spending subject to appropriation       Most of the estimated increases in discretionary spending      would be required to fund the additional workload that would      be imposed on the U.S. Trustees. These increases would be      more than offset by changes in bankruptcy filing fees that      would be recorded as offsetting collections under the bill.      CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 333 would result in a      net reduction in discretionary costs of $23 million over the      2002-2006 period.       Means-Testing (Section 102). This section would establish a      system of means-testing for determining a debtor's      eligibility for relief under chapter 7. Under the means test,      if the amount of debtor income remaining after certain      expenses and other specified amounts are deducted from the      debtor's current monthly income exceeds the threshold      specified in section 102, then the debtor would be presumed      ineligible for chapter 7 relief. A debtor who could not      demonstrate ``extraordinary circumstances,'' which would      cause the expected disposable income to fall below the      threshold, could file under other chapters of the bankruptcy      code.       Although the private trustees would be responsible for      conducting the initial review of a debtor's income and      expenses and filing the majority of motions for dismissal or      conversion, CBO expects that the workload of the U.S.      Trustees would increase under the means-testing provision.      The U.S. Trustees would provide increased oversight of the      work performed by the private trustees, file     additional motions for dismissal or conversion, and take part      in additional litigation that is expected to occur as the      courts and debtors debate allowable expenses and other      related issues. Although CBO cannot predict the amount of      such litigation, we expect that, during the first few years      following enactment of the bill, the amount of litigation      could be significant, as parties test the new law's      standards. In subsequent years, litigation could begin to      subside as precedents are established. Based on information      from the U.S. Trustees, CBO estimates that the U.S. Trustees      would require 115 additional attorneys, paralegals, and      analysts to address the increased workload. As a result, CBO      estimates that implementing this provision would cost $48      million over the next five years.       General Accounting Office (GAO), Small Business      Administration (SBA), and U.S. Trustees Studies (Sections      103, 230, and 443). Section 103 would require the U.S.      Trustees to conduct a study regarding the use of Internal      Revenue Service expense standards for determining a debtor's      current monthly expenses and the impact of these standards on      debtors and bankruptcy courts. Section 230 would require GAO      to conduct a study regarding the feasibility of requiring      trustees to provide the Office of Child Support Enforcement      information about outstanding child support obligations of      debtors. Section 443 would require the Administrator of SBA,      in consultation with the Attorney General, the U.S. Trustees,      and the AOUSC, to conduct a study on small business      bankruptcy issues. Based on information from U.S. Trustees,      GAO, SBA, CBO estimates that completing the necessary studies      would cost up to $1 million in 2002, and less than $500,000      in 2003.       Debtor Financial Management Test Training Program (Section      105). This section would require the U.S. Trustees to      establish a test training program to educate debtors on      financial management. The test training program would be      authorized for six judicial districts over an 18-month      period. Based on information from the U.S. Trustees, CBO      estimates that about 90,000 debtors would participate if such      a program were administered by the U.S. Trustees in fiscal      years 2002 and 2003. At a projected cost of about $40 per      debtor, CBO estimates that this provision would cost $4      million over the 2002-2004 period.       Credit Counseling Certification (Section 106). This section      would require the U.S. Trustees to certify, on an annual      basis, that certain credit counseling services could provide      adequate services to potential debtors. Based on information      from the U.S. Trustees, CBO estimates that the U.S. Trustees      would require additional attorneys and analysts to handle the      greater workload associated with certification. CBO estimates      that enacting this provision would cost $17 million over the      next five years.       Maintenance of Tax Returns (Section 315). This section      would authorize the AOUSC to receive and retain debtors' tax      returns for the year prior to the commencement of the      bankruptcy for chapter 7 and chapter 13 filings. Such      collection and storage of tax returns would commence only at      the request of a creditor. Based on information from the      AOUSC, CBO expects that creditors will request tax      information in about 25 percent of such cases. CBO estimates      that implementing H.R. 333 would cost $9 million over the      next five years to store and provide access to over two      million tax returns.       Changes in Bankruptcy Filing Fees (Sections 325 and 418).      Section 325 would increase chapter 7 and chapter 13      bankruptcy filing fees and change the distribution of such      fees. In addition, the bill would allow the U.S. Trustee      System Fund to collect 75 percent of chapter 11 filing fees.      Under current law, the filing fee for chapter 7 and chapter      13 is $155 and is divided between the U.S. Trustee System      Fund, the AOUSC, the private trustee assigned to the case,      and the remainder is recorded as a governmental receipt      (i.e., revenue). Under H.R. 333, the filing fee for a chapter      7 case would be $160, and income from this fee would be      recorded in two different places in the budget. Of the $160,      $65 would be recorded as an offsetting collection to the      appropriation for the U.S. Trustee System Fund, and $50 would      be recorded as an offsetting receipt and spent without      further appropriation by the AOUSC. The remainder of this fee      would be spent by the private trustees assigned to each case.      The bill would reduce the filing fee for a chapter 13 case to      $150 and change how the fee is recorded in the budget. The      U.S. Trustee System Fund would receive $105 and the AOUSC      would receive $45 per case. Under H.R. 333, no portion of      chapter 7, chapter 11, or chapter 13 filing fees would be      recorded as governmental receipts.       Section 418 would permit a bankruptcy court or district      court to waive the chapter 7 filing fee and other fees for a      debtor who is unable to pay such fees in installments. Based      on information from the AOUSC, CBO expects that in fiscal      year 2002 chapter 7 filing fees would be waived for about 3.5      percent of all chapter 7 filers and that the percentage      waived would gradually increase to about 10 percent by fiscal      year 2005.       Considering the expected reduction in the use of chapter 7      because of means-testing and the provision that would allow      fee waivers, CBO estimates that implementing the new fee      structure and changes in fee classifications would result in      an increase in offsetting collections totaling $279 million      over the 2002-2006 period.       U.S. Trustee Site Visits in Chapter 11 Cases (Section 439).      This section would expand the responsibilities of the U.S.      Trustees in small business bankruptcy cases to include site      visits to inspect the debtor's premises, review records, and      verify that the debtor has filed tax returns. Based on      information from the U.S. Trustees, CBO estimates that      implementing section 439 would require about 20 additional      analysts to conduct over 2,300 site visits each year. CBO      estimates that implementing this provision would cost about      $11 million over the next five years for the salaries,      benefits, and travel expenses associated with these      additional personnel.       Compilation and Publication of Bankruptcy Data and      Statistics (Sections 601-602). H.R. 333 would require the      AOUSC to collect data on chapter 7, chapter 11, and chapter      13 cases and the U.S. Trustees to make such information      available to the public. CBO estimates that it would cost      about $30 million over the 2002-2006 period to meet these      requirements. Of the total estimated cost, about $26 million      would be required for additional legal clerks, analysts, and      data base support. The remainder would be incurred by the      U.S. Trustees for compiling data and providing Internet      access to records pertaining to bankruptcy cases.       Audit Procedures (Section 603). Beginning 18 months after      enactment, H.R. 333 would require that at least one out of      every 250 bankruptcy cases under chapter 7, chapter 11, and      chapter 13, plus other selected cases under those chapters,      be audited by an independent certified public accountant.      Based on information from the U.S. Trustees, CBO estimates      that about 1.6 million cases would be subject to audits in      fiscal year 2003, increasing to about 1.9 million in fiscal      year 2006. CBO assumes that about 0.8 percent of those cases      would be audited and that each audit would cost about $1,000      (in 2001 dollars). CBO also expects that the U.S. Trustees      would need about 10 additional analysts and attorneys to      support the follow-up work associated with the audits. We      estimate that implementing this provision would cost $68      million over the 2003-2006 period.       Additional Judgeships--Support Costs (Section 1224). This      provision would extend five temporary bankruptcy judgeships      and authorize 23 new temporary bankruptcy judgeships for 21      federal judicial districts. Based on information from the      AOUSC, CBO assumes that about half of the 23 new positions      would be filled by the beginning of fiscal year 2002 and the      rest would be filled by the start of fiscal year 2003. Also,      we anticipate that all five temporary judgeships would be      filled by fiscal year 2003. We expect that discretionary      expenditures for support costs associated with each judgeship      would average about $460,000 annually (in 2001 dollars). CBO      estimates that the administrative support of additional      bankruptcy judges would require an appropriation of less than      $500,000 in fiscal year 2001 and $63 million over the 2002-     2006 period. (Salaries and benefits for the judges are      classified as mandatory spending, and those costs are      described below.)       Federal Trade Commission Toll-Free Hotline (Section 1301).      This section would require the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)      to operate a toll-free number for consumers to calculate how      long it would take to pay off a credit card debt if they were      to make only the minimum monthly payments. Based on      information from the FTC about the demand for the agency's      other credit-related hotline, CBO expects that the FTC would      receive about 20,000 calls each month. CBO estimates that the      equipment and personnel necessary to serve this volume of      inquiries would cost $2 million in 2002 and $6 million over      the 2002-2006 period, subject to the appropriation of the      necessary amounts.     Direct spending and revenues       Additional Judgeships (Section 1224). CBO estimates that      enacting the means-testing provision (section 102) would      impose some additional workload on the courts. Section 128      would authorize 23 new temporary bankruptcy judgeships and      extend five existing temporary judgeships. Based on      information from the AOUSC and other bankruptcy experts, CBO      expects that the increase in the number of bankruptcy judges      would be sufficient to meet the increased workload. Assuming      that the salary and benefits of a bankruptcy judge would      average about $155,000 a year (in 2001 dollars), CBO      estimates that the mandatory costs associated with the      salaries and benefits of these additional judgeships would be      less than $500,000 in fiscal year 2001 and about $18 million      over the 2002-2006 period.       Changes in Bankruptcy Filing Fees (Sections 102, 325, and      418). Section 325 would change the classification of where      bankruptcy filing fees are recorded in the budget. Under      current law, filing fees are divided between the U.S. Trustee      System Fund, the AOUSC, the private trustee assigned to the      case, and the remainder is recorded as governmental receipts      (i.e., revenues). The percentage of the fees allocated to      these different parts of the budget varies by chapter. Under      the fee structure specified in the bill, the portions of      chapter 7, chapter 11, and chapter 13 filing fees that are      now recorded as governmental receipts would be recorded as      offsetting collections or offsetting receipts. Therefore, CBO      estimates that enacting H.R. 333 would reduce governmental      receipts by $260 million over the 2002-2006 period. (The      change in offsetting receipts would be matched by additional      spending, resulting in no net change in direct spending.)       Tax Provisions (Title VII). Title VII of H.R. 333 would      alter several provisions related to tax claims. It would      alter the treatment of certain tax liens, disallow the      discharge of taxes resulting from fraudulent tax returns      under chapter 13 or chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code,      require periodic cash payments of priority tax claims, and      specify the rate of interest on tax claims. Title VII also      would change the status of assessment periods for tax claims      and would alter various administrative requirements. Based on      information from the Internal Revenue Service and the Joint      Committee on Taxation, CBO estimates that these provisions      would increase revenues, but that any increase would be      negligible.       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and      Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go      procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or      receipts. The means-testing, waiver of fees, and changes in      filing fees provisions would affect receipts, and the      additional judgeships would increase direct spending; hence,      pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. The net changes in      outlays and governmental receipts are shown in the following      table. For the purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go      procedures, only the effects in the current year, the budget      year, and the succeeding four years are counted. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                          By fiscal year, in millions of dollars                                                                 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                   2001    2002    2003    2004    2005    2006    2007    2008    2009    2010    2011--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Changes in outlays..............................................       0       2       4       4       4       4       4       4       2       2       2Changes in receipts.............................................       0     -45     -53     -54     -54     -54     -54     -54     -54     -54     -54--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       Estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments:      H.R. 333 contains intergovernmental mandates as defined in      UMRA, but such costs would not be significant and would not      exceed the threshold established in that act ($55 million in      2000, adjusted annually for inflation). Overall, CBO expects      that enacting this bill would benefit state and local      governments by enhancing their ability to collect outstanding      obligations in bankruptcy cases.     Mandates       Section 227 of the bill would preempt state laws governing      contracts between a debt relief agency and a debtor, but only      to the extent that those state laws are inconsistent with the      federal requirements set forth in this bill. Such preemptions      are mandates as defined in UMRA. Because the preemption would      not require states to change their laws, CBO estimates the      costs to states of complying with this mandate would not be      significant.       Section 719 would require state and local income tax      procedures to conform to the Internal Revenue Code with      regard to dividing tax liabilities and responsibilities      between the estate and the debtor, the tax consequences of      partnerships and transfers of property, and the taxable      period of the debtor. CBO estimates that this provision would      increase costs for the administration of state and local tax      laws, but would not require state and local tax rates to      conform to the federal rates. Such administrative costs would      not be significant and would likely be offset by increased      collections.       Section 1310 would prohibit state courts from recognizing      or enforcing certain foreign judgments. Based on the small      number of potential cases and the small likelihood that those      cases would be heard in state courts, CBO estimates that      there would be no significant costs associated with complying      with this mandate.     Other impacts       The changes to bankruptcy law in the bill would affect      state and local governments primarily as creditors and      holders of tax or child support claims against debtors. In      addition, it would change some of the state statutes that      govern which of a debtor's assets are protected from      creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.       A 1996 survey of the 50 states conducted by the Federation      of Tax Administrators and the States' Association of      Bankruptcy Attorneys, the most recent data available,      indicated that more than 360,000 taxpayers in bankruptcy owed      claims totaling about $4 billion. Of these claims, states      reported collecting only about $234 million. Total bankruptcy      filings have increased since 1996. While CBO cannot predict      how much more money might be collected, it is likely that      states and local governments would collect a greater share of      future claims than they would under current law.       Exemptions. Although bankruptcy is regulated according to      federal statute, states are allowed to provide debtors with      certain exemptions for property, insurance, and other items      that are different from those allowed under the federal      bankruptcy code. (Exempt property remains in possession of      the debtor and is not available to pay off creditors.) In      some states debtors can chose the federal or state exemption;      other states require a debtor to use only the state      exemptions. The bill would reduce the value of a debtor's      homestead exemption under certain circumstances and create a      new exemption for certain retirement funds and education      savings plans. This bill also would place a ceiling of      $100,000 on the exemptions for the value of certain property      acquired in the two years prior to a bankruptcy filing under      certain circumstances.       These exemption standards would apply regardless of the      state policy on exemptions. The new homestead exemption and      property-value limitation could make more money available to      creditors in some cases, while the exemptions on retirement      and education savings generally would make less money      available.       Domestic Support Obligations. The bill would significantly      enhance a state's ability to collect domestic support      obligations, including child support. Domestic support      obligations owed to state or local governments would be given      priority over all other claims, except those same obligations      owed to individuals. The bill would make these debts      nondischargeable (not able to be written-off at the end of      bankruptcy). The bill also would require that filers under      chapter 11 and 13 cases pay domestic support obligations owed      to government agencies or individuals in order to receive a      discharge of outstanding debts. In addition, under this bill,      the automatic stay that is triggered by filing bankruptcy      would not apply to domestic support obligations owed by      debtors or withheld from regular income, as it currently      does. The bill also would require bankruptcy trustees to      notify individuals with domestic support claims of their      right to use the services of a state child support      enforcement agency, and notify the agency that it has done      so. The last known address of the debtor would be a part of      the notification.       Tax Payment Plans. The bill would require that payment      plans for tax liabilities be limited to five years and that      payment amounts be regular and not less favorable than      payments for other obligations. Under current law, taxing      authorities sometimes face payment plans that include a      series of small payments over time followed by a large      balloon payment near the end of the planned payment stream.      At that point, the debtors often fail to complete their      payments. This provision would require that taxes be paid at      a rate proportionate to those of other debts, but does not      specifically prohibit balloon provisions. It also would      establish interest rates to be applied to outstanding tax      liabilities. Under current law, any interest charges on      outstanding tax liabilities are determined at the discretion      of the bankruptcy judge.       However, this status is granted only if a tax is assessed      within a specific period of time from the date of the      bankruptcy filing. If that filing is subsequently dismissed      and a new filing is made, the tax claim may lose its priority      status. The bill would make adjustments to this provision,      allowing more time to pass in some circumstances, thus      increasing the likelihood that state or local tax claims      would maintain their priority status.       Taxes and Administrative Expenses. Under current law,      certain expenses and the priority of claims reduce the funds      that would otherwise be available to pay tax liens on      property. The bill would increase the priority of those liens      in certain circumstances against certain expenses and claims,      thereby making it more likely that funds would remain      available to cover tax obligations. Governmental units would      not be required to file a request for certain administrative      expenses as a condition of being allowed such an expense. The      bill also would allow state and local governments to claim      administrative expenses for costs incurred by closing a      health care business.       Fuel Tax Claims. Under current law, all states owed fuel      tax under the International Fuel Tax Agreement have to file      separate claims against debtors under the bankruptcy code.      The bill would allow a state designated under the agreement      to file a single claim on behalf of all states owed the fuel      taxes. This would simplify the filing process.       Tax Return Filing. A number of provisions in the bill would      require debtors to have filed tax returns, and in some cases      to be current in their tax payments, before a bankruptcy case      may continue. These provisions would help states identify      potential claims in bankruptcy cases where they may be owed      delinquent taxes.       Priority of Payments. In some circumstances under current      law, debtors have borrowed money or incurred some new      obligation that is dischargeable (able to be written-off at      the end of bankruptcy) to pay for an obligation that would      not be dischargeable. This bill would give the new debt the      same priority as the underlying debt. If the underlying debt      had a priority higher than that of state or local tax      liabilities, state and local governments could lose access to      some funds. However, it is possible that the underlying debt      could be for a tax claim, in which case the taxing authority      would face no loss. Because it is unclear what types of      nondischargeable debts are covered by new debt and the degree      to which this new provision would discourage such activity,      CBO can estimate neither the direction nor the magnitude of      the provision's impact on states and localities.       Single Asset Cases. One provision of the bill would allow      expedited bankruptcy proceedings in certain single asset      cases (usually involving a large office building). State and      local governments could benefit to the extent that real      property is returned to productive tax rolls earlier as a      result of this provision.       Municipal Bankruptcy. The bill would clarify regulations      governing municipal bankruptcy actions and allow      municipalities that have filed for bankruptcy to liquidate      certain financial contracts.     Estimated impact on the private sector       Mandates       H.R. 333 would impose new private-sector mandates on      bankruptcy attorneys, creditors, bankruptcy petition      preparers, debt-relief agencies, and credit and charge-card      companies. Consumer bankruptcy attorneys would be required to      make reasonable inquiries to confirm that the information in      documents they submit to the court or to the bankruptcy      trustee is well grounded in fact. Creditors would be required      to make disclosures in their agreements with debtors and      provide certain notices to courts and debtors. Bankruptcy      petition preparers and debt-relief agencies would also be      required to provide certain notices to debtors. Credit and      charge-card companies would be required to disclose specified      information in monthly billing statements, new account      introductory rate offers, and internet-based solicitations.      CBO estimates that the direct costs of these mandates would      exceed the annual threshold established by UMRA ($109 million      in 2000, adjusted annually for inflation).       Section 102 of the bill would make bankruptcy attorneys      liable for misleading statements and inaccuracies in      schedules and documents submitted to the court or to the      trustee. To avoid sanctions and potential civil penalties,      attorneys would need to verify the information given to them      by their clients regarding the list of creditors, assets and      liabilities, and income and expenditures. Completing a      reasonable investigation of debtors' financial affairs and,      for chapter 7 cases, computing debtor eligibility, would      require attorneys to expend additional effort. Information      from the American Bar Association indicates that this      requirement would increase attorney costs by $150 to $500 per      case. Based on the 1.59 million projected filings under      chapter 7 (liquidation) and chapter 13 (rehabilitation), CBO      estimates that the direct cost of complying with this mandate      would be between $240 million and $790 million in fiscal year      2002. With a rise in projected filings over the next three      years, annual direct costs would reach a peak in fiscal year      2004 at between $280 million and $950 million and remain in      that range through fiscal year 2006. The additional costs for      attorneys would most likely be passed on to debtors.       The bill would require certain notices to be disclosed as      part of the bankruptcy process. Section 203 of the bill would      require a creditor with an unsecured consumer debt seeking a      reaffirmation agreement with a debtor to provide certain      disclosures. The agreement reaffirms the debt discharged in      bankruptcy between a holder of a claim and the debtor.       These disclosures must be made clearly and conspicuously in      writing and include certain advisories and explanations. The      required disclosures could be incorporated into existing      standard reaffirmation agreements. Section 221 would require      bankruptcy petition preparers who are not attorneys to give      the debtor written notice explaining that the preparer may      not provide legal advice. Section 228 would require a debt-     relief agency providing bankruptcy assistance to an assisted      person to give certain written notices to the person and to      execute a written contract. Such agencies also would be      required to supply certain advisories and explanations      regarding the bankruptcy process. Most attorneys and debt-     relief counselors currently provide similar information.      Based on information from bankruptcy practitioners, CBO      estimates that the direct costs of complying with these      mandates would fall well below the annual threshold      established by UMRA.       H.R. 333 also requires credit lenders to provide additional      disclosures to consumers. Credit and charge-card companies      would be required to include certain disclosures in billing      statements with respect to various open-end credit plans      regarding the disadvantages of making only the minimum      payment. Other disclosures would be required to be included      in application and solicitation materials involving      introductory rate offers, internet-based credit card      solicitations, and for late payment deadlines and penalties.      Based on information from credit lenders, CBO estimates that      the direct costs of these disclosure requirements would fall      below the annual threshold.       Other impacts       H.R. 333 also contains many provisions that would benefit      creditors. Most significant for creditors are provisions that      would shift debtors from chapter 7 to chapter 13 and      provisions that would expand the types of debts that would be      nondischargeable. By expanding the types of debts that are      nondischargeable, some creditors would continue to receive      payments on debts that would be discharged under current law.      Means-testing in the bankruptcy system would result in more      individuals being required to seek relief under chapter 13      rather than chapter 7. Because chapter 13 requires debtors to      develop a plan to repay creditors over a specified period,      the total pool of funds available for distribution for      creditors would likely increase. As long as the likelihood of      repayment by debtors and the pool of funds increases by an      amount greater than the cost to creditors of administering      the new bankruptcy code, creditors would be made better off      under the bill.       Under UMRA, duties arising from participation in voluntary      federal programs are not mandates. The bankruptcy process is      largely voluntary for debtors, and debtor-initiated      bankruptcies are equivalent to participation in a voluntary      federal program. Consequently, new duties imposed by the bill      on individuals who file as debtors do not meet the definition      of private-sector mandates, and additional cost for debtors      would not be counted as direct costs for purposes of UMRA.
