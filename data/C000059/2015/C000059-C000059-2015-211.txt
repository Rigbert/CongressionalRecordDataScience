Chairman, I know there is no doubt that Indian Country, especially Indian education, is a nonpartisan priority of this entire subcommittee. We are committed to building upon the bipartisan work of former subcommittee chairmen Mike Simpson, Jim Moran, Norm Dicks, and certainly Ranking Member Betty McCollum.  We all agree that there are great needs in Indian Country, especially in education. In fact, we were in Arizona recently at both the Navajo and Hopi reservations and saw firsthand the need for education in this country.  Although I am proud of what we have done for Indian Country in this bill, that said, I understand where the gentleman is coming from. I recognize there is so much more to do on Indian education that can and should be done.  I yield back the balance of my time.
