An extraordinary talent, his memorable on-screen characters and his remarkable ability to connect with his audience have delighted generations of moviegoers. As an actor, Karl Malden brought joy to people in ways that very few people can. Mr. Malden passed away on July 1, 2009, at the age of 97, but his legacy will forever remain in the hearts and spirits of his family and friends, as well as his many loyal fans.  Born Mladen George Sekulovich on March 22, 1912, in Chicago, Karl was raised in Gary, Indiana, a hardworking steel-producing community. The son of a Czech seamstress and a Serbian milkman and steelworker, Karl's early years were much like many of his generation who grew up in northwest Indiana at the time. As a high school student, he was a gifted athlete and student, excelling on both the basketball court and in the classroom. A leader among his peers, Karl was also the senior class president of the Gary Emerson High School class of 1931.  Following his graduation in 1931, Karl briefly considered continuing his athletic career at the collegiate level before returning to Gary, and like his father, began working in a local steel mill. His career in the mills would not last long though as his passion for theater and acting continued to grow. Early on, young Mladen often performed in Serbian plays produced by his father at his church. Undoubtedly, this had an immense impact on his decision to leave the steel mill and begin studying at Chicago's Goodman Theater. From there, Karl would eventually relocate to New York and begin performing on Broadway. Thus, the start of his illustrious career as an entertainer began.  For more than seven decades, Karl Malden brought memorable characters to the stage and screen. With more than fifty film credits and numerous plays and television projects on his resume, not to mention one of the most recognizable commercial characters in history, Karl Malden proved that he is one of the most adored and versatile actors of not only his, but all, generations. From his lesser known roles to his unforgettable, Oscar-winning performance in A Streetcar Named Desire, Karl's determination and passion for his craft were,without a doubt, an extension of the lessons he learned as a child growing up in Gary, and as a laborer in the steel mills. It is this same passion for his craft that has raised millions of dollars for programs aimed at preserving and researching the history of film.  From his high school years to his golden years, Mr. Malden was always held in high esteem by his peers, so it is no surprise that he served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for several years, and in 2004 he was honored with the Screen Actors Guild's Lifetime Achievement Award.  Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in paying tribute to an American treasure, Mr. Karl Malden. A gifted actor whose characters often embodied the hard-working, blue-collar northwest Indiana community from which he emerged, Mr. Malden has been a source of pride for the people of Gary, Indiana, for decades, and I ask that you join me in remembering him today as one of northwest Indiana's most beloved sons.                          ____________________
