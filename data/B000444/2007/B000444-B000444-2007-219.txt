 President, today I introduce legislation to ensure that the United States does not fall further into debt at the United Nations, and to pay the debt that we have accrued since January 1, 2006.  For over a year, we have not been paying our full contribution to the U.N. for its peacekeeping operations--for missions in places like Lebanon, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Kosovo--that advance our national interests and spread the burden of keeping the peace among other nations. We are approximately $80 million in debt, and the number grows every month as new bills come in for peacekeeping operations.  Here is why.  In 1994, Congress passed a law limiting U.S. payments for U.N. peacekeeping at 25 percent after fiscal year 1995. The United Nations continued to bill the United States at 31 percent. As a result, a debt accrued--that is, the gap between the 25 percent allowed under U.S. law, and the 31 percent we were charged by the U.N.  In 1999, when Congress approved the ``Helms-Biden'' law, it authorized the repayment of U.S. arrears to the U.N. conditioned on certain reforms in the U.N. system. One of those reforms was a negotiated reduction of the U.S. peacekeeping rate down to 25 percent. Through negotiations in 2000, U.S. Ambassador Holbrooke succeeded in reducing the U.S. assessments for peacekeeping to just over 27 percent.  In 2001, Congress amended the Helms-Biden law to allow the arrears payments to be provided to the U.N., even though Ambassador Holbrooke had not reached the target of 25 percent. But the original 1994 law limiting our payments to 25 percent was never repealed.  In the past few years, Congress has amended the 1994 law on a temporary basis by raising the 25 percent limitation to conform it to the rate negotiated by Ambassador Holbrooke, but the most recent temporary change in law expired on December 31, 2005.  Therefore, the law today is this: the United States may not pay more than 25 percent for peacekeeping, even though the United Nations assesses the United States at a higher rate.  Mr. President this is a problem. At a time when our government continues to seek important reforms at the United Nations, it is a mistake for us to continue to fall short on our dues. Rather than encourage reform, it may give other countries an excuse to avoid it. How can we, in good faith, fail to pay our bills while at the same time push the U.N. to get its financial house in order?  More important, U.N. peacekeeping operations advance America's national security. If the U.N. didn't do them, we might have to do so. The U.N. `blue helmets' are literally on the front lines in conflicts that are the worst of the worst: protecting civilians, monitoring cease-fires, clearing mine fields, and disarming combatants. Right now, the United States continues to seek support at the U.N. for a robust mission in Darfur. We have voted time and again in the Security Council, and rightfully so, to support these critical missions.  Through U.N. peacekeeping, the U.S. contributes to international peace and stability where we have critical foreign policy interests, while sharing the human, political and financial costs with other nations. We should not shortchange these operations.                                 ______                                       By
