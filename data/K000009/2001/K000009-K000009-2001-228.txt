Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the 100th anniversary of the East Toledo Family Center in Toledo, Ohio.  Begun by a cadre of East Toledoans who felt great pride about their neighborhood and wanted to further enhance opportunities for its residents, the East Toledo Family Center was born in 1901. It has established itself as a stalwart beacon in a community which saw continued and great change in its century of existence.  Evolving with the neighborhood and its changing needs, the center has grown into a full service neighborhood center with 40,000 square feet of space providing educational, recreational, and social programs including preschool, school age childcare, youth enrichment, programs for teens to learn about themselves and their environment, human services case management on site, a family health clinic offering family and maternal health care, and a police substation. It also coordinates with community organizations offering special programs on site.  Amazingly, the East Toledo Family Center serves more than 10,000 people each year. Its longtime former director Warren Densmore, who led the center through unprecedented growth for 38 years, encapsulated the feeling and vision of the East Toledo Family Center: ``We want to create a feeling of neighborliness by helping individuals and groups to be interested in one another and to help each other try to better the conditions around themselves physically, culturally, socially, and morally. We try to develop our own leadership, so that when a community problem or need arises we can go to work on it, individually and as groups.'' It is a philosophy which is a guiding principle yet today. The East Toledo Family Center is governed by the community, of the community, and for the community. Therein lies both its strength and its success. The East Toledo neighborhood is center stage in the planning and implementing of all of the center's opportunities.  Its mission is to ``provide quality programs and services to enhance the lives of individuals and families by meeting the emerging needs of our community. We will accomplish this by assisting seniors in maintaining independent lifestyles; preparing young people to do well in school, developing and fostering good character, and helping them become productive members of society; building strong family units within the community; coordinating services and cooperating with other agencies to improve the quality of life in the community.'' Anyone who has visited the East Toledo Family Center can attest to how well it lives its mission. It is truly a jewel in our city's crown.                          ____________________
