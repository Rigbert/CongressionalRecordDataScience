 I rise in support of the motion offered by my colleague from Nebraska to commit this bill in order to strike the more than $42 billion in cuts in the Medicare home health benefit.  Madam President, you, too, come from a pretty rural State, so I know you understand just how important home health care is to the seniors in our States. Home health care has become an increasingly important part of our health care system.
