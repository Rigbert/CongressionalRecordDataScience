Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman), I thank the gentleman for his words. There are, frankly, not very many better legislators in this Congress than the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman). He has done some extraordinary work through the years, and I appreciate his comments. I want him to know what a positive partner, as I said at the beginning of this process, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) is.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), a former Secretary of State of Rhode Island.
