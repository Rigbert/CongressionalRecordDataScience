Chairman, I might also say that the administration's request to us through the Department of Agriculture was cleared through the Office of Management and Budget in the executive branch. My own guess is that the Department of Agriculture would like to increase the PL-480 program a whole lot more than the budget submission that reached this Congress. It has to go through the filter of OMB, and that is an unrealistic way in which to make decisions about policy.  We reflect the will of the American people here, and rural America is crying out to us. We ought to use every single tool that we have, and we should not cut a dime out of the PL-480 program, with all due respect to the gentleman, who represents a great citrus-producing State, a great beef-producing State, a great milk-producing State.
