I understand and appreciate the work that the gentleman has done on this measure and it is my intention that the appropriate subcommittee of the Committee on Resources will hold a public hearing on this prior to the August recess, especially this upcoming 2000 recess.  I compliment the gentleman on his good work. He has talked to me before tonight and I appreciate the gentleman withdrawing the amendment.
