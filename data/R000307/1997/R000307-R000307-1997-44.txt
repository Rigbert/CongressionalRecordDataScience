President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with.  The amendment is as follows:       On page 28, line 19, before the period at the end of the      sentence, insert the following: ``: Provided further, That,      of the amount made available under this sentence, $4,000,000      shall be available for obligation only after the      Administrator of the Risk Management Agency issues and begins      to implement the plan to reduce administrative and operating      costs of approved insurance providers required under section      408(k)(7) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C.      1508(k)(7))''.
