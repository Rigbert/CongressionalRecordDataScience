Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Vincent D. Murray, who will receive the prestigious Harold W. McGraw, Jr. Prize in Education. Mr. Murray has been the principal of Henry W. Grady High School in Atlanta, Georgia since 1991.  Mr. Murray has been chosen for the prestigious 19th annual award for his leadership in transforming his inner-city public school into a higher achieving institution in which graduation and college-going rates consistently have risen above the district and state averages.  Sixty-six percent of Grady High students are African American and 44 percent qualify for free or reduced price lunch. When Murray joined Grady High, more than a third of all freshmen were held back and repeated their freshmen year. The student body's passing rate on the Georgia graduation test was below the statewide average.  Mr. Murray has been consistent in his efforts and focused on innovative reform. The result is that today, four out of every five graduates go directly on to college or university, including Ivy League institutions. Average scores on the graduation test, SAT and Advanced Placement exams exceed district, state and national averages. Graduation rates have risen 38 percentage points for African-American students (to 84 percent), 26 points for economically disadvantaged students (to 86 percent) and 25 points for white students (to 97 percent). As a result of Murray's success in transforming Grady High, the U.S. Department of Education recognized him in 2000 with the Department's Title I Distinguished School Award. In 2006, the governor of Georgia named him a High Performance Principal, a top honor in the state.  Mr. Murray has a bachelor of arts degree in history and English from Morehouse College, a master of arts degree in early childhood education from the University of Georgia, and a doctorate in psychology/learning disabilities from Boston University. He has pursued post-doctoral studies at Clark-Atlanta University and Georgia State University.  I salute Mr. Vincent D. Murray for his outstanding contributions to education. He has dedicated himself to improving education in this country and his accomplishments continue to make a difference.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1937]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]CONGRATULATING VINCENT D.
