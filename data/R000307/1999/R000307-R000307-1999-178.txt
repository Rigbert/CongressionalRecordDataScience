President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 4 p.m. this afternoon. The first 2 hours have been reserved for general statements, with time controlled by Senators Nickles and Durbin. The remaining 2 hours are equally divided between the majority and minority leaders, with the understanding that the time will be used for statements in relation to the situation in Kosovo.  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill. The majority leader has announced there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. However, Members are encouraged to come to the floor to offer and debate amendments today to the supplemental bill with any votes ordered postponed until tomorrow.  Members are reminded that a cloture petition was filed on Friday to the Lott second-degree amendment relating to Kosovo, with that vote occurring at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday.  I thank my colleagues for their attention and yield the floor.
