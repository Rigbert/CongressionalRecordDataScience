Private bills so      rejected by the committee will not be reconsidered during the      same Congress unless new evidence sufficient to justify a new      hearing has been presented to the committee.       (h)(1) It shall not be in order for the committee to      consider any new or original measure or matter unless written      notice of the date, place and subject matter of consideration      and to the extent practicable, a written copy of the measure      or matter to be considered, has been available in the office      of each Member of the committee for at least 48 hours in      advance of consideration, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and      legal holidays.

Open Meetings       (i) Each meeting for the transaction of business, including      the markup of legislation, of the committee shall be open to      the public, including to radio, television, and still      photography coverage, except when the committee, in open      session and with a majority present, determines by rollcall      vote that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that      day shall be closed to the public because disclosure of      matters to be considered would endanger national security,      would tend to defame, degrade or incriminate any person or      otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House. No      person other than Members of the committee and such      congressional staff and such departmental representatives as      they may authorize shall be present at any business or markup      session which has been closed to the public. This Rule does      not apply to open committee hearings which are provided for      by Rule 3(j) contained herein.       (j) Each hearing conducted by the committee shall be open      to the public including radio, television, and still      photography coverage except when the committee, in open      session and with a majority present, determines by rollcall      vote that all or part of the remainder of that hearing on      that day shall be closed to the public because disclosure of     matters to be considered would endanger national security,      would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or      would tend to defame, degrade or incriminate any person, or      otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House of      Representatives. Notwithstanding the requirements of the      preceding sentence, and Rule 2(g), a majority of those      present, there being in attendance the requisite number      required under the rules of the committee to be present for      the purpose of taking testimony:       (1) may vote to close the hearing for the sole purpose of      discussing whether testimony or evidence to be received would      endanger the national security or violate Rule XI 2(k)(5) of      the Rules of the House of Representatives; or       (2) may vote to close the hearing, as provided in rule XI      2(k)(5) of the Rules of the House of Representatives. No      Member may be excluded from nonparticipatory attendance at      any hearing of any committee or subcommittee, unless the      House of Representatives shall by majority vote authorize a      particular committee or subcommittee, for purposes of a      particular series of hearings on a particular article of      legislation or on a particular subject of investigation, to      close its hearings to Members by the same procedures      designated in this Rule for closing hearings to the public:      Provided, however, that the committee or subcommittee may by      the same procedure vote to close one subsequent day of the      hearing.       (3) Whenever a hearing or meeting conducted by the      committee is open to the public, there proceedings shall be      open to coverage by television, radio, and still photography,      except as provided in Rule XI 3(f)(2) of the House of      Representatives.

(2) No legislative report filed by the committee on any      measure or matter reported by the committee shall contain      language which has the effect of specifying the use of      federal resources more explicitly (inclusively or      exclusively) than that specified in the measure or matter as      ordered reported, unless such language has been approved by      the committee during a meeting or otherwise in writing by a      majority of the Members.                           committee records       (m)(1) The committee shall keep a complete record of all      committee action which shall include a record of the votes on      any question on which a rollcall vote is demanded. The result      of each rollcall vote shall be made available by the      committee for inspection by the public at reasonable times in      the offices of the committee. Information so available for      public inspection shall include a description of the      amendment, motion, order, or other proposition and the name      of each Member voting for and each Member voting against such      amendment, motion, order, or proposition, and the names of      those Members present but not voting.       (2) The records of the committee at the National Archives      and Records Administration shall be made available for public      use in accordance with Rule XXXVI of the Rules of the House      of Representatives. The Chairman shall notify the Ranking      Minority Member of any decision, pursuant to clause 3(b)(3)      or clause 4(b) of the Rule, to withhold a record otherwise      available, and the matter shall be presented to the committee      for a determination on the written request of any Member of      the committee.

Any requests by those Members, staff      or witnesses to correct any errors other than errors, in      transcription, or disputed errors in transcription, shall be      appended to the record, and the appropriate place where the      change is requested will be footnoted. Prior to approval by      the Chairman of hearings conducted jointly with another      congressional committee, a memorandum of understanding shall      be prepared which incorporates an agreement for the      publication of the verbatim transcript. Transcripts of      markups shall be recorded and published in the same manner as      hearings before the committee and shall be included as part      of the legislative report unless waived by the Chairman.                   opening statements; 5-minute rule       (o) Insofar as is practicable, the Chairman, after      consultation with the Ranking Minority Member, shall limit      the total time of opening statements by Members to no more      than 10 minutes, the time to be divided equally among Members      present desiring to make an opening statement.

The rules of germaneness will be enforced by the      Chairman.       (p) Notwithstanding rule 3(o), upon a motion, the Chairman,      in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member, may      designate an equal number of Members from each party to      question a witness for a period not longer than 30 minutes,      or, upon a motion, may designate staff from each party to      question a witness for equal specific periods.                      requests for written motions       (q) Any legislative or non-procedural motion made at a      regular or special meeting of the committee and which is      entertained by the Chairman shall be presented in writing      upon the demand of any Member present and a copy made      available to each Member present.
