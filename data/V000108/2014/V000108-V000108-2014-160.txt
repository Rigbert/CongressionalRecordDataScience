Speaker, it is with great respect and sincere admiration that I rise today to celebrate Black History Month and its 2014 theme--Civil Rights in America, focusing on the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This year's theme reflects on the many courageous individuals who fought for an end to discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Through the passage of the Civil Rights Act, discrimination was outlawed in public facilities including restaurants and hotels, ending the era of legal segregation in such establishments.   Leading up to the passage of the Civil Rights Act, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led the Civil Rights March on Washington fighting for, amongst other ideals, meaningful civil rights legislation, including better employment opportunities and an end to segregation. This historic event led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which paved the way for future anti-discrimination legislation, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965. While there is more work to be done, we must follow in the footsteps of the great leaders of the Civil Rights Movement in order to ensure that every American is afforded equal opportunity and justice.   This month and always, it is important that we honor and celebrate America's greatest advocates for equal rights and civil liberties, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Dubois, and Thurgood Marshall, and to remember the extraordinary contributions of organizations including the NAACP, the National Urban League, and the Congress for Racial Equality, as well as many others which have played such a critical role in changing the landscape of American society for the better. As we pay tribute to these heroes of African American history, let us remember their profound perseverance, sacrifice, and struggle in the fight for freedom and equality which has shaped our great nation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in celebrating Black History Month and honoring those who fought, and those who continue to fight, for civil rights and justice. Through the efforts of these honorable individuals, we are reminded how far we have come as a nation, while realizing there is still progress to be made.                          ____________________
