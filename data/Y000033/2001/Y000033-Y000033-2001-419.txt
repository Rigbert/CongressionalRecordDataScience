Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for that enlightening comment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Since we have debated this issue five or six times here this afternoon and this evening, I just want to make the point again that Congress, since in the times that I have been here, has never refused to meet its responsibility when it came to natural disasters, not only in the United States but in many parts of the world, and we will continue to do so.  If the gentleman were to be correct that we are wrong, and I do not think we are, but if he were to be correct, Congress would react quickly to meet any problems that might occur from a natural disaster.
