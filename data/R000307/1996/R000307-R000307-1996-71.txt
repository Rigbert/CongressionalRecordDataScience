Speaker, I say to the gentleman from Missouri, ``Mr. Emerson, we love you, man.''  And to Mr. Pomeroy and Mr. Taylor and Mr. Volkmer, good friends of mine all, I have a lengthy, lengthy refutation as to why freedom to farm is notwelfare, and how we have halved the budget in regards to agriculture and saved $10 billion. But I am just going to autograph what I have down here, and turn it in, and revise and extend.           The Market Transition Payment and the Welfare Myth       The political rhetoric: Currently within the agricultural      community there are some who seem to be concerned with the      appropriateness of federal payments--``market transition      payments'' under the Agricultural Market Transition Act--for      farmers during periods of high prices. Some even liken market      transition payments to welfare. Agriculture Secretary Dan      Glickman, in recommending a Presidential veto of the Balanced      Budget Act, restated this position:       . . . As we move to balance the budget, farmers should not      receive windfall payments when market conditions are good.      They should receive assistance when in greatest need--when      prices are low, as provided for by the current structure of      programs. . . .       I have highlighted ``market conditions'' and ``low      prices.'' This statement may reflect the Secretary's      thinking, but is the statement accurate in the real world of      agriculture? First, farm programs are not welfare and      partisan statements equating farm programs with welfare do a      disservice to farmers and ranchers.       Check Webster's--Agriculture doesn't fit the definition of      welfare: One of the most unfair arguments against farmers is      to say that agriculture payments--of any kind--are welfare      payments. Under current law, to receive ``welfare,'' whether      it's food stamps or Aid to Families with Dependent Children      (AFDC), an individual simply meets the definition of      ``disadvantaged'' to receive government assistance. In total      contrast, farmers work on their land, and receive a payment      for agreeing to a variety of conditions. FIRST, farmers must      adhere to environmental mandates--conservation compliance and      wetlands requirements--in return for a federal payment. There      is a clear exchange of beneficial environmental practices for      benefits received by farmers in the program. Second, the      federal payment helps to offset unfair trading practices      under which farmers live. Farmers are at the mercy of many      trade restrictions. Major markets in the Middle East such as      Iran and Iraq are under export embargoes. Threats to      continued trade with China also pose significant concern in      American agriculture. And finally, due to federal assistance,      U.S. farmers can ensure a stable and affordable food supply      for American consumers. A federal payment is a small price      for a national food supply that guarantees the basic staples      of bread, meat and milk at the lowest prices in the world.       What about ``high and low prices'' and farm income: Those      who call a market transition payment ``welfare'' follow the      basic proposition that Congress cannot justify paying farmers      when prices are high because they would get an enormous      ``windfall.'' For this scenario to work, farmers must be      selling above average quantities of commodities at very high      prices. But, does that often happen? The answer is no.       Here's how it really works: Think of the basics of supply      and demand: When supplies are tight, prices go up; when      supplies are excessive, prices drop. Supply--tight or      excessive--usually determines a windfall profit. Farmers      receiving a windfall through a market transition payment      during periods of high commodity prices, as Secretary      Glickman indicates, depends upon whether farmers actually      have a commodity to sell.       Follow this example: Consider the two following scenarios      that a wheat farmer could face:       High prices: Wheat: $5.00 per bushel; average production:      15/bu./acre; Gross Revenue acre: $75/acre.       Low Prices: Wheat: $3.00 per bushel; Average Production: 40      bu./acre; Gross Revenue/Acre: $120/acre.       Who's right?: Under the current government program in the      situation outlined above, the farmer should receive a payment      in the year of relative low prices even though his income is      higher. In fact, those who complain about giving a payment      when prices are high cannot justify their view when you      compare farmers' gross revenues. When you actually look at      the real world facts, the rhetorically-popular ``welfare''      argument no longer hold up.       Market transition payments allow farmers to manage their      own destinies: A market transition payment gives the farmer      responsibility for his own economic life. Just as farmers      will need to look to the market for production and market      signals, the Agricultural Market Transition Program will      require farmers to manage their own finances to meet market      swings. Government is out of the business of running the      farm.       Don't believe us--check with the economists: The economic      consulting firm of Abel, Daft, Earley and Ward looked at the      calculations and agreed. They said, ``variations in      production more than offset variations in market price,      usually in the opposite direction. While market prices      typically are lower with a larger crop, the positive impact      of an increase in crop size on crop value more than offsets      the negative impact of a lower market price. And, the reverse      is true as well. The increase in market price associated with      a small crop is typically not sufficient to offset the      negative effect a small crop has on crop value.''       How to avoid a $2 billion payback disaster: The facts prove      that the market transition payment is NOT welfare for      farmers. Indeed, it actually corrects a major flaw in the      present target price system. High prices, but no crop, means      farmers have to pay back their advance deficiency payments.      Without a crop or federal payment, farmers have repeatedly      called for disaster assistance in the past--which costs      billions of dollars. That's why the market transition payment      is a sound basis for the transition out of a 60-year-old      government-run farm program. The key in looking at the policy      options is to consider farm income, not high price.       What about ``market conditions'': Market conditions involve      much more than price. One ``market condition'' could be the      circumstance of weather-related factors. The market      transition contract will provide payments in lean years as      well as in a year such as this when production is down in      various regions of the country, but prices are strong. One      thing is very clear: The market transition payment is not a      welfare payment. the federal agricultural improvement and reform act is responsible to                                taxpayers       1. Average expenditures for commodity and export programs      in this farm bill are significantly less than previous farm      bills.       Average expenditures for commodity and export programs (CCC      expenditures): 1985 Act-$15.5 billion per year; 1990 Act-     $10.6 billion per year; HR 2854-$6.7 billion per year.       2. Budget Certainty. Expenditures are capped so that ag      program spending is no longer an open-ended entitlement.       CBO is the 1985 farm bill would cost $55 billion over 5      years--it cost nearly $80 billion.       The 1990 farm bill was supposed to cost about $41 billion--     instead it cost $56 billion.       Under this bill there is budget certainty--expenditures      will not exceed $47 billion on farm programs and ag. export      promotion programs.       3. Payment limitation is reduced by 20 percent, to $40,000      from the current level of $50,000.       4. Part of the payments are really to compensate producers      for the fact that deficiency payments have been capitalized      in land values. The transition payments will buffer any      shocks to land values that may come about as we move to a      more market-oriented agriculture.       5. The Market Transition Payment recognizes the fact that      high prices do not translate into high income levels. Often      the reason prices are high is because farmers didn't have a      crop and a high price times no crops does not equal high      income.       6. Payments are based on 85 percent of each farm's former      base acres and program yield multiplied by the per bushel      payment. Estimated average payments are corn: 36 cents per      bushel, wheat: 63 cents per bushel, upland cotton: 7.3 cents      per pound and rice: $2.43 per cwt.                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                                       Committee on Resources,                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1996.     Hon. Pat Roberts,     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Although the Speaker declined to name      members from the Committee on Resources as conferees on the      House and Senate farm bills, both measures do contain      provisions which fall within the Committee on Resources'      jurisdiction. I am sending this letter to confirm our      continued jurisdictional interest in these provisions and      hope that you will take our views into consideration during      the conference on S. 1541 and H.R. 2854.       Senate bill (S. 1541)       Section 313, Wetlands Reserve Program. Section 313 of the      Senate bill amends the wetlands reserve program of the Food      Security Act. As the primary successor in interest to the      Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, the Resources      Committee received its jurisdiction over ``fisheries and      wildlife, including restoration and conservation''. The      Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee has successfully      argued that the crucial role that wetlands serve as habitat      for migratory waterfowl, their contribution to the nutrient      base and habitat for many species of fish and wildlife      (including endangered species) at critical stages in their      development and their function in shoreline protection and      flood protection all gave that Committee a strong      jurisdictional interest in legislation affecting wetlands.      The Merchant Marine Committee's jurisdiction over bills      affecting wetlands, including those amending or affecting the      Food Security Act, have long been recognized, with the      Committee receiving sequential referrals on the wetlands      provisions of the farm bills in both 1985 and 1990. The 1985      Food Security Act report (H. Rept. 99-272, Part II) states      ``(t)he Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee's      jurisdiction over fish and wildlife, including habitat,      provides the basis for Committee jurisdiction over      legislation affecting wetlands''. Most recently, the Merchant      Marine Committee was also represented on the 1990 conference      on the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act.      Finally, the Resources Committee itself has received      referrals of wetlands bills in the past (see H.R. 1203, a      bill to promote the conservation of migratory waterfowl and      to offset or prevent the serious loss of wetlands by the      acquisition of wetlands and other essential habitat, referred      to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs in the 99th      Congress).       The changes proposed to the wetlands reserve program in      section 313 of the Senate bill will enhance benefits for fish      and wildlife     while also recognizing landowner rights. We have no objection      to including the measure in the conference report as long as      our jurisdictional interests in this matter continue to be      recognized.       Section 545. Cooperative Work for Protection, Management,      and Improvement of the National Forest System. The Committee      on Resources has jurisdiction over ``forest reserves . . .      created from the public domain''. This provision would affect      the operation of these forests. With this understanding of      our jurisdictional interest, however, we have no objection to      having the provision included in the conference report.       Section 554, Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. This      section establishes a $50 million Wildlife Habitat Incentive      Program overseen by the Secretary of Agriculture. The program      will provide payments to landowners to develop ``upland      wildlife, wetland wildlife, threatened and endangered      species, fisheries and other types of wildlife habitat      approved by the Secretary.''       We are sympathetic to the policy underlying this measure,      which is similar to provisions included in H.R. 2275,      reauthorizing the Endangered Species Act of 1972, However, we      also believe that, based on the arguments outlined above, the      Committee on Resources would be the primary committee of      jurisdiction should this provision be introduced as a      separate bill. We have no objection to its inclusion in the      conference report, but will fully exercise our jurisdiction      over the implementation of the program in the future.       Section 557, Clarification of Effect of Resource Planning      on Allocation or Use of Water. Section 557 amends the Forest      and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act and the      Federal Land Policy and Management Act to ensure that private      property rights, including water rights, will be recognized      and protected in the course of special use permitting      decisions. The Committee on Resources shares jurisdiction      over these laws based on its jurisdiction over ``forest      reserves and national parks created from the public domain''.      Section 557 would affect the management of National Forests      created from the public domain.       We agree with the policy underlying these amendments and      would have no objection to including the provision in the      conference report with this recognition of our shared      jurisdiction.       Section 824, Aquaculture Assistance Programs. The Committee      on Resources enjoys jurisdiction over aquaculture, as      outlined in the discussion below. The amendments made by this      section to the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and      Teaching Policy Act of 1977 implement the National      Aquaculture Act referenced below for the Department of      Agriculture. Although we prefer that all aquaculture      activities take place as part of the larger aquaculture plan      developed under the National Aquaculture Act, the amendments      made by this section are acceptable and we have no objection      to including this provision in the final conference report.       Section 872, Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research      Center. This provision is a slightly modified version of H.R.      33, a bill introduced in the 104th Congress by Congresswoman      Lincoln to transfer a fish laboratory in Arkansas from the      Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture.      The bill was referred solely to the Committee on Resources,      and passed by the House of Representatives on December 18,      1995, by voice vote under Suspension of the Rules.       With this understanding of our jurisdiction, we have no      objection to including this measure in the conference report,      with one change. We noticed after passage in the House that      the bill contains a typographical error: it refers to      ``station and stations''; it should be ``station or      stations'' to execute properly.       Section 873, National Aquaculture Policy, Planning and      Development. This section amends the National Aquaculture Act      of 1980. The bill creating that Act (H.R. 20, 96th Congress)      was referred originally to the Merchant Marine and Fisheries      Committee. I was an original cosponsor of the measure. After      it was reported, it was sequentially referred to the      Committee on Agriculture. The reauthorization of the law in      1984 was provided for in H.R. 2676 (98th Congress); the      referral pattern is the same. The law was again reauthorized      in 1985 as part of the Food Security Act of 1985, which      incorporated the National Aquaculture Act reauthorization      measure H.R. 1544, a bill referred originally to Merchant      Marine and sequentially to Agriculture. Finally, the Act was      reauthorized in 1990 in the Food Security Act of 1990. As      stated earlier, the Merchant Marine Committee received a      sequential referral of the 1990 and 1985 farm bills,      including a referral of sections of the bills dealing with      aquaculture.       In addition, in the 103rd Congress, Congressman Studds      introduced H.R. 4853, which amended the National Sea Grant      College Program Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act to      enhance marine aquaculture in the United States. This bill      was referred solely to the Merchant Marine and Fisheries      Committee. Mr. Studds also introduced H.R. 4854, which      amended the National Aquaculture Act of 1980; that bill was      jointly referred to the Merchant Marine and Agriculture      Committees. Finally, in the 103rd Congress, Congresswoman      Lambert introduced H.R. 4676, a bill which looks remarkably      similar to Section 873. This bill was also jointly referred      to Merchant Marine and Agriculture Committees. It is very      clear that the Committee on Resources has a substantial      jurisdictional interest in aquaculture.       Section 873 makes radical changes to the National      Aquaculture Act, including changing the definition of      ``aquaculture'' to exclude private ocean ranching of Pacific      salmon in a State where such salmon is prohibited by law. In      addition, the section adds a definition of ``private      aquaculture'' to include the activities of ``the Federal      Government, any State or local government, or any Indian      tribe recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.'' Most      importantly, the amendments to the National Aquaculture Act      strips the co-equal decision making authority of the      Secretaries of Interior, Commerce and Agriculture in      developing Federal aquaculture policy, and gives this      authority to the Secretary of Agriculture, with a mere      consultative role for the other Secretaries. In short, if      adopted, these proposed amendments would cede authority for      all forms of aquaculture, both onshore and offshore, to the      Department of Agriculture.       This is a major policy departure from the original Act, In      the 1980 law, it is clear that all three Departments will      have equal status in developing policy, regulations and the      continuing assessment of aquaculture in the United States. In      fact, the Act authorizes equal funding for the three      Departments for Fiscal Years 1991, 1992 and 1993.       While changes to the National Aquaculture Act may be      warranted, we have not addressed this issue during the 104th      Congress. Therefore, until the Committee on Resources has had      an opportunity to examine the need for change in United      States aquaculture policy and these specific changes, we ask      that you drop this provision from any conference agreement at      this time.       HOUSE BILL (H.R. 2854)       Section 507, Everglades Agricultural Area. Section 507, as      added on the House Floor, provides $210 million to the      Secretary of the Interior for restoration of the Florida      Everglades. Even under a very restrictive view of the Rules      of the House, the Committee on Resources would have primary      jurisdiction over this provision as it affects the Everglades      National Park, several National Wildlife Refuges, the Florida      Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the restoration of the      Everglades for the benefit of fish and wildlife.       One of the House conferees on this section, Congressman      Richard Pombo has been working extensively with me and my      staff to see that protections for the Everglades are      effective, reasonable and in the public interest. Therefore,      I would support the inclusion of an Everglades acquisition      provision in the final conference report IF the provision is      acceptable to Congressman Pombo.       New Provision. We understand that the conference committee      may include a measure similar to section 872 of the Senate      bill which transfers a fish culture laboratory in Marion,      Alabama, from the Department of the Interior to the      Department of Agriculture. This provision is taken from H.R.      1205, the Marion National Aquaculture Research Center Act of      1995, introduced by Congressman Hilliard. The bill was      referred to both resources and Agriculture Committees.       Although we do not have the benefit of a hearing record on      this measure (as with the Stuttgart fish laboratory      transfer), we know of no reason why the laboratory should not      be transferred between the departments. Therefore, with this      recognition of our jurisdiction, we have no objection to this      discretionary measure being included in the conference      report.       I appreciate your consideration of these recommendations      (which affect what I hope are noncontroversial provisions in      the historic Agricultural Market Transition Act) and ask that      you include this letter in the conference report on the      bills. You and your staff should be congratulated on the      reforms you are trying to accomplish in the text of these      bills.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,     Chairman.                                                                    ____                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                                         Committee on Science,                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1996.      Hon. Pat Roberts,     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Roberts: I am writing to clarify the      legislative history associated with the termination of the      Agricultural Weather Service which you reference in the Joint      Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference on H.R.      2854, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of      1996. As you are aware, under Rule X (n)(11) of the House of      Representatives, the National Weather Service (NWS) and all      its programs are within the jurisdiction of the Science      Committee.       Last year, during consideration of the fiscal year (FY)      1996 authorization of the NWS' programs, the Science      Committee amended the NWS Organic Act to forbid the NWS from      continuing specialized weather services that can be provided      by the private sector including the Agricultural Weather      Service. The Committee also included report language which      specifically addressed the issue of the Agricultural Weather      Service. Report 104-237 (Part 1) reads:       ``* * * The Committee supports terminating the National      Weather Service Agricultural and Fruit Frost specialized      weather forecast programs in fiscal year 1996. The Committee      notes that concerns have been raised about terminating the      programs on     October 1, 1995. The Committee believes that the Secretary of      Commerce should have flexibility to continue the programs      beyond October 1, 1995 if he finds that the private sector is      unwilling or unable to provide replacement services. Under no      circumstances should such an extension last beyond April 1,      1996.       ``* * * No additional money has been authorized for the      continuation of existing Agricultural and Fruit Frost      services and any expenses associated with these services, if      necessary, should come from National Weather Service's      operating budget * * *''       The Committee's NWS authorization passed the House on      October 12, 1995 as part of H.R. 2405, the Omnibus Civilian      Science Authorization Act of 1995. On March 4, 1996, the      National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)      printed notice of its intent to terminate specialized weather      services including the Agricultural Weather Service on April      1, 1996 in the Federal Register.       The Science Committee continues to support the      privatization of specialized weather services such as the      Agricultural Weather Service. The Committee expects the      service to be terminated on April 1, 1996. Further, the      Committee has not authorized appropriations for Agricultural      Weather Service for FY 1996 or FY 1997, and no money should      be appropriated for its continuation.       I hope this letter helps clarify the legislative history      associated with the Agricultural Weather Service. Please let      me know if I can provide you with any additional information      on the subject.           Cordially,                                                 Robert S. Walker,     Chairman.                                                                    ____     Hon. Robert S. Walker,     Chairman, Committee on Science,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter. As you      indicate, under Rule X of the House of Representatives, the      National Weather Service and all its programs fall under the      primary jurisdiction of the Committee on Science. The      statement of the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee      of Conference on H.R. 2854, the ``Federal Agriculture      Improvement and Reform Act of 1996'', was intended as an      expression of support for a program within the Science      Committee's jurisdiction and this Committee's concern that      weather service be provided to rural areas and that those      involved in agriculture continue to have adequate collection      and dissemination of weather data.       Thank you for providing me with the historical context      under which the Department of Commerce has recommended      terminating the agricultural weather service.           Sincerely,                                                      Pat Roberts,                                                         Chairman.
