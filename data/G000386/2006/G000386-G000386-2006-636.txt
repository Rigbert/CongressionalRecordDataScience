 President, Today, I wish to honor an heroric Iowan who has given the ultimate sacrifice for his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. SGT Nathan R. Field died January 7, 2006, in Umm Qasr, Iraq due to injuries sustained when his Humvee was hit by a civilian vehicle. Sgt. Field was assigned to the 4249th Port Security Company, U.S. Army Reserve out of Pocahontas, IA, but was temporarily assigned with the 414th Military Police of Joplin, MO. I want to extend my condolences to his parents Bill and Mary, his brother Eli, his fiancee Connie, and his many family members and friends.  Sergeant Field graduated from South East Webster High School in 2000 where he was a member of the student council, senior class president, captain of the wrestling team, and was a three year member of the football team and manager of the football team his senior year. SGT Field enlisted in the Army Reserve while still in high school and after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. His unit was called to active duty where he accompanied ships to Belgium, France and Germany. In September of 2005, he volunteered for duty in Iraq, something that he felt compelled to do for the freedom of our country.  Nathan Field will be remembered for his loyalty to friends and for his love of life. As his father said, ``If Nathan liked you, there wasn't anything he wouldn't do for you.'' I call on my colleagues in the Senate and every American to pay tribute to this brave American and to give thanks to this courageous soldier who gave the ultimate sacrifice in defending our freedom.                          ____________________[Page S248]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES                        Sergeant Nathan R.
