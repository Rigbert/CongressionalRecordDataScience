President, I come to the Senate floor today to stand up for a small business in my home state--the Rutland Fire Clay Company of Rutland, VT.  For the past week, a coalition of 240 special interest organizations have run a series of the same paid advertisements in such Washington-based publications as Roll Call and National Journal's Congress Daily AM . The targets of these interest groups in this expensive ad campaign are, of course, the members of this body and of the House of Representatives. The advertisement uses the recent bankruptcy reorganization filing of the Rutland Fire Clay Company to promote the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act, S. 758 and H.R. 1283.  Mr. President, here is a copy of this ad. The headline is: ``How asbestos litigation ruined a family business.'' Then in the body of the advertisement is this pullout headline: ``Rutland Fire Clay Files For Chap. 11.'' Throughout the ad is the history of this 116-year-old Vermont firm as reported in the Rutland Herald on October 19, 1999.  Finally, the ad concludes with this statement: ``we believe that the interests of the hundreds of large and small businesses affected by this national travesty, their employees, pensioners, communities who depend on them, and their millions of shareholders warrant your support of the Act as well.'' I ask unanimous consent that the text of this advertisement be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.
