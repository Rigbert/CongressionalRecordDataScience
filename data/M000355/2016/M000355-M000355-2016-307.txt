 President, Senators have been continuing their work across the aisle to reach an agreement on a continuing resolution that will help keep Americans safer from Zika, provide critical funding for veterans, and keep the government open.  I have been encouraged by the progress that we have made so far, and I hope to see it continue as we work toward a final bill which will extend through December 9 at last year's enacted level.  We all know how important the measure is. So let's keep working and get this done.                          ____________________
