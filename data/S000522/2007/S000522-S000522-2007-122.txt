Madam Speaker, I, along with my colleague, Representative Bart Stupak, Co-Chair of the Spina Bifida Caucus, would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the life of Harold (Hal) Pote. Hal Pote, the founder and President of the Spina Bifida Foundation (SBF), passed away unexpectedly on June 26, 2007. Mr. Pote's dedication towards educating the public on the Nation's most common, permanently disabling birth defect has not gone unnoticed. We are deeply saddened by this loss and we know that many of our colleagues on Capitol Hill share these sentiments as well.  Spina Bifida develops during the first month of pregnancy when the spinal column does not close completely. Over 70,000 individuals in the United States currently live with Spina Bifida and it occurs in approximately seven out of every 10,000 live births. Mr. Pote began his campaign to increase awareness surrounding Spina Bifida when his nephew Gregory was born with this disabling condition almost 22 years ago. Gregory has undergone more than 20 surgeries, all of which Mr. Pote was there to support--and his dedication expands beyond his nephew as he was committed to ensuring that all individuals living with SpinaBifida have access to, and enjoy, a high quality of life. Additionally, Mr. Pote devoted his efforts to preventing the incidence of Spina Bifida by educating women on the importance of consuming folic acid prior to pregnancy and throughout their childbearing years.  Not only has Mr. Pote been successful in his endeavors to raise awareness surrounding Spina Bifida, he had a very successful business career as well. He attended Princeton University where he received a bachelor's degree in economics and subsequently received a Masters of Business Administration from Harvard Business School. Mr. Pote's hard work eventually led to his nomination as Chairman and CEO of Fidelity Bank at the age of 37. After co-founding the Beacon Group, he was appointed to lead Chase Manhattan's Regional Banking Group--eventually culminating with a position as chairman of Retail Financial Services for JP Morgan Chase. Once Mr. Pote retired from JP Morgan Chase, he served as CEO of the American Financial Realty Trust in Philadelphia.  In its 8 years of existence, under Mr. Pote's steadfast leadership, SBF has achieved many incredible successes for the Spina Bifida community. Due to Mr. Pote's perseverance and commitment to reducing the suffering from Spina Bifida, and advancing medical research in the field, individuals born with Spina Bifida are now living much longer, fuller lives than they had previously.  Mr. Pote's vision and dedication has helped not only Gregory, but tens of thousands of people who suffer from Spina Bifida as well. Hal Pote's sudden and unexpected death is a tragedy not only to his loved ones and the Spina Bifida community, but to all our colleagues who have lost a great man. To Mr. Pote's wife, Linda Johnson, his mother Lucille Bock Pote, his two brothers Frank and Corey Pote, and his nephews--we offer our deepest condolences.  We ask our colleagues to join us in saluting and remembering this extraordinary man.                          ____________________
