President, I thank the Senator from Utah.  I want to try to bring this down to the bottom line. This really is a debate about children's health coverage. This is not a debate about immigration. I hope my colleagues will be willing to have that debate about immigration, and soon, because it is long overdue in this country.  Much of this debate is focused on the idea that this provision in the bill would call on undocumented immigrants to abuse the system and that our financially strapped system would be run down by an influx of these undocumented immigrants jumping onboard.  Let me make it clear: Undocumented immigrants have never been eligible for the major benefit programs in America, and this law does not change that. We are talking about legal immigrants, people who are in the United States legally, people who are working and paying taxes, people who are more than likely to become tomorrow's citizens.  It is a different group.
