I can assure him we are trying to move through as many as we can. I hope, for example, the President will nominate more district judges, too. There are about 77 percent district court vacancies; about 77 percent do not even have a nominee. There is a real problem and we will work with the administration.  Some of the slowdowns have been taken care of, as the Senator from Oklahoma knows. We had a number of judges who were held up because the White House did not directly answer the question whether they had been arrested or convicted in the last 10 years. We thought that was at least a worthwhile thing to know for someone getting a lifetime appointment. I think the White House might have realized it made sense and allowed them to answer the question, and it broke a logjam. We had 10 nominations, 5 judges, that went through this morning. My intention is to keep moving as rapidly as we can.  I ask the distinguished acting Republican leader, we could have rollcalls on the next two judges, or if he has no objection, I would ask we do them by voice vote. If he would like rollcalls, that is his right.
