Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.  If I can have the chairman's attention just for a moment, I assume we are not looking for specific times and speakers on this matter but will go back and forth in the usual fashion as people arrive. Is that agreeable?
