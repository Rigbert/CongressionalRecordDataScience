Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I have one point because asthma has been brought up.  When I was chairman of the Environment Committee a number of years ago, we had done significant studies on the increase in asthma. The gentleman is correct on income levels.  The lower income folks are suffering from asthma at greater numbers primarily because of indoor pollution. One of the reasons, if we can get into the specifics of why that has occurred, is because we have carpets now and drapes and we don't use linoleum and so forth that we used to have, and so we have the growth of indoor air pollution, and kids don't get outside as much as they used to.  So I think we sometimes blame other factors for asthma, and sometimes the other factors are more to blame. But this program, DERA, is a program that works, continues to work; and I know it has in my area, and I know it has in other areas throughout the United States.  So, Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
