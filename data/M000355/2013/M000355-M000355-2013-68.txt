 President, I would like to start this morning by quoting something my good friend the majority leader said back in 2007--back when Congress was weighing whether to raise the debt ceiling. Here is what the majority leader said back then:       Until we change the policies that led down this path, we      will be back year after year, digging the hole ever deeper.  And, of course, that is essentially what so many Americans are saying today: If we are going to address the debt ceiling, then let's also address the root causes of the debt. It just makes good sense.  One would think our friend the majority leader would continue to agree with this logic as well, but that is not what he has been saying lately. He is basically saying that it would be irresponsible for Congress to address the most pressing problem we face in the country, that it would be reckless to raise the debt ceiling if that also meant doing something about the debt. In other words, he now seems to think the best thing to do about our crushing Federal debt is to do nothing at all. That is why my friend the majority leader introduced legislation this week to now allow another $1 trillion to be added to the debt with no strings attached at all, none, just a $1 trilliondebt ceiling increase: Just keep raising the credit card limit and letting someone else deal with it later on.  We now have a debt close to $17 trillion--nearly double what it was in 2007. We are borrowing nearly $2 billion a day--$2 billion a day--and apparently our friends on the other side are fine with that.
