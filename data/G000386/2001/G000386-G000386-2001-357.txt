m. on Friday, May 18, for a pro forma session only. No business will be conducted during Friday's session of the Senate. I further ask that, on Friday, the Senate immediately adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on Monday, May 21, and immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume consideration of the reconciliation bill.
