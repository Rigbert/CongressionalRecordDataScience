Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Washington for entering into this colloquy.  Would the gentleman agree to work with me and other members of the Northwest congressional delegation to seek an agreement that will allow theForest Service to move ahead within the next year on regulations that fully implement the ban and deal with the issue of sourcing areas in a reasonable manner?
