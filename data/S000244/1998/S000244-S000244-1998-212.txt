Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.  The gentleman from North Carolina, when he gave his statement, referred to the testimony of a Peter Madland who used to be the President of the Tavern League of Wisconsin, talking about how big his place was and how much his gross income was.                              {time}  1315  But what the gentleman from North Carolina did not tell us, and he would not yield to me so I could enlighten him, is that under the Sensenbrenner amendment, Mr. Madland's establishment would not be exempt from paying ASCAP fees.  He testified before the subcommittee of the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) on July 17, 1997, that he has 20,000 to 25,000 square feet in his establishment. It is a big bar. I have never been there, it is in the district represented by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey). But the exemption contained in both the McCollum amendment and the Sensenbrenner amendment goes to 3,500 square feet, and Mr. Madland's establishment is way over that. He does not get a free ride. He is going to pay the same ASCAP fee as he has paid before because he has a big establishment.  For the gentleman from North Carolina, having presided over the hearing where Mr. Madland testified on how big his establishment is, to make a representation that this major operator was going to get a free ride I think is regrettable.
