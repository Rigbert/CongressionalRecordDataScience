Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, John Greaves. On May 29, 2001, John will be honored for his dedicated service to the United Steelworkers of America Local 6787 at a dinner to be held at American Legion Post 260 in Portage, Indiana.  John's distinguished career in the labor movement has made his community and nation a better place in which to live and work. For more than 30 years, John has worked at Bethlehem Steel Corporation and has been a dedicated member of Local 6787.  While a member of Local 6787, John served as Treasurer from 1984-1987, Chairman of the Grievance Procedure from 1987-1989 and Trustee from 1990 until his retirement earlier this year. Additionally, he serves as President of the Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor. John has devoted his entire working career to the expansion of labor ideals and fair standards for all working people. He has been a strong voice for the steel industry, meeting frequently with legislators in Indianapolis and lobbying leaders in Washington. Additionally, he has worked on a county level as a liaison between labor, industry and government to make the interests of working men and women known.  While John has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to the betterment of union members, he has always found the time to serve his community as well. He serves as a board member for the Westchester YMCA and the Porter County Chapter of the American Red Cross. He is a former member of the Jaycees of America and served as a Labor Board member for the Porter County United Way.  On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to John Greaves. His large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions he prominently has made. His work in the labor movement provided union workers in Northwest Indiana opportunities they might not have otherwise had. John's leadership kept the region's labor force strong and helped keep America working. Those in the labor movement will surely miss John's dedication and sincerity. I sincerely wish John Greaves a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
