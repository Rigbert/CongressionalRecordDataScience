 President, today with my colleague Senator Cantwell, I wish to commemorate Mayor Jim Haggerton for his 30 years of public service. Mr. Haggerton first served the people of Tukwila, WA as a member of the planning commission from 1985 to 1994 and thereafter as a member of the city council from 1994 to 2007. Since 2008, Mr. Haggerton has served as mayor of Tukwila. On December 31, Mr. Haggerton will retire after 30 years of service to Tukwila.  During his tenure, Mr. Haggerton has consistently provided outstanding leadership, kept the interests of the public at the forefront of his work, celebrated the city's diversity, and supported its neighborhoods, businesses, and residents. Mr. Haggerton successfully spearheaded dozens of major development and public infrastructure projects including the new Klickitat interchange, the Tukwila South Development Agreement, opening the LINK Light Rail Station in Tukwila, the South Park Bridge, a permanent Tukwila Commuter Rail and Amtrak Station, the Southcenter Parkway, and the redevelopment of Interurban Avenue. Mayor Haggerton fought to redevelop neglected and crime-ridden property along Tukwila International Boulevard, which culminated in the Tukwila Village Development Agreement. Additionally, Mr. Haggerton fiercely advocated to fund new crimefighting initiatives and led efforts to build sports and recreational facilities in Tukwila. Throughout his career, I was consistently impressed with Mayor Haggerton's commitment and contributions to the local community.
