I so appreciate his leadership because this is a chance, with the Reed proposal, to make sure the consumers in this country can get what they need without litigation. I hope Members of the Senate will see this ought to be the wave of the future. It is a revolution in the concept of consumer protection because what this part of our proposal does, under the leadership of the Senator from Rhode Island, is essentially say: Let's try to help the patients and the families early on in the process. Let's not let problems fester and continue and eventually result in huge problems which can lead to litigation.  It seems to me--I want the Senator from Rhode Island to address this--what he is doing is essentially changing consumer protection so it ought to be at the front end when problems have not become so serious.
