Mr. Speaker, let us stop kidding ourselves. Partial birth abortion is child abuse. That some otherwise smart and even brilliant people have been so thoroughly fooled by the abortion industry's outrageous lies and distortions and half-truths and those surface appeal arguments is at best disappointing and unsettling.  How can anyone in this Chamber or in the White House defend sticking a pair of scissors into a partially born child's head so as to puncture the child's skull and then a suction catheter is inserted to suck out the child's brains? How can anybody defend that?  My wife Marie is a former elementary schoolteacher. This morning she said that, if a child or a student were to do that to her doll, stick the doll in the back of the head with scissors, wewould think the child needed psychological counseling and would immediately call for that kind of help. Yet the abortion President, Bill Clinton, seeks to continue legal sanction of this gruesome assault on children, with real scissors and real babies.  Finally, we are seeing what the right to choose really means executing untold thousands of children by stabbing them and sucking out their brains. I guess we now know how far the so-called prochoice movement will go to sustain the Orwellian supermyth that abortion is somehow sane, somehow compassionate, and even prochild.  Americans will now see that the real extremists are not the people who insist on calling attention to the grisly details of abortion, dismemberment of the baby's fragile body, brain-sucking abortions or chemical injections. They will see that the people who actually dismember, poison, or hold the scissors at the base of the skull, they are the dangerous people.  Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of myths that the abortion lobby has circulated about partial-birth abortion. This past Sunday in the Sunday Record (of Bergen), a proabortion newspaper in my State, again exposed the lie that there are 500 partial-birth abortions in the country each year. The proabortion lobby seeks to trivialize the issue by grossly undercounting the actual number. The article, however, points out that in one New Jersey abortion mill alone, each year 1,500 partial-birth abortions are performed.                              {time}  1215  The Record article also points out that the indicators for most of those abortions are nonmedical in that abortion clinic. Just like Dr. Haskill, one of the pioneers in this gruesome procedure, who has said that 80 percent of those who he sees are doing it for purely elective reasons. The Sunday Record pointed out, and I quote:       Interviews with physicians who use the method reveal that      in New Jersey alone at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions      are performed each year, three times the supposed national      rate. Moreover, doctors say that only a minuscule amount are      for medical reasons.  Mr. Speaker, it is time to begin to stand up for these unborn children and these partially born children and these newly born children. This is a matter of human rights. The abortion side, the abortion lobby, has sanitized these killings, they have kept people in the dark. But, the dirty secret of the abortion rights movement is finally out: Abortion kills babies, it is child abuse and we can stop some of that abuse by overriding Bill Clinton's antichild veto.
