Mexico owes somewhere between $160 and $200 billion. That is with a ``b.'' That is in public debt that is owed to other creditors. This is only one small piece of it. This is probably the piece that they thought they might be able to bite off without too many people disagreeing, but there is a lot more money owed, and then inside Mexico, because of the strange relationship between their private sector and their public sector and their banks, there are all kinds of debts internal to Mexico, and with interest rates going up there and with the inflation rates going up, it is a very unstable economic situation inside of Mexico.  The value of their money has just been cut in half. Lots of businesses there have loans. The relationship of those businesses to their banks, to the inflation rate, et cetera, is a very unstable situation, and the largest revenue generator to the Government is Pemex, the oil company.  Over, I think, nearly half the revenues of that Government are generated by Pemex, so that is another place that the oil revenues are pledged as collateral to their own Government.  I happen to believe that Mexico's main problems are not economic but, rather, social and political; in other words, if you could get a system there that operated in a more democratic fashion, could you begin to put the pieces in place of an economic order that shared the wealth with the vast majority of people rather than just at few people on the top.
