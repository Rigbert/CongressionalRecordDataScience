 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, September 16. I further ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume consideration of the transportation appropriations bill.
