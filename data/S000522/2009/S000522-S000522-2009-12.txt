Thank you, Mr. Souder. And I do want to thank you again for offering that amendment and for that very illuminating and incisive hearing on RU-486.  Again, we know that the trials that led to approval by the FDA, when Kessler was the head of the FDA under President Clinton, he on bended knee asked the company that manufactures RU-486 to bring it here. Sham trials were conducted where women who were seriously hurt were not reported. And we know for a fact, women are actually dying from RU-486. Probably because they had the best reporting of any other State, those women have surfaced in California from those deaths attributable to RU-486. And it's baby pesticide that has serious consequences for women, including death.  Again, no pharmaceutical company in America would take up RU-486, the abortion drug, simply because it was so dangerous. So they found the Population Council Company. Try suing them when you have egregious harm done to a woman or a death, a fatality. It's an organization. It's not like Merck or some other because all of them took a pass because it is so dangerous.  And you held the only hearing, as you so well pointed out, and I commend the gentleman for them.  I would like to yield to Mr. Fortenberry, a good friend and great champion of human rights as well.
