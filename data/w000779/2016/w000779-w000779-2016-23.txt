President, now more than ever, we need strong leadership at the FCC to protect consumers from consolidated powers in the telecommunications industry. Noncontentious issues should be passed and implemented so Americans have access to wireless broadband and voice services in their communities and access to video programming for the blind and visually impaired can be expanded and consumers can be protected from excessive cable and internet costs.  I was given the assurance that Commissioner Rosenworcel is committed to working toward consensus on all items before the Commission this year, including the Mobility Fund that provides support for wireless and voice service in rural America. For that reason, I lift my hold on her nomination.                          ____________________
