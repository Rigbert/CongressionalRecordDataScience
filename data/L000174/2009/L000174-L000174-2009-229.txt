President, I would like to salute Tom Ryan and his daughter, Maggie, of Shelburne, VT, for their goodwill gesture at a recent Boston Red Sox game.  Last week, Tom and Maggie were at Fenway Park cheering on the Red Sox, and they ended up with the baseball David Ortiz--better known in Red Sox Nation as Big Papi--hit over the Green Monster for the 300th home run of his career.  I had the good fortune to meet Big Papi last year at the White House celebration honoring the 2007 Red Sox World Series championship, and I was delighted to learn Tom and Maggie had the opportunity to meet Big Papi too and present him with the historic ball.  In honor of the Ryans, and this important moment in Red Sox history, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Burlington Free Press's story, Vermont Man, Daughter Make Big Papi's Day, by Sam Hemingway be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 12, 2009]               Vermont Man, Daughter Make Big Papi's Day                           (By Sam Hemingway)       Shelburne.--Going to Fenway Park is akin to going to church      for die-hard Boston Red Sox fan Tom Ryan.       So imagine what it was like for the 46 year-old Shelburne      resident to meet David ``Big Papi'' Ortiz, Boston's beloved      slugger--inside the team clubhouse and within sight of the      locker room.       Ryan and his daughter, Maggie, had that Red Sox dream-come-     true moment Thursday night when Ryan ended up in possession      of the baseball that Ortiz ripped for his 300th homer in the      first inning of what ended in an 8-6 loss to the Kansas City      Royals.       ``It didn't get out by much,'' Ryan said, recalling the      moment the ball zoomed off Ortiz's bat and hit the top ledge      of the Green Monster wall in left field.       The ball ricocheted off the wall and fell to the ground      below Section 33, Box 165, Row LL, a spot that overlooks left      field half way between third base and the Green Monster.       That's where Ryan and Maggie were, in Seats 5 and 6, when      Royals' leftfielder Jose Guillen picked up the ball and,      acknowledging the appeals in the seats above, tossed the ball      into the stands--and into Ryan's hands.       ``We were just excited because it was a Big Papi home      run,'' Ryan said. ``People around us were all charged up,      too.''       Moments later, a security guard approached Ryan and asked      him to come with him. Ryan thought perhaps he had done      something wrong and that maybe he and Maggie were going to      get kicked out of Fenway Park.       Instead, the guard told him the homer was Ortiz's 300th and      that Big Papi had asked for someone to find out if he could      get the ball back. Ryan said he was glad to comply with      Ortiz's request.       ``To me, it was the right thing to do,'' he said.       So he, Maggie and the security guard walked over to the      team's clubhouse.       Along the way, a representative of Major League Baseball      approached them and questioned Ryan about how he got the      ball, just to make sure it really was the one that Ortiz had      just hit. Only 19 active baseball players have hit 300 or      more homers.       When the group entered the clubhouse to make the ball      exchange, a door across the room opened and in walked Ortiz,      grinning from ear to ear.       He's a mountain of a man,'' Ryan said. ``Big smile, big      hands, big heart. He was genuinely very grateful, kind of      giddy, kind of excited.''       Ryan said he asked Ortiz what he was going to do with the      ball and said Ortiz told him and Maggie that he had talked to      his dad that morning and was going to give the ball to his      father while visiting him during the upcoming All Star break.       In return for the ball, Ortiz gave Ryan and Maggie one of      his bats and signed it. Maggie,     17 and an incoming Champlain Valley Union High School senior,      was with her dad in Boston to check out colleges, and      happened to be wearing an Ortiz Red Sox T-shirt.       So Ortiz signed that, too.       ``It was just luck,'' Maggie said of the shirt she chose to      wear that day. ``I also have a (Jason) Varitek and a (Jacoby)      Ellsbury shirt.'' Varitek is the Red Sox catcher, Ellsbury      the team's center fielder.       Dad and daughter eventually returned to their seats and      passed the Ortiz bat around among their seatmates.       Later in the game, the Major League Baseball person again      asked to speak to them, questioning them some more in order      to make sure the ball Ryan gave Ortiz wasn't one slugged into      the stands during batting practice.       The Ortiz bat now sits on a shelf in the Ryan living room.      Maggie has her signed Ortiz T-shirt, but it's unlikely she'll      be wearing--or washing--it much more in the future.       Ryan said he asked the Red Sox for one last favor on      Thursday night.       Would it be possible, he queried, for him to bring his wife      Lucia, and the family's other two children all of them      passionate Sox fans--back to Fenway Park sometime this summer      and visit with Ortiz again?       ``They told me they did not think it would be a problem.''                          ____________________
