 President, I rise today to honor Commander Timothy Alan Cook for his service to the United States Senate and his continued service to our country in the United States Coast Guard.  Commander Cook has been detailed to be the Coast Guard Liaison to the United States Senate since July 2001, and I am proud to have had the opportunity to work closely with him over the past 3 years. In my leadership roles on the Transportation and Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittees, my staff and I have often relied on Commander Cook's tremendous grasp on the inner-workings of both the Coast Guard and the Senate.  Commander Cook began his Senate career in 1997 as the Coast Guard Fellow to the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee. However, his Coast Guard career began more than a decade earlier as a 1986 graduate of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.  Then-Ensign Cook's first tour was as Deck Watch Officer aboard the Medium Endurance Cutter DAUNTLESS (WMEC 624) then stationed in Miami Beach, FL. In 1988 he became Executive Officer of the Fast Patrol Boat MANITOU (WPB 1302) also stationed in Miami Beach, FL.  He was selected for the Coast Guard Academy Postgraduate Instructor Program in 1990 and attended Duke University where he received his Master of Arts degree in Public Policy. CDR Cook taught U.S. History and American Government in the Coast Guard Academy Humanities Department from 1992 to 1995. During this period he also qualified as Deck Watch Officer on the Coast Guard Tall Ship EAGLE (WIX 327).  In 1995 he assumed Command of the Fast Patrol Boat MAUI (WPB 1304) stationed in Miami Beach, FL. During this time he also completed a Master of Arts degree in Political Science from Brown University.  Then, following his service at the Senate Commerce Committee, Commander Cook became Executive Officer of the Medium Endurance Cutter BEAR (WMEC 901) at the mid-point of its 106-day Mediterranean cruise. During his tour he completed numerous patrols in the Caribbean conducting the Coast Guard law enforcement and search and rescue missions.  This week, Commander Cook will leave his post as the Coast Guard's Senate Liaison. He will be missed in the United States Senate, but the Coast Guard needs his expertise on the Deepwater Acquisition Program.  It has been my pleasure to work with Commander Cook. On behalf of the Senators and staff who have also been fortunate to work with him, I wish Commander Cook, his wife Nancy and their two sons, Evan and Joel, the best in all of their future endeavors.                          ____________________
