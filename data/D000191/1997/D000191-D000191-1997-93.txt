  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, this was to be the year of tough decisions in Congress, as they planned for a balanced budget, decisions between tax cuts, increases in military spending, stability for Medicare and Social Security, investment in transportation or education. It is incredibly difficult for Congress and the President to decide between these competing priorities and constituencies. We cannot have it all, as we learned in the early 1980's.  So after months of wrangling and hand-wringing, Congress and the President did the predictable: They decided they did want it all and they wanted a balanced budget; big increases for the Pentagon, big tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and even a nod toward transportation and education.  It is too good to be true. Guess what, it is not. The budget negotiators simply assumed an additional $225 billion of income; no new CBO baseline forecast, no new economic forecast. Let us assume our way out of this problem, $225 billion that does not exist and will not exist, and I am not being allowed to offer a budget that does not assume that today.                          ____________________
