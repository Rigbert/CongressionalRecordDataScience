However, at the current pace of development it will be at least a decade before fuel cell systems are available in any significant numbers for large markets. Meanwhile, Japan and the European countries are investing more in fuel cell development than the U.S. is investing, and we are losing our leadership in this area. Japan's investment last year alone was three times that of the DOE.  Senator Smith and I agree that U.S. fuel cell companies are ready to demonstrate P-E-M fuel cell powerplants that will serve the niche markets, and can accelerate the introduction of fuel cells to markets in the near term and the larger markets in the mid term. Would the Senator agree that there is an exciting opportunity here?
