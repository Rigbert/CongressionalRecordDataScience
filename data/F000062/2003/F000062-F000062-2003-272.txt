 President, I rise today to introduce a bill with Senator Ensign to ensure that Title I funds are directed towards instructional services to teach low-income students.  Title I provides assistance to virtually every school district in the country to serve children attending schools with high concentrations of low-income students, from preschool through high school.  It has been the ``anchor'' of Federal assistance to schools, since its origin in 1965. And while it has always been Congresses intent for Title I funds to be used for instruction and instructional services, the Federal Government has never provided a clear definition of what instructional services should entail.  This lack of Federal guidance has become especially clear now, as States scramble to comply with the new and expanded Title I accountability standards established in ``No Child Left Behind.''  While State Administrators of Title I are directed by law to meet these specific requirements, they have been given little guidance as to how to ensure that they are in compliance with the law.  I believe that the Federal Government is responsible for making this process as clear to States, as possible. In my own view, as it relates to Title I, we haven't lived up to our end of the bargain.  During consideration of ``No Child Left Behind,'' I worked hard to get my bill defining appropriate Title I uses included in the Senate version of the bill.  Unfortunately, during conference consideration, my bill was stripped out and in its place language directing the General Accounting Office, GAO, to report on how States use their Title I funds was inserted.  In April, GAO released the report that Congress directed them to submit on Title I Administrative Expenditures.  What GAO found is that while districts spent a relatively small amount--no more than 13 percent--of Title I funds on administration that ``because there is no common definition on what constitutes administrative, or indirect, expenditures'' the accounting office couldn't precisely measure how much of their Title I funds were used for administration.  Because Title I funds are not defined consistently throughout the States, the accounting office created their own definition by compiling aspects of State priorities to complete the report.  You see, the very reason I worked to define how Title I funds should be used--to create consistency and distribution priority nationwide--became the definitive aspect preventing GAO from effectively drawing conclusions in their report.  My bill takes some strong steps by balancing the needs for States to retain Title I flexibility and providing them with the guidance needed to administer the program uniformly throughout the country.  My bill does two things: It defines Title I direct and indirect instructional services and sets a standard for the amount of Title I funds that can be used to achieve the academic and administrative objectives of this program.  It ensures that the majority of Title I funds are used to improve academic achievement by stipulating that ``a local educational agency may not use more than 10 percent of [Title I] funds received. . . . for indirect instructional services .''  By limiting the amount of funds that schools can spend on administrative or indirect services, school districts are restricted from shuffling the majority of Title I to pay for non-academic services, but it also gives the districts flexibility to use the remaining funds for the indirect costs of administering Title I distribution.  The second component of my bill defines direct and indirect services so that all States apply the same standards for Title I use nationwide.  Examples of permissible Direct Services are: Employing teachers and other instructional personnel (including employee benefits); intervening and taking corrective actions to improve student achievement; extending academic instruction beyond the normal school day and year, including summer school; providing instructional services to pre-kindergarten children for the transition to kindergarten; purchasing instructional resources such as books, materials, computers, and other instructional equipment and wiring to support instructional equipment; professional development; developing and administering curriculum, educational materials and assessments; transporting students to assist them in improving academic achievement.  Examples of indirect services limited to no more than 10 percent of Title I expenditures are: business services relating to administering the program; purchasing or providing facilities maintenance, janitorial, gardening, or landscaping services or the payment of utility costs; and paying for travel to and attendance at conferences or meetings, except for travel and attendance necessary for professional development.  Current law on Title I is much too vague.  It says, ``A State or local educational agency shall use funds received under this part only to supplement the amount of funds that would, in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available from non-Federal sources for the education of pupils participating in programs assisted under this part, and not to supplant such funds.''  Basically, it says that Title I funds are to be used for the ``education of pupils.'' That is just too nebulous.  The U.S. Department of Education has given States a guidance document that explains how Title I funds can be used.  Under this guidance document, only two uses are specifically prohibited: 1. Construction or acquisition of real property; and 2. payment to parents to attend a meeting or training session or to reimburse a parent for salary lost due to attendance at ``parental involvement'' meeting.  I believe we should give the Department, States and districts clearer guidance in law.  My reasons for introducing this bill are two-fold: First, I believe that States must use their limited Federal dollars for the fundamental purpose of providing academic instruction to help students learn.  Secondly, I believe that it is nearly impossible to do so without providing a clear definition of what is considered an instructional service.  I am not suggesting that it is the fault of the school districts for not focusing their Title I funds on academic instruction. They are simply exercising the flexibility that Congress has given them.  What I am saying is that if Congress also intended for those funds to educate our neediest children, Federal guidance must be given to ensure that it happens.  It is my view that Title I cannot do everything. Federal funding accounts for a small percentage of total funding for elementary and secondary education and Title I is even a smaller percentage of total support for public schools.  That is why I am trying to better focus Title I funds on academic instruction, teaching the fundamentals and helping disadvantaged children achieve success.  Schools must focus their general education budget to pay for expenses that fall outside of the realm of direct educational services and retain the majority of Federal funds to improve academic achievement for poor children.  It is time to better direct Title I funds to the true goal of education: to help students learn. This is one step toward that goal.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1372       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
