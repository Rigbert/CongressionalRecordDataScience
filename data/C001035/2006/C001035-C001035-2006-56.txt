President, very shortly we will be voting on cloture on the Port Security Act. I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion. We hope to be able to complete action on this bill by 5 o'clock this afternoon. We are working toward that goal.  Senator Murray and I are happy to talk to our colleagues, but we will be moving through the amendments at a very rapid pace after cloture is invoked, as I hope it will be. We have made great progress on this bill. It isan important bill for our homeland security, and I urge all of our colleagues to support the cloture motion.
