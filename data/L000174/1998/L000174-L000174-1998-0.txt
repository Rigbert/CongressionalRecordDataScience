President, as the Senate concludes this second session of the 105th Congress, I want to take a moment to thank Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for working with us to confirm judges desperately needed around the country. He pressed forward with three confirmation hearings in October, which resulted in sending another nine judicial nominees to the Senate calendar. He supported each of the nominees confirmed by the Senate this year and worked hard to clear judicial nominees reported by the Committee for action by the Senate. I also thank the Majority Leader for proceeding to consider the judicial nominations confirmed in these last days of the session.  For the year, the Senate confirmed 65 federal judges to the District Courts and Courts of Appeals around the country and to the Court of International Trade. In addition, we confirmed a number of judges to the United States Court of Claims and to the court for the Northern Mariana Islands.  Senator Hatch is fond of saying that the Senate could do better. I agree with him and hope that we will continue to do better next year. I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain that pace it established in the last nine months of last year. Had we done so, we could have confirmed 90 judges. Instead, the Senate has acted to confirm only 65 of the 91 nominations received for the 115 vacancies the federal judiciary experienced this year.  Together with the 36 judges confirmed last year, the total number of article III federal judges confirmed during this Congress to a 2-year total of 101--the same total that was confirmed in one year when Democrats made up the majority of the Senate in 1994. The 104th Congress (1995-96) resulted in a 2-year total of only 75 judges being confirmed. By way of contrast, I note that during the last two years of the Bush Administration, even including the presidential election year of 1992, a Democratic Senate confirmed 124 federal judges.  Meanwhile 50 judicial vacancies remain. This is one of the largest number of vacancies left unfilled at the end of a Congress. In 1983 vacancies numbered only 16. Even after the creation of 85 new judgeships in 1984, the number of vacancies had been reduced to only 33 by the end of the 99th Congress in 1986. At the end of the 100th Congress in 1988, which had a Democratic majority and a Republican president, judicial vacancies numbered only 23. In 1996 the Republican Senate adjourned leaving 64 judicial vacancies. This year the Senate is adjourning leaving 50 judicial vacancies and the number is likely to increase during the recess.  Moreover, the Republican Congress has refused to consider the authorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary to deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984 and in 1990, Congress did respond to requests for needed judicial resources by the Judicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the Congress created judgeships during a Republican presidential administration. Last year the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. If Congress had passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, S.678, as it should have, the federal judiciary would have 103 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past several years.  In order to understand why a judicial vacancy crisis is plaguing so many federal courts, we need only recall how unproductive the Republican Senate has been over the last three years. More and more of the vacancies are judicial emergencies that have been left vacant for longer periods of time. The President has sent the Senate qualified nominees for 23 of the current judicial emergency vacancies, 15 of those nominations that are still pending as the Senate prepares to adjourn.  In his 1997 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist focussed on the problem of ``too few judges and too much work.'' He noted the vacancy crisis and the persistence of scores of judicial emergency vacancies and observed: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.''  During the entire 4 years of the Bush administration there were only three judicial nominations that were pending before the Senate for as long as 9 months before being confirmed and none took as long as a year. In 1997 alone there were 10 judicial nominations that took more than 9 months before a final favorably vote and 9 of those 10 extended over a year to a year and one-half. Of the judges confirmed this year, Professor Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--the longest-pending judicial nomination in the history of the United States--Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Susan Oki Mollway's confirmation took 30 months, Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Margaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation took 15 months, Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation took 14 months, Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and Victoria Roberts' confirmation took 11 months.  I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky nominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1996, the Republican Senate shattered the record for the average number of days from nomination to confirmation for judicial confirmation. The average rose to a record 183 days. Last year, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and that was during the first year of a presidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the administration of justice. This year the Senate will break last year's record. The average time from nomination to confirmation for the 65 judges confirmed this year was over 230 days.  In addition, nominations are being forced to sit on the Senate Executive Calendar for longer and longer periods of time. Unlike earlier days in the Senate when nominees were not made to wait for weeks and months on the Senate calendar before they could be considered, that is now becoming the rule. Margaret Morrow, Sonia Sotomayor, Richard Paez, Ronnie White, Patrick Murphy and Michael McCuskey each spent more than four months on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting action.  Further, this Congress is concluding with four judicial nominations that have been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee still pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. Two were reported without objection by unanimous consent. I do not know why Justice Ronnie L. White and Judge William J. Hibbler, two outstanding African-American nominees are being held on the Senate calendar without a vote. I regret that the Majority Leader was unable to call up for a vote the nomination of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit or the nomination of Timothy Dyk to the Federal Circuit.  Most Congresses end without any judicial nominations left on the Senate Executive Calendar. Indeed the 99th, 101st, 102nd, and 103rd Congresses all ended without a single judicial nomination left on the Senate calendar. The Democratic Senate majority in the two Congresses of the Bush Administration ended both those Congresses, the 101st and 102nd, without a single judicialnomination on the calendar. By contrast, the Republican Senate majority in the last Congress, the 104th, left an unprecedented seven judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar at adjournment without Senate action. The 105th Congress is concluding with four qualified judicial nominees being denied action by the Senate.  At each step of the process, judicial nominations are being delayed and stalled. Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie L. White, Judge William J. Hibbler and Timothy Dyk are being denied consideration by the Senate. Marsha Berzon, Anabelle Rodriquez, Clarence Sundram, and Matthew Kennelly were each denied a vote before the Judiciary Committee following a hearing. Judge James A. Beatty, Jr., Helene N. White, Jorge C. Rangel, Ronald M. Gould, Robert S. Raymar, Barry P. Goode, among a total of 13 judicial nominees, end this Congress without ever having received a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.  At the conclusion of the debate on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as 23 Republicans were preparing to vote against that exceptionally well-qualified nominee whose confirmation had been delayed 18 months, Senator Hatch said ``playing politics with judges is unfair, and I am sick of it.'' I agree with him. I look forward to a return to the days when judicial nominations are treated with the respect and attention that they deserve.                     Nomination of Edward J. Damich
