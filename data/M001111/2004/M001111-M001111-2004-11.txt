 President, I strongly support the intelligence reform bill now before the Senate, and I will vote for it.  The 9-11 Commission worked incredibly hard in a bipartisan manner to identify how to better protect our country from terrorism. They have given us a roadmap to protect our people, and we should move forward with it promptly.  In their report, the commissioners said we need clear direction for our country's intelligence community. They stressed better coordination as a key area where we can make the greatest difference. The bill on the floor does that, it has bipartisan support, and we should move it forward.  As a member of both the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee and the Senate's 9/11 Working Group, I have looked closely at these challenges. And over the past few years, I have worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security, including the Coast Guard, FBI, TSA, Border Patrol, as well as the National Guard and local law enforcement throughout Washington State. Through our work together, I have learned first hand the difficulties they face every day in defending our country.  I especially want to commend the September 11 families who bravely stood up and spoke out. They forced our government to fully examine the terrorist attacks and to find ways to make our people safer. Their brave advocacy has made a difference.  Mr. President, this is an important step toward achieving a truly integrated national effort in the global war on terror. I am proud to support it.
