President, one of the most significant accomplishments of the 106th Congress was the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, commonly known as ``ESIGN.'' This landmark legislation establishes a Federal framework for the use of electronic signatures, contracts, and records, while preserving essential safeguards protecting the Nation's consumers. It passed both houses of Congress by an overwhelming majority, and went into effect in October 2000.  I helped to craft the Senate version of the bill, which passed unanimously in November 1999, and I was honored to serve as a conferee and help develop the conference report. I am proud of what we achieved and the bipartisan manner in which we achieved it. It was an example of legislators legislating rather than politicians posturing and unnecessarily politicizing important matters of public policy.  Much of the negotiations over ESIGN concerned the consumer protection language in section 101(c), which was designed to ensure effective consumer consent to the replacement of paper notices with electronic notices. We managed in the end to strike a constructive balance that advanced electronic commerce without terminating or mangling the basic rights of consumers.  In particular, ESIGN requires use of a ``technological check'' in obtaining consumer consent. The critical language, which Senator Wyden and I developed and proposed, provides that a consumer's consent to the provision of information in electronic form must involve a demonstration that the consumer can actually receive and read the information. Companies are left with ample flexibility to develop their own procedures for this demonstration.  When the Senate passed ESIGN in June 2000, I expressed confidence that the benefits of a one-time technological check would far outweigh any possible burden on e-commerce. I also predicted that this provision would increase consumer confidence in the electronic marketplace.  One year later, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce have issued a report on the impact of ESIGN's consumer consent provision. In preparing the report, these agencies conducted extensive outreach to the on-line business community, technology developers, consumer groups, law enforcement, and academia. The report concludes:       [T]hus far, the benefits of the consumer consent provision      of ESIGN outweigh the burdens of its implementation on      electronic commerce. The provision facilitates e-commerce and      the use of electronic records and     signatures while enhancing consumer confidence. It preserves      the right of consumers to receive written information      required by state and federal law. The provision also      discourages deception and fraud by those who might fail to      provide consumers with information the law requires that they      receive.''  Significantly, the consumer consent provision is benefitting businesses as well as consumers. The report states that businesses that have implemented this provision are reporting several benefits, including ``protection from liability, increased revenues resulting from increased consumer confidence, and the opportunity to engage in additional dialogue with consumers about the transactions.'' The technological check has not been significantly burdensome, and ``[t]he technology-neutral language of the provision encourages creativity in the structure of business systems that interface with consumers, and provides an opportunity for the business and the consumer to choose the form of communication for the transaction.''  The report also finds that ESIGN's consumer safeguards are helping to prevent deception and fraud, which is critical to maintaining consumer confidence in the electronic marketplace.  ESIGN is a product of bipartisan cooperation, and it is working well for the country. We should learn from experience as we take up new legislative challenges.                          ____________________
