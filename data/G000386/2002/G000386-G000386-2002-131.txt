 I am very pleased to announce that a total of eight entries from the great State of Iowa qualified for the national finals. Each of these talented young people represented their State with distinction and all Iowans can be very proud of these students.  Gabriella Green, who attends Alan Shepard Elementary in Long Grove, took first place with a junior individual documentary entitled ``Solution to Hunger: Dr. Norman E. Borlaug and the Green Revolution.'' Amy Paul and Katie Pauley of Indian Hills Jr. High in West Des Moines took first prize in junior group documentaries for ``GraceHopper: Expanding Computer Horizons.'' Stephen Frese of Marshalltown took the second place medal for his junior historical paper, ``Wrestling with Reform: Iowa Coal Communities and the Transformation of Childhood.''  In addition, Alex Cahill and Emily Green from North Scott High School took fifth place in the senior group performance category with ``The Works Progress Administration: Our Business of Relief'' and Elyse Lyons took seventh place in junior individual performances with ``Alice Hamilton: Friend of the Factory Worker.''  Johnston Middle School Student Abigail Bowman, who took eighth place in junior historical papers with ``Mustafa Kemal Ataturk: Reformer of Turkey,'' was invited to present her paper at the Turkish Embassy while she was in the Washington, DC area for the national competition. Laura Westercamp, a student at Kennedy High School in Cedar Rapids, took eighth place in senior individual exhibits with ``Battle of the Bottle: The Woman, the Reaction, the Reform'' and was able to present her project at the Smithsonian Museum of American History.  Lauren Appley, who attends Akron-Westfield School, took the ninth place award in junior individual papers with ``Martha Graham: Revolutionary Genius of Modern Dance.''  I would like to congratulate each of these Iowa students. The number of quality entries by Iowans in this national contest demonstrates the importance Iowans place on education. I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the State Historical Society of Iowa, which sponsors the National History Day program in Iowa, as well as the American Legion of Iowa Foundation, which provides funding for the program.  Again, congratulations to Gabriella, Amy, Katie, Stephen, Alex, Emily, Elyse, Abigail, Laura, and Lauren. You have done Iowa proud!                          ____________________
