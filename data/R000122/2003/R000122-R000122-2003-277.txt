President, reserving the right to object, as I understand it, if we do not accept the unanimous consent request proposed by the Senator from New York, we will leave 1 million Americans without unemployment compensation benefits at a time they desperately need it. I also understand her amendment simply calls for 30 minutes of debate and a vote. I think it would be appropriate to vote.  If the majority leader can give us some indication as to when we will deal with the issue of these 1 million people who will be without benefits, I think it might help us as we try to respond and decide on this issue.
