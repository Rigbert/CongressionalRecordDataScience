Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 129 of Lorain, Ohio. This is an incredibly significant centennial milestone of labor history in northern Ohio.  Since 1916, IBEW Local 129 has served northern Ohio with distinction, providing the highest quality of electrical work and providing power to the residents of the Lorain-Elyria area. Its members continue to dedicate their careers to the advancement of wages, benefits and working conditions for all electrical workers.  The history of this organization dates back to March 1, 1916 when the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 129 was chartered in Elyria, Ohio. The founding eleven brothers were: Henry Therman, H.R. Ward, Gus Pallas, A.J. Miller, I.W. Horton, Ray Ward, J.W. Bareholmen, John Keishair, F.A. Lawrence, A.E. Gramholz and C. Pallas.  Beginning wages were roughly $0.12/hour--which was far greater than an unorganized laborer in those days.  In 1917, IBEW Local 627 Lorain was formed under the leadership of Organizer Boyle from Local 129. By the time 1930 rolled around, the membership numbers and work available to the two locals was not what either had anticipated. After much deliberation and negotiation, Local 129 of Elyria absorbed Local 627 of Lorain and, under one banner became the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 129 of Lorain, Ohio.  The skilled men and women of IBEW Local 129 have contributed their time and talents to many notable projects including: The National Tube Company, Fruehauf Trailer Plant at Avon Lake, United States Steel, The Ford Manufacturing Plant, local commercial developments like O'Neil's Shopping Center, LorainCounty Schools, Lorain and the surrounding area hospitals, American Shipbuilding, Cleveland Electric Illuminating, and B.F. Goodrich, to name a few.  IBEW founder Henry Miller envisioned a union of electrical workers banded together toward the goal of improved safety, wages and working conditions for the brotherhood. A century later, his legacy stands tall through the brothers and sisters of Local 129. We offer our heartiest congratulations to IBEW Local 129 in celebration of its rich history and thank you for working to illuminate our world over the last 100 years                          ____________________
