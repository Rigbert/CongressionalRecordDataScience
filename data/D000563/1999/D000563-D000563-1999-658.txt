President, I say at the outset, I salute the Senator on his remarks. I think he struck the right tone. There is a sense of mourning and sadness across America for what happened in Colorado.  We have to address the needs of troubled children. I think the Senator from New York was correct in highlighting that. I think he also calls us to task, too, to do something sensible about gun control. A troubled child is a sad thing; a troubled child with a gun can be a tragedy not just for himself but for a lot of innocent youngsters.  I ask the Senator if he can indicate to Members those legislative initiatives we should be considering that might slow down the violence we are seeing too often in America and too frequently in our schools?
