 Mr. DeLAY. I do not want Members to misunderstand me. Also, it is coming to the end of the session, and as the gentleman knows, I would not encourage Members to make a lot of plans for Mondays and Fridays, plans that cannot be broken because as we get to the end of the session, the weeks could very well get longer.
