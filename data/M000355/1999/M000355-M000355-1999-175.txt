 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Kentuckian and friend Charles Bennett Greenwood of Central City, who died July 16, 1999, at his home.  Charles, or C.B. to his friends, was a unique individual who loved his home state of Kentucky and revered life in small-town Central City. You see, C.B. lived all of his 93 years within a four block area of downtown Central City. Almost all of the milestones of his life occurred within the same four blocks of Central City. C.B. never went away to college and took very few vacations. It was obvious to everybody who knew him that C.B. was satisfied with his view of the world from Central City.  C.B. was born to William H. and Viola ``Louisa'' Greenwood on March 6, 1906, at the family home on Fourth Street and went to school just a few hundred feet from his birthplace. In 1934, C.B. and his bride, Louise Batsel, were married at the minister's residence on Third Street, just one block away from the homeplace. All of C.B.'s children--daughter Margaret Ann Long of Oklahoma City; and sons Charles Jr., William and David of Central City--were born at their home on Fourth Street.  Incredibly, C.B. never worked more than four blocks from his birthplace. In the 1920s, C.B. worked for J.C. Batsel Meat Market and Perry Drugstore and in 1932, he went to work for J.C. Penney, all of which were located downtown. In 1945, C.B. purchased Barnes Mercantile Clothing Store on Broad Street, again just four blocks away from his birthplace and residence. He worked at the store until he retired in 1989. For 75 years C.B. walked to and from his jobs in downtown Central City in deep snow or 100 degree weather.  An active community leader, C.B. was a member of the First Baptist Church of Central City, and served on both the Central City Council and the Central City School Board. C.B. was laid to rest in the Rose Hill Cemetery in Central City, four city blocks from where he was born, lived his life, raised his children, worked and ran his business, and served his community.  In today's highly mobile society, few people live their lives like C.B., rooted in their hometown. C.B. was a special person who was happy in his life and lived life to the fullest. I express my condolences to C.B.'s family--his wife, Louise, and children, Charles, Jr.; my close friend Bill and his wife Leslie; and David, and Margaret; 10 grandchildren, 9 great-grandchildren, and one great-great grandchild.                          ____________________
