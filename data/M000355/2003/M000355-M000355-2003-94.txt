 HATCH. That is absolutely correct. Just fast forward to this week. As the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported this week, Bill Pryor filed a pretrial brief asking the Alabama Court of the Judiciary to remove Judge Moore from the Alabama Supreme Court because of Moore's defiance of the Federal court order to remove the Ten Commandments display. Bill Pryor's brief stated, quoting from the Atlanta Journal Constitution article: Moore should be removed because ``he intentionally engaged in misconduct and because he remains unrepentant for his behavior.''  I could go on about Bill Pryor. During his hearing--a lengthy hearing--he was asked over and over by virtually every Democrat who showed up about his deeply held personal beliefs. He answered every question the way a judicial nominee should. Even though he had deeply held beliefs, he would obey the law.
