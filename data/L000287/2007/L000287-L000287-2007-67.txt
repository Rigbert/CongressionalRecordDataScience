At your will, Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule XXI.  The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''  The amendment in this case imparts direction, so I insist upon my point of order.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any Member wish to speak on the point of order?  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, to the point of order, again, the gentleman is technically correct. But again, unlike the previous amendment, this amendment not only does not cost money, it actually benefits the Federal Government and the Federal taxpayers.  I wish the gentleman would reconsider that point and not target this because of an earlier debate on a different issue having to do with spending levels. This actually would save the taxpayers money. I would ask that the gentleman reconsider his objection.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Seeing no further speakers on the point of order, the Chair is prepared to rule.  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language imparting direction. The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI.  The point of order is sustained and the amendment is not in order.                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Lamborn
