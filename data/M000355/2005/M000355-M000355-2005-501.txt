 President, before the Senator from Missouri leaves the floor, I want to extend on behalf of every Member of the Senate our thanks to him for his leadership in fighting the scourge of methamphetamine. The Senator from Missouri has become the leader in the Senate in combating this scourge. On behalf of all Members of the Senate, I thank him for his extraordinarily effective work in this most important area.
