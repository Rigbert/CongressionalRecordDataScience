 [[Page H2388]]   Let us get back to the Contract With America. It seems to me that the essence of what the Contract With America is about are several things: No, 1, our Republicans want to provide very, very substantial tax breaks, primarily for the wealthiest people in this country. People earning over $100,000 a year would get at least half of the tax breaks, and as I understand it, people earning $200,000 a year or more would get about one-third of the tax breaks. These are the people whose incomes have soared during the last decade, who, in many instances, are already not paying their fair share of tax, but these are the people who are targeted for the major tax breaks under the Republicans.  The second point that I think we should consider in the Republican Contract With America is that these folks who are talking about the need to move toward a balanced budget, balanced budget in 7 years, first, they are talking about huge tax breaks for the wealthy and, second of all, they are talking about a major increase in military spending, tax breaks for the rich and increase in military spending.  Last week we had a rather vigorous debate here right on the floor of the House when our Republican friends suggested they wanted to bring back the star wars program; again, no one is clear about how much more money they want for it. We were not specific about the dollars. I think the estimate is another $30 or $40 billion for star wars alone, let alone for some other military programs.
