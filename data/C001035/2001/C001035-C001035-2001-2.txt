The Navy has indicated in its most recent study of the Arleigh Burke (DDG-51)-class destroyer industrial base, and in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, that three DDG-51 destroyers per year is the most economical rate of procurement. Last year, the National Defense Authorization Act provided the authority to the Secretary of the Navy to enter into contracts to procure three vessels in each fiscal year 2002 and 2003. The FY2002 National Defense Authorization bill includes $2.966 billion for the procurement of three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.  This year, the Senate Armed Services Committee added report language agreeing with the Navy's long standing assessment that the destroyer industrial base is at risk unless three destroyers are built each year, or unless the destroyer shipbuilders attain significant other work beyond their historic level. As such, the FY2002 national Defense authorization report reiterates that the Secretary of the Navy should include procurement of three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in the FY2003 budget request. I strongly support the inclusion in the fiscal year 2003 defense budget of a third DDG-51, which would be built at Bath Iron Works in my home state. The integrity of our shipbuilding industrial base largely depends upon it. I would ask that chairman and ranking Member whether they agree with me on this important point.
