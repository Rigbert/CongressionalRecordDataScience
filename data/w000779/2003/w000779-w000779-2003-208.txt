President, I rise today, with my friend and colleague Senator Smith of Oregon, to introduce legislation to improve the management of and recreational access to the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area in Douglas County, OR.  For the small, rural, coastal community of Winchester Bay in Douglas County, OR, this piece of legislation is critical. Hit first in the early 90's with a steep downturn in the timber economy, closely followed by a near shut-down of the fishing industry, this community found itself on the brink of economic ruin. The final blow came in March of 2000 when the major employer, International Paper, closed its paper mill, putting 300 residents out of work and sending an economic shockwave through the community that impacted the city, the school district, the hospital district, and literally every resident in the area.  Yet, since that time, Winchester Bay, OR has adopted a ``never give up'' attitude, changed its long term outlook, and focused its efforts on developing a thriving tourist industry. The bill I introduce today directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey approximately 68.5 acres from the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, in Douglas County, OR, to Douglas County to be managed for open space and for recreational purposes. The acreage is located just west of tourist and recreational area developments already owned and run by Douglas County. The County will use the land to provide a staging area for off-highway vehicles, thereby improving management of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. The land transfer also facilitates the policing of unlawful camping and parking along Salmon Harbor Drive and adjacent areas. This land transfer will improve tourism on Oregon's economically challenged South Coast, as well as improve public safety and reduce traffic congestion along Salmon Harbor Drive.  This legislation is supported by the entire Oregon delegation. It is also supported by the BLM, Douglas County Commissioners, and the community of Winchester Bay. An identical bill was introduced in the last Congress by Representative DeFazio, though the 107th Congress ended before both houses could pass it. Representative DeFazio reintroduced this land transfer legislation in the 108th Congress, H.R. 514, in the House of Representatives.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record.                                 S. 714       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(c) Reversionary Interest.--       (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the      parcel conveyed under subsection (a) is not being used by the      County for a recreational purpose--       (A) all right, title, and interest in and to the parcel,      including any improvements on the parcel, shall revert to the      United States; and       (B) the United States shall have the right of immediate      entry onto the parcel.
