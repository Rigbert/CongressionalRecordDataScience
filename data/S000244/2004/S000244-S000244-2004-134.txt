Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4077) to enhance criminal enforcement of the copyright laws, to educate the public about the application of copyright law to theInternet, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4077       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,                TITLE I--PIRACY DETERRENCE IN EDUCATION     SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Piracy Deterrence and      Education Act of 2004''.     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds as follows:       (1) The Internet, while changing the way our society      communicates, has also changed the nature of many crimes,      including the theft of intellectual property.       (2) Trafficking in infringing copyrighted works through      increasingly sophisticated electronic means, including peer-     to-peer file trading networks, Internet chat rooms, and news      groups, threatens lost jobs, lost income for creators, lower      tax revenue, and higher prices for honest purchasers.       (3) The most popular peer-to-peer file trading software      programs have been downloaded by computer users over      600,000,000 times. At any one time there are over 3,000,000      users simultaneously using just one of these services. Each      month, on average, over 2,300,000,000 digital-media files are      transferred among users of peer-to-peer systems.       (4) Many computer users simply believe that they will not      be caught or prosecuted for their conduct.       (5) The security and privacy threats posed by certain peer-     to-peer networks extend beyond users inadvertently enabling a      hacker to access files. Millions of copies of one of the most      popular peer-to-peer networks contain software that could      allow an independent company to take over portions of users'      computers and Internet connections and has the capacity to      keep track of users' online habits.       (6) In light of these considerations, Federal law      enforcement agencies should actively pursue criminals who      steal the copyrighted works of others, and prevent such      activity through enforcement and awareness. The public should      be educated about the security and privacy risks associated      with being connected to certain peer-to-peer networks.     SEC. 103. VOLUNTARY PROGRAM OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.       (a) Voluntary Program.--The Attorney General is authorized      to establish a program under which the Department of Justice,      in cases where persons who are subscribers of Internet      service providers appear to the Department of Justice to be      engaging in copyright infringing conduct in the course of      using such Internet service, would send to the Internet      service providers warning letters that warn such persons of      the penalties for such copyright infringement. The Internet      service providers may forward the warning letters to such      persons.       (b) Limitations on Program.--       (1) Extent and length of program.--The program under      subsection (a) shall terminate at the end of the 18-month      period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act and      shall be limited to not more than 10,000 warning letters.       (2) Privacy protections.--No Internet service provider that      receives a warning letter from the Department of Justice      under subsection (a) may disclose to the Department any      identifying information about the subscriber that is the      subject of the warning letter except pursuant to court order      or other applicable legal process that requires such      disclosure.       (c) Reimbursement of Internet Service Providers.--The      Department of Justice shall reimburse Internet service      providers for all reasonable direct costs incurred by such      service providers in identifying the proper recipients of the      warning letters under subsection (a) and forwarding the      letters.       (d) Reports to Congress.--The Attorney General shall submit      to the Congress a report on the program established under      subsection (a) both at the time the program is initiated and      at the conclusion of the program.       (e) Inadmissibility of Evidence.--The fact that an Internet      service provider participated in the program under subsection      (a), received a warning letter from the Department of      Justice, was aware of the contents of the warning letter, or      forwarded the warning letter to a subscriber, shall not be      admissible in any legal proceeding brought against the      Internet service provider.       (f) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be      construed to affect the ability of a court to consider, in a      legal proceeding brought against an Internet service      provider, notifications of claimed infringement as described      in section 512(c)(3) of title 17, United States Code, or any      other relevant evidence, other than that described in      subsection (e).

(c) Sector Specific Materials.--The Internet Use      Educational Program shall, to the extent appropriate, develop      materials appropriate to Internet users in different sectors      of the general public where criminal copyright infringement      is a concern. The Attorney General shall consult with      appropriate interested parties in developing such sector-     specific materials.       (d) Consultations.--The Attorney General shall consult with      the Register of Copyrights and the Secretary of Commerce in      developing the Internet Use Education Program under this      section.       (e) Prohibition on Use of Certain Funds.--The program      created under this section shall not use funds or resources      of the Department of Justice allocated for criminal      investigation or prosecution.

SEC. 108. CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR UNAUTHORIZED RECORDING OF                    MOTION PICTURES IN A MOTION PICTURE EXHIBITION                    FACILITY.       (a) In General.--Chapter 113 of title 18, United States      Code, is amended by adding after section 2319A the following      new section:     ``Sec. 2319B. Unauthorized recording of motion pictures in a        motion picture exhibition facility       ``(a) Offense.--Any person who, without the authorization      of the copyright owner, knowingly uses or attempts to use an      audiovisual recording device to transmit or make a copy of a      motion picture or other audiovisual work protected under      title 17, or any part thereof, from a performance of such      work in a motion picture exhibition facility, shall--       ``(1) be imprisoned for not more than 3 years, fined under      this title, or both; or       ``(2) if the offense is a second or subsequent offense, be      imprisoned for no more than 6 years, fined under this title,      or both.     The possession by a person of an audiovisual recording device      in a motion picture exhibition facility may be considered as      evidence in any proceeding to determine whether that person      committed an offense under this subsection, but shall not, by      itself, be sufficient to support a conviction of that person      for such offense.       ``(b) Forfeiture and Destruction.--When a person is      convicted of an offense under subsection (a), the court in      its judgment of conviction shall, in addition to any penalty      provided, order the forfeiture and destruction or other      disposition of all unauthorized copies of motion pictures or      other audiovisual works protected under title 17, or parts      thereof, and any audiovisual recording devices or other      equipment used in connection with the offense.       ``(c) Authorized Activities.--This section does not prevent      any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or      intelligence activity by an officer, agent, or employee of      the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a      State, or by a person acting under a contract with the United      States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State.       ``(d) Immunity for Theaters and Authorized Persons.--With      reasonable cause, the owner or lessee of a motion picture      facility where a motion picture is being exhibited, the      authorized agent or employee of such owner or lessee, the      licensor of the motion picture being exhibited, or the agent      or employee of such licensor--       ``(1) may detain, in a reasonable manner and for a      reasonable time, any person suspected of committing an      offense under this section for the purpose of questioning      that person or summoning a law enforcement officer; and       ``(2) shall not be held liable in any civil or criminal      action by reason of a detention under paragraph (1).       ``(e) Victim Impact Statement.--       ``(1) In general.--During the preparation of the      presentence report under rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of      Criminal Procedure,     victims of an offense under this section shall be permitted      to submit to the probation officer a victim impact statement      that identifies the victim of the offense and the extent and      scope of the injury and loss suffered by the victim,      including the estimated economic impact of the offense on      that victim.       ``(2) Contents.--A victim impact statement submitted under      this subsection shall include--       ``(A) producers and sellers of legitimate works affected by      conduct involved in the offense;       ``(B) holders of intellectual property rights in the works      described in subparagraph (A); and       ``(C) the legal representatives of such producers, sellers,      and holders.       ``(f) Definitions.--In this section:       ``(1) Audiovisual work, copy, etc.--The terms `audiovisual      work', `copy', `copyright owner', `motion picture', and      `transmit' have, respectively, the meanings given those terms      in section 101 of title 17.       ``(2) Audiovisual recording device.--The term `audiovisual      recording device' means a digital or analog photographic or      video camera, or any other technology or device capable of      enabling the recording or transmission of a copyrighted      motion picture or other audiovisual work, or any part      thereof, regardless of whether audiovisual recording is the      sole or primary purpose of the device.       ``(3) Motion picture exhibition facility.--The term `motion      picture exhibition facility' means a movie theater, screening      room, or other venue that is being used primarily for the      exhibition of a copyrighted motion picture, if such      exhibition is open to the public or is made to an assembled      group of viewers outside of a normal circle of a family and      its social acquaintances.       ``(g) State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in this section may      be construed to annul or limit any rights or remedies under      the laws of any State.''.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO                    PREVENT ILLEGAL ACTIVITY ON PEER-TO-PEER                    SERVICES.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:       (1) The most popular publicly accessible peer-to-peer file      sharing software programs combined have been downloaded      worldwide over 600,000,000 times.       (2) The vast majority of software products, including peer-     to-peer technology, do not pose an inherent risk. Responsible      persons making software products should be encouraged and      commended for the due diligence and reasonable care they take      including by providing instructions, relevant information in      the documentation, disseminating patches, updates, and other      appropriate modifications to the software.       (3) Massive volumes of illegal activity, including the      distribution of child pornography, viruses, and confidential      personal information, and copyright infringement occur on      publicly accessible peer-to-peer file sharing services every      day. Some publicly accessible peer-to-peer file sharing      services expose consumers, particularly children, to serious      risks, including legal liability, loss of privacy, threats to      computer security, and exposure to illegal and inappropriate      material.       (4) Several studies and reports demonstrate that      pornography, including child pornography, is prevalent on      publicly available peer-to-peer file sharing services, and      children are regularly exposed to pornography when using such      peer-to-peer file sharing services.       (5) The full potential of peer-to-peer technology to      benefit consumers has yet to be realized and will not be      achieved until these problems are adequately addressed.       (6) To date, the businesses that run publicly accessible      file-sharing services have refused or failed to voluntarily      and sufficiently address these problems.       (7) Many users of publicly available peer-to-peer file-     sharing services are drawn to these systems by the lure of      obtaining ``free'' music and movies.       (8) While some users use parental controls to protect      children from pornography available on the Internet and      search engines, not all such controls work on publicly      accessible peer-to-peer networks.       (9) Businesses that run publicly accessible peer-to-peer      file sharing services have openly acknowledged, and numerous      studies and reports have established, that these services      facilitate and profit from massive amounts of copyright      infringement, causing enormous damage to the economic well-     being of the copyright industries whose works are being      illegally ``shared'' and downloaded.       (10) The legitimate digital music marketplace offers      consumers a wide and growing array of choices for obtaining      music legally, without exposure to the risks posed by      publicly accessible peer-to-peer file sharing services.       (11) The Federal Trade Commission issued a Consumer Alert      in July of 2003 warning consumers that some file-sharing      services contain damaging viruses and worms and, without the      computer user's knowledge or consent, install spyware to      monitor a user's browsing habits and send data to third      parties or automatically open network connections.       (12) Publicly available peer-to-peer file-sharing services      can and should adopt reasonable business practices and use      technology in the marketplace to address the existing risks      posed to consumers by their services and facilitate the      legitimate use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology and      software.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress      that--       (1) responsible software developers should be commended,      recognized, and encouraged for their efforts to protect      consumers;       (2) currently the level of ongoing and persistent illegal      and dangerous activity on publicly accessible peer-to-peer      file sharing services is harmful to consumers, minors, and      the economy; and       (3) therefore, the Congress and the executive branch should      consider all appropriate measures to protect consumers and      children, and prevent such illegal activity.     SEC. 110. ENHANCEMENT OF CRIMINAL COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.       (a) Criminal Infringement.--Section 506 of title 17, United      States Code, is amended--       (1) by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:       ``(a) Criminal Infringement.--Any person who--       ``(1) infringes a copyright willfully and for purposes of      commercial advantage or private financial gain,       ``(2) infringes a copyright willfully by the reproduction      or distribution, including by the offering for distribution      to the public by electronic means, during any 180-day period,      of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted      works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000,      or       ``(3) infringes a copyright by the knowing distribution,      including by the offering for distribution to the public by      electronic means, with reckless disregard of the risk of      further infringement, during any 180-day period, of--       ``(A) 1,000 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more      copyrighted works,       ``(B) 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more      copyrighted works with a total retail value of more than      $10,000, or       ``(C) 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more      copyrighted pre-release works,     shall be punished as provided under section 2319 of title 18.      For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or      distribution of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be      sufficient to establish the necessary level of intent under      this subsection.''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(g) Limitation on Liability of Service Providers.--No      legal entity shall be liable for a violation of subsection      (a)(3) by reason of performing any function described in      subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of section 512 if such legal      entity would not be liable for monetary relief under section      512 by reason of performing such function. Except for      purposes of determining whether an entity qualifies for the      limitation on liability under subsection (a)(3) of this      section, the legal conclusion of whether an entity qualifies      for a limitation on liability under section 512 shall not be      considered in a judicial determination of whether the entity      violates subsection (a) of this section.       ``(h) Definitions.--In this section:       ``(1) Pre-release work.--The term `pre-release work' refers      to a work protected under this title which has a commercial      and economic value and which, at the time of the act of      infringement that is the basis for the offense under      subsection (a)(3), the defendant knew or should have known      had not yet been made available by the copyright owner to      individual members of the general public in copies or      phonorecords for sale, license, or rental.       ``(2) Retail value.--The `retail value' of a copyrighted      work is the retail price of that work in the market in which      it is sold. In the case of an infringement of a copyright by      distribution, if the retail price does not adequately reflect      the economic value of the infringement, then the retail value      may be determined using other factors, including but not      limited to suggested retail price, wholesale price,      replacement cost of the item, licensing, or distribution-     related fees.''.       (b) Penalties.--Section 2319 of title 18, United States      Code, is amended--       (1) by redesignating subsections (d) and (e) as subsections      (e) and (f), respectively;       (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:       ``(d) Any person who commits an offense under section      506(a)(3) of title 17--       ``(1) shall be imprisoned not more than 3 years, or fined      in the amount set forth in this title, or both, or, if the      offense was committed for purposes of commercial advantage or      private financial gain, imprisoned for not more than 5 years,      or fined in the amount set forth in this title, or both; and       ``(2) shall, if the offense is a second or subsequent      offense under paragraph (1), be imprisoned not more than 6      years, or fined in the amount set forth in this title, or      both, or, if the offense was committed for purposes of      commercial advantage or private financial gain, imprisoned      for not more than 10 years, or fined in the amount set forth      in this title, or both.''; and       (3) in subsection (f), as so redesignated--       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' after the      semicolon;       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking the period and inserting      ``; and''; and       (C) by adding at the end the following:       ``(3) the term `financial gain' has the meaning given that      term in section 101 (relating to definitions) of title 17.''.       (c) Civil Remedies for Infringement of a Commercial Pre-     Release Copyrighted Work.--Section 504(b) of title 17, United      States Code, is amended--       (1) by striking ``The copyright owner'' and inserting the      following:       ``(1) In general.--The copyright owner''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(2) Damages for pre-release infringement.--       ``(A) In general.--In the case of any pre-release work,      actual damages shall be presumed conclusively to be no less      than $10,000 per infringement, if a person--       ``(i) distributes such work by making it available on a      computer network accessible to members of the public; and       ``(ii) knew or should have known that the work was intended      for commercial distribution.       ``(B) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the      term `pre-release work' has the meaning given that term in      section 506(h).''.     SEC. 111. AMENDMENT OF FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES                    REGARDING THE INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS                    AND RELATED CRIMES.       (a) Amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines.--Pursuant to      its authority under section 994 of title 28, United States      Code, and in accordance with this section, the United States      Sentencing Commission shall review and, if appropriate, amend      the sentencing guidelines and policy statements applicable to      persons convicted of intellectual property rights crimes,      including sections 2318, 2319, 2319A, 2319B, 2320 of title      18, United States Code, and sections 506, 1201, and 1202 of      title 17, United States Code.       (b) Factors.--In carrying out this section, the Sentencing      Commission shall--       (1) take all appropriate measures to ensure that the      sentencing guidelines and policy statements applicable to the      offenses described in subsection (a) are sufficiently      stringent to deter and adequately reflect the nature of such      offenses;       (2) consider whether to provide a sentencing enhancement      for those convicted of the offenses described in subsection      (a) when the conduct involves the display, performance,      publication, reproduction, or distribution of a copyrighted      work before the time when the copyright owner has authorized      the display, performance, publication, reproduction, or      distribution of the original work, whether in the media      format used by the infringing good or in any other media      format;       (3) consider whether the definition of ``uploading''      contained in Application Note 3 to Guideline 2B5.3 is      adequate to address the loss attributable to people broadly      distributing copyrighted works over the Internet without      authorization; and       (4) consider whether the sentencing guidelines and policy      statements applicable to the offenses described in subsection      (a) adequately reflect any harm to victims from infringement      in circumstances where law enforcement cannot determine how      many times copyrighted material is reproduced or distributed.       (c) Promulgation.--The Commission may promulgate the      guidelines or amendments under this section in accordance      with the procedures set forth in section 21(a) of the      Sentencing Act of 1987, as though the authority under that      Act had not expired.
