President, it is my pleasure to recognize Ms. Shirley Cochran, a person who has made a significant contribution to the education of our children.  Ms. Cochran's outstanding efforts during her 28 years as a special educator have helped countless individuals live productive, successful lives. In hercurrent position at the Camelot Care Center in Palatine, IL, she continues to assist students who have enrolled to get the special attention they need. Ms. Cochran's kindness and commitment are commendable.  As an educator with an undergraduate degree in psychology and a master's degree in special education, Ms. Cochran is well-equipped to serve as a teacher and administrator. But it is her genuine kindness, sincerity, and devotion to her students that make her the remarkable educator she has proven to be throughout the past 28 years.  Ms. Cochran is an example of professional dedication for all teachers in the state of Illinois and the nation. I congratulate her on her years of educational achievement, and wish her the best of luck in the years to come.                          ____________________
