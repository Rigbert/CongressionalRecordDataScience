President, today I rise in support of the United Orphanage and Academy in Moi's Bridge, Kenya. As many of my esteemed colleagues know, Africa has a special place in my heart. I visit the continent several times a year to see a number of dear friends. My own granddaughter, Zegita Marie, joined our family through adoption from Ethiopia.  As we hear virtually every day, Sub-Saharan Africa is in crisis; the statistics of devastation are staggering. In 2006, 2.8 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa contracted HIV and nearly 1 million children died from malaria, according to the World Health Organization. The United Nations estimates that in the same year, there were 12 million AIDS orphans living in the region. These pandemics are further compounded by famine, unsafe drinking water, corruption, and war.  Much has been said of these heart-wrenching situations, but today my message is one of hope. During my travels, I have found Africa to be a place of beauty, courage, and ingenuity. Kenya alone is home to more than 42 distinct ethnic communities, the soaring heights of Mt. Kenya, and one of the largest drama events in Africa, the annual Kenya Schools and Colleges Drama Festival.  Embodying these characteristics, the United Orphanage and Academy cares for 40 children impacted by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Founded in 2001, this beacon of hope lies in rural northwest Kenya, near the Ugandan border. Children ages 4 to 14 are provided with food, shelter, clean water, and quality education. One hundred students are currently enrolled in classes from pre-kindergarten through second grade. Moreover, the home is a place of reconciliation and unity as children from five distinct ethnic backgrounds and numerous tribes learn to work, play, and grow together.  The vision for the orphanage stemmed from humble beginnings, as conversations between Rev. Stephen Chege and Henri Rush, an elder at Westminster Presbyterian Church, evolved into a vision to ``develop a caring and spiritual space for children to live and grow when they come to the point of having no family or guardian support available to them.'' As a result, an ambitious roadmap has been set in place, encompassing everything from procuring a van for vital transportation needs to constructing additional classrooms.  Today, I would like to highlight efforts to expand this mission. Great need requires great hope, and great hope requires great action. Reverend Chege, Mr. Rush and their partners seek to double the capacity of the orphanage to house up to 80 children. Furthermore, plans exist to expand the school to include grades K-12 and further vocational training. The philosopher Aristotle once said: ``All who havemeditated on the art of governing mankind have been convinced that the fate of empires depends on the education of youth.'' In my humble estimation, the fate of Africa depends, in large part, on the education of young men and women who learn to lead their communities with wisdom and integrity.  I am filled with hope when I see individuals and communities coming together to respond to perhaps one of the greatest crises of our time, and I am encouraged when such initiatives emerge from transcontinental friendships. I believe the United Orphanage and Academy embodies the values and provides the tools necessary to equip Africa's youth to embrace a world of challenges and possibilities.                          ____________________
