. 2830, the Pension Protection Act, and I ask my colleagues to join me in opposition.                              {time}  1045  Last night not only were my four amendments disallowed, but a substitute measure offered by Mr. Rangel and Mr. Miller was also disallowed. From my perspective, given the importance of the underlying legislation, we ought to have an open debate. We ought to have votes, and we ought to have decisions made by the full membership.  In terms of the amendments I offered last night to the Rules Committee, the first set essentially said that the funds in retirement accounts are the workers' money, and employees ought to have a voice in single employer pension plans regarding the management of those moneys. Given the number of pensions that have been thrown overboard, and given the tens of thousands of Americans who have been hurt, I also think, as a bare minimum, companies ought to once, every 3 years, be required to inform their employees of the health of their pension funds.  The third amendment I offered essentially said that every last option, whether it be from the perspective of the PBGC or the company be exhausted before that pension is assumed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, given the fact that, on average, at least 15 percent of the retirees who have their pensions assumed by the corporation are going to receive less than their full promised pension.  A case in point was in United Airlines negotiations, the unions of the company were still bargaining and the PBGC came in and unilaterally assumed that pension.  The final goes to the heart of the matter, and that is to close that gap. For those pensioners that do not receive their full pension under the PBGC, they are out that pension money. I am disgusted by the fact that they do not have standing under theprocedures. And I would use Adelphi Corporation, which recently declared bankruptcy as an example of the abuse of the system and the disadvantage that the employees are put under.  Adelphi, headed by Mr. Smith, who also was at Bethlehem Steel when they went bankrupt and they dumped their pensions over, really has no interest in going out of business. They want to dump their liabilities. Under the Bankruptcy Code, Mr. Miller and up to 500 executives at Adelphi are entitled to 30 to 250 percent bonuses for running their company into the ground, going through bankruptcy, dumping their liabilities and hurting people.  What happens to the workers who do not get their full pension after Mr. Miller and his gang dump those pensions overboard, they have no standing under the Bankruptcy Code.  All I asked the Rules Committee last night was that we ought to talk about that here on the House floor and we ought to have a debate. Those people who gave their lives to that company who are now short money for the rest of their lives when they need it the most should have some standing. I ask Members to oppose the rule.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this restrictive rule for H.R. 2830, the Pension Protection Act and I ask that my colleagues join me in opposition.  Last night in the Rules Committee, I offered four amendments that I believe would have made this a better bill, none of which were found to be in order. Furthermore, this restrictive closed rule does not even make in order a substitute measure authored by Ranking Members Miller and Rangel. In a time when Delphi will be awarding 500 executives, bonuses of 30 percent to 250 percent of their base salaries, workers are seeing their pensions frozen, I find it very troubling that the majority refuses to have a full and open debate on an issue so critical to our Nation's retirement security.  My first amendment would have put employee representatives on the trustee board of single employer pension plans, which would ensure that employees have a voice in how their investments are managed. The growing significance of pension plans in the U.S. economy has sparked a continued public debate over the control of pension fund investments. A generation ago, Congress took action to safeguard pensions in response to an Enron-like debacle at Studebaker. These protections for defined benefit plans included diversification requirements as well as government insurance. Pension funds represent deferred compensation and there is no reason why single-employer pension plans still lack employee representation on their boards.  My second amendment would have required that plan sponsors furnish pension participants with the most current benefit statement at least once every 3 years. Fiscally unhealthy pensions have caused severe hardship on employees who have depended on their pensions as part of their retirement security. In order for pensioners to have a more complete understanding of the health of their pension fund, it is necessary to provide full and accurate information on a timely basis. Both the underlying bill as well as Mr. Miller's substitute address this issue, but I do not believe that they go far enough.  My third amendment would make it more difficult for companies to abuse the bankruptcy process in order to dump their pension obligations. Specifically, this provision requires that alternatives to pension-dumping be identified, which would essentially make pension-dumping a last resort for companies rather than a financial-planning tool. The amendment would require both employer-initiated and PBGC-initiated terminations to identify and disclose alternatives to dumping their pension obligations.   There is a disturbing trend of companies dumping their pension obligations not because the company is going out of business, but because the company does not want to follow through on the financial commitment made to its employees. This legislation would make it more difficult for financially-viable companies to engage in pension dumping to increase their long-term profits. Current law does not sufficiently protect against the termination of plans. By implementing this provision, pension participants would have greater opportunity to work with companies to find alternatives to eliminating existing pension plans.  After a company successfully terminates its pension plan, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, PBGC, takes over the financial obligations to make payments to pensioners. In certain instances, the maximum amount the PBGC will pay is less than the original amount promised by the pension.  My final amendment would have made the cost of the pension payment ``gap'' an administrative expense for the company, which would make it easier for pensioners to collect the missing funds in bankruptcy court. Pensioners deserve the full pension amount they were promised. In cases where the company goes bankrupt, and the PBGC payment is less than the original amount promised, pensioners deserve to be near the front of the line when it comes to collecting debts from the company in bankruptcy court. I believe that a promise is a promise, and if a company emerges from bankruptcy with the finances to pay the difference of a lower pension, they should do so.  Once again, I urge my colleagues to oppose this restrictive rule.
