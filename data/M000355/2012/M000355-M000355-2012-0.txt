 President, I wish to thank my good friend the majority leader for his kind words and thank everyone for their patience and their counsel throughout this process.  I also thank the Vice President for recognizing the importance of preventing this tax hike on the Americanpeople and stepping up to play a crucial role in getting us there. It shouldn't have taken us this long to come to an agreement and this shouldn't be the model for how we do things around here, but I appreciate the Vice President's willingness to get this done for the country.  I know I can speak for my entire conference when I say we don't think taxes should be going up on anyone, but we all knew that if we did nothing, they would be going up on everyone today. We weren't going to let that happen. Each of us could spend the rest of the week discussing what a perfect solution would have looked like, but the end result would have been the largest tax increase in American history.
