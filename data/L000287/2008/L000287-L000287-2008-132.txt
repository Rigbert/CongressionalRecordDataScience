Madam Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Senator Johnny Isakson as he honors our elders for their inspiration in our lives by honoring and remembering his own parents, Ed and Julia Isakson, at the 6th Annual Thanks Mom & Dad Celebration on June 20, 2008.  A loving son, Senator Isakson credits his parents for instilling in him his strong work ethic, his love of family and his respect for others. A good father in his own right, Senator Isakson's children credit him for teaching them through his example, not just words.  Senator Isakson has long championed the rights of older adults and supports programs and services that promote healthy living, employment services and other programs vital to both active and homebound older adults.  The Thanks Mom & Dad Fund' honors parents, grandparents and mentors by supporting programs and services for older adults, and each year asks someone in the community each year to honor their parents, grandparents or mentors. Senator Isakson was selected to honor his parents and is also being honored because he has inspired the lives of his children and so many others in the community.  I know well the power of his work in Georgia and here on Capitol Hill where he has demonstrated the ability to inspire members and staff alike to respond to the needs of the elderly.  I rise to honor Senator Isakson's contributions and to express may gratitude that he continues on in service on behalf of his constitutents.                          ____________________
