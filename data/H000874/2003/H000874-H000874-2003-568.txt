Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H. Res. 423, recognizing the 5th anniversary of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, legislation that established the Office of International Religious Freedom within the Department of State.  This office is most often associated with its Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, which describes the status of religious freedom in each foreign country, government policies violating religious belief and practices, and U.S. policies to promote religious freedom around the world.  This document serves as an important tool for both Congress and the administration in making policy decisions regarding our relations with, and support for, countries around the world.  But in addition to the report, and frankly just as importantly, the Office develops strategies to promote religious freedom, both to attack the root causes of persecution and as a means of promoting other fundamental U.S. interests, such as protecting other core human rights, and encouraging the development of mature democracies.  The importance of this work cannot be overstated--the promotion of religious freedom is intimately connected to the promotion of other fundamental human and civil rights, as well as to the growth of democracy.  A government that acknowledges and protects freedom of religion and conscience is one that understands the inherent and inviolable dignity of the human person, and is more likely to protect, the other rights fundamental to human dignity, such as freedom from arbitrary arrest or seizure, or freedom from torture and murder.  But our interest in promoting religious freedom runs deeper than our support for democracy and stability--it is, simply put, our most important core value, the very reason the 13 colonies were established. American support for religious freedom abroad certainly predates passage of this legislation in 1998. I am particularly proud of the role I played during my tenure as the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Helsinki Commission to raise awareness of religious persecution in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Republics, and the work of the Commission to promote the protection of religious minorities in the Eastern Bloc and elsewhere around the world.  Religious freedom is the first of the freedoms enumerated in the Bill of Rights--a reflection of the founders' belief that freedom of religion and conscience is the cornerstone of liberty.  As Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1803, ``It behooves every man who values liberty of conscience for himself, to resist invasions of it in the case of others; or their case may, by change of circumstances, become his own.''  I was an active supporter of the original legislation, I am proud of the work done by the office since its creation, and am pleased to help commemorate this important anniversary.                          ____________________
