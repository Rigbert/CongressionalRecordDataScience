Speaker, I would like to take a moment to offer my congratulations to the Lackey High School Chargers football team of Indian Head, Maryland, for reaching the State finals this past Thursday, December 4, 2003.  The Lackey Chargers had a fairytale season led by their head coach, Mr. Scott Chadwick, and many devoted assistant coaches. In regular season matches, they were defeated only once, and this record allowed them to begin competing in championship games in early November.  The path that would lead the Lackey Chargers to the State finals began on November 7, 2003, when the Lackey Chargers defeated Westlake High School to become the Southern Maryland Athletic Conference champions. Their momentum continued on November 15, 2003, as they beat Northern High School, and they showed their strength once again on November 22, 2003, when they narrowly overtook Westlake High School to become the Regional Champions.  On November 28, 2003, the Lackey Chargers defeated Randallstown High School in the Maryland Triple A Semifinals, propelling them to the State finals at Ravens Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, where they faced Linganor High School. Despite a valiant effort, the Lackey Chargers fell short in the end in a heartbreaking loss. Even without carrying home the title, Principal Jarvis Petty and the students, staff and parents at Lackey High School have shown their support for a football team that has made the entire Charles County community proud of their incredible season.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing each of these outstanding athletes, #2 Cameron Neal; #3 Courteney Knight; #5 Devonte Williams; #6 Avery Lancaster; #7 Aaron Smith; #8 Michael Young; #10 Damian Shorter; #11 Jason Murray; #15 Jesse Hitch; #16 Mark Herbert; #20 Morgan Green; #23 Darren Bullock; #25 Brandon Gaylor; #32 Ricardo Young; #34 Tre Gray; #40 Bryan Gibbons; #43 Kevin Glascock; #44 Robert Matthews; #48 Kyle Mckeown; #50 Jeremy Hairston; #52 George Kerr; #55 Mike Seman; #56 Aaron Williams; #60 Kenny Washington; #65 J.B.
