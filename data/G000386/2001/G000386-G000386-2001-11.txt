 We are giving a 60-percent tax credit for health care tax for unemployed workers, including people who can use it to extend COBRA insurance benefits.  States will have the ability to address problems such as part-time workers. There is a modest proposal to accelerate income tax rate reductions in the 27-percent bracket.  I am sure there are a lot of Members of this body, particularly those who voted against the bipartisan tax bill last spring, who are not going to want to speed up, from 27 percent to 25 percent, the reduction of that tax rate. Somehow there is an insinuation that if you do that, you are helping the wealthy. I want my colleagues to remember that this benefits a single taxpayer earning as little as $27,051 and going up to $65,000. And then, for a married couple, that would kick in at $45,201, going up to $109,000.  For people making $27,000, where this bracket starts, or for married couples making $45,000, these are not rich people or rich families. What we are talking about is a 2-percentage-point tax cut for these folks.  So is there anything wrong with a single person paying $770 less in taxes or a married couple paying $1,281 less in taxes if they fall into this income tax bracket that we would call middle income?  It seems to me it is fair, but, most importantly, it is meant to be a stimulus. This is something that middle-of-the-road Democrats and Republicans support. This is part of the original centrist package.  We also have a 30-percent bonus depreciation. That is something that was in everybody's package, Republican or Democrat, House or Senate.  We have also a 5-year net operating loss carryback. That was not in the President's package. That was not in the Senate Republican package. That was in the Senate Democratic package.  On corporate alternative minimum tax, there is no repeal, no retroactivity, like was lambasted when it came out of the House that way. There is no corporate AMT repeal, retroactive or otherwise, in the White House-centrist package. There are some well thought out reforms that cost about one-twentieth of what the House bill did on alternative minimum tax. That is a very major movement. That is why the centrists support this compromise.  The White House-centrist package extends expiring tax provisions by 2 years.  Finally, the White House-centrist package includes bipartisan tax relief proposals for victims of terrorism and business in New York City. These are much needed, and they are urgent matters. I believe the Senators from New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut ought to find it inviting that these things are in there for their constituents and support this package.  Let's get the record straight. Let's have a good debate. Let the votes fall where they may. I can't help but ask our distinguished majority leader, Senator Daschle, to give the people what they want--a bipartisan economic stimulus bill with the largest aid going to dislocated workers in a generation.  It is clear that the people and the President don't want stalling, don't want muddling, don't want delay and, most important in this state of war we are in, don't want partisanship.  I urge the Senate majority leader to do the right thing: End this session by delivering a bipartisan priority. By doing it, we put the people's business first. If I were the majority leader, I would not know how to explain to the American people, as I returned home to the State of Iowa to enjoy the holiday season there with my family on the farm at New Hartford, why millions of Americans are desperately waiting for the Senate to pass an economic and job security bill that has been in this body for the last 2 months. If I were the majority leader, I don't know how I would explain to the people of Iowa, how I could look my constituents straight in the eye, and all of my taxpayers and all the small business owners of Iowa, and explain, by not passing this bill, how I would choose politics ahead of people.  It is time to get the job done. There is still time to do it. If people are allowed to vote their conscience and not have the restriction of party, we can get the job done, I believe.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
