Speaker, around the country, more and more Americans are out of work, struggling to pay their bills. Yesterday, the Web site recovery.gov revealed that your government spent $1.2 million to purchase pork at twice what struggling families would pay at a local grocery store. It would be funny if it weren't so painful.  The $787 billion stimulus was sold to the American people as a bill that would put people back to work. But now we see it for what it really is, a massive expansion of social welfare which is doing nothing to create jobs.  Where are the jobs? Almost 6 months have passed since the stimulus was signed into law, and unemployment continues to tick upward. It is over 13 percent in my congressional district. The so-called ``stimulus'' was a missed opportunity to provide true tax relief to the American people and for shovel-ready infrastructure projects that would have provided jobs. As more information on this stimulus package is revealed, I'm sure more terrifying news will be before us.                          ____________________
