President, I will be very brief. I have had the privilege of serving longer in this body than any other Member of the Senate, currently. I can count on my one hand, or probably a few fingers, some of the great speeches I have heard by both Republicans and Democrats in this body. One great speech I will never forget was that of the Senator from Rhode Island. He speaks to a subject that every single Vermonter would agree with, and this veteran Senator thanks him.
