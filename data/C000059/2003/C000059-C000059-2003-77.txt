Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an organization whose dedication and contributions to Riverside County are exceptional. Riverside County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community organizations who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. St. Thomas the apostle church is one of those organization. This January, St. Thomas the Apostle Church celebrates its 100th year anniversary.  The history of St. Thomas the Apostle Church includes service by the Jesuits, Franciscans and Diocesan priests as well as several communities of religious women. The Church has had the honor to have one of the newly named American saints work within the church community. St. Katharine Drexel and her order, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, served the religious needs of the children at the Indian schools in the Southwest.  In 1903, St. Thomas the Apostle Church's path began as Father O'Brien celebrated his first Mass to a church paced with Indian students using a kitchen table as an alter. In the 1940's, the church experienced many changes as the pews began to fill with Army personnel during World War II. Father Edmund Krolicki of the Conventual Franciscans, with the help of parishioner volunteers, worked to build the first school buildings at St. Thomas the Apostle. In the late 1950's the parish faced more challenges when the church was lost to an arson fire. The commitment of service and faith would see the church through these difficult times and the community quickly united in the effort of re-building the church.  The new millennium has brought the parishioners of St. Thomas the Apostle great spiritual and structural growth under the care and guidance of Fr. Joseph Felker. Since his arrival in 2000, the parish has enjoyed a renewed sense of community as the parish joins in the collaborative effort of renovating the parish site as well as building a new ministry center. The Katharine Drexel Ministry Center is a dream being actualized as a legacy for the next generation.  St. Thomas the Apostle continues to illustrate what a church community should strive for; a community of prayer, a place for families to be blessed; a place to celebrate the sacraments; and where God's live is at work. St. Thomas the Apostle's tireless work in their community and among their members has contributed immeasurably to the betterment of Riverside county. I congratulate St. Thomas the Apostle on 100 years of service and worship.                          ____________________
