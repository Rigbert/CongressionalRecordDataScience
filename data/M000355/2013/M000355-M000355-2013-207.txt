 President, it seems like, with each passing hour, the facts get more and more inconvenient for senior folks over at the IRS.  Yesterday, it was reported that the agency may have gone after a ministry founded by Billy Graham. We also learned that the very same IRS office that admitted to harassing conservative groups also released nine pending applications for tax-exempt status to the liberal investigative group ProPublica.  How did we find out? ProPublica revealed it.  Basically all we have gotten from the IRS, on the other hand, is an attempt to scapegoat some folks out in Cincinnati and a laughable attempt to move past this whole issue with a ridiculous op-ed claiming ``mistakes were made.''  Well, most folks don't think that ignoring the Constitution is simply a ``mistake.'' I like the fact that one group the IRS targeted, when asked by the agency to provide reading materials related to their mission, mailed them a copy of the Constitution.  Today, I would like to encourage every group that feels like it has been unjustly targeted to do the same. Maybe just underline the First Amendment before you put it in the envelope, because that is what this is all about.  But getting back to the latest news--the leak to ProPublica--let's be clear about what this means: the IRS is forbidden from providing that kind of information about groups that have not been approved. It is a bright line prohibition that even the lowliest staffers at the IRS surely should know about.  We intend to find out all the relevant details. Yesterday, I said the administration needs to comply fully with all congressional inquiries on the matter. This ProPublica leak will unquestionably be one of them. The administration needs to make witnesses available to testify on this and on any other incident of targeting the administration's ideological opponents, and to resist the temptation to stonewall or obfuscate what took place.  Today, other Senate Republicans are joining me in this call. More than 40 members have signed a letter demanding as much of the President.  If the President is truly concerned about this issue, as he claims, he will work openly and transparently with us to get to the bottom of what happened and people will be held accountable. These allegations are serious--that there was an effort to bring the power of the Federal Government to bear on those the administration disagreed with, in the middle of a heated national election. It actually could be criminal. And we are determined to get answers.  Again, let's not forget that we would not know any of this if congressional Republicans had not demanded better answers than the ones we were getting from the administration. When I and several of my colleagues wrote to the IRS last year seeking clarification on allegations that they were harassing conservative groups, the response we got was essentially: nothing to see here, move along.  When I pressed the issue in a speech last June, the left either ridiculed the suggestion or ignored it. When IRS officials were asked point blank in congressional hearings whether this was happening, they said point blank that it wasn't.  Of course it turns out it was.  By the way--you know who did not have trouble getting information out of the IRS? ProPublica, which was pushing an ideological agenda friendly to the administration. When they asked the IRS for information, they got it--in 12 days. Some of it was not even supposed to be released.  When I asked the IRS for information, when did I get it? Only when it was coming out anyway in an IG report.  So there are a lot--a lot--of unanswered questions that remain.  Which officials knew about this scandal?  When did they know about it?  What did they do about it when they found out?  Did they deliberately mislead Congress and the American people?  The number of officials involved continues to grow. And now, with this revelation from ProPublica, it appears that the campaign against conservative groups was of a broader scope than originally admitted. So it is no surprise that the American people are demanding more than just some half-hearted apology made under duress. As an activist from one of the targeted groups in Kentucky said yesterday, ``Apology not accepted.''  ``There are many questions that still need to be asked,'' he said. ``There are many that remain unanswered.''  My constituent was absolutely right.  I ask unanimous consent the letter signed by my colleagues be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             United States Senate,     Washington, DC, May 14, 2013.     Hon. Barack Obama,     Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our grave      concerns and deep disappointment about the revelations in a      report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax      Administration (TIGTA) that the Internal Revenue Service      (IRS) had specifically targeted certain organizations for      extra scrutiny as part of their approval review of      applications for tax-exempt 501(c)(4) status. This appears to      be a wholly inappropriate action that threatens to silence      political dissent and brings partisan politics into what used      to be a nonpartisan, unbiased and fact-based review process.      The public's confidence in the IRS relies on fair and      apolitical application of the law. Actions such as these      undermine taxpayers' ability to trust its government to      fairly implement the law.       According to information given to Congress in a timeline      provided by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax      Administration (TIGTA), in early 2010 ``specialists had been      asked to be on the lookout for Tea Party applications, and      the IRS Determinations Unit had begun searching its database      for applications with `Tea Party,' `Patriots,' or `9/12' in      the organization's name.'' The report goes on to state that      ``By June 2011, some IRS specialists were probing      applications using the following criteria to identify tea-     party cases, according to the Treasury inspector general      findings: `` `Tea Party,' `Patriots' or `9/12 Project' is      referenced in the case file; issues include government      spending, government debt or taxes; education of the public      by advocacy/lobbying to `make America a better place to      live'; statements in the case file criticize how the country      is being run.''       We are deeply disturbed that agents of the government were      directed to give greater scrutiny to groups engaged in      conduct questioning the actions of their government. This      type of purely political scrutiny being conducted by an      Executive Branch Agency is yet another completely inexcusable      attempt to chill the speech of political opponents and those      who would question their government, consistent with a      broader pattern of intimidation by arms of your      administration to silence political dissent.       These disclosures are even more unsettling as they      contradict prior statements made by representatives of the      Administration on this matter. In response to questions      raised in 2012 on this issue by Republican Senators, Steven      T. Miller, the Deputy Commissioner for Services and      Enforcement at the IRS, specifically (and falsely) stated      that there was an unbiased, technical screening process used      to determine which applications for 501(c)(4) organizations      merited further review. In two separate letters to Finance      Committee Ranking Member Orrin Hatch, Mr. Miller failed to      note that explicitly political screens were used in reviewing      applications, despite the fact the practice was apparently      well known within the IRS as early as 2010.       Given these strong and clear statements by the      Administration in 2012 that no such targeted review or      specified politically motivated criteria existed, these      revelations raise serious questions about the entire      application review process, and the controls in place at the      IRS to stop this sort of political interference once and for      all. According to TIGTA these actions took place more than      two years ago, yet without this information becoming public,      there is no evidence that your administration would have done      anything to make sure these abuses were brought to light and      dealt with in a transparent way.       The American people deserve to know what actions will be      taken to ensure those who made these policy decisions at the      IRS are being held fully accountable and more importantly      what is being done to ensure that this kind of raw      partisanship is fully eliminated from these critically      important non-partisan government functions. As such, we      demand that your Administration comply with all requests      related to Congressional inquiries without any delay,      including making available all IRS employees involved in      designing and implementing these prohibited political      screenings, so that the public has a full accounting of these      actions. It is imperative that the Administration be fully      forthcoming to ensure that we begin to restore the confidence      of our fellow citizens after this blatant violation of their      trust. We look forward to working on this critical issue with      the Administration's full cooperation.           Sincerely,         Orrin Hatch, John Barrasso, Pat Toomey, Mitch McConnell,            John Cornyn, Bob Corker, David Vitter, Marco Rubio,            Mark Kirk, John Thune, John Hoeven, James Inhofe, Deb            Fischer, James Risch, Mike Johanns, Johnny Isakson,            Richard Shelby, Tom Coburn, John Boozman, Chuck            Grassley, Rand Paul, Mike Crapo, Dan Coats, Kelly            Ayotte, John McCain, Ted Cruz, Dean Heller, Richard            Burr, Pat Roberts, Roger Wicker, Thad Cochran, Ron            Johnson, Rob Portman, Michael B. Enzi, Jeff Flake,            Susan Collins, Saxby Chambliss, Roy Blunt, Jeff            Sessions, Lamar Alexander, Jerry Moran, Mike Lee,            Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, Lisa Murkowski.                          ____________________
