Chairman, I rise to echo the words of the distinguished gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] who does such an outstanding job representing Baltimore, the port, and our State.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to also rise to thank the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Myers], the chairman of the committee, who has been a longstanding supporter. I came here in 1981 and started working on the dredging of the Baltimore Harbor along with others. One of the predecessors on the committee was not too enthusiastic about that, as the gentleman may recall. But the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Myers] and the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Bevill] have been tremendously helpful to the Port of Baltimore. I thank them, thank the committee, and join my colleague from Maryland in his remarks.
