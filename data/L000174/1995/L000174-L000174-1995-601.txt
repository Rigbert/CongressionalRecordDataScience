President, I assure my colleagues, the distinguished managers of the bill and my good friends, that I will not hold the floor long. I noted that nobody else was speaking just at the moment.  Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago I went on Senate business to the Republic of Ireland in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom over a 3- or 4-day weekend as one who has been involved in the international fund for Ireland. It was at a time just prior to the publication of the framework Document of Peace between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. Our distinguished former colleague, Senator George Mitchell, was also there representing the President of the United States. He and I had various meetings in Dublin and elsewhere. I have discussed those before.  But I thought of this earlier this week. I picked up the New York Times and saw under a heading ``Belfast Journal'' a very, very moving article by James F. Clarity. I will speak to that in just a moment.  What I noticed were rather hopeful signs as I drove from Dublin to Belfast and went into Northern Ireland leaving the Republic of Ireland. The gates and barriers and bomb detectors, police and military that you normally see across the border were absent. In fact, you could see the marks on the ground where the speed bumps had been removed. And you did not see the all-pervasive military patrols, at least in the daylight hours throughout Belfast.  In Belfast, I met with both Protestant and Catholic groups. They talked of their fears, their concerns, and their hopes. Then on Sunday I met with some mothers who spoke to me--it really makes no difference which faith is involved here because I heard the same thing from all mothers I spoke with--that for the first time since the troubles began they were able to walk with their children on the streets and not have to worry about car bombs. For the first time they did not have to worry about the knock in the middle of the night of somebody telling them their husband will be killed or witness such a killing in front of the rest of the family.  The presence of armed authorities on the streets of Belfast were greatly diminished, in contrast with the Republic of Ireland where the occasional police officer you might see goes unarmed. These were the hopeful signs. The ``War Widow's'' journal is so moving.  I ask unanimous consent that I might put the whole article in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               A War Widow's Thoughts at Peace's Dawning                         (By James F. Clarity)       Belfast, Northern Ireland.--Pauline Hegney, the mother of      four young children whose husband was slain three and a half      years ago by Protestant paramilitaries on a Belfast street,      prays every day that the Government peace effort will work      and that there will be no more killings here in the name of      patriotism.       She is among the tens of thousands of survivors of the      3,172 Protestants and Roman Catholics who have been killed in      sectarian warfare here since 1969. She speaks with a soft      Ulster lilt and there is passion in her voice, but no hatred.       Her husband, Karl, an unemployed house painter, was gunned      down in the street on his way home from a pub. Both his widow      and the police say he had no involvement in the Irish      Republican Army. The police told her they had an idea who the      killers were, but no proof, she said. No one has been      arrested.       She was left with their four young children and a job at      the Europa Hotel in the city center, as head of the banquet      dining room staff. But the I.R.A. viewed the hotel as a major      economic target and bombed it frequently. The bombings often      shut it down, putting her out of work, sometimes for months.       The I.R.A. declares that it is fighting for Northern      Ireland's Catholics. Mrs. Hegney, who is Catholic, said she      prays for them, and for the Protestant guerrillas too.       She told her children that ``a sick man'' had killed their      father and that he was now in heaven with Granny, his mother.      Her daughter, Julie-Anne, said that at first she hated Granny      for taking him away and that she saw her father return to her      room one night. She said she wanted to die and go to heaven      with him. Lately Julie-Anne, who is not 8, says only, ``I      wish I could see him, mummy, for one wee minute.''       Mrs. Hegney joined a group of Catholic and Protestant      widows of guerrilla war victims, and they exchange their      feelings and problems.       But the cease-fires that have raised the hopes for peace      and for a normal life for most people in Northern Ireland      also left her and the other widows feeling depressed, she      said.       ``During the trouble, we were all in it together,'' she      said. ``Everyone in Belfast was affected. But when the peace      came, I felt isolated. Other people can get on with their      lives. We can't.''       Last October, as reports spread that the Protestant      guerrillas, following the lead of the I.R.A., were going to      call their own cease-fire, she hoped it would not be on Oct.      13, the third anniversary of her husband's killing, but it      was announced on that day.       ``It didn't feel right,'' she said. ``I was praying for      peace, but I didn't want it on that day.'' Now, she said, she      faces the prospect of seeing representatives of the      guerrillas become celebrated personalities as they approach      formal negotiations with the British and Irish Governments      and the other political parties in the North.       ``I don't like the idea that after they've killed so many      people, they'll be sitting down to say what the future will      be, when people like these destroyed my children's future.      But if it stops people being murdered, I've no objection.''       Her children still miss their father. Karl Jr., who is 14,      wants to be a lawyer. She said she asked him if he would      defend someone he knew to be guilty of a ``terrible crime.''      Karl said: ``Would you serve him if he came into      [[Page S3656]] the Europa. You do what you're paid to do.''      She shrugged.       ``I'll get through it,'' she said. ``I'm a struggler. I've      begun to write about it.''       In her account of the night her husband was killed, she      wrote: ``We never know what's to come for us, though, do we?      I put the boys to bed when their daddy went out. I went into      the kitchen and had a little laugh to myself when I saw the      saucepans sitting on the cooker. One was full of potatoes and      the other one had sprouts in it all ready for the Sunday. He      also had the roast cooked. I thought how organized my Karl      is.       ``A very curt male voice came on the phone saying he was a      police officer and asked if I could make my way to the police      station as my husband was in the hospital seriously ill. I      lost my mind at that moment and I don't think I have actually      found it all again.       ``The nightmare for me had only just begun. I went to see      Karl lying in that operating theater where he had died with      the doctors fighting to save his life. He lay there still and      cold, no life left in the body of the man who had taken the      core of me, loved me and made my life worth living. I thought      how could he leave me? What would I do without him? How was I      going to live without him?       ``I held Karl's hand and it was like holding the hand of a      wax dummy. It felt so strange. I didn't cry. I just asked him      to give me strength to get through the next few hours. I went      and sat at the top of the stairs waiting for the first of the      children to waken. I knew this would be our 5-year-old      daughter, Julie-Anne. She was wearing her little pink and      green pajamas and she still had her hair in pigtails from the      day before. She was just so beautiful.       ``What I was going to tell her was going to rob her of her      little innocent childhood. She came over to me with her wee      arms out and said, `Where's my daddy?' I sat her down on my      knee and told her that her daddy had gone up to heaven to see      his own mummy, her granny Nancy. `When's he coming back?' she      said. I explained to her that some sick man had shot her      daddy and that he had died and would not be coming back. She      had to blame somebody, God love her, so she started crying      and said she hated her granny.       ``I told our three little boys what had happened to their      lovely daddy. None of them spoke. Karl and Michael began to      cry. Mario just sat there. I think he was in deep shock. I      put my arms around all four of them and all but Mario cried      sorely for what we had lost.''
