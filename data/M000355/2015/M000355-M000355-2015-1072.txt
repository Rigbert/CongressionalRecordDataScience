 President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a very dear friend of mine who has sadly passed away. MAJ Ken Slye, retired from both the U.S. Army and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, died on June 24, 2015, at the Robley Rex VA Medical Center in Louisville. He was 81 years old.  Ken was a retired master Army aviator who did two combat tours in Vietnam, flying both Chinook and Huey helicopters. After his retirement from the Army, Ken was very active in the local Louisville military community as well as that of Fort Knox. He was a past chairman of the Louisville Armed Forces Committee; a four-times past president of the Louisville Chapter, Military Officers Association of America; a member of VFW 1170 Middletown; of the DAV; and of the American Legion G.I. Joe Post 244 in Jeffersontown.  Ken served on the Veteran Experience Board at the Robley Rex VA Medical Center, and in fact he and fellow veteran Carl Kaelin were instrumental in getting the medical center named after Kentucky's own World War I-era vet, Robley Rex. Ken was the recipient of the 2015 Louisville Armed Forces Patriot Award just this past May.  Ken was also heavily involved with professional tennis as an international chair umpire, and he served in the chair in matches all over the United States as well as the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Canada, Brazil, Japan, France, Argentina, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Jamaica. He began his officiating career in 1974 and was a graduate of the first professional tennis officials' school, in 1976 in Dallas. He chaired matches at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the French Open, and the Davis Cup.  Ken officiated in 16 matches with legendary player John McEnroe. Ken was the only Kentuckian to chair the final of a Grand Slam Tennis Tournament. He was the chair umpire for the classic 1980 U.S. Open Men's Singles Final between McEnroe and Bjorn Borg, watched on television by 20 million fans and 22,000 in the stands at Flushing Meadow. He was the chair umpire at the 1987 Wimbledon semi-final match between Stefan Edberg and Ivan Lendl. Other tennis legends Ken encountered during his career were Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, Ilie Nastase, and Jimmy Connors.  Born in Boston and raised in Wellesley, MA, Ken moved to Louisville because it was the hometown of his wife, Linda. He sang bass with the Louisville Thoroughbred Chorus for 4 years and served as its manager for 6 years. He served for 20 years with the Secretary of Defense's staff on top of his heroic service with the Army.  Ken is survived by his wife, Linda, as well as his son Scott Slye and daughter Susan Fabiano; his granddaughters Stacey Brandon and Audrey Ribley; his six great-grandchildren, Ashlynn, Will, Addison, Cooper, Scott, and Brystal; and Linda's son and daughter Jeff Furnish and Meg Furnish.  MAJ Ken Slye bravely served his country in uniform during a time of war, and he served his fellow veterans when he returned home. He will be greatly missed, not only by the military community throughout Kentucky but also by his many friends who knew and loved him.  I am proud to count myself among that group of friends. I relied on Ken's advice and friendship. I want to extend my deepest condolences to his family in their time of loss. The Commonwealth of Kentucky joins them in mourning this heroic man, patriot, and soldier.                          ____________________
