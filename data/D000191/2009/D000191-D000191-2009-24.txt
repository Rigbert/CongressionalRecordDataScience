  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, all across America unemployed Americans, struggling small businesses heaved a sigh of relief today because we know the recession is over. Goldman Sachs reported profits of $3.19 billion. They are on track to pay bonuses of over $20 billion, $700,000 average per employee. The recession is over for Goldman Sachs.  Of course, there is a little problem with this whole equation. Over the last year, they have received over $60 billion in taxpayer subsidies. Hmm, thathappens to be about five times their projected profits and three times what they are going to pay out in bonuses.  They got $13 billion from AIG after we gave AIG $80 billion to pay off bad debts. They changed into a bank-holding company magically, but are exempt from bank-holding company rules, and got another 50-or-so billion dollars of subsidies out of the Federal Treasury.  What a wonderful system this is. They are creating tremendous wealth. They are an engine of growth. They have recovered from the recession. All hail Goldman Sachs.                          ____________________
