 President, today the Senate passed by unanimous consent important legislation Senator Kyl and I sponsored that seeks to improve the United States' ability to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. This bill, S. 3205, the Counterterrorism Act of 2000--together with a Kyl-Feinstein amendment making a few technical changes--implements major recommendations from a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission on terrorism.  Let me describe what the bill would do. First, it urges that the U.S. government continue to take strong and effective actions to investigate the recent attack on the U.S.S. Cole and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice. The assault on the Cole is the worst against the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia killed 19 airmen in 1996. It is also the worst attack on a Navy ship since an Iraqi missile struck an American guided-missile frigate in 1987, killing 37 sailors.  Second, the bill requires the Department of Justice to review legal authority of federal agencies responsible for responding to a catastrophic terrorist attack and determine whether additional legal authority is necessary.  Third, the bill requires the president to establish a program for long-term research and development to counter catastrophic terrorist attacks and submit a report to Congress on this program. It also expresses the sense of Congress that there should be more long-term research and development in this area.  Fourth, the bill mandates that the attorney general issue a report on how to improve U.S. controls on biological pathogens and the equipment necessary to produce biological weapons, and requires the Health & Human Services secretary to issue a report on any appropriate actions that should be taken to protect against unlawful diversion of pathogens.  Fifth, the bill requires that the president establish a joint task force to develop a broad approach toward discouraging the fundraising activities of international terrorist organizations and that the task force issue a report.  Sixth, the bill requires the FBI to report on whether it can set up a central mechanism to distribute intelligence information it gleans about international terrorists to other members of the intelligence community.  Seventh, the bill directs the president to review the type of information shared by U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies as well as legal limitations on the sharing of this information. The president shall provide any recommendations regarding the sharing of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information between such agencies.  Eighth, the bill mandates that the CIA shall issue a report responding to the Commission on Terrorism's finding that the CIA should scrap a internal classified guideline requiring CIA agents to get approval from headquarters before recruiting unsavory individuals to act as informants about terrorism.  Ninth, the bill expresses the Sense of Congress that Syria and Iran should remain on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism.  Finally, the bill would ensure that federal counterintelligence personnel be fully reimbursed for buying insurance they purchase to protect themselves from liability if they are sued for their officially authorized activities. Currently, the government reimburses federal criminal law enforcement officers, supervisors, and management officials for one-half of their insurance expenses. These individuals purchase professional liability insurance because government representation may not be available to them.  However, FBI special agents and CIA officers who do counterterrorism work may not be reimbursed at all when they buy such insurance. This is particularly unfortunate because counterterrorism work is so risky--especially when the work occurs overseas. There can be few more dangerous tasks than infiltrating a terrorist cell in, say, Yemen or Afghanistan.  The Kyl-Feinstein Counterterrorism Act of 2000 is not a panacea for the problem of terrorism. Rather, it seeks to implement a number of specific improvements to our counterterrorism policy unanimously suggested by the Commission on Terrorism, a bipartisan group of experts.  The bill also lays the groundwork for a number of further improvements. We will be revisiting many of the issues covered by the bill in the next Congress once we receive more detailed information and recommendations from the Executive Branch. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and with the next Administration to implement S. 3205.  I believe that we need to take strong action to combat terrorism. There is no question that terrorist attacks willcontinue and that they will become more deadly. Terrorists today often act out of a visceral hatred of the U.S. or the West and seek to wreak maximum destruction and kill as many people as possible.  At the same time, I believe that our counterterrorism policy must be conducted in a way that remains consistent with our democratic values and our commitment to an open, free society.  In many ways, the Kyl-Feinstein Counterterrorism Act of 2000 is a counterpart bill to the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act that recently passed the Senate 95 to 0. That legislation, which I cosponsored, will make it easier for American victims of terrorism abroad to collect court-awarded compensation and ensure that the state sponsors of terrorism pay a price for their crimes.  While I strongly support assisting terrorist victims, I also believe that we need to do more to prevent Americans from becoming victims of terrorism in the first place. Thus, I am glad that the Senate has acted to pass S. 3205 with such dispatch. It is crucial to act now before terrorists strike again, killing and injuring more Americans and leaving more families grieving. I urge the House to pass S. 3205 before we adjourn.  In conclusion, I want to thank my good friend Senator Kyl for his tireless efforts to get this bill passed. His work, as always, has been invaluable.  I also thank my other colleagues for their assistance in helping us pass this bill. I know Senator Leahy, for instance, initially had a number of concerns with the legislation. I am grateful for the time he spent working through these issues with us, and I am glad that we can move this bill forward unanimously.                          ____________________
