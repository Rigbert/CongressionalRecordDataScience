Speaker, it is with great sincerity and admiration that I offer congratulations to several of Northwest Indiana's most talented, dedicated, and hardworking individuals. On Friday, July 28, 2006, the Lake County Electricians Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee, JATC, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the National Electrical Contractors Association will honor the class of 2006 at their annual Apprentice Completion Banquet, which will be held at the Avalon Manor Banquet Hall in Hobart, Indiana.  This year, the Lake County Electricians JATC will be recognizing and honoring the following graduates, who have completed the apprentice training: Nicholas Bacan, Daniel Boyd, Glen Britton, Nicholas Cardaras, Gonzaliev Castillo, Robert Coleman, James Crocker, David Delaney, Oliver Ewing, Jason M. Gallion, Nathan Gombus, Nathan Gonzales, Eric Hardesty, Jeremy Huber, Mark Jackson, Eric Kociara, Craig B. Konopasek,Travis Link, Jesus Luna, James Mola, William Parsons, David Petrashevich, Geoffery Richards, Elliot Rosenberry, John Santana, Jared Solan, Jonathan Steuer, Nicholas Vlasich, and Keith Winston.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These outstanding graduates all exemplify these traits. They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their commitment, hard work, and selfless sacrifice.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these committed, hardworking individuals. Along with the other extraordinary men and women of Northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have contributed in many ways to the growth and development of the economy in Indiana's First Congressional District, and I am very proud to represent them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
