Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend Mr. Pomeroy for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, people are suffering, people are barely getting by. Some people are using their retirement savings today to pay their credit card bills or to avoid foreclosure on their home. This is a choice people should not have to make. Today, we offer just a little bit of help.  Mr. Speaker, after a lifetime of hard work, people need to know that they can retire and their pensions will be there for them. This bill will help thousands of Delta employees who live and work in my district, thousands of pilots and airline workers, whose retirement savings slipped away when the airline went bankrupt.  The payments they are receiving through the bankruptcy agreement are not going to make up for that loss. This bill will allow these workers to take their bankruptcy payment and put their money into a retirement account. Pilots and airline workers are asking for this help so they can help put their money back where it belongs, growing into a nest egg for retirement.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Rangel and the great staff of the Ways and Means Committee and my own staff who worked with me to help pilots and airline workers in this bill today. We must do more to help people earn enough money and save enough money so they can live well when they retire. We must protect the hopes and dreams of America's workers.
