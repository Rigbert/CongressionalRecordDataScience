Chairman, listen, we all know what happened in Flint was a tragic failure at every level, and folks there are rightly tired of the finger pointing. They want answers.  Is it asking too much for the EPA to tell folks when lead levels are too high? I say no. This is why this very body passed the Kildee-Upton bill earlier this year, 416-2, that would force the EPA to alert families when lead levels are too high.  Is it asking too much for us to tackle this problem in a fiscally responsible manner? I say no. That is why we have a responsible solution right in front of us. This provision will be fully paid for when conferenced with the Senate.  Is it asking too much for our kids to have access to safe drinking water? I say no. I was just in Flint with my friend, Mr. Kildee. We ought to be focused on working together to get the job done.  Folks in Flint have been asking these questions for more than 2 years now. And you know what? They deserve answers, action, and results. It is time to stand up and deliver.
