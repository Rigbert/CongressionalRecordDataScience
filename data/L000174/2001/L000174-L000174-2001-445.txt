President, Dan Bryant is well-known to many of us, especially those of us serving on the Judiciary Committee. We knew him first as an able member of the House Judiciary Committee staff and through his work as the Chief Counsel of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, working under Chairman Hyde and Congressman McCollum. At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Hyde, Mr. Conyers, Senator Biden and both Senators from Virginia all came to testify on his behalf.  Mr. Bryant is respectful of the Senate and, I feel, all Senators. We are already working with Mr. Bryant as he is serving as a consultant to the Department while his nomination is pending. His history and current work give me every reason to support his nomination. I look forward to working with him in the days and months ahead. His is a most demanding job. I congratulate Dan and his family on his confirmation by the U.S. Senate.                      nomination of larry thompson
