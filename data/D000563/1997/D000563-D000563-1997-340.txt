This will be good news in Marianna, FL, where Pete Peterson is waiting for word on his new assignment. He has accepted the important assignment for this country. He has given so much more than any of us have ever been asked to give. And this new assignment to Vietnam is one that Pete takes very seriously.  My colleague and friend from Mississippi, the majority leader, has raised an important critical issue of the unaccounted for POWs and MIAs. I cannot think of a person who will take that responsibility more seriously than Pete Peterson, who knows men whom he served with in the Air Force and other branches who are not accounted for. And I am certain that he will work with diligence to try to establish their whereabouts to the satisfaction of their families as quickly as possible.  Of course, in terms of our relations with Vietnam, that debate will go on, and our relationship with that country will be decided based on the conduct of Vietnam toward the United States and vice versa. A man of Pete Peterson's stature I think will enhance that relationship, and I am confident that when he is called for consideration on Tuesday or Wednesday after we return, he will receive strong bipartisan support for this assignment.  I thank the majority leader for coming to the floor. I know he has a very busy schedule, but I consider this an important matter, as I am sure he does. I appreciate his cooperation. I thank my colleague from Arkansas for giving me this opportunity to speak first.  I yield back my time.
