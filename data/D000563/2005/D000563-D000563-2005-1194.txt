BOXER. That is the interesting question. Under Bill Clinton's administration, in the late 1990s, Carol Browner, the Administrator of EPA, stopped this kind of acceptance of these tests by the EPA.  Christie Todd Whitman agreed with her and stopped all of this and said EPA is not going to look at these. It is immoral. It is wrong.  It is only recently that this moratorium was allowed to lapse and the current Administrator--it is Leavitt, I think--started to accept these studies. So it is very recent.  Remember, we had two EPA Administrators who had said no to this. Now, suddenly we are back in the game of utilizing these studies and sending a signal out to the scientific world: Go ahead and do these dosing studies.
