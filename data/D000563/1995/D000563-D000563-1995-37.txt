Speaker, the reason we are here today in this session, in this House, in this city, is because of the failure of the Republican leadership to pass appropriation bills on time.  Mr. Speaker, now they come to us with a continuing resolution to keep government in business, but they add a kicker. They will not allow the Federal Government to stay in business unless we agree to raise Medicare premiums on the elderly by 25 percent.  Speaker Gingrich is determined to raise Medicare premiums to cut the Medicare program. That is his agenda. He has said to the President of the United States, ``We will not allow Government to stay in business, unless you will raise Medicare premiums.''  Mr. Speaker, we are counting on the President of the United States to veto this bill; to stand up for American families and America seniors. We can go ahead today and defeat the rule. We can defeat this CR, but the final judgment will come in the White House when the President is forced to veto this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I hope at that point that Speaker Gingrich will ease up on the elderly of this country and move forward to a bipartisan approach.
