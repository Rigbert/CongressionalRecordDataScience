 President.  Mr. President, this amendment that is being offered today by myself, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Landrieu is not unfamiliar to this body. In fact, the U.S. Senate has voted three times on the amendment that is now before us. Three times we have passed this amendment unanimously--once in the welfare bill, once in the budget bill, and once in the budget reconciliation bill. All three times when this amendment was brought before this body, not one Senator spoke against it. It was voted on and passed and sent to conference committee. Without one single voice of opposition and without one single vote of opposition, this amendment was stripped in the conference. Perhaps it is no surprise when you hear the subject of this amendment. It is regarding domestic violence.  Too often women in our country when it is in the light of day have everyone behind them and support them when it comes to domestic abuse. But these women know where abuse occurs. It occurs behind closed doors when no one is watching.  This Senate should not approve of that kind of action. This amendment is one that is absolutely vital to the health and welfare of women, their families, and the communities that surround them. The policemen are too often called to situations where a domestic violence incident is occurring, and their lives are then put on the line.  The amendment that we are offering today does a simple thing. It allows a temporary waiver of the work requirement for a victim of domestic violence in order for them to take care of their medical needs, to change their Social Security number, to take care to make sure that their children are in a safe place and that their family is secure before they are required to be at work. We know that, if a woman is being abused and she is required to be at work, her abuser will often go there to find her or put up barriers so she can't be there. She knows that her life is insecure if her abuser can find her at a workplace where she has to give her Social Security number, where she has to let them know where she is going to be. Where her children are in day care, she can't take care of them to make sure they are safe and secure.  That is why this humane and compassionate Senate three times has passed this amendment. It is a temporary waiver. We are not asking for a permanent waiver of the work requirements. In fact, we want women who are victims of domestic violence to be at work. Being economically able to take care of themselves is the security they need in order to leave a domestic violence situation. But we want to make sure that they aren't at work with bruises and don't show up at work and are afraid to show up at work with bruises. We want to be sure that their children are in a safe place, if they are victims of domestic violence, before we require them to be at work. We want them to be able to change their Social Security number so they can't be followed before we require them to be at work. Too often these things take months. Changing your Social Security number can often take months.  We in this Congress don't want to put these women in abusive situations inadvertently. This amendment simply is going to remove a barrier for women so that they can get out of the domestic violence situation. When a woman decides to get out of a situation, she has to know, ``Can I have the money? Can I have the ability to take care of my children, to take care of myself?''  Welfare allows her the ability to get out of that situation, to get herself back on her feet, and to get into the work force, which is exactly what she wants to do so she can be economically secure.  The way the welfare bill is written today, it does not allow her to do that.  When we passed this temporary waiver, we said to these women that we would give to States the ability to screen for domestic violence so that they will be allowed to help these women get on their feet and get back into the work force. We did that intelligently here in the Senate. In fact, it passed unanimously in the House as well. But when this amendment got behind closed doors, women were once again abused, and it was stripped from the bill.  It is absolutely essential that we put this law into the books so that the States across the Nation who are waiting to see what our action is can make sure that women who are abused are taken care of.  Today, the Children's Defense Fund has come out in support of this amendment, and I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Children's Defense Fund,                                                September 9, 1997.              CDF Supports Anti-Family Violence Amendment       Washington, DC.--The Children's Defense Fund (CDF)      announced its support today for the Victims of Family      Violence provision proposed by Senators Patty Murray (D-     Wash.) and Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) as an amendment to the      Senate Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education      Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1998.       The amendment allows states to temporarily waive certain      requirements of the 1996 welfare law for families that are      victims of domestic violence, even if their number exceeds      the law's 20 percent cap on exemptions to the time limit.       ``Mothers who have been threatened or battered need a safe      place for themselves and their children, and need support to      reenter the work force. The Victims of Family Violence      amendment makes it possible for states to offer that      protection and help to mothers and children,'' said Grace      Reef, Director of Intergovernmental Relations of the      Children's Defense Fund. ``Twenty-eight states have opted      under the 1996 welfare law to screen for family violence and      offer services to families affected. These and other states      need the clarification that this amendment provides to ensure      that families receive the help they need to escape immediate      danger and plan for their return to work.''       Studies by the Better Homes Fund and the University of      Massachusetts Medical Center and by the Taylor Institute in      Chicago have documented the prevalence of domestic violence      in the lives of women and children receiving public      assistance. Another study found that 55 percent of battered      women surveyed had been prevented from working by their      batterer (Shepard and Pence, 1988). More than half of      battered women responding to a survey said that they stayed      with their batterer because they did not feel they could      support themselves and their children (Sullivan, 1992).       ``The Victims of Family Violence amendment means safety for      children and their mothers while they take the steps      necessary to move on with their lives,'' said Reef.
