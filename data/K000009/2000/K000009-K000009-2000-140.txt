Chairman, I move to strike the last word, and want to continue a bit on this colloquy on the Asian Longhorned Beetle.  I, too, would like to join with the chairman of our subcommittee, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), and state that I will work in conference for increased funding for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service so it has the resources to effectively battle such invasive species as the Asian Longhorned Beetle, the citrus canker, and the Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter, among others.  And I want to say to our colleagues, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Blagojevich), that we know what leadership they have taken here in the Congress in bringing our attention to the problems that their home communities are facing. I hear that in New York City this week there have been additional sightings of the beetles near Central Park. And having traveled to New York and Chicago, I can only imagine your park directors and what they are going through, because we have no known predator for this creature. The only solution we have is to basically cut down the trees and burn them.  Of course, we know that these creatures came in in packing crates from China, both in the wood and in the cardboard inside, unfortunately; and we are now trying to take more precautions to fumigate those crates when they come in here, but this is a very, very serious problem. And because there is no known predator, adjacent States that have agricultural production, for example in maple sugar and maple syrup, those forests are threatened, those groves and stands of trees are threatened by this very same insect.  So we hear the concerns of both the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Blagojevich), and we will absolutely be bringing this to the attention of the conferees.
