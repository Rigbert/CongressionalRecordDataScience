President, I rise for a special request. I just returned from a military trip overseas with four other Members just a matter of minutes ago to find out that the two amendments that I was trying to get pending--and I would really settle for just one of those two. I was not here when all of these UCs were made and the arrangements were put together between the parties.  So I ask the leader on the other side--or the handler on the other side, Senator Jack Reed--if he would consider a waiver of his commitment to allow me to bring up one of these to get in the queue.  I yield to the Senator.
