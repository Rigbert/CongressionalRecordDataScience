 President, I am pleased to join with my colleague Senator Max Baucus in introducing the ``Medicare Cost-Sharing and Welfare Extension Act of 2005.''  This legislation extends the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, for 3 months and provides funding for 6 months of Transitional Medical Assistance, TMA, for familiesmaking the transition from welfare to work. As my colleagues know, H.R. 3672, which has been signed into law, would extend TANF until December 31, 2005, so this legislation represents a total extension of TANF until the end of March, 2006.  This is the twelfth extension of TANF and related programs. Welfare reform reauthorization should have been passed years ago. Too many families are languishing on the welfare rolls and we are seeing a backsliding of the improvements that we saw in the early years, after welfare reform. Child care funding has remained stagnant. States have been operating their welfare programs under a cloud of uncertainty regarding what a final Federal welfare reauthorization bill would require of them. We need to make some critical reforms to build on the success of the 1996 bill and give States the ability to manage and plan for their welfare programs. I am hopeful that this represents the final short-term extension of TANF and that the Congress will act quickly to pass a comprehensive welfare bill.  Additionally, this legislation includes a provision to extend cost-sharing assistance to qualifying individuals, QIs, for the Medicare Part B premium through September, 2006. This program has been helping vulnerable individuals with incomes between 120 and 135 percent of the Federal Poverty Level since 1997. It is estimated that the Part B premiums will cost a beneficiary $88.50 a month, an increase of $10.30 from the current $78.20 premium. For these low-income individuals, that represents a significant percentage of their monthly income. The President's budget includes a one year extension of the QI program.  Both the QI and TANF programs provide critical support to individuals and families with children who are in need--folks who otherwise might not be able to get healthcare services or make ends meet.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
