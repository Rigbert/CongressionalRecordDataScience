Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I would say to the gentleman that these are items that have been identified that need to be taken care of. As my colleague, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), mentioned just a few minutes ago dealing with airport security and aviation security, they have to be done.  Now, Members do not understand that in the absence of an authorizing bill, the appropriators are usually asked to take care of issues that have not been authorized, and so that is what we do, and we do that very well. We try to do it in cooperation with the authorizing committee, and we thought that we had a fairly good understanding not only on this but the aviation package as well.  So we understand the appropriate relationships of the committees, but sometimes the authorizing committees do not have a bill, do not have a vehicle, are not prepared to deal with a problem, and so the Committee on Appropriations is asked to do it.
