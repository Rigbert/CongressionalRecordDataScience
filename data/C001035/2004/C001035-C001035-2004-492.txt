President, I will not debate this amendment tonight. I wanted to alert our colleagues that this amendment represents the work of the Governmental Affairs Committee to reform and improve and strengthen the formula for the allocation of Homeland Security grant moneys. Our committee has held several hearings over the last 2 years on this issue. This legislation reflects the result of those hearings. It also parallels the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission,that the formula needs to be revised so that it is more of a threat-based formula.  We worked very hard to come up with a compromise on the committee. We maintained the minimum that each State would get to ensure that every State can respond to its preparedness needs. But we also rewrote the formula in recognition of the fact that some areas of our country, some States, are indeed high-threat areas.  This legislation represents a careful balance that reflects the membership of our committee, which includes both large-State Senators, such as Senator Levin of Michigan, and small-State Senators, such as Senator Carper of Delaware. Senator Levin, in particular, I recognize for his very hard work on revising the formula. As I said--and I see members of the leadership on the floor--we will not debate this at length tonight. I did want to send the amendment to the desk.
