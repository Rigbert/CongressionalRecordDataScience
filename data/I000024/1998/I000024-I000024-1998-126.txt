President, I want to be recognized for a unanimous consent request.  Before I do that, let me commend the junior Senator from Missouri. He is right on target. I would like to share with him that in the last 2 weeks I had over 20 town hall meetings in the State of Oklahoma. In not one meeting did anyone bring up this thing and initiate the discussion. I think this is really a beltway issue. When I brought it up and told them about the massive tax increase--the largest single tax increase, with the stroke of one pen that this results in--they were all very, very much against it. I think some people will try to use this as somehow a way to stop children from smoking when, in fact, it would not stop children from smoking.
