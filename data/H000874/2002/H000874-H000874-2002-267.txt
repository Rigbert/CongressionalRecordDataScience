Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This amendment is no different than the two amendments like it which we previously defeated. In fact, it is in essence exactly like the last amendment.  I tell my friend from Oklahoma that this is not about whether we are for or against civil rights. I take a backseat to no one in this institution in support of civil rights and human rights, here and around the world.  This is about making some speech more protected than other speech. The first amendment does not say that. Infact, it is the essence of the first amendment that all speech is protected, that no speech is more protected than any other, that there is no State-favored speech. This is about a bill which I suggest to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Watts) does not stop any speech, contrary to his representations.  Does it say under the rules that someone has to use hard money that is discloseable to make that speech on television and on radio? Yes, it does, and it treats all speech exactly the same. If it were not so, I suggest to the gentleman it would be unconstitutional.  The gentleman may take the position that, in fact, the bill is unconstitutional, and that will be argued clearly in the Supreme Court; but this is not about undermining civil rights speech, undermining speech about the second amendment, undermining speech, in fact, pursuant to the first amendment.                              {time}  1900  This is about reforming campaign finances.  And I will say to my friend that this amendment, like the other amendments, clearly is designed, in my opinion, to undermine and defeat campaign finance reform, not to protect civil rights speech, which is, in fact, protected under the first amendment, which is, in fact, protected under the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.  This amendment, like its predecessors, which were exactly alike, is unnecessary, unneeded, and ought to be opposed.
