Speaker, I rise today to honor and praise an individual in my district who has worked tirelessly in her community and devoted much of her time to helping others. This individual continually strives for excellence and is willing to take on any project that comes her way. Her abilities to succeed and make a difference are matched by her compassion and kindness. This dedicated individual is Beth King.  Beth King is a member of the Board of Directors for the Corona Regional Medical Center Foundation ands, as such, is co-manager of its gift shop where she oversees purchasing, merchandising, bookkeeping and coordinating the staff of volunteers. She is also very active in the community and participates in several organizations. She is a member of the American Cancer Society Board of Directors, the Settlement House Board of Directors where she serves as treasurer, and the Circle Club Rotary Club where she serves as the Board of Directors member who serves as the Community Service Director.  Her time and energy have been well spent as a dedicated leader in fundraising on several committees, such as the Corona Regional Medical Center Foundation which hosts the Annual Gala, co-chaired by Beth in 1997. For three years, Beth has co-chaired the American Cancer Society Dinner Dance and Auction. These events have become two of the largest in Corona.  I would like to thank Beth for her innumerable contributions in her community. I encourage her to continue in her efforts to make the city of Corona a better place and wish her the best of luck in all of her future endeavors.                          ____________________
