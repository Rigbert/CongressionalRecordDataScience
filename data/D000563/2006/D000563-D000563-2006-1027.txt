The Senator made it clear. He has two parts of this amendment. The first part is, frankly, an easy part. Is English the common, unifying language of our Nation? The answer is yes. His conclusion is that you can't succeed in America without being English proficient. If that's his amendment, that vote would be 100 to nothing.  It is the second part, the part you called the technical arguments, that we find troublesome. You said, in the course of explaining the amendment, that you didn't want to take away any existing rights of people in law, in courtrooms, for example, or going to vote, and I'm glad to hear that. But I want to ask you directly: Do you want to diminish any of the rights currently available to those living in our country under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on national origin?
