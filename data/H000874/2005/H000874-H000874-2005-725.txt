It is also my understanding, Mr. Leader, that although we will recess to the call of the Chair, it would be, as I understand it, the intention of the Chair not to recall the House until 9 p.m. tonight.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman's question, and that is the intention. But, hopefully, level heads will prevail, and maybe something will happen; lightning might strike and another agreement may be made.  Certainly we would not do anything without the distinguished whip's concurrence and okay, in consultation with him, and we will keep the whip advised if there is any unlikely reason for us to come back earlier than 9 o'clock.
