 President, I rise today to introduce important tax legislation for myself and Senators Jeffords, Conrad, Murkowski, Leahy, Wellstone, Chafee, Smith of Oregon, Breaux, Graham, Mack, Daschle, and Dorgan.  Our legislation extends the production tax credit for energy generated by wind. This proposed bill resembles bi-partisan legislation introduced in November of 1998 that, unfortunately, was not enacted.  As original author of the Wind Energy Incentives Act of 1993, I strongly believe that the expansion and development of wind energy must be facilitated by this production tax credit.
