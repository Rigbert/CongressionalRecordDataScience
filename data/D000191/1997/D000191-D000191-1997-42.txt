  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, remember the handshake, the handshake between Speaker Gingrich and President Clinton, June 11, 1995? The agreement that would go forward with campaign finance reform in this country at least?  Eight hundred and twenty-two days ago, $2.5 billion ago, untold scandals ago, they shook hands. Now what does the Speaker say? The Speaker says there is not enough money in the system; we should undo the few remaining reforms and protections we have.  The Republicans want to focus only on the Democrats' problems. The Democrats have problems. I admit it. The system is corrupt and corrupting for both sides of the aisle. That is true. But remember Simon Fireman, the vice chairman of Mr. Dole's Committee on Finance, was convicted of money laundering. He received a $6 million fine, pled guilty to 74 counts of laundering illegal contributions for the Republican Presidential candidate, and was sentenced to 6 months in jail. This is a problem on both sides of the aisle. We need campaign finance reform action now.                          ____________________
