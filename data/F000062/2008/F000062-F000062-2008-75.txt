 President, I rise to introduce the Imported Ethanol Parity Act of 2008.  This legislation is cosponsored by Senators Gregg, Cantwell, Allard and Collins.  First, let me explain what this bill does. The Imported Ethanol Parity Act instructs the President to lower the ethanol import tariff, so that it is no higher than the subsidy for blending ethanol into gasoline.  This legislation is necessary because the Farm Bill extended the tariff for two more years at $0.54 per gallon, even though the Farm Bill reduced the ethanol blending subsidy to $0.45 per gallon.  In effect, the Farm Bill has turned the tariff from an ``offset'' into a true trade barrier of at least $0.09 per gallon.  The Ethanol tariff poses many problems.  It increases the cost of Gasoline in the United States by making ethanol more expensive.  It prevents Americans from importing ethanol made from sugarcane. Sugar ethanol is the only available transportation fuel that works in today's cars and emits considerably less lifecycle greenhouse gas than gasoline;.  It taxes imports from our friends in Brazil, India, and Australia, while oil and gasoline imports from OPEC enter the United States tax free.  It hinders the emergence of a global biofuels marketplace through which countries with a strong biofuel crop could sell fuel to countries that suffered drought or other agricultural difficulties in the same crop year. Such a global market would permit mutually beneficial trade between producing regions and stabilize both fuel and food prices.  It makes us more dependent on the Middle East for fuel when we should be increasing the number of countries from whom we buy fuel. When it comes to energy security for the United States, which has less than 3 percent of proven global oil reserves and 25 percent of demand, we must diversify supply.  Bottom Line: until the tariff is lowered, the United States will tax the only fuel it can import that increases energy security, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and lowers gasoline prices.  In 2006 I introduced legislation to eliminate the ethanol tariff entirely, and in 2007 I cosponsored an amendment to the Energy Bill which would have eliminated the tariff.  The Imported Ethanol Parity Act is a different proposal that I believe addresses the concerns of tariff defenders.  The advocates of the $0.54 per gallon tariff on ethanol imports have always argued that the tariff is necessary in order to offset the blender subsidy that applies to the use of all ethanol, whether produced domestically or internationally. They argue that the ethanol subsidy exists to support American farmers who produce ethanol at higher cost than foreign producers.  For instance, on May 6, 2006, the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee stated on the Senate floor that, ``the U.S. tariff on ethanol operates as an offset to an excise tax credit that applies to both domestically produced and imported ethanol.''  On May 9, 2006, the Renewable Fuels Association stated in a press release: ``the secondary tariff exists as an offset to the tax incentive gasoline refiners receive for every gallon of ethanol they blend, regardless of the ethanol's origin.''  In a letter to Congress dated June 20, 2007, the American Coalition for Ethanol, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Corn Growers Association, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the National Sorghum Producers, and the Renewable Fuels Association stated that the ``(blender) tax credit is available to refiners regardless of whether the ethanol blended is imported or domestic. To prevent U.S. taxpayers from subsidizing foreign ethanol companies, Congress passed an offset to the tax credit that foreign companies pay in the form of a tariff.''  Just this month, the Renewable Fuels Association's Executive Director asserted that ``The tariff is there not so much to protect the industry but the U.S. taxpayer.''  Bottom Line: the tariff cannot be justifiably maintained at $0.54 per gallon if its intent is to offset a $0.45 per gallon blender subsidy, and it should be reduced.  Ethanol from Brazil or Australia should not have to overcome a trade barrier that no drop of OPEC oil must face.  Tariff defenders either should support this legislation or explain how a tariff can justifiably be higher than the subsidy it is designed to offset.  Climate Change is the most significant environmental challenge we face, and I believe that lowering the ethanol tariff will make it less expensive for the United States to combat global warming.  The fuel we burn to power our cars is a major source of the greenhouse gas emissions warming our planet. To reduce this impact, we need to increase the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and lower the lifecycle carbon emissions of the fuel itself.  For this reason, in March 2007, I introduced the Clean Fuels and Vehicles Act with Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins.  The legislation proposed a ``Low Carbon Fuels Standard,'' which would require each major oil company selling gasoline in the United States to reduce the average lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy in their gasoline by 3 percent by 2015 and by 3 percent more in 2020.  The legislation was modeled on the state of California's Low Carbon Fuels Standard, which also requires a reduction in the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels.  This concept became a major aspect of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, in which Congress required oil companies to use an increasing quantity of ``advanced biofuels'' that produce at least 50 percent less lifecycle greenhouse gas than gasoline.  Unfortunately the ethanol tariff puts a trade barrier in front of the lowest carbon fuel available, making it considerably more expensive for the United States to lower the lifecycle carbon emissions of transportation fuel.  The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of ethanol vary depending on production methods and feedstocks, and these differences will impact the degree to which ethanol may be used to meet ``low-carbon'' fuel requirements under California law and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  For instance, sugar cane ethanol plants use biomass from sugar stalks as process energy, resulting in less fossil fuel input compared to current corn-to-ethanol processes. By comparison, researchers at the University of California concluded that ``only 5 to 26 percent of the energy content (in corn ethanol) is renewable. The rest is primarily natural gas and coal,'' which are used in the production process.  The 2007 California Energy Commission Report entitled Full Fuel Cycle Assessment: Well-to-Wheels Energy Inputs, Emissions, and Water Impactsconcluded that the direct lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of imported sugar based ethanol are 68 percent lower than gasoline, while the direct lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn based ethanol from the Midwest are 15 to 28 percent lower than gasoline.  Further research released in 2008 suggests that the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn based ethanol may be higher than gasoline, when land use change is factored into the equation.  The bottom line: biofuels that protect our planet may be produced abroad, and we should not put tariffs in front of these fuels, while we import crude oil and gasoline tariff free.  Energy and food prices are both rising at unprecedented rates, and there is a great deal of debate about whether the renewable fuels standard mandating ethanol use is causing the problem.  I have always opposed corn ethanol mandates. But I remain concerned that the blending subsidy and the ethanol tariff have as much to do with rising corn prices as the ethanol mandate.  Corn ethanol production has considerably exceeded the renewable fuels standard every year since its adoption in 2005. With oil prices this high, it is profitable to produce ethanol at record corn prices with or without the mandate. The low value of renewable fuels standard credits, known as RINs, confirms that using ethanol is not a burden for oil companies.  To address the rising cost of corn, we have to address the underlying economics of corn ethanol production, and effectively increasing the tariff on imports, as the Farm Bill has done, is a step in the wrong direction.  This legislation corrects the Farm Bill's mistaken policy that imposed a real trade barrier on clean and climate friendly ethanol imports, giving gasoline imports a competitive advantage over cleaner fuel that simply should not exist at a time we are trying to combat climate change.  It prevents ethanol producers abroad from receiving American ethanol subsidies, which is supposedly the intent of the ethanol tariff.  I think it strikes the right balance, and I urge Congress to pass this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3080       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Imported Ethanol Parity      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) On May 6, 2006, the Chairman of the Finance Committee      of the Senate stated on the Senate floor that, ``the United      States tariff on ethanol operates as an offset to an excise      tax credit that applies to both domestically produced and      imported ethanol.''.       (2) On May 9, 2006, the Renewable Fuels Association stated:      ``the secondary tariff exists as an offset to the tax      incentive gasoline refiners receive for every gallon of      ethanol they blend, regardless of the ethanol's origin.''. In      May 2008, the Renewable Fuels Association's Executive      Director asserted that ``The tariff is there not so much to      protect the industry but the United States taxpayer.''.       (3) In a letter to Congress dated June 20, 2007, the      American Coalition for Ethanol, the American Farm Bureau      Federation, the National Corn Growers Association, the      National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the National Sorghum      Producers, and the Renewable Fuels Association stated that      the ``(blender) tax credit is available to refiners      regardless of whether the ethanol blended is imported or      domestic. To prevent United States taxpayers from subsidizing      foreign ethanol companies, Congress passed an offset to the      tax credit that foreign companies pay in the form of a      tariff.''.       (4) The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, as      contained in the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 2419 in      the 110th Congress, proposes to decrease the excise tax      credit for blending ethanol from $0.51 to $0.45 per gallon,      but extend the $0.54 per gallon temporary duty on imported      ethanol, increasing the competitive disadvantage of ethanol      imports in the United States marketplace. The legislation      would transform a tariff designed to offset a domestic      subsidy into a real import barrier of at least $0.09 per      gallon.       (5) The State of California is adopting a Low Carbon Fuels      Standard that requires a reduction in the lifecycle      greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels, and the      Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires the      United States to use increasing quantities of ``advanced      biofuels'' that have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that      are at least 50 percent less than lifecycle greenhouse gas      emissions from gasoline.       (6) The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of ethanol vary      depending on production methods and feedstocks. These      differences will impact the degree to which ethanol may be      used to meet ``low-carbon'' fuel requirements under      California law and the Energy Independence and Security Act      of 2007.       (7) Sugar cane ethanol plants use biomass from sugar stalks      as process energy, resulting in less fossil fuel input      compared to current corn-to-ethanol processes.       (8) The 2007 California Energy Commission Report, entitled      ``Full Fuel Cycle Assessment: Well-to-Wheels Energy Inputs,      Emissions, and Water Impacts'', concluded that the direct      lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of imported sugar based      ethanol are 68 percent lower than gasoline, while the direct      lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn based ethanol from      the Midwest are 15 to 28 percent lower than gasoline.       (9) The cost to ship ethanol by sea from foreign production      areas to California is competitive with the cost to ship      ethanol by rail from the American Midwest, according to      ethanol producers and importers.       (10) Ethanol production will vary from region to region      each year based on crop performance, and a global biofuels      marketplace would permit mutually beneficial trade between      producing regions capable of stabilizing both fuel and food      prices.       (11) In March 2007, the United States and Brazil entered      into a strategic alliance to cooperate on advanced research      for biofuels, develop biofuel technology, and expand the      production and use of biofuels throughout the Western      Hemisphere, especially in the Caribbean and Central America.       (12) On March 9, 2007, President Bush stated ``it's in the      interest of the United States that there be a prosperous      neighborhood. And one way to help spread prosperity in      Central America is for them to become energy producers.''.       (13) According to a February 2008 study by the      Massachusetts Institute of Technology, titled ``Biomass to      Ethanol: Potential Production and Environmental Impacts'',      the current ethanol distribution system in the United States      is not capable of efficiently supplying ethanol to the East      Coast markets.     SEC. 3. ETHANOL TAX PARITY.       Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of      this Act, and semiannually thereafter, the President shall      reduce the temporary duty imposed on ethanol under subheading      9901.00.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United      States by an amount equal to the reduction in any Federal      income or excise tax credit under section 40(h), 6426(b), or      6427(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and take any      other action necessary to ensure that the temporary duty      imposed on ethanol under such subheading 9901.00.50 is equal      to, or lower than, any Federal income or excise tax credit      applicable to ethanol under the Internal Revenue Code of      1986.                                 ______                                       By
