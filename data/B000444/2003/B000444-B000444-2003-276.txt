 President, I am pleased once again to join my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, to talk about a bill that will help American families afford their children's college tuition. The bill we are reintroducing today, the Make College Affordable Act, will make up to $12,000 in college tuition tax deductible each year, while providing graduates with a tax credit to reduce the cost of their student loans.  With the average college graduate earning 80 percent more than the average non-college, high school graduate, it is abundantly clear that in today's economy a college degree is an absolute necessity. When I went to college, it cost about $1,000 a year. That meant, for a family making about $12,000 a year, the cost of college was about 6 or 7 percent of that family's income. Today the average cost of room, board and tuition at a four-year public college has jumped to over $9,000 a year. The average cost of room, board and tuition at a private four-year college has jumped to over $25,000. What does this mean? This means that hard working American families are spending a larger percentage of their income than ever before to send their children to school. To attend my alma mater, the University of Delaware, it costs nearly 20 percent of a Delaware family's average annual income to cover costs. If that same family wants to send their child to a private university, approximately 50 percent of their income is required. This means that the average American family is likely to spend just as much, if not more, on their child's tuition as they are to pay in annual mortgage payments.  I have said it before. How can we expect families to dream of a better and brighter future for their children, when the cost of attending even some public universities rivals their home mortgage payments? We can't.  That is why in 1995, I first offered an amendment to permit a $10,000 tuition tax deduction. That is why in 1996 and 1997, I introduced my GET AHEAD bill which would have provided students and their families with scholarships, tax deductions, and college savings plans. We've made some good progress. A number of initiatives were incorporated into the 1997 tax bill. Today families have available to them the Hope Scholarship--a tax credit of up to $1,500 for the first two years of college, and the Lifetime Learning Credit--which permits a 20 percent tax credit on up to $10,000 worth of higher education expenses. Students can also claim a tax deduction for interest on student loans, have the opportunity to consolidate their student loans at low interest rates and beginning in 2001, have had the chance to deduct up to $3,000 in tuition expenses from their Federal income tax.  And yet, we can and should do more to help qualified students attend the college of their dreams. This is why I introduced my Tuition Assistance for Families Act in January. This bill would expand current tuition tax credits, provide merit scholarships to graduating seniors, increase the maximum Pell Grant and raise the tuition tax deduction much like the bill before us today.  I join my friend from New York today to introduce the Make College Affordable Act because it will allow most taxpayers to take up to a $12,000 tax deduction each year for college tuition and fees. For some families this would amount to a tax savings of more than $3,000 each year--$3,000 that can go toward their children's doctor visits, retirement savings, child care costs and yes, toward their annual mortgage payment.  In addition to the tax deduction, the Schumer-Biden bill will provide a tax credit of up to $1,500 for the interest paid on student loans over the first five years of repayment. This credit will be available to individuals with incomes of up to $50,000, and families with incomes up to $100,000. When one considers that the average graduate is $16,928 in debt, you can imagine how quickly interest payments add up each year.  We are hearing a great deal these days about tax cuts. How we choose to provide them, and who we choose to provide them to, is a reflection of our nation's priorities and values. What greater priority could there be than providing our children with a first class education. Let's be smart about our investments when considering the tax proposals that come before us. Let's help families provide their children with a better life through the promise of a college education. And let's not forget that the Make College Affordable Act will not only ensure a brighter future for all our children, it will help to guarantee an educated and prosperous America down the road.                                 ______                                       By
