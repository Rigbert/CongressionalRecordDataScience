Speaker, I stand before you today to appropriately draw attention to the contributions of our nation's prestigious Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and their proud tradition of educating and preparing African-Americans for the past 166 years.  This year, we celebrate these universities the week of September 14 to September 20, and I feel honored to participate in such a noble cause.  Over 100 Historically Black Colleges and Universities have been established in the United States. These institutions comprise only 3 percent of all centers for higher education in the United States, but account for 30 percent of bachelor's degrees awarded to African Americans each year.  I am very proud that Bowie State University, the oldest of Maryland's four HBCUs is located in my district and I am privileged to represent the students, faculty and staff members who make great things happen on this campus. (There are three other HBCUs in MD--Morgan State in Baltimore City, Coppin State in Baltimore and the University of Maryland--Eastern Shore). Bowie State is the descendant of the first school opened by the Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of Colored People in 1865. BSU rightfully boasts a number of significant and praiseworthy statistics:  First nationally in graduating African Americans with master's degrees in computer science and information sciences;  Second nationally in graduating African Americans with master's degrees in psychology;  Third nationally in graduating African Americans with master's degrees in communications; Eighth, nationally in graduating minorities with master's degrees in psychology;  Fourth among HBCUs in granting master's degrees of all disciplines;  Fourth in extramural funding in the University System of Maryland (USM) with the highest percentage of increase in the System (48.1 percent) for the 2000-2001 fiscal year.  Ninth nationally in graduating all minorities with master's degrees in communications;  Thirteenth nationally in graduating African Americans with master's degrees;  Additionally, in 1995 BSU won an 11-year, $27 million award from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/National Science Foundation to become one of the six national Model Institutions of excellence in science, engineering, and mathematics.  HBCUs provide a vital role in educating the next generation of our nation's leaders by extending to our students access to the best opportunities for personal and professional success. Most important, these schools champion the cause of equal access to education, access that is critically important during a time when fiscal constraints have burdened our state and ultimately our families, making affording higher education even more difficult for many Americans.  In fact, the Maryland Higher Education Commission recently announced that the number of Maryland college students on a waiting list for state-sponsored financial aid increased almost 50 percent this fall--at the same time, tuition and the number of college applicants has increased. Last school year 133,692 Marylanders filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the nationwide form that determines aid eligibility. That was up from 118,537 applications from Maryland in the 2001-2002 school year, a 12 percent increase.  Many historically black institutions are facing similar financial challenges, and regrettably, for some, closing has become a reality. The federal government must realize that Historically Black Colleges do not simply provide educational opportunities and benefits to African Americans, but educating our nation's young people, regardless of race, improves the aptitude of all of our people. The entire country has gained from these fine institutions of education, and with the help of the federal government, the youth of our nation will continue to be well educated for generations to come.  Congress and the President can acknowledge this by adequately funding the programs that support the efforts of these important institutions. The House of Representatives included $224 million in funding for the Strengthening Historically Black Colleges program and the Strengthening HBCU Graduate Institutions for fiscal year 2004. This is a $10 million increase in funding from last year, and as a member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations. Subcommittee, I will continue to support these programs and will fight for increased funding to help them continue their mission and tradition of educating African-Americans.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me this week in saluting the contributions of America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which have been educating students for more than 100 years. I am grateful to the nation's HBCUs for their commitment to academic excellence for all students, including low-income and educationally disadvantaged students, and am especially proud of the four HBCUs in the state of Maryland.                          ____________________
