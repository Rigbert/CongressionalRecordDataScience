 President, prior to our cloture vote on the FSC/ETI bill, I read a list of some products that, if they are going to be shipped out of the United States and exported to Europe, are going to have, right now, a 5-percent tariff added to them because of European retaliation against the United States because we have not passed this legislation yet. That is going to cause jobs to be lost. That tariff is going to go up, over the course of the next 12 months, 1 percent every month, to 17 percent.  I will be a little bit more specific in how some of those products and the manufacturers of those products, or the producers of those products, will be affected.  In jewelry manufacturing, we would have $2 billion in annual exports being jeopardized. Ninety-five percent of jewelry manufacturers are small businesses, so obviously it would have a huge potential impact on jobs. Folks such as Stamper Black Hills Gold in South Dakota are targeted, as one example of jewelry manufacturing.  Racehorses: The average value of U.S. exports of racehorses is about $100,000. At 5 percent, that is an extra $5,000 cost to our exports. By the end of the year, it will be an extra $14,000 on average. For high-value horses, it will be several times more. These sanctions would impact States such as New York, California, Florida, and Maryland. In the area of dairy, we will have sanctions on cheese exports impacting States such as Wisconsin, Vermont; fruits and vegetables, California; citrus fruits, peppers, Florida, and tomatoes, as an example.  I could go on and on, but I will include for the Record a list beyond what I have just referred to. We have over 500 items that have been targeted already with sanctions on them. I ask unanimous consent to print that information in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               TABLE I.--SUMMARY OF EU RETALIATION ON U.S. EXPORTS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                  U.S. share    HS                       Number of     EU imports from     EU imports from   of total EU      U.S. States Chapter     Description    products on     the U.S. ($)        the World ($)      imports         impacted                                list                                              (percent)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------           Total targeted          1608      $2,987,104,667    $105,286,944,000         2.84            products.71.......
