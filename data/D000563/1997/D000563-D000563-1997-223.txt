President, I might say to my colleagues in the Senate this amendment seeks to right a wrong. It seeks to provide food stamp coverage for the children of legal immigrants to the United States. The welfare reform bill cut off food stamp protection for children--deserving qualified children--and really relegated over 200,000 children across the United States into a position where they do not have adequate nutrition.  It does not do our Nation a bit of good to deny these children food at a moment in their lives when it is important to their development. These kids are likely to become American citizens. They are likely to be our neighbors. They are likely to be our future workers.  Let us resolve that although we are trying to eradicate welfare as we know it, we will not take it out on the kids. The money that is used to pay for the food stamps for the children of these legal immigrants is an offset that comes from the administrative costs sent to the States. This is money that should be dedicated for the better purpose of feeding hungry, deserving children.  I ask my friends, regardless of your position on welfare reform, to make sure that we are dedicated in America to healthy children, not hungry children. I hope you will consider voting to waive the provisions of the Budget Act and approval of this amendment.
