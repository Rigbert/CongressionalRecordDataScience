 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant and all its workers, past and present, on the occasion of the facility's upcoming 50th anniversary, which will be celebrated by the Paducah community on October 24th.  The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant is currently the only operating uranium enrichment facility in the United States. Production of enriched uranium began in Paducah in 1952, and the plant has operated continuously since that time. Until 1964, the plant's output was almost entirely for the purposes of national defense as it produced fissionable material for our country's nuclear arsenal. The Paducah workers during that period played a vital role in securing our freedom and helped America prevail in the cold war. Unfortunately, the Federal Government didn't always do right by the workers, who were often exposed to hazardous conditions and materials which would later sicken and even kill some. Even today, we are still working to correct this shameful injustice.  After 1964, Paducah production began shifting to enriched uranium for commercial nuclear reactors; helping to provide the benefits of cleanly generated electric power to millions of people. After 1973, Paducah no longer enriched uranium for military purposes. However, the plant continues to help create a more secure world as the U.S. recipient for nuclear materials from the former Soviet arsenal. Under the Megatons to Megawatts program, nuclear weapons are dismantled in Russia and the nuclear material is shipped to Paducah where it is repackaged and shipped worldwide for civilian electric power production.  Over the last half century, a number of companies have operated the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Company, (later Union Carbide) was the original operator of the plant. Successor operators included Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, and finally United States Enrichment Corporation, which took over direct operation of the plant in 1999, and continues as the operator today. Today 1,500 workers are employed at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. What is remarkable is that despite the past sins of the Federal Government, these employees remain dedicated to their jobs and the important work they perform every day. It is a testament to those individuals in particular and this region in general.  In addition to the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant itself, an entire complex of supporting plants were built to support enrichment activities at Paducah. Two electric generating plants were constructed to supply the large power demands of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. These were the TVAShawnee Steam Plant in western McCracken County, Kentucky, and the EEI plant in Joppa, Illinois. Additionally, a uranium hexaflouride plant was constructed in Metropolis, IL. Together, these four facilities comprise the economic and industrial heart of the region.  In recent years, we have learned that there were often risks associated with work at Paducah, particularly during the earlier years of its operation. Some workers were exposed to cancer-causing chemicals and radiological hazards. Many of these workers have now benefited from the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, which I am proud to have helped bring into existence. Working alongside the union representing the workers, I have also fought to make sure that medical screening is available to all workers so that they may be tested and treated for any problems they incur as a result of working at the plant. We have also embarked upon the task of cleaning up some of the legacy waste materials left on the site. The Department of Energy's recently announced DUF6 conversion plant will be a huge step in this direction, as it will clean up thousands of cylinders of depleted uranium hexaflouride which have been stored on the site for decades. The conversion plant additionally will add new jobs to the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant complex.  While significant challenges lie ahead for America's domestic uranium enrichment industry, it is appropriate to pause on this occasion to commemorate the Golden Anniversary of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, and the dedicated service of all the employees over the last half century. The workers at Paducah today continue the fine tradition of service, commitment, and productivity. I am sure they are up to any future challenge to be met in keeping a viable domestic uranium enrichment capability.                          ____________________
