President, today I am introducing legislation to require parental consent for intrusive physical exams, genital exams, administered under the Head Start program.  Young children attending Head Start programs should not be subjected to these invasive exams without the prior knowledge or consent of their parents. While the Department of Health and Human Services has administered general exam guidelines to agencies, the U.S. Code is not clear about prohibiting them without parental consent. My bill will clarify the Code by not allowing any non-emergency invasive genital exam by a Head Start agency without parental consent.  As a father and grandfather, I believe it is vital for parents to be informed about what is happening to their children in the classroom. I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this important bill.                                 ______                                       By
