 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:15 a.m., on Wednesday, January 22. I further ask unanimous consent that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume consideration of H.J. Res. 2, the appropriations bill, as under the previous order.
