 President, I rise humbly to pay tribute to Officers Jacob Chestnut and Special Agent John Gibson--and all of their fellow Capitol Police officers and law enforcement officers across the nation and world.  As I filed past the bodies of our slain officers in the rotunda this morning, I was overwhelmed by the sacrifice they made to protect us, our families and fellow citizens. So many times, we take law enforcement for granted because we see them every day monitoring entrances, patrolling the Capitol, just being there. And, thankfully, we don't often see events like the tragedy that occurred on Friday.  But events like those on Friday do happen. They happen every day across this great nation. Law enforcement officers sacrifice their lives so we can live more safely and freely. Every time that happens, I remember the commitment they have made and I thank them.  When such madness strikes at our nation's symbol of democracy, it should remind us even more that freedom comes at a price. Our citizens and people of all lands are welcome to visit our capitol and participate in the democracy that they help sustain. They can watch Members of Congress undertake the people's business from the galleries above the two house chambers. They can visit us in our offices. They can visit sacred monuments and historic sites.  Just last Wednesday, at a coffee I held for visiting constituents from Washington State, one tourist exclaimed how impressed she was with the accessibility of the Capitol, with the openness of the process and the ability to meet and see her Senator and Representatives. I agreed that we have a wonderful system and I praised her for taking advantage of that openness and participating in our great democracy.  But we have defenders of this democracy and openness. Those men and women are our police officers who try to find that perfect balance of an open society and a safe society. Sometimes that balance means lives are sacrificed to protect those noble goals.  My thoughts and prayers are with the families of Officer Chestnut and Special Agent Gibson. This is such a tragedy. As I have read about their lives and families and commitment to their communities, their sacrifice was made even more real. They are true heroes.  So, I thank them and I thank the Capitol Police. I honor their service. I will use this tragedy to make sure I remember the tremendous commitment our law enforcement officers have made to us: To keep us as safe and when we are in danger, to lay down their lives for us.             Tribute to Slain Officers Chestnut and Gibson
