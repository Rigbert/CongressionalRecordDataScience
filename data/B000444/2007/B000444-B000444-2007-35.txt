5 billion.                      Amendment No. 3142 Withdrawn  Mr. President, I would obviously prefer that it be put here. But I tell you, if there has ever been appropriate use of the expression someone's word is ``as good as gold,'' it is about my friend from Hawaii. I am happy to withdraw the amendment.
