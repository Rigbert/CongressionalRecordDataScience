Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, the leadership of the pro-abortion movement are highly skilled and extraordinarily savvy in masking the violence and cruelty to baby girls and boys killed by abortion and the harmful effects to women. Nobody muddies the water like they do. That leadership has now been exposed once again by one of its own as a fraud. And to think they almost got away with it again.  Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, has publicly confessed that he, ``Lied through his teeth'' when he told a TV interviewer, according to the New York Times, that partial-birth abortion was used rarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged.                              {time}  1345  It seems I heard a lot of my colleagues say that in the last debate on this matter. According to the AMA News and the New York Times, Mr. Fitzsimmons now says that his party line defense of this method of abortion was a deliberate lie and that in the vast majority of cases the procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or more along.  Mr. Fitzsimmons says that the abortion folks knew it, which means the whole antibaby gang deliberately tried to deceive us all and the Nation. And they almost got away with it.  Interestingly, he also said the antiabortion people, the pro-lifers, we knew it as well, and we did, and we said it on this floor. Unfortunately, there were very few who listened when we pointed out these facts.  As a matter of fact, most in the media believed and amplified as true the falsehoods and lies put out by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the ACLU, NARAL, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, NOW, the NationalRepublican Coalition for Choice, People for the American Way, Population Action International, Zero Population Growth and others who signed letters that went to my office and yours, one of them on October 25, 1995 that said, ``This surgical procedure is used only in rare cases, fewer than 500 per year, and most often performed in the case of wanted pregnancies gone tragically wrong.''  We know that is not true. It is a lie. We know that these groups have lied to us, and it is not the first time, Mr. Speaker, that these groups have lied to us.  Dr. Bernard Nathanson, the former abortionist who did thousands of abortions and one of the founders of NARAL, has said that lying and junk science were and continue to be commonplace in the pro-abortion movement. It is the way they sell abortion to a gullible public. Dr. Nathanson has said that in the early days they absolutely lied about maternal mortality, they lied about the number of illegal abortions, they lied and said that there is no link between abortion and breast cancer, and there is a link, and they lie about the so-called safety of abortion, and of course, the big lie on partial-birth abortion has been exposed for everybody in this Chamber to see. The procedure is not rare. It is common. It is common, and it is used with devastating consequences on both the mothers as well as on the babies.  Remember last year several of you took to the floor and said that anesthesia caused fetal demise. That falsehood was blown right out of the water as well as another big lie that was used by my friends on the other side of the aisle and on this side of the aisle and spoon fed to you in fact sheets and talking points by the pro-abortion lobby. The president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Dr. Noring Ellison came forward and testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 17, 1995 and said:       I believe this . . . to be entirely inaccurate. I am deeply      concerned, moreover, that the widespread publicity given to      Dr. McMahon's testimony may cause pregnant women to delay      necessary and perhaps life-saving medical procedures, totally      unrelated to the birthing process, due to misinformation      regarding the effect of anesthetics on the fetus.       In my medical judgment, it would be necessary--in order to      achieve neurological demise of the fetus in a partial-birth      abortion--to anesthetize the mother to such a degree as to      place her own health in serious jeopardy.       I have not spoken with one anesthesiologist who agrees with      Dr. McMahon's conclusion, and in my judgment, it is contrary      to scientific fact. It simply must not be allowed to stand.  Remember all this when Planned Parenthood, which performs or refers for 230,000 abortions each year, lobbies you and plies you with talking points and fact sheets. They simply are not to be trusted--even their ideological soulmates in the government and media should have serious doubts about these groups' credibility.  These same pro-abortion groups--many of which get huge Federal, State, and local government subsidies--also wrote us that, ``lawmakers . . . have no place . . . in the operating room.''  But unless you construe an unborn baby to be a disease or tumor, it is the abortionists who have turned the operating room into an execution chamber.  Like some deranged horror movie doctor who dresses well and looks respectable on the outside, the abortionist in these execution rooms partially delivers a helpless child, only to thrust a pair of scissors into the baby's head so a suction device can vacuum out his or her brains.  This is madness. This is inhumane. And lawmakers should not shrink from our moral responsibility to stop it.
