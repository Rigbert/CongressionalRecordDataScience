Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 4068, as amended, the Robert J. Dole Department of Veterans Affairs Medical and Regional Office Center.  Mr. Speaker, American history is filled with men and women who have made great sacrifices and performed great services on behalf of our Nation. It is one of the privileges that we in the House and Senate, the Congress, have to be able to recognize these individuals before our fellow countrymen and for all future generations. One such American worthy of honor is former soldier and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.  Bob Dole was probably one of the best known World War II veterans. As a young officer in the famed Tenth Mountain Division, he was severely wounded during fighting in Italy and spent 3 years in Army and Veterans Administration Hospitals recovering. He was permanently disabled with a shattered shoulder; yet by his personal courage and persistence, he overcame a boatload of crushing obstacles. He went on to become a national leader as a United States Senator, he was a presidential candidate, and a tireless advocate for veterans and the disabled.  So it is extremely fitting that in his home State of Kansas, the VA facility in Wichita be named the Robert J. Dole Department of Veterans Affairs Medical and Regional Office Center.  I would especially commend the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran), who is the author of the bill, to honor Bob Dole. The gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran) is chairman, as we know, of the Subcommittee on Health of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs; and I am very proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill, which he has spoken about with great eloquence earlier.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my team.
