 President, I ask unanimous consent that if the Senate receives the papers for H.R. 3236, that at 1:45 p.m. on Thursday, July 30, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3236; that the bill be read three times and the Senate vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate; that there be a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for passage of the bill; and that following passage of the bill, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
