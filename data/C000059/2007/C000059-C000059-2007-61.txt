Riverside County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Dr. David Long is one of these individuals. On Thursday, May 24, 2007, Dr. Long will be honored at a farewell dinner at the Riverside Convention Center.  Dr. Long is originally from Mason City, Iowa, and obtained is Ph.D. from Iowa State University. Over the years, Dr. Long has served as a classroom teacher, coach, principal, and district superintendent. He was elected Riverside County Superintendent of Schools in 1998. The Riverside County Office of Education (RCOE) has 2,000 employees and a budget totaling more than $260 million. RCOE is a service agency supporting the county's 23 local districts with training, fiscal support, and certain state mandated educational programs.  The Riverside County Office of Education has been dramatically improved by Dr. Long's innovation and dedication to excellence. Under his leadership, RCOE created the nationally recognized Riverside County Achievement Teams (RCAT), which have helped Riverside County outpace the state in improving test scores, and focused attention on specific issues that create problems for students.  Dr. Long has been active in both state and national arenas, serving as the President of the California County Superintendents Educational Services Association (CCSESA), and chairing the national Safe and Drug Free Schools and Community Advisory Committee for the U.S. Department of Education.  Dr. Long has been honored as California Administrator of the Year by the National Organization of Partners in Education, Superintendent of the Year, and received the Governor's Award for school leadership. Dr. Long received the Inland Empire 2003 Entrepreneur of the Year award for his innovative approach to raising student achievement through the Riverside County Achievement Teams. Dr. Long is also the recipient of the prestigious Marcus Foster Memorial Award from the Association of California School Administrators for outstanding leadership and significant contributions to public education by a school administrator.  Dr. Long was recently selected by Gov. Schwarzenegger to serve as California's Secretary of Education and the Governor could not have picked a more qualified individual. Dr. Long's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside and the entire State of California. Dr. Long has been the heart and soul of Riverside County education and he will be sorely missed. I know that so many community members and leaders are grateful for his service and salute him as he moves on to the next stage of his career On behalf of Representatives Lewis, Bono and Issa, I also add my expression of admiration and appreciation to Dr. Long for his outstanding service to our children and our community. We wish him the best of luck and all blessings in his new position.                          ____________________
