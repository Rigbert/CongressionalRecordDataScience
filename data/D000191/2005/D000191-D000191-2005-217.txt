Speaker, it has been nearly a year since the President signed the secretly negotiated CAFTA agreement and has begun the process to bring it forward to the House for an up-or-down vote. No amendments allowed. It is a perfect agreement, of course.  It is only perfect in that it mirrors all of our most recent failed trade agreements, such as its predecessor, NAFTA.  Some would say this is about helping the American economy, putting Americans to work, to help our exporters. That is what they said about NAFTA. And it turned out that the people of Mexico, the aggregate buying power of everybody in Mexico who spent every peso on American goods was slightly less than the State of New Jersey. It was never about the purchasing power of the people of Mexico and the idea that somehow they were going to buy American goods and put Americans to work here at home. It was always about United States capital, multinational corporations, chasing cheaper labor into Mexico and now further into Latin America; chasing lack of environmental standards and enforcement into Mexico, particularly the maquiladora area, which is a total environmental nightmare, further into Latin America; in chase of the lowest standards, the lowest common denominator, the most abused labor.  And that is what CAFTA is all about. It mirrors the NAFTA agreement. Like the NAFTA agreement, it will deliver the same thing. They told us we would gain 140,000 jobs with NAFTA. Well, we lost close to half a million jobs because of NAFTA. CAFTA will be the same.  When we are doing something that is failing the Nation and the Nation's workers and driving down wages here at home and trying to pull down our standards of consumer protection, environmental protection, labor standards, then maybe it is time to think about doing something different, and perhaps the House of Representatives is on the verge of doing that. Perhaps they are beginning to listen to the large majority of the American people. We are going to run a trade deficit this year of $2 billion a day.                              {time}  2045  Every billion dollars represents tens of thousands of lost jobs, the export of our industrial base, and, now, the export of our knowledge base.  We cannot continue these same failed policies as the President would have us do. I have heard that they have begun the purchasing phase of the CAFTA agreement.  Now, most Americans would wonder, what is the purchasing phase? Well, they have tried the strong-arm phase for the last year. They still do not have enough votes to jam another failed trade agreement through the United States House of Representatives. So I am told by friends on the other side of the aisle that they are about to begin the purchasing phase.  The White House is open for business. What do you need? How much does it cost? What can we do for you? It is not any argument that this is somehow going to deal with our trade deficit, help raise wages here at home, help provide jobs here at home; it is all about what deal can we cut for you so these same multinational corporations can continue to move jobs offshore, and, in this case, a little closer tohome. Perhaps they could avoid some of the transport costs from China or India where they have sent many of our other jobs, or Vietnam, and they can find almost as exploitable and cheap labor in Central America.  The combined buying power of these five nations is less than four days' purchasing power of the United States of America. If every person in these affected nations spent every cent they earned in the next year, it would be totally insignificant to the American economy; and, obviously, they are not going to do that. So it is very much the same as NAFTA: it is to move our plants, our equipment, some workers have even been made to package up their machines and train their replacements in the case of NAFTA, and they will be doing the same thing under CAFTA.  Mr. Speaker, it is time for a major change in policy. It is time for a policy that brings jobs home to America, that puts people at work here in America, that helps maintain wages in our country, and helps bring people overseas up to our standards instead of trying to drag the American people down to the lowest common denominator.  I hope that Members, particularly on the other side of the aisle, will not be bought by the White House in this debate and they will vote in the interests of the people who sent them here to Washington, DC.                          ____________________
