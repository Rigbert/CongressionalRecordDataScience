President, first, I would like to make an inquiry and then I have a couple comments to make.  When are we going to be taking up amendments that have been on the list for quite some time? Has that been decided yet? Or may I ask the manager of the bill, are we going to be disposing of the Bunning amendment before we go to other amendments? Is that going to be the order?
