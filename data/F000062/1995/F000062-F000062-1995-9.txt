  As we discuss companies or individuals ineligible for the safe harbor, I would also want to clarify the safe harbor does not apply to brokers or analysts who may have an incentive to oversell a stock to obtain a sale. On this point, the safe harbor would not have applied to the financial concerns we experienced in Orange County, California. If Merrill Lynch is a broker selling derivatives to a county government, in my state of California or any other state, they are not protected by the safe harbor because the safe harbor does not protect brokers and does not address derivatives.
