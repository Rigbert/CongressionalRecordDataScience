 President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his comments, and he is correct, we did face significant constraints throughout this bill which impacted upon the Next Generation High Speed Rail program. Furthermore, the Administration's funding request for this specific program was funded in part with a recommendation to transfer Revenue Aligned Budget Authority from the State highway formula to this and other programs, a proposal which was rejected by the Congress. I believe the Senator from Michigan opposed the RABA transfer from the States in the Budget Committee.  However, I believe the unallocated portion of the train control demonstration program under the Next Generation High Speed Rail Program should be allocated to the Michigan ITCS project, and as we enter the Conference with the House, I will work to ensure adequate funding for this project.
