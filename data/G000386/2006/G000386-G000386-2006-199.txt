 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the first female Iowan to have lost her life in the Iraq conflict. Petty Officer 2nd Class Jaime Jaenke was a naval reservist who had been in Iraq for only 3 months. She was killed on Monday, June 5, when the humvee she was traveling in was hit by an improvised explosive device. She was 29 years old and was assigned to the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 25 at Fort McCoy, WI.  Petty Officer Jaenke has given her life for our country, and I would ask that all Americans join me today in remembering and honoring Petty Officer Jaenke. Her loss will be felt deeply in the town of Iowa Falls. Although she had lived in Wisconsin for a number of years, she returned to Iowa 2 years ago and last fall opened an equestrian business outside Iowa Falls. My thoughts and prayers are with Petty Officer Jaenke's daughter, Kayla, her parents, Susan and Larry, as well as all those other family and friends who are grieving the loss of this young mother.  We owe a huge debt of gratitude to Petty Officer Jaenke for her sacrifice. I am greatly saddened by her passing but deeply proud and grateful for what she gave for America. Her loss remains tragic but she died a true patriot.                          ____________________
