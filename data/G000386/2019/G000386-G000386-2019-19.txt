 President, last week, despite the objections of the United States, the World Bank adopted a plan for lending more than $1 billion annually to China.  China is the world's second largest economy, and its per capita income is well above the level at which countries are supposed to graduate from needing World Bank assistance. American tax dollars should not be used, even indirectly, for lending to wealthier countries, particularly when they violate human rights.  China seeks legitimacy through international institutions for its bad practices, including for its own predatory lending through the Belt and Road Initiative. Despite what the recent World Bank Group's Country Partnership Framework reads, China is not an example developing countries should follow.  To sum up on this point, China has the second largest economy in the world, and it still wants to be considered a developing country and lend taxpayers' dollars around the world in order for there to be a greater Communist influence. As taxpayers, we should not stand for that to happen.             78th Anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor  Mr. President, on another point, this past weekend marked the 78th anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor--a raid that plunged the United States into World War II. Almost 2,500 U.S. soldiers lost their lives that day.  I am proud of the many Iowans who have served and sacrificed for our great country. Earlier this year, three of these people returned to Iowa to be laid to rest--Robert J. Bennett, William L. Kvidera, and Bert E. McKeeman.  I honor them and all of our servicemembers for their sacrifices in serving our people, protecting our constitutional rights and the freedom and liberties we have.  I yield the floor.                       Nomination of Stephen Hahn
