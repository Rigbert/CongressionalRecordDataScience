President, today our nation mourns the loss of Yolanda King, the eldest daughter of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King, and the ``first daughter'' of the civil rights movement.  Yolanda King's life moved in the stream of American civil rights history. Born in segregated Montgomery,AL, in November of 1955, she came into this world only 3 weeks before the Interstate Commerce Commission issued its ban on racial segregation in interstate commerce and 2 weeks before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Montgomery. Yolanda was 7 years old when her father, in his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech, said ``I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a Nation where they will not be judged by the color of the skin but by the content of their character.''  In a 2004 statement entitled, ``The Meaning of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday,'' Coretta Scott King recalled that ``Dr. King once said that we all have to decide whether we will walk in the light of creative altruism or the darkness of destructive selfishness. Life's most persistent and nagging question . . . is what are you doing for others?''  Yolanda led a life that made her family and her Nation proud. She was an actress, an author, and a producer. But she also worked in service to others. The world will remember her as an activist for peace, an ardent supporter of nonviolence, and a torchbearer for Dr. King's dream of racial harmony.  Through her actions, the King family legacy lives on. Like her parents, Yolanda inspired a generation of youths to dedicate their lives to service. Her life is a shining example that we all can make a difference, and her deeds will continue to inspire generations to come.  Our thoughts are with the King family today. I salute Yolanda's life, and hope that our Nation will continue its march towards a more inclusive democracy.                          ____________________
