I do say that is a very judicious and thoughtful approach. We want to be fair to this man who served his country well, but we also understand his remarks were viewed by many in a very negative light at a very critical moment in our history. I think what we should ask of everyone in the service of our country is what the President has asked, and that is to keep it very clear ours is a war against terrorism and not a war against the Islamic faith or people who adhere to it. We could no more expect General Boykin to embrace the Islamic faith and its principles than we would expect someone of the Islamic faith to accept Christian principles or Jewish principles and values. But we can expect every member of our Government to be tolerant and sensitive of other people's values and principles. I think that is a standard we should all live by in public life, whether appointed or elected.  I think what the Senator from Virginia has done today is an important step forward. I would say his extraordinary service to this country in the military and as Secretary of the Navy and in the Senate I think means his recommendation will be understood as a heartfelt recommendation and taken seriously by the administration. I hope they do. I hope they follow his counsel and follow it quickly. The sooner we can defuse this matter the better for all, including the general, and I think the sooner it will be that we can bring some stability and perhaps some coherence to our position so we can fight this war on terrorism in terms all Americans, including the President, agree with.  I thank the Senator from Virginia.
