 President.  Mr. President, this bill is notable in several regards:  First, under the leadership of Senator Akaka and Senator Byrd, we were able to provide $1.977 billion in emergency funding in this bill to address the projected shortfall in veterans health care funding for 2006.  This is in addition to the $1.5 billion in the 2005 supplemental funding we were able to add to the 2006 Interior appropriations bill to make up the current shortfall in veterans health care. The bill before the Senate now totals $82.98 billion, of which $44 billion is discretionary spending.  For military construction, the bill equals the budget request of $12.116 billion. Although we have rearranged some of the funding within that request for the VA, the total amount appropriated in this bill is $70.7 billion, including $34.1 billion in discretionary and $36.6 billion in mandatory spending. This is $3.2 billion above the President's original budget request.  I commend and thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Hutchison of Texas. We have worked very well together in producing a very good bill. I am delighted we were able to finish it with quick speed.  I thank the staff on both sides. We have great professional staff. They have done a fine job.  I would like to turn it over to the chairman of the committee, my friend, Senator Hutchison.
