Mr. Speaker, as many of my colleagues know, we were going to take up the contempt report following this vote. We have decided not to do that until a later time. It is not because of the issue. It is because of the number of people that saw fit to leave this body on both sides of the aisle to return to their homes. It will be considered next time.                          ____________________
