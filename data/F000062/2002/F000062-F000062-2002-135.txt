  I thank the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for the investigation which took place and began subsequent to our hearing on January 29 and my request to FERC that they conduct this investigation.  As Chairman Wood told the Energy Committee hearing: Sunlight is the best disinfectant. I am very pleased that, under his leadership, FERC is now practicing what Mr. Wood has preached.  But take note that these documents have sat within Enron for the last 18 months. This is 6 months after a subpoena was issued for them. And, finally, after all this time, the Enron board decided it would release the documents.  It is appalling that it took this long. It is precisely why the CFTC or FERC or some regulatory agency needs the authority to investigate. That was an authority that the CFTC had until the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed by this body in December of 2000.  That is the same month these documents were actually produced. It is exactly what Senator Cantwell, Senator Wyden, and I have been saying in the Energy Committee for more than a year. Had our derivatives amendment been in place, at least it would have ensured that for online trades, a regulatory agency would have had access to these documents and would have been able to investigate right away. I hope the 50 of my colleagues who voted against our energy derivatives amendment will reconsider their opposition.  Senator Harkin, who is present in the Chamber, the chair of the Agriculture Committee, has said he would take a look at our legislation and mark it up. I am once again calling on his committee to hold hearings and mark up our legislation as soon as possible.  Congress must pass legislation to reinstate CFTC authority to oversee energy derivatives in the futures market and investigate fraud and manipulation of energy producers.  What do these documents mean for California and the Western States? Until now, FERC has never said it thought there was manipulation in the California and western energy markets. As such, it has taken a very conservative view with respect to refund proceedings, interpreting ``just and reasonable'' doctrines and reviewing long-term energy contracts. That means FERC-ordered refunds were very limited and very insignificant relative to ``unjust and unreasonable'' costs. Now all of a sudden the landscape has changed. Manipulated spot markets lead to forward markets that were also manipulated, and thus long-term contracts also reflect unjust and unreasonable rates. So this means everything needs to be put back on the table by FERC.  I don't believe it was just Enron. I believe other companies were out there doing the same or similar things. In fact, one document, a December 2000 memo from two Enron employees named Yoder and Hall to another named Sanders, even fingers two other companies, Puget Sound and PowerEx, as having done the same thing.  These documents suggest that this may be beyond FERC at this point. That is why I am calling for the Department of Justice to investigate these memoranda, the companies, and other companies. I am also calling on FERC to take another look at contracts signed by California and other Western States with energy companies to see if future prices of energy were also manipulated by Enron. The evidence is now very clear that this was in fact the case.  I am also asking FERC to take another look at the refund proceedings. The evidence now exists that prices were unjust and unreasonable to a much larger extent than FERC had previously determined.  As my colleagues know, I have asked the Department of Justice to investigate, and here is why I believe there may well be outright fraud. There are three easy ways.  First, Enron sold power out of State and then bought it back. This enabled them to evade certain price caps and sell energy without a cap in order to receive a much higher price for their energy. This is referred to as megawatt laundering.  Second, by knowing that transmission lines were constrained and oversubscribed for a set hour, the company scheduled deliveries in order to get paid and not deliver. The net effect was that Enron got paid for moving energy to relieve congestion that they had no intention of actually ever moving.  Third, with simple sleight of hand, Enron could sell nonfirm energy to the power exchange as firm energy in order to get paid extra for ancillary services in the firm contracts when Enron was actually selling nonfirm power.  There are other examples documented on the Web site. Some are much more technical, with suspicious names such as Fat Boy, Get Shorty, and Death Star. I am sure there are yet other ways to manipulate the system, and perhaps other companies figured out other ways to do it as well.  I am also asking the Department of Justice to investigate the entire western energy market and those trading into it in the years 2000 and 2001. If there ever was a bugle call to action to fix what was wrong with the California and western energy markets from May of 2000 to June of 2001, this is it.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
