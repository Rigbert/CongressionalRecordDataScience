President, I rise today to introduce legislation designed to improve educational opportunities for struggling students. The All Students Achieving Through Reform Act, or All-STAR Act, would provide Federal resources to the most successful charter schools to help them grow and replicate.  Last week, I visited the KIPP Ascend Charter School in Chicago. You might have heard of the KIPP charter schools. The first KIPP school was founded in Texas by two Teach for America teachers. Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin wanted to start a school that would inspire high achievement for students living in disadvantaged communities. The 82 KIPP schools nationwide focus on high expectations, an intense academic curriculum, expanded school days and years, parental involvement, and high quality teachers. The results are impressive. While less than one in five low-income students attends college nationally, KIPP's college matriculation rate stands at more than 85 percent for students who complete the 8th grade at KIPP. More than 90 percent of KIPP alumni go on to college-preparatory high schools. Collectively, they have earned millions ofdollars in scholarships and financial aid since 2000.  I saw this success when I visited Chicago's KIPP school. Students at KIPP Ascend are actively engaged in learning and their teachers are energetic and inspiring. The students there are outscoring their peers in other Chicago Public Schools, and 100 percent of the 8th graders who have graduated from KIPP Ascend have been accepted to college-preparatory high schools.  Right now there is only one KIPP school in Chicago, but there should be more. The bill I am introducing today with Senator Gregg would help make that possible. Currently, federal funding for charter schools can only be used to create new schools, not expand or replicate existing schools. My bill would create new grants within the existing charter school program to fund the expansion and replication of the most successful charter schools. Schools in Chicago, like KIPP and Noble Street, that have achieved amazing results with their students will be able to apply for federal grants to expand their schools to additional grades or replicate the model to a new school. Successful charters across the country will be able to grow more easily, providing better educational opportunities to thousands of students.  The bill also incentivizes the adoption of strong charter school policies by states. We know that successful charter schools thrive when they have autonomy, freedom to grow, and strong accountability based on meeting performance targets. The bill would give grant priority to States that provide that environment. The bill also requires new levels of charter school authorizer reporting and accountability to ensure that good charter schools are able to succeed while bad charter schools are improved or shut down.  This bill will improve educational opportunities for students across the Nation. Charter schools represent some of the brightest spots in urban education today, and successful models have the full support of the President and Secretary Duncan. We need to help these schools grow and bring their best lessons into our regular public schools so that all students can benefit. This bill has the support of more than 25 education organizations including some of the Nation's highest performing charter networks like KIPP and Green Dot. Supporting the growth of successful charter schools should be a part of the conversation when we take up reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I thank Senator Gregg and Representative Polis in the House for joining me in this effort.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3441       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
