Chair, as I said earlier, this bill at this point is an excellent product policy-wise. We will vigorously debate improvements and potentially problematic amendments over the next 2 days and, hopefully, have a similar or an improved product in the end. Whether or not we will be allowed to attempt to augment the funding remains to be seen.  With that, we are off to a good start. I look forward to the coming debate.  I yield back the balance of my time.
