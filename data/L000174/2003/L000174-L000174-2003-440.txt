President, last November, the Drug Competition Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent. This morning, I am proud to join Senator Grassley, along with Senators Cantwell, Durbin, Feingold, Kohl, and Schumer in offering our bill as an amendment to the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003, S. 1, I hope that in this Congress it is actually enacted into law as part of the larger effort to improve the health care of millions of Americans. Prescription drug prices are rapidly increasing, and are a source of considerable concern to many Americans, especially senior citizens and families. Generic drug prices can be as much as 80 percent lower than the comparable brand-name version.  While the Drug Competition Act is small in terms of length, it is large in terms of impact. It will ensure that law enforcement agencies can take quick and decisive action against companies that are driven more by greed than by good sense. It gives the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department access to information about secret deals between drug companies that keep generic drugs off the market. This is a practice that hurts American families, particularly senior citizens, by denying them access to low-cost generic drugs, and further inflating medical costs.  Last fall, the Federal Trade Commission released a comprehensive report on barriers to the entry of generic drugs into the pharmaceutical marketplace. The FTC had two recommendations to improve the current situation and to close the loopholes in the law that allow drug manufacturers to manipulate the timing of generics' introduction to the market. One of those recommendations was simply to enact our bill, as the most effective solution to the problem of ``sweetheart'' deals between brand name and generic drug manufacturers that keep generic drugs off the market, thus depriving consumers of the benefits of quality drugs at lower prices. Indeed, at a hearing just yesterday in the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Timothy Muris of the FTC praised the Drug Competition Act in his testimony, and urged its passage. In short, this bill enjoys the unqualified endorsement of the current FTC, which follows on the support by the Clinton administration's FTC during the initial stages of our formulation of this bill. We can all have every confidence in the common sense approach that our bill takes to ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have the information they need to take quick action, if necessary, to protect consumers from drug companies that abuse the law.  Under current law, the first generic manufacturer that gets permission to sell a generic drug before the patent on the brand-name drug expires enjoys protection from competition for 180 days--a head start on other generic companies. That was a good idea--but the unfortunate loophole exploited by a few is that secret deals can be made that allow the manufacturer of the generic drug to claim the 180-day grace period--to block other generic drugs from entering the market--while, at the same time, getting paid by the brand-name manufacturer not to sell the generic drug.  Our legislation closes this loophole for those who want to cheat the public but keeps the system the same for companies engaged in true competition. I think it is important for Congress not to overreact and throw outthe good with the bad. Most generic companies want to take advantage of this 180-day provision and deliver quality generic drugs at much lower costs for consumers. We should not eliminate the incentive for them. Instead, we should let the FTC and Justice look at every deal that could lead to abuse, so that only the deals that are consistent with the intent of that law will be allowed to stand. The Drug Competition Act accomplishes precisely that goal, and helps ensure effective and timely access to generic pharmaceuticals that can lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, for families, and for all of us.  The effects of this amendment will only benefit the effort to bring quality health care at lower costs to more of our citizens. The Drug Competition Act enjoyed the unqualified support of the Senate last year, and I hope my colleagues will recognize that it fits well within the framework of the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003. It will do nothing to disrupt the balance struck in the larger bill, while aiding the ultimate goal of that legislation. I urge all Senators to embrace this effort on behalf of Medicare recipients, and of all Americans.                          ____________________
