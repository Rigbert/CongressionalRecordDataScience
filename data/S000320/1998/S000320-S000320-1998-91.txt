 President, I want to state to my colleagues tonight that I believe myself, as I said earlier, that what Senator DeWine is offering to do makes a lot of sense. I will work with Senator DeWine and Senator Lautenberg in the conference when we get into the seriousness of what we can do with money. Interdiction here dealing with drugs should be and will be one of our No. 1 priorities.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me thank both of my colleagues, the ranking member and the chairman, for their great cooperation. I understand my colleague has expressed his concerns about the money situation. I look forward to working with both Members in regard to that.  I appreciate your concern for the Coast Guard. I believe this is money very well spent. I think the Coast Guard knows what to do with its money. They know how to get the job done. I have been out literally in the field or on the sea with them to see what they can do. They do a good job getting it done.  I understand the concerns with regard to the money.  I don't know if there is any further debate.
