Thank you for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to H.R. 6 and encourage mycolleagues to vote against this bill, because one of its consequences is to raise revenue for some of America's most adamant and ardent enemies, such as Mr. Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Mr. Ahmadinejad in Iran.  As I travel my district, my constituents have a consistent message for me: Find a way to achieve energy independence and end our reliance on foreign oil from unstable regions of the world. I am extremely disappointed that the Democrat leadership has chosen to pursue an energy bill that does nothing to achieve this goal and is simply a ruse perpetrated on the American people.  In the past, I have worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to promote alternative energy legislation. In previous Congresses, I have sponsored bills to offer incentives for the development of biodiesel and ethanol, to encourage investment in coal-to-liquid technology, and increase the use of renewable fuels. Each of these received bipartisan support.  I attempted to offer an amendment to this bill on an issue that has received bipartisan support, but it was refused. This is the sole piece of energy legislation in the 100-hour agenda, yet our party was not allowed even a single amendment. Why has this legislation not been an opportunity to discuss real solutions to our Nation's energy crisis? Why does this bill include no provisions to move our Nation away from oil use at all?  Why, Mr. Speaker? Because the majority doesn't want a real solution. They only want to stand here today and play politics with our Nation's future.  I truly wish this debate could have been about the virtues of developing alternative energies. Instead, this is a veiled tax hike to create what some may say is a slush fund for future use. This is unconscionable, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel). =========================== NOTE ===========================     January 18, 2007--On Page H695 the following appeared: Mr. McGOVERN.
