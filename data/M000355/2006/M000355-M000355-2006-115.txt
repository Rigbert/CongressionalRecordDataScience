 President, on a related note, one portion of the much publicized National Intelligence Estimate that came out this week failed to capture much attention. It was a segment that said, ``We cannot measure the extent of the spread [of jihadist terrorism] with precision . . .'' This candid admission reflects just how difficult good intelligence is to come by. It also reflects why it is so important that this bill permits the CIA interrogation program to continue--because it provides valuable intelligence.  Over the weekend, much was made about this selective leak of national security information. Some of our colleagues pounced on the media reports to bolster their argument that we should pull out of Iraq, pull out now.  But whoever leaked this report somehow forgot to mention a key finding of the intelligence community. As anyone who read the declassified report knows, the findings are clear: If we defeat the terrorists in Iraq, there will be fewer terrorists inspired to carry on the fight elsewhere. But if we leave Iraq to the terrorists, it will only inspire more terrorists to join the fight.  In other words, defeating terrorists in Iraq not only secures the new democracy there but prevents future attacks here.  The New York Times editorial board rightly pointed out that ``[t]he current situation will get worse if American forces leave.''  Mr. President, it is a banner day when the New York Times editorial board contradicts my colleagues across the aisle, and the Times is certainly right, at least in this regard: a policy of retreat will not stop terrorists there--or prevent attacks here.  I have said it before, but it bears repeating. Terrorism against the United States didn't start on 9/11 or the day our troops entered Baghdad--But attacks here at home did stop when we started fighting al-Qaida where they live rather than responding after they hit.  We don't need to guess what will happen if we leave Iraq to the terrorists. We already have a real-world example of what will happen. Recall that Afghanistan was a wholly owned subsidiary of al-Qaida before 9/11. It was from there that they planned and executed--with impunity--attacks against the United States and our allies. Think what Iraq would be like if we let al-Qaida take possession of the country--like bin Laden wants us to do.  And remember what the 9/11 Commission concluded, and I quote: ``If, for example, Iraq becomes a failed state, it will go to the top of the list of places that are breeding grounds for attacks against Americans at home.''  Mr. President, we know what will happen if we leave Iraq before the job is finished. That is simply not in dispute. Remember, bin Laden declared that, for him, Iraq was the ``capital of the Caliphate.'' We must not and we will not give him that victory.                          Ryan White CARE Act
