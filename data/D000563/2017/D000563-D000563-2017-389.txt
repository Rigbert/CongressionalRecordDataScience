President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 850       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Medical School      Accountability Fairness Act of 2017''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.       To establish consistent eligibility requirements for      graduate medical schools operating outside of the United      States and Canada in order to increase accountability and      protect American students and taxpayer dollars.     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Three for-profit schools in the Caribbean receive      nearly \3/4\ of all Federal funding under title IV of the      Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) that      goes to students enrolled at foreign graduate medical      schools, despite those three schools being exempt from      meeting the same eligibility requirements as the majority of      graduate medical schools located outside of the United States      and Canada.       (2) The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and      Accreditation and the Department of Education recommend that      all foreign graduate medical schools should be required to      meet the same eligibility requirements to participate in      Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act of      1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.).       (3) The attrition rate at United States medical schools      averaged 3.4 percent in 2014, while rates at for-profit      Caribbean medical schools have been known to reach 30      percent.       (4) In 2016, residency match rates for foreign trained      graduates averaged 54 percent compared to 94 percent for      graduates of medical schools in the United States.       (5) On average, students at for-profit medical schools      operating outside of the United     States and Canada amass more student debt than those at      medical schools in the United States.     SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS.       Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20      U.S.C. 1002(a)(2)) is amended--       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking clause (i) and      inserting the following:       ``(i) in the case of a graduate medical school located      outside the United States--       ``(I) at least 60 percent of those enrolled in, and at      least 60 percent of the graduates of, the graduate medical      school outside the United States were not persons described      in section 484(a)(5) in the year preceding the year for which      a student is seeking a loan under part D of title IV; and       ``(II) at least 75 percent of the individuals who were      students or graduates of the graduate medical school outside      the United States or Canada (both nationals of the United      States and others) taking the examinations administered by      the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates      received a passing score in the year preceding the year for      which a student is seeking a loan under part D of title      IV;''; and       (2) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by adding at the end the      following:       ``(V) Expiration of authority.--The authority of a graduate      medical school described in subclause (I) to qualify for      participation in the loan programs under part D of title IV      pursuant to this clause shall expire beginning on the first      July 1 following the date of enactment of the Foreign Medical      School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017.''.     SEC. 5. LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY.       If a graduate medical school loses eligibility to      participate in the loan programs under part D of title IV of      the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.)      due to the enactment of the amendments made by section 4,      then a student enrolled at such graduate medical school on or      before the date of enactment of this Act may, notwithstanding      such loss of eligibility, continue to be eligible to receive      a loan under such part D while attending such graduate      medical school in which the student was enrolled upon the      date of enactment of this Act, subject to the student      continuing to meet all applicable requirements for      satisfactory academic progress, until the earliest of--       (1) withdrawal by the student from the graduate medical      school;       (2) completion of the program of study by the student at      the graduate medical school; or       (3) the fourth June 30 after such loss of eligibility.                                 ______                                       By
