President, we hear people complain about how foreign aid is a waste of money, and there are certainly examples of it. The United States poured countless millions of dollars into the pockets of President Mobutu, and one need only observe the chaos and suffering in Zaire today to understand what a terrible mistake that was. Many of us said so at the time, but we were ignored. During that same period, the United States propped up General Noriega in Panama, until he was no longer useful to us.  But you do not hear very much about the good uses of foreign aid, and how it makes a difference between life and death, or hope and misery, for millions of people around the world. In fact, there are far more examples of those good uses, than of the scandals that attract the attention of the media.  One example is the War Victims Fund project in Uganda. This project began in 1989, and it is now coming to an end. I think Members of Congress and the public should know about it, because it is a remarkable example of what the U.S. Government, a private voluntary organization, the good will and hard work of American volunteers, and the support of the Government of Uganda, have done for the benefit of thousands of wounded and severely disabled people in that country.  Uganda, a once productive country that boasted the finest medical school in sub-Saharan Africa, was virtually destroyed by the disastrous Idi Amin and Obote regimes. The medical school was destroyed, its faculty members killed or run out of the country. Years of civil war left thousands of casualties, including many victims of landmines.  In 1989, the year the Leahy War Victims Fund was established, USAID began a project in Uganda. It was implemented by Health Volunteers Overseas, a Washington, DC-based organization that sends volunteer doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals to train people in poor countries.  Health Volunteers Overseas did an extraordinary job in Uganda during the 7-year life of this project. There were tremendous achievements, and one terrible tragedy when Dr. Rodney Belcher, the Virginia orthopedic surgeon without whom the project would not have accomplished nearly so much, was gunned down in a robbery. His loss was felt throughout Uganda, because so many people knew of his selflessness, and that he had literally given his life for them and future generations in that country. His legacy is the scores of Ugandan health professionals he trained who are carrying on his work today.  Mr. President, HVO's final report on the Uganda project should be read by all. Its staff and volunteers deserve our sincere thanks, and our continued support. USAID, and President Museveni and his Health Ministry, also deserve credit. I ask that excerpts of the report be printed in the Record.  The excerpts of the report follow:Excerpts of Final Report--Uganda Orthopaedics and Physical Therapy for                           the Disabled Project                              introduction       In August of 1989, Health Volunteers Overseas (HVO) entered      into a three year grant agreement with the U.S. Agency for      International Development (USAID) Mission in     Uganda to ``improve the provision of orthopaedic, prosthetic,      orthotic and physical therapy services for Uganda's thousands      of children and adults who have lost upper and lower limbs,      been crippled through the paralytic residual of poliomyelitis      or otherwise become immobilized, especially those persons      whose disabilities resulted from civil strife''.       This grant concluded on December 31, 1996.                           *   *   *   *   *                            accomplishments                               Facilities       HVO renovated and furnished the Polio Clinic at Old Mulago      Hospital to serve as the site for the Department of      Orthopaedics. The renovated building included space for      departmental offices, weekly clinics, library, storage,      seminar/classroom, and the HVO offices.       HVO renovated and equipped the operating room suite at Ward      7 at Old Mulago, creating two ``clean'' theaters for non-     septic cases. These rooms were opened in March of 1991 and      according to a report dated January 31, 1995, ``the well      trained nursing and theater staff [are] working smoothly to      assist the surgical teams in performing an average of 20      surgical operations weekly for conditions including polio,      trauma, fractures, spinal and hip injuries, tuberculosis,      cerebral palsy, bone tumors, club feet and a variety of      severe and late burns of hands and limbs''.       HVO rebuilt and equipped the Mbale Workshop which had been      destroyed in a fire in March of 1990.       HVO renovated and furnished a guest house on the hospital      grounds to serve as housing for volunteers.       HVO built a new, larger sterile store room adjacent to the      OR suite in the fall of 1996. This was funded by a private      donation to HVO, not with grant monies.                         Training and Education       HVO established a M.Med. (Orthopaedics) postgraduate degree      at Makerere University and Mulago Hospital. The goal of this      program is to train a corps of Ugandan orthopaedic surgeons      who will be qualified to continue the teaching program in      orthopaedic surgery and trauma management after the end of      this grant. The curriculum for this four year degree was      approved by the University Senate and accepted by the School      of Postgraduate Studies in 1995. The authors of the      curriculum included Drs. Belcher and Lawrence Gordon. In the      fall of 1995, three young Ugandan physicians were formally      enrolled in the program as the first residents.       Over the life of this grant, various cadres of personnel      were taught the principles of orthopaedic surgery and trauma      management. According to a summary provided by Dr. Belcher      in 1995, over 450 medical students, 45 physicians and      surgeons, 36 orthopaedic assistant paramedical officers,      16 physical therapists and 40 nurses had been exposed to      training and education related to orthopaedic surgery.       Considerable effort was also devoted to training the OR      personnel and surgical nursing staff in operating theater      sterile techniques and surgical procedures. When the      operating theaters at Ward 6 were nearing completion, HVO      sent an experienced OR nurse, Theresa McInerney, to Kampala      for a 6 month tour. Her job was to get the newly renovated OR      suite functioning. This included organizing donations      received from the United States, determining what additional      items needed to be procured from the United States or could      be made locally, and developing procedures to ensure that      sterile technique was maintained. She also initiated a series      of classes for the OR personnel in OR technique with a      special emphasis on asepsis and the importance of      productivity.       This training continued under the direction of another OR      nurse, Wilma Ostrander, who served several tours in Uganda.      She focused her efforts on improving the efficiency and      effectiveness of the OR nursing and paramedical staff through      a series of lectures and demonstrations. She also      participated in the development of infection control programs      designed to improve the safety of the environment in the      operating rooms resulting in lower post-operative infections      and complications.       On return visits, she also assisted the department in the      development of a computerized inventory system to track the      utilization of supplies and equipment. This has facilitated      the development of a departmental system to reorder supplies      as needed, a critical function for the department. As part of      this process, she has introduced the utilization of patient      records and patient supply lists so that there is a record      available tracing the items used and to facilitate stock      orders.       As the OR became functional, it also became clear that      there was not an adequate number of trained technicians at      the hospital who could handle the maintenance and servicing      of the medical equipment needed for surgery. This was      particularly evident in the lengthy process required for the      commissioning of the autoclave purchased for the Ward 7 OR      suite. Once commissioned, Dr. Belcher learned that there was      no one on the staff of the hospital who could maintain this      autoclave, despite the fact that it was similar to others at      New Mulago Hospital.       As a result, HVO entered into a collaborative relationship      with the American Medical Resources Foundation (AMRF), a      Boston-based NGO, to design and deliver a series of workshops      to teach Ugandan technicians at both Old and New Mulago      Hospitals how to repair, maintain and service medical      equipment. A total of three workshops were held in 1996      focusing on the repair of cardiology, radiology, anesthesia,      respiratory and OR equipment. The first workshop was attended      by 30 hospital engineers and technicians from Mulago, Mengo,      Rubago and Nsambya Hospitals. Although there was significant      interest in the other two workshops, HVO and AMRF decided to      limit the number of participants to 15 in order to ensure      adequate time for hands-on work in diagnosing and repairing      equipment.       HVO also sent a resident to Hong Kong for 2.5 months of      post-graduate training at the University of Hong Kong under      the direction of Professor John C.Y. Leong. This training not      only served as an opportunity to see how services are      delivered in another country, but also fostered the      development of professional contacts outside of Uganda.                         Extension of Services       The scope of this project was national. HVO, under the      direction of Dr. Belcher, focused considerable effort on      expanding the delivery of services to hospitals outside      Kampala and developing an effective orthopaedic referral      system for the up-country regions of Uganda.       For the first three years of the project, regular visits to      various up-country facilities were undertaken by members of      the Department of Orthopaedics, usually accompanied by a      volunteer. Patients would be examined and the difficult cases      referred to Mulago for surgery. Others would be measured and      fitted with calipers or, if feasible, taken into surgery.       These visits ceased when travel funds for department      personnel were no longer forthcoming from the Ministry of      Health. However, Dr. Belcher planned an ambitious program of      up-country visits starting again in 1996.                           *   *   *   *   *       The goal of these trips outside of Kampala was to increase      the visibility of the services available for the disabled, to      identify patients in need of services and to successfully      enroll them in treatment programs.       With the end of the grant, this aspect of the project is      perhaps the least likely to continue, although the need for      this type of outreach is critical. Funds are needed for      transportation, as well as food and housing for the team      members. It is unlikely that the Ministry of Health will be      able to fund as many trips as originally planned on an annual      basis.                         Other Accomplishments       HVO was able, with funds from the grant, to identify and      procure essential educational materials, including books,      journals, slide sets, and videos. HVO also purchased items      necessary for the viewing and development of educational      materials. For example, HVO procured overhead and slide      projectors, a television and video machine, computers with      CD-ROM capabilities, and a photocopier. Access to this      equipment is essential as members of the department or      volunteers seek to organize lectures and teaching materials      for students.       More than 5,000 books and journals were shipped to Uganda      under the auspices of this grant. Most of these were donated      by members of HVO. HVO, based on input and recommendations of      the senior members of the Department of Orthopaedics, also      procured a set of current reference texts in medicine,      rehabilitation, and orthopaedics for the departmental      library. This order filled many gaps that existed in the      library and will serve the educational needs of the      department for many years to come.       One of HVO's educational objectives at the Medical School      and Mulago Hospital was to develop better interaction and      communication between the various departments involved in      patient services and teaching. This was accomplished through      the development of a weekly joint conference with the      Radiology Department where orthopaedic surgeons and      radiologists reviewed patient x-rays and learn from one      another. Similar conferences were established with a joint      pathology, radiology, orthopaedic, and oncology conference      held monthly. Other joint conferences were established with      the Neurosurgical and Pediatric Departments.       In addition, HVO, with the assistance of Dr. Belcher, was      able to develop links with other departments. HVO initiated      volunteer-staffed teaching programs with the departments of      anesthesia, medicine and pediatrics. Strengthening the      capacity of these departments to treat patients and to teach      future generations of Ugandan medical providers is critical      to the overall improvement of health care in Uganda.       When it became evident that HVO volunteers would not be      able to have an active role assisting AVSI in the School for      Physical Therapists, HVO recruited several PT volunteers to      work primarily with the Departments of Physical Therapy.      Donna Tinsley, a PT who spent 6 months in Kampala with the      project, taught PT students during bedside ward rounds on      Ward 7 as well as in the amputee, cerebral palsy and polio      clinics.                          problems encountered       Some of the problems encountered in the course of      implementing this project are inherent in the way      international assistance is designed. The original grant was      for a period of three years, an extremely short period of      time in which to ``improve the provision of orthopaedic,      prosthetic, orthotic and physical therapy services . . .''      for a country such as Uganda. Extensions were forthcoming but      only for 12 to 18 months at a time. This     short-term focus prevented HVO from developing longer range      plans that might have been more effective.       The logistical problems involved in renovating and      equipping the departmental offices and OR suites on Ward 7      were, at times, monumental. Dealing with local contractors      was very difficult. Materials were often delayed or ``went      missing''. Workers might not show up on time or even at all.      These problems contributed to a substantial delay in the      project which was compensated for by a one-year extension.       Communications between the field office and HVO's      Washington office were hampered by frequent power outages and      missing faxes. This situation, however, improved over the      life of the project, especially with the introduction of e-     mail.       As was mentioned above, there were recurring problems with      the maintenance of equipment, including, but not limited to,      medical equipment. Due to power surges, office equipment      frequently was damaged, often beyond repair. The problems      associated with the commissioning of the autoclave might well      serve as a case study in the difficulties in merging a highly      sophisticated piece of equipment into a facility which cannot      provide adequate supplies of water and electricity. Despite      considerable research and investigation as to which autoclave      would be best suited to the department's needs and      building's capacity, this autoclave was inoperable for      several years. When finally commissioned, its maintenance      was a recurring problem.                         project sustainability       The death on March 11, 1996, of Dr. Rodney Belcher was a      tremendous loss for all involved in this project. Dr. Belcher      was murdered in front of the HVO office on the hospital      grounds in the course of a carjacking attempt that was      ultimately unsuccessful.                           *   *   *   *   *       Given the unexpected and tragic turn of events in 1996,      what are the chances that activities undertaken to date will      continue and that the impact of these many years of hard work      will be sustained over time?       On a positive note, the senior members of the department      immediately took charge upon Dr. Belcher's death and      appropriately divided the departmental workload. The      department has continued to function with weekly clinics,      twice weekly operating schedules, ward rounds, seminars, etc.      Through the end of 1996, thanks to funding available from      HVO, up-country outreach clinics were conducted. Dr. Naddumba      has been elected Head of the Department and has earned high      marks for his administrative and political skills.       Health Volunteers Overseas will continue to send volunteers      to share their technical expertise with members of the      Department of Orthopaedics. HVO will also send volunteers to      work with faculty and students in the Departments of      Medicine, Pediatrics, and Anesthesia.       In addition, Dr. Norgrove Penny, a Canadian orthopaedic      surgeon and member of Orthopaedics Overseas, accepted a four      year contract in Kampala with the Christoffel Blindenmission      (CBM) beginning in August of 1996. He is working in      conjunction with the Uganda Society for Disabled Children and      the Leonard Cheshire Homes of Uganda, both British based      charities working in community based projects. His job      includes developing services to up-country district hospitals      who at present have no orthopaedic services.       There have been discussions between members of the      Department of Orthopaedics at Mulago Hospital and Dr. Penny      regarding the possibility of working together. There      certainly appears to be an overlap of mutual interests and      HVO/Washington has strongly supported this possibility.       However, * * * without a certain level of ongoing financial      support there will be some serious problems ahead for the      department and for the delivery of orthopaedic and      rehabilitation services to the population at large in Uganda.                           *   *   *   *   *                                summary       This project began in the fall of 1989 in the midst of      great anticipation and hope. Uganda was recovering from a      long period of intense civil strife marked by intense      fighting, brutality and bloodshed. HVO had an opportunity to      participate in a program that would help rehabilitate the      lives of thousands touched in one way or another by the      breakdown of society during this period.       Now, seven years later, we can say that this project has      done much to ``improve the provision of orthopaedic,      prosthetic, orthotic and physical therapy services for      Uganda's thousands of children and adults who have lost upper      and lower limbs, been crippled through the paralytic residual      of poliomyelitis or otherwise become immobilized, especially      those persons whose disabilities resulted from civil      strife''.       The death of Dr. Rodney Belcher was a devastating even. His      death, however, serves as a beacon for members of the      department and HVO who are determined not to allow this event      to diminish the accomplishments of his many years of      dedication and hard work.
