 DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Vermont. I would say we have some of the best health care in America but also the most expensive health care in America. We spend more per person than any other nation on Earth, and a lot of it has to do with money not being well spent. People who do not have access to a medical home, which we establish in this bill, people who do not have access to a community health care clinic, in desperation, will take a baby with a high fever in to an emergency room.
