 President, if I could, it strikes me that there was some intervening event here between the difficulty of getting a vote over the past few years and the apparent ease of getting a vote now. It strikes me--and I would be interested in the observations of my colleague from North Dakota--it strikes me this interveningevent was the election and it could be that the voices of the American people have already altered the agenda in the Senate even before the Senate officially changes hands in January. Maybe the voices of the American people have finally been heard on this important issue that the Senator from North Dakota has been speaking about week after week after week for a very long time.  I would say to the Senator from North Dakota, when there is a new majority here, if we come up short between now and the end of the year, we will be back and back and back, looking for ways to make sure that the voices of the American people are heard, and all of these new jobs are created.  So I hope--the Senator from North Dakota has indicated we will come to a favorable conclusion sooner, but I assure the Senator from North Dakota that we will come to a favorable conclusion later, if not sooner.  I see the Senator from Texas.
