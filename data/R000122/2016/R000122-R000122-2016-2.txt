President, I want to take an opportunity to salute and thank and commend my colleagues who are departing.                               Mark Kirk  Mr. President, Senator Kirk, my colleague from Illinois, just finished his remarks.  Mark and I had the opportunity and the privilege to work on many things together. He is a Navy commander. He never lets me forget that. He always called me Major; I always called him Commander. He served the State of Illinois with great integrity, great energy, and great spirit, and we thank him for that very much.  Thank you for your service to the Nation in the uniform of the United States Navy.  We also have other colleagues departing: Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire; Senator Boxer of California, Senator Coats of Indiana; as I mentioned, Senator Kirk of Illinois; Senator Mikulski of Maryland; Senator Reid of Nevada; and Senator Vitter of Louisiana. Each has brought passion in their work to best serve their constituents, and the institution of the Senate and the Nation are better for this service. I am better for knowing them, working with them, and having the opportunity to share with them, and I want to thank them for their service. Let me mention a few words with respect to all of these distinguished Senators.                              Kelly Ayotte  Mr. President, Kelly Ayotte and I worked together for many years on the Armed Services Committee. What she brought was an unparalleled commitment to and passion for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States. She wanted them to have a quality of life that reflects their service and their sacrifice. She wanted them to have the training and the equipment that would protect them as they engage our foes, and she wanted to make sure they knew that we were always conscious of their sacrifice and service. She did this in so many different ways, and she did it so well.  She was particularly committed to making sure that the A-10 aircraft remained in our inventory. As someone who as a younger person was an infantry officer, I appreciated having seen in training how effective that system is to protect our forces on the ground, and her efforts were unstinting to make sure that our forces were fully protected. Again, that is just one example of her commitment.                             Barbara Boxer  Mr. President, Barbara Boxer and I had the privilege to serve both in the House and the Senate together. My first term in the House of Representatives was Barbara's last term in the House before she was elected to the Senate. She is an extraordinary, tenacious fighter--remarkably so. She has fought for women's rights. She has fought for the rights of families, for people who needed economic assistance, and for people who needed a chance because she realized that the essence of America is opportunity--opportunity for all, not just for those who are privileged or who have the benefit of wealth or power but for all. She has done this extraordinarily well.  A great deal of her energy was directed to environmental protection because that is something that benefits all of us and that is something that is really the biggest legacy we will give to the next generation and the generations that follow. No one has more fiercely defended the environment--not just for a narrow interest, not just for a temporary expedient but for the long-term health and wealth of the American people.                               Dan Coats  Mr. President, Dan Coats and I served together. This goes back to both his tenures in the Senate. Dan and I served in the Armed Services and HELP Committees. He was a remarkable Member. He continues to be a remarkable Member. He left us for a while to serve as Ambassador to Germany. Once again--no surprise--he distinguished himself with his thoughtful support of American policy, with his international approach to issues of concern, and with the ability to bring people together, not just colleagues in the Senate but, also, international colleagues.  When he returned, I was very, very grateful for his help. Senator Dean Heller and I were working very hard together on a bipartisan basis to help unemployment insurance extension. Dan joined us in that effort, and I thank him for that. It reflects the huge range of talent and interests that he has and, also, his commitment to the men and women of Indiana, particularly the working men and women of Indiana.                               Mark Kirk  Mr. President, Mark Kirk I have mentioned. I had the privilege, the opportunity, and the pleasure of being able to salute him as he was here. Again, we always greet each other as Major Reed and Commander Kirk, and I see deep symbolism and deep affection in regard to that exchange. I wish him well as he goes forth.                              David Vitter  Mr. President, David Vitter and I served together on the Armed Services Committee, and we continue to serve together on the Banking Committee. As a senior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, he has been very critical in ensuring that we continue our commitment to infrastructure. Infrastructure is a word nowthat is getting a lot of attention. Years ago, David was interested in that, not only interested but instrumental in making sure we did our best to keep up with infrastructure so that we could have a productive America, so that people could enjoy the benefits, and so that we could be competitive in a global economy.  He has done a great deal. One area where we also shared an interest is his Home Owner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which became law in 2014. This was critical not just to Louisiana but to every coastal State, including Rhode Island. His energy, his commitment, and his dedication made it a success. I want to thank him for that, and I wish him well as he goes forward.                            Barbara Mikulski  Mr. President, Barbara Mikulski--what an extraordinary individual. She is a pioneer. She was the first Democratic woman Senator elected in her own right. She is the longest serving woman in the history of the Congress. Barbara Mikulski and history are one in the same. She has made it. She came from very modest roots in Baltimore. She talked yesterday on the floor about her father and mother running a small grocery store in her neighborhood. She took that sense of community, that sense of dedication, and that sense of selfless service to others. As she said, she was inspired by the nuns that taught her, and that inspiration was extraordinary and fully realized in her life. There are a lot of Sisters of Mercy and Sisters of Notre Dame who are sitting back today thinking: I knew that young lady had it in her.  She certainly did. She led us on the Appropriations Committee, the first woman to chair the committee. She has done so much to assist me on issues that are so important to Rhode Island. I must say that she and Kit Bond, one of her colleagues, were extraordinary in recognizing the problems of lead exposure in children and providing needed resources. I thank her for that.  She has assisted the fishermen in communities in Rhode Island with real assistance and real aid. She has done it over and over. She has given me profound advice, counsel, and kindness.  She said yesterday on the floor: The best ship in the world is friendship. I agree, but ultimately the measure of our service and of our days is kindness. I must say that by that measure, she is a very towering figure in the Senate, in the history of the United States, and I thank her.                               Harry Reid  Mr. President, finally, there is our leader, Harry Reid. Much has been said about Harry today. I will not go over the extraordinary tale of a young man from Searchlight, NV. He was a boxer and a Capitol Police officer while he was working his way through law school. He has always been a fighter--and a fighter for those who need help, not for the powerful but for the people without power. For those without a voice, he has given a voice.  I have always appreciated his counsel, his guidance, and his support, which were important to my constituents and important to all Americans. We have worked on numerous pieces of legislation together to address the housing crisis, to extend unemployment insurance, to make college more affordable, and to improve mental health services, to name just a few.  As he said today in his remarks, one of his achievements is to be able to give health care protection to millions of Americans who didn't have it and if it is taken away will not have it. He did that because it was the right thing to do, because he understood from his own personal experience how traumatizing and how debilitating and, ultimately, how destructive the lack of access to good health care--both physical health care and mental health care--is to America, and, also, how it does make us productive. Simply having health care is not just a good thing to do, it is a smart economic thing to do. He led that fight for us.  It has been an honor to serve alongside Harry Reid and to see this extraordinary legislator work his way quietly sometimes--many times--but persistently. There is no one more persistent than Harry. His steady, unselfish leadership will continue to guide us and his example will continue to guide us.  I have been very fortunate. I have had the privilege to serve with these ladies and gentlemen, and I want to thank them for their service.                  Tribute to Vice President Joe Biden  Mr. President, I was also very privileged to serve with the Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden. The Vice President was here yesterday. I was here listening to the comments. I must add, if I could, some words of my own.  Joe Biden is a true statesman. I had the privilege of serving with him for over a decade. We traveled together to places such as Afghanistan and Iraq. I am honored to have gotten to know him and his wonderful family. Even though he is Vice President of the United States of America--the second highest office of the land--I know the titles he is proudest to hold are father, grandfather, husband, brother, and, after that, Senator.  A tribute to Joe Biden really has to extend to some others, and one person I want to single out is his sister, Valerie Biden Owens. Val is not only his closest adviser but the architect of his first campaign and every one thereafter. At a time when very few women were running U.S. Senate campaigns, Val was responsible for electing a 29-year-old newcomer. When tragedy struck, she was the one who helped bring him back, who enabled him to serve the people of Delaware and, ultimately, the people of the United States and of the world. She is a brilliant strategist who has gone on to advise many officeholders. We thank her for her lasting contributions, and I wanted to make sure she got some credit.  Both the Vice President and Val are quick to note the real credit goes to their parents--Catherine Jean Finnegan Biden, his mom, and his late, great father, Joe Sr. The Vice President and I would often joke--and it is not a joke; it is actually a truth: Always aspire to be half as good as mom and dad. That is an Irish aspiration. Joe has made it. I am still working on it, but he is at least half as good as these extraordinary people.  If you have spent any time with the Vice President, you know that he is famous for quoting his father and his mother and the wisdom they imparted to all the children--Joe, Val, Jimmy, and Frank. I think you have heard Senator Biden, Chairman Biden, and Vice President Biden say: ``I give you my word as a Biden.'' You know you can take that to the bank. He meant it.  Once you heard that, without hesitation, you know he was there with you and would not equivocate, would not deviate, and would be with you.  I had the privilege of not only working with Senator Biden, but I also had the privilege of working with a young captain in the U.S. Army, at least briefly, as we visited him, and that was CPT Beau Biden of the Delaware National Guard. Beau Biden didn't have to join the National Guard. He didn't have to volunteer for Iraq, but he felt it was his duty and his obligation. When we were together with him in Iraq, you saw someone who personified the very best of this Nation--a soldier, someone conscientious, someone who would give his all, give his life for others and, particularly, give every ounce of energy and service to this great Nation.  Anyone who met Beau knew he was a Biden. He didn't have to say it. He looked like his dad but, more importantly, he acted like his dad--strong, tough, proud, dedicated, committed to helping others, particularly those who needed a chance, who needed a hand up. He had a passion for social justice, compassion, and that element of kindness. In the sum of his days--of Beau's days--he certainly surpassed that test of kindness, decency, and compassion.  The Biden family has known a great deal of tragedy--more than most families--but they have stuck together, and they have shared both moments of triumph and moments of profound sadness. Together, they have shaped history and made this a better nation and a better world. All of us who have had the privilege of knowing Joe, Jill, and their family are better people.  Mr. President, let me thank you. Mr. Vice President, Senator, Joe, thank you.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
