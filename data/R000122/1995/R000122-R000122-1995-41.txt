Chairman, I would seek to engage the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee in a coloquy, if he would be so amendable.  Mr. Chairman, as we know, the administration requested $10 billion for the Rhode Island Freight Rail Development initiative in the fiscal year 1996, to be matched dollar for dollar by the State of Rhode Island. This funding was to be combined with $5 million in fiscal year 1995 funds. Regrettably, the bill does not contain this request.  Is this correct, Mr. Chairman, I would ask the chairman of the subcommittee?
