484, a bill aiming to improve EPA's lead paint rule. He has been a tremendous help throughout the long effort we have had to address this onerous and frustrating regulation. He and I firmly believe that this rule can be implemented in a way that both protects the health of children and pregnant women without unnecessarily raising the cost of construction projects when there exists only a negligible risk of harm. That is what our bill aims to do, and I want to thank him for being in lockstep with us from the beginning.                          ____________________
