 Mr. Speaker, I was listening to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Owens] in my office, and I ran back over here because I just received a telephone call, a frantic call from the gentleman's home State of New York that for over 700 workers in Medina, NY, at the Fisher-Price plant, which is owned by the Mattel Corp., this morning were given a notice, yesterday were given a notice to come in to work this morning at 7:30. They all came in to work, and they all were fired.  And where did their jobs go? Lo and behold, the jobs of over 700 Americans, manufacturing workers, went to Mexico. Why are they going to Mexico? In the company's own words, and I quote, ``The Medina plant historically has been the higher-cost producer and doesn't have the flexibility of other United States/Mexico manufacturing facilities.''  In short, American workers who asked for a more fair wage for the work that they do are punished for it.  I think it is absolutely reprehensible what is going on here, because it is exactly what the critics of NAFTA, like myself, were most afraid to hear, in fact dreaded to hear: Fired by a multinational corporation, Fisher-Price, owned by Mattel, which has been crying the loudest about its investments. Where? In Mexico.  And in the New York Times, on January 5, there was a story on the business page which indicates that Mattel, the Mattel Co., was concerned and wants [[Page H320]] us to bail Mexico out because it is not making as much profits in Mexico as it had hoped to make.  So I want to say to my colleague from New York I am so happy he is down here on the floor. I am sorry that I am the bearer of bad tidings from his State, the northern part of the State. But it was so related to what the gentleman is talking about that I had to run over here and get this on the record.                              {time}  1450  Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to those who are listening with expected United States taxpayer money in their pocket, ``If Congress passes this Mexican bailout, then Mattel will be firing--they have already fired those 700 workers in upper New York State, and they are going to move those jobs to Mexico, and then we are going to back up their investment in Mexico. How is that one for late in the day on Wednesday afternoon?''
