 President, I rise to speak in support of the Conference Report to the Department of Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1996. First, I would like to associate myself with the thoughtful remarks of the distinguished Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Nunn. I continue to believe that this world is not a safe place. I, along with other leaders, had hoped that after the end of the cold war there might be more peace in the world. This has unfortunately not been the case. In fact, there is now more conflagration and more war. The price of freedom continues to be eternal vigilance.  This legislation provides for the hardware and force structure that make our Armed Forces strong. It looks forward to our future defense needs by funding increased procurement of weapons systems vital to our war fighting capability and maintains the troop levels necessary to complete our Nation's military missions.                            Weapons Systems  This bill authorizes funding for more Air Force F-15, and F-16 fighters--the backbones of our air attack strategy. It also funds the F-22 next generation fighter. This aircraft is the cutting edge of any fighter aircraft anywhere in the world. The Hellfire air-to-surface missile, used so effectively in The gulf war, are procured for the Army. The Navy received authorization to purchase additional F-18 fighters which are used to protect our aircraft carriers and for attack. These systems provide our soldiers in the field with overwhelming force, thus protecting their lives as they fight for America.                            Force Structure  The troop strength of our active duty forces and guard and reserve forces is maintained in this bill. Our active duty Armed Forces will be over 1.4 million men and women strong and our guard and reserve forces will total nearly 940,000 soldiers.  The bill enhances our national security by removing the language which would have lead to a U.S. violation of the ABM Treaty and continues the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that helps reduce the risk of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons proliferation.  It fully funds the research, development, test and evaluation account providing millions in funding to develop a theater missile defense system which will be able to protect our troops deployed overseas from Scud and other ballistic missile attacks. Funding in this account will also allow research to develop new alloys and designs for stronger and lighter fighter plane wings and studies to enhance the electric battery life in vehicles for use in new mechanized infantry equipment and in commercial vehicles.  Finally, the conference report for the DOD authorization bill provides many benefits to our men and women in uniform. A much needed 2.4 percent pay raise for our service men and women is included in the bill, as well as increased funding for the family advocacy and the new parents support programs that help military families balance their duty to their country with their responsibility to their family.  Unfortunately, it is also in the area of military personnel that the provisions in this bill with which I disagree most exist. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about just three of these provisions.           Required Discharge of HIV-Positive Service Members  Most of all, I am saddened and angered by one provision of this bill that is the worst type of fear-mongering imaginable.  I never imagined that I would live in a time when Congress would blatantly discriminate against a group of people who contract a disease, but that is exactly what this bill does.  This conference report contains a provision that blatantly discriminates against an entire group of military personnel simply because they are infected with the HIV virus. The Department of Defense will be required to discharge any service member who tests positive for HIV. There are now more than 1,000 people serving in our military who would be discharged within the first 6 months. The fact that these HIV-positive men and women can still perform their duties as ably as other nondeployable military personnel is ignored. There is no other disease for which a member of the Armed Forces can be forced to separate from service.  What message is Congress sending to the businesses of America? It is essentially saying that if someone contracts the HIV virus, they should be immediately discharged regardless of their ability to work. Is this how we intend to treat people who contract a disease? Is this what our country is based upon?  I pray that this mean-spirited provision does not move this country back to the dark ages of discrimination, hate, and fear. It is my sincere hope that this provision will be reversed by a future Congress that better respects the plight of those with the HIV virus or that it will be found unconstitutional by the courts. Restricted Access to Privately-Funded Abortions on U.S. Bases Overseas  The conferees adopted language that prohibits abortions on U.S. military facilities overseas, even if a woman pays for the procedure herself, except in cases of rape, incest, or life of the mother. This provision is discriminatory and has no place on a defense authorization bill.Elimination of Authorizations for Troops to Cops and Troops to Teachers  On the issue of defense conversion, the Senate passed an amendment, cosponsored by Senator Pryor and myself, to authorize $10 million for the Troops to Cops Program and $42 million for the Troops to Teachers Program. These programs greatly assist the difficult transition of service personnel to the private sector in two ways. First, Troops to Cops and Troops to Teachers partially funds the training and hiring costs of local school districts and law enforcement agencies, and second, these programs provide trained and dedicated recruits. I am very disappointed that this provision was eliminated in conference committee.             Lack of Competition for Shipbuilding Contracts  The conference report provides for the construction of destroyers and submarines at designated shipyards without requiring competition for this workload. Competition among qualified industrial facilities is a procurement contracting fundamental. I am disappointed that this provision remained in the bill.  Although I disagree with these provisions, on balance this bill enhances our national defense.      Provides for the Purchase of Additional B-2 Stealth Bombers  I was very pleased to support the authorization for $493 million in long-lead funding for the B-2 stealth bmber. This most technically advanced aircraft in our bomber fleet gives our Air Force the capability of immediate response to a conflict anywhere in the world without the need for escort aircraft to protect it from anti-aircraft fire. Even with this protection, our non-stealthy bombers are unable to penetrate enemy airspace, as we saw in the gulf war. The B-2 also has the ability to precisely target mobile units unlike any other bomber in the fleet today. The B-2's stealth, long-range, and precision munition capability make it a good investment for the money. Provides for Improvements to the Base Realignment and Closure Process  The conference report includes several improvements to the base realignment and closure process. I am particularly proud of the amendment cosponsored by Senator McCain and myself which improves the base realignment and closure reuse process for local communities. One provision of this amendment changes the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994, by requiring that the Secretary of Defense consult with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development over the reuse plan that is developed by the local redevelopment authority. Homeless assistance providers would still be guaranteed a seat at the reuse table, and redevelopment authorities would still be required to accept expressions of interest for base property by homeless assistance groups and other interested parties. In addition, the Secretary of HUD would still review the final reuse plan to ascertain if the needs of the homeless have been met. However, instead of the Secretary of HUD approving or disapproving the reuse plan, the Secretary of Defense would make the final decision. Furthermore, the local redevelopment plan developed by the local community and local elected officials would be given substantial deference by the Secretary of Defense. This puts the power of base reuse firmly where it should be, in the hands of the local redevelopment authority and the community.     Provides for Land Conveyances and Military Construction Projects  Finally, this conference report includes many important land conveyances and military construction projects for California and the Nation. The land conveyance provisions will allow many local communities to redevelop and expand many underutilized industrial sites which will enhance economic growth. And the military construction projects will provide many needed housing units and other military facilities that will better enable our men and women in the Armed Forces to perform their duties.  I voted for the conference report to the DOD authorization bill for fiscal year 1996, however, perhaps next year, we can concentrate on continuing to make our Armed Forces the best that they can be and restore the rights denied our men and women in uniform.
