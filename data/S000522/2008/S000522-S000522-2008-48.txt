Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 369, recognizing May as National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month.  Osteoporosis is often thought of as an older person's disease, but building strong bones during childhood and adolescence can be the best defense. A healthy lifestyle can lower the chances of having osteoporosis by maintaining a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. It is important that Americans monitor their bone health to ensure that they are not one of the 1.5 million victims of fractures that occur annually.  Given its influence on the risk of fragility, fracture, osteoporosis may significantly affect the quality of life for those who do not know about early prevention, assessment, diagnoses, and treatment.  I would especially like to thank the author of the resolution, Ms. Shelley Berkley of Nevada, for raising public awareness of osteoporosis. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the resolution.  I reserve the balance of my time.
