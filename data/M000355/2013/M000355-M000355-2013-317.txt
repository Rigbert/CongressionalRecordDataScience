                           Motion to Proceed  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask that Senators Alexander and Barrasso engage in a colloquy with me about our understanding of the operation of the standing order that the Senate just adopted related to motions to proceed and nominations, and our intent in drafting it.
