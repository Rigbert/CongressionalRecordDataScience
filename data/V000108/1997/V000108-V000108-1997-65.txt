Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Fraternal Order of Police [FOP], Lake County Anton Lodge No. 125. Yesterday, the Lake County FOP began hosting the annual Indiana State Fraternal Order of Police Golf Tournament at Broadmoor Country Club in Merrillville, IN and Summertree Golf Club in Crown Point, IN. Specifically, I would like to congratulate Lake County FOP chairman, Patrick Tracy, and co-chairmen, Robert Porras and Tony Ramirez, on the leadership they have displayed in organizing this event. The Lake County Anton Lodge is expecting the 2-day event to attract over 400 golfers throughout the State of Indiana. Several executive officers of the Indiana Fraternal Order of Police will be in attendance at this tournament, including State president, Mike Cook, State vice-president and Anton Lodge No. 125 president, Tim Downs, national trustee, Robert Imborek, and former national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, R. Pat Stark.  The largest and most commanding voice on behalf of our Nation's law enforcement officers, the FOP was founded in 1915 in Pittsburgh, PA, with the intent of improving the working conditions of police who were assigned long and tedious shifts 365 days of the year. Since 1915, the organization's membership has grown to nearly 2,000 local lodges, with almost 270,000 members nationwide. The FOP has, over the years, successfully served as a unifying voice for the men and women protecting our communities by providing its members with the latest developments in labor and employee relations through both an aggressive schedule of seminars and several prominent publications. Due to the dissemination of information pertaining to bargaining, employee relations, and representation, more labor contracts are negotiated by FOP lodges than by any other professional police association. The FOP proudly attributes its success to the foundation of its organization, which is best described in the phrase ``Police Representing Police.''  The Fraternal Order of Police has also effectively represented the interests of its members through the pursuit of an aggressive national legislative agenda, advancing issues important to rank-and-file law enforcement officers. The National Legislative Program of the FOP, the most active and comprehensive of any law enforcement organization in Washington, is committed to legislation which will support better living and working conditions for law enforcement officers, improve safety for officers on the job, and continue to increase the level of efficiency and professionalism of law enforcement.  Through its local lodges, the Fraternal Order of Police plays a crucial role in bettering the relationship between law enforcement and local communities. Local FOP lodges have been active in such programs as youth sports, drug and crime awareness programs, and other community activities which have served to integrate the efforts of police forces and individual citizens in combating crime. It is through the support of events, like the annual golf tournament, that the FOP can continue its fine work in strengthening our communities.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Fraternal Order of Police, Anton Lodge No. 125, as it hosts the Annual Indiana State Golf Tournament. The work the Lake County Fraternal Order of Police has done for our communities has undoubtedly improved the quality of life in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
