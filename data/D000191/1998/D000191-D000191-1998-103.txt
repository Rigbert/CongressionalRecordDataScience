Speaker, we all had many teachers during our years of education. Some of them were more important than others in assisting our understanding of the world and our place in it. For me, Dan Goldrich was one of the very few who stood head and shoulders above the rest. He helped me develop my ability to think critically and defy conventional wisdom when necessary. He is credentialed as a Professor of PoliticalScience but he taught me much more. Often as I take to the Floor of the House of Representatives to debate issues of human rights, labor rights, international trade, the environment or U.S. foreign policy, Dan's lessons echo in my mind. Dan's teaching didn't end with my graduation from graduate school. He has continued to counsel and assist me during my political career. He has also constantly challenged me and many other former students by the example he sets as a tireless activist and humanitarian. Congratulations on your formal retirement to emeritus status! I fully expect that freedom from the demands of full time teaching will give Dan even more time and energy to inspire a whole new generation of activists who understand the struggle for sustainability, democracy and equity!                          ____________________
