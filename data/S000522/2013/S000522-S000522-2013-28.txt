Mr. Speaker, the Jeffrey Dahmer-like murder trial of an abortionist named Kermit Gosnell is replete with shocking testimony of beheadings, unfathomable abuse, spinal cord snippings, death, and body parts in jars.  But how different, really, is Gosnell's ``house of horrors'' from the abortions that occur in clinics around the country every single day? Not much. Not much at all.  Mr. Speaker, will Americans ever be told the horrifying details as to how and how often abortionists dismember, decapitate, and chemically poison innocent babies?  Last week, reporter Timothy Carney asked participants in a call hosted by the pro-abortion group RH Reality Check:       What is the distinction between what Gosnell did and what a      late-term abortionist like Leroy Carhart does?  Professor Tracy Weitz responded:       When a procedure that usually involves collapsing the skull      is done, it is usually done when the fetus is still in the      uterus, not when the fetus has been delivered.  That's it? It's just a matter of where, in the womb or not, that this violence against children is construed to be okay?  Where is the outrage over 55 million children victims who have been killed by abortion, and where is the appalling lack of compassion?  Why the empathy deficit for the victims, women and children, especially by our President, President Barack Obama?  Women and children deserve better.                          ____________________
