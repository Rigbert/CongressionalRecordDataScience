President, first, I thank my colleague from Ohio. He has taken on a special responsibility for fallen soldiers from his State to come to the floor and pay tribute to each of them. It involves a great deal of work on his part to put together the record of their lives. It also involves a great deal of commitment on his part. He shows again to Members of the Senate that he is a man with great heart, and I know that he speaks not only for himself and his family but for all of us in extending our condolences to the 2,899 American soldiers who have fallen in the war in Iraq. I thank him for doing this on behalf of his State, and I join him in his salute.                          ____________________
