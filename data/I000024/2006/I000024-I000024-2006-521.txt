 The American people do not want obstruction; they want progress from us.  Obstruction was certainly practiced by Senator Daschle, and the people showed their lack of appreciation at the ballot box.  I ask that Members join me in this effort and do what our constituents want for the sake of transparency and honesty.  We ought to have the courage to stand up for our convictions, not hide in the shadows of darkness and anonymity.
