Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, this law needs to be repealed for a host of reasons, especially because of its impact on small businesses and seniors.  Recently, I spoke to an owner of a coal mine in West Virginia which has 24 employees. She told me the act has caused her annual premiums to increase by $84,000.  It was the wrong approach, and it will cost jobs.  Let's not lose sight, though, of our most vulnerable citizens in our society--senior citizens. The law's $500 billion in cuts to Medicare is unconscionable. Reducing benefits for some senior citizens and jeopardizing access to other care is unacceptable to those of our Greatest Generation.  Congress should never have broken its promise that it made decades ago by cutting the health care senior citizens deserve. Let's repeal it and replace it with something that is bipartisan, that lowers costs, that saves jobs, and that protects our senior citizens.
