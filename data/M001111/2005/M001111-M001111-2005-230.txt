 President. I would like to briefly explain the scope of the Transit New Start project listed as ``Seattle Monorail Project Post-Green Line Extensions.'' The project authorization does not authorize any Federal funding for the 14-mile Green Line approved by Seattle voters in November 2002. The 14-mile Green Line was approved by voters using entirely local funds. The authorization in this bill is for a possible second monorail line or an extension of the Green Line following construction of the 14-mile line.
