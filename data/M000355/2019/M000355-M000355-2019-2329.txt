  All but four yesterday voted against the motion to proceed to S. 1, and I am assuming they will vote against it again this afternoon. S. 1--the bill they are preventing us from going to--has wide bipartisan support and is a critical step in supporting our allies in the Middle East and securing peace in Syria.  I have talked to many Americans who are intensely interested in the Israel issues. They don't understand why this important legislation would be stymied over a dispute over something entirely different.  Through the Chair, I ask Senator Cardin if this blockade against business on the floor is absolute.
