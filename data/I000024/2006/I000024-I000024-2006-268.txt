President, as chairman and on behalf of my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, I would like to recognize the dedicated public works professionals, engineers, and administrators who represent State and local governments throughout the United States and was pleased to introduce S. Res. 475 proclaiming the week of May 21-May 27, 2006, as National Public Works Week.  As we celebrate the contributions of the tens of thousands of men and women in America who provide and maintain the infrastructure and services that Americans rely on every day, let us not forget these same people are our first responders too. More often than not, they are on the scene before police, fire, and medical personnel. They can be found clearing roads, restoring water and power as well as critical infrastructure lifelines following disasters. Only in the absence of these dutiful public servants, would we truly recognize how valuable their tireless efforts are in providing and maintaining the basic infrastructure that many Americans often take for granted.  America's public infrastructure is the lifeblood of every community. It includes the roads, bridges, public transportation and airports, the drinking water and wastewater treatment systems, the solid waste services and facilities and other important utilities essential to our quality of life. These structures and services help sustain community life, safeguard the environment, protect our health, support our economy and allow people and goods to move safely and efficiently. These structures and services are truly public goods.  Because of my work on the most recent transportation law, SAFETEA-LU, Public Law 109-59, I have a better appreciation of just how important a reliable, well maintained and fully functioning network of interstate highways and transportation infrastructure is to the Nation. America's transportation system is one of the world's most expensive, with more than 3.9 million miles of roads, 5,300 public-use airports, 26,000 miles of navigable waterways, and more than 173,000 route-miles serviced by buses and rail in urban areas.  Transportation-related goods and services contribute more than $1.3 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product, about 11 percent of the total.  Furthermore, every $1 billion invested in roads and bridges generates approximately 47,500 jobs. Not only are infrastructure investments of the most fundamental and important functions of government, but they are also financially wise.  The Nation's 54,000 community drinking water systems supply drinking water to more than 250 million Americans, and municipal wastewater treatment systems each year prevent billions of tons of pollutants from reaching our rivers, lakes, stream, and coastlines. By keeping water supplies free of contaminants, these water utilities protect human health and preserve the environment. Additionally, our water infrastructure supports a $50 billion a year water-based recreation industry, at least $300 billion a year in coastal tourism, a $45 billion annual commercial fishing and shell fishing industry, and hundreds of billions of dollars a year in basic manufacturing which rely on clean water.  Clearly, public works professionals play a vital role in protecting the environment, improving public health and safety, contributing to economic vitality and enhancing the quality of life of every community of the United States.I am delighted to use this National Public Works Week to thank them for their diligent and continued service.                          ____________________
