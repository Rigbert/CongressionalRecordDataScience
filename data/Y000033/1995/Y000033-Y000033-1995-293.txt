Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Studds] mentioned, this is a bipartisan bill. This is not the first time that he and I have addressed this issue. We want to stress that 25 million acres of land now is under military jurisdiction for training of our personnel for military purposes. What we are trying to do in this bill and with the original bill was to make sure the military recognized the extraordinary value. Most military bases are in the proximity of urban areas. They are truly the wildlife refuge areas of the urban people. They are also very valuable for those resource activities, which I think are also very valuable for the maintaining and the management of those species; that is, in fact, the wildlife itself, for fishing and hunting and recreational purposes.  Mr. Speaker, under this act, with the help of the gentleman from Massachusetts, I do believe we strengthen the DOD and in fact direct them to better manage those resources available to them. The 25 million acres of land, refuge land that is under military jurisdiction today, is actually more land than we have in any other part of our natural Federal use lands in the lower 48. Therefore, I do urge the passage of this legislation. It is good legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
