 The yeas and nays have been ordered on it. So before this bill is finally adopted, their amendment will be in order at some point.  We are trying to move our way through, Mr. President, to the end of this evening. The majority leader has said we will finish this bill tonight. There are a number of amendments that are pending. We hope to dispose of all of them before it gets too late this evening.  I again ask unanimous consent as I said before.
