 Before we begin, I would also like to thank my colleague for his willingness to have this discussion on an issue of great importance to national security and to many of the Air National Guard personnel in my State.  Let me start by saying that I think most of my colleagues understand that while the world today has changed, some things have stayed the same. When you are trying to stop terrorists, just like organized crime, you have to follow the money. These days, in order to follow the money, you have to have the very best in information operations skills. You have to understand the computerized financial networks and security systems used by financial institutions. In addition, you have to be able to protect your own information. This is a critical aspect of the war on terrorism and one where the Government needs more capability.  Last year, the Defense Authorization Conference Report provided 30 additional Air Guard personnel that we had hoped would be used to stand up a new unit in Delaware to do this mission. This year, Senator Carper and I had hoped to finish that work by providing a total of 60 personnel for that unit. Unfortunately, we are not able to do that because the Department of Defense has not evaluated this proposal to determine whether it is a mission that should be assigned to the Air National Guard.  We understand that the Department of Defense has an established process for assigning missions and determining the manning necessary to support those missions. Expanding the information operations capability of a unit or units within the Air National Guard has not been considered through this process.
