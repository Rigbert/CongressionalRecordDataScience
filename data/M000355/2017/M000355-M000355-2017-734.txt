 President, I listened carefully to Chairman McCain talking about his long association with Joe. I thought maybe it was appropriate, I would say to my colleague from Arizona, to point out that he eliminated an awful lot of my earmarks over the years.  Mr. McCAIN. Great job.  Mr. McCONNELL. I will have fond reflections as well, in a sense. I want to join you, Senator McCain, in congratulating Joe for a great job for you and for our country for a very long time.  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you.
