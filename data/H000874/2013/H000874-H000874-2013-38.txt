Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill which will undermine the providing of health care at affordable prices for millions and millions and millions of Americans.  We said to those Americans that prior to the adoption of this act if they had a policy, they could keep it. That was accurate. It didn't say that the insurance companies would have to continue to offer it, which, as I understand it, that side of the aisle wouldn't be for in any event. The fact of the matter is that statement was correct.  Subsequent to that, there were policies offered and insurance companies knew and policyholders should have known because it was in the law that they would be subject to minimum requirements. Why? Because as The Heritage Foundation said when it originally came up with this idea, everybody ought to take personal responsibility.  I have heard a lot of talk on your side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, about personal responsibility. I believe in that.  The Upton bill, as everybody knows, will skew the risk pool and encourage adverse selection. Anybody who knows anything about insurance knows that if you have adverse selection, the prices for those who need insurance will go up very substantially while, yes, the prices for those who don't need insurance will go down very sharply. Quite frankly, if all of us knew we would never be in an automobile accident, we wouldn't have to have automobile insurance, except, of course, the law in almost every State requires us to have it so that others will be protected as well.
