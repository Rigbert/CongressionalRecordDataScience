President, when most of us think about health we think about it on a personal or local level. Perhaps a child is suffering from an ear infection or an outbreak of chicken pox has emptied the local elementary school. But when Dr. Nils Daulaire thinks about health it is from a global perspective, and I am delighted to report that Nils was recently named the next President and CEO of the National Council for International Health.  I have known Nils for many years. He is a fellow Vermonter and a trusted friend whose advice I have valued enormously. Nils' boundless energy and devotion to helping others is an inspiration to everyone who knows him. He is as comfortable tending to a sick child in a remote village in Nepal as he is representing the United States Government in international health policy negotiations. Over the years, Nils has earned a reputation as a leading authority in the public health field.  During his tenure as Senior Health Adviser at the Agency for International Development, Nils worked to ensure that international health is a major focus of AID's efforts worldwide. He played a central role in convening a conference of health agencies and organizations to develop a multi-year U.S. strategy to strengthen global surveillance and control of infectious disease. Nils' leadership was instrumental in the strategy that emerged from that conference, which should, over time, result in a significant reduction in the number of deaths from infectious disease. As the new head of NCIH whose membership includes over 1,000 medical professionals and organizations, Nils' continued involvement in this initiative will be critical to its success.  The NCIH's mission to improve global health is a monumental task. I cannot think of a person more capable of leading NCIH into the next century than Nils Daulaire. He is a straight talker and he knows what he is talking about. He understands the medical issues and he understands the political issues. Once Nils begins his new job on August 1, NCIH's operations will be split between Nils in Vermont and his other capable staff in Washington. I look forward to continuing our close working relationship on infectious disease, on maternal health, and other important issues.  Mr. President a June 24, 1998, article in the Washington Post described Nils Daulaire's contribution to the field of international health. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  The article follows:               [From the Washington Post, June 24, 1998]                  A Man to Make Health a Global Issue                             (By Judy Mann)       Nils Daulaire, the U.S. government's leading authority on      international health, is leaving his post as senior health      adviser to the Agency for International Development to become      president and CEO of the National Council on International      Health.       The NCIH is an organization of more than 1,000 medical      professionals and organizations; pharmaceutical companies      such as Merck and Becton Dickinson & Co.; government agencies      such as the Peace Corps and the Centers for Disease Control      and Prevention; international relief organizations such as      CARE, Save the Children and Project Hope; Planned Parenthood;      religious relief agencies; and universities such as Harvard      and John Hopkins. It receives funding from the MacArthur,      Kellogg, Ford and Turner foundations, and some government      financing.       Based in the United States, its mission is to advance      policies and programs that improve health around the world.      But a recent blue-ribbon panel headed by former surgeon      general C. Everett Koop recommended a major restructuring of      the organization. The new NCIH will focus on the need for      improving global health and making health one of the      cornerstones of globalization, on a par with international      trade, currency flows and information and communication. A      32-member board is being replaced by a smaller board where      leading medical experts can cross-fertilize ideas with      experts in development and leaders in the private sector.       The Koop report also recommended hiring a president and CEO      with international stature, which the board has done:      Daulaire, 49, is a Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude      graduate of Harvard College and received his medical degree      from Harvard Medical School. He has a master's in public      health from Johns Hopkins. He has spent two decades in      fieldwork, including five years in Nepal, and has provided      technical assistance in more than 20 countries. He speaks      seven languages.       He was the lead U.S. negotiator at the Cairo International      Conference on Population and Development in 1994, the Beijing      World Conference on Women in 1995 and the Rome World Food      Summit in 1996. He has represented the United States in the      last five World Health Organization assemblies and was      helpful in the election of Gro Brundtland, former prime      minister of Norway, to be director general-elect of WHO with      a mission to revitalize it.       New leadership of both of these organizations holds      enormous potential for putting health at the center of      efforts to improve living conditions around the world. NCIH      plans to change its name to the Global Health Council and      aims to become, within five years, the preeminent      nongovernmental source of information, practical experience,      analysis and public advocacy for the most pressing global      health issues.       ``You can get more done from the outside than the inside,''      Daulaire says. ``In terms of my work over the last five      years, if I had had an outside organization that was highly      effective in explaining things to the public, tying people      together, involving the private sector, it would have made my      job much more effective. When you look at the whole movement      toward a globalized economy, you can't have enormous      differentials in health status. You can't have disruption of      economies and trade due to the spread of disease.       ``A reason disease is uncorrected is people accept it as      natural,'' Daulaire says. ``One of the consequences of the      global communications revolution is people [elsewhere] will      be aware of how good we have it. They will see their poor      conditions and have an awareness that this is not a necessary      condition.''       When he first arrived in Nepal 20 years ago, ``I thought      I'd landed in the 14th century. Kids had never seen a wheeled      vehicle. When I went back five years ago, there were      satellite dishes and cellular phones.'' The use of      information technology as a tool for health care workers and      educating people in poor, rural areas has led to astounding      changes in the last 15 years, he says.       Currently, the council's top health priorities are AIDS,      maternal health, family planning and infectious diseases. It      plans to increase public and private funding to improve      effectiveness in these areas through sharing information      about what works best. Using cutting-edge technology and      communication is a key component of its plans. It plans to be      ready for emerging diseases.       Daulaire believes the damage to foreign assistance programs      by congressional budget hackers has to be reversed, but he      also recalls a conversation with a staffer who works for a      prominent Republican. He bluntly told Daulaire that these      programs may be the right things to do but they have no      constituency and so they were ``going to get hammered.''       The new NCIH plans to develop that constituency so that      people, governments and the private sector understand that      countries can't participate in the global economy when they      are dragged down by health care costs that can be avoided.      Daulaire sees a major role for the private sector in      promoting global health, and already Becton Dickinson & Co.,      a multinational medical technology company, has indicated a      keen interest in developing a major partnership with the new      NCIH.       Daulaire's appointment is to be announced officially      tomorrow at the NCIH's 25th annual meeting. He takes office      Aug. 1, bringing to the post a rare blend of medical      expertise, optimism, fieldwork, knowledge of bureaucracies, a      network of relationships with health experts and politicians      around the world, and an unusual ability to articulate      complicated health and development issues to the media.       Global health is not them; it is all of us. Daulaire is the      person to move that principle into the center of efforts to      raise standards of living around the world.                          ____________________
