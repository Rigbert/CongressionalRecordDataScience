Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Quinn). All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the bill shall be considered by section as an original bill for the purpose of amendment, and each section is considered read.
