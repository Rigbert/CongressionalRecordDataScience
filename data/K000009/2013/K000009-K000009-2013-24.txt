 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate's bipartisan compromise to end the government shutdown, reopen the government, avert a debt default, and pay our bills to spur economic growth and job creation in this country.  This compromise today is what the American people expect of us. They are tired of the partisan bickering and the economic uncertainty that the deadlock has created. The biggest challenge facing our country is creating growth to help to balance the budget. We can start by coming together on a budget agreement.  So let's restore regular order. Let the Budget Committee go back to work. Let the Ways and Means Committee go back to work. Let the Appropriations Committee go back to work under regular order, not just continuing resolutions. And let us move our bills in regular order and not govern from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis.  I will vote for this this evening. It is the best we could get under the circumstances, but it is far less than we are capable of.
