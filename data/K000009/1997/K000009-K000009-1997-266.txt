Speaker, one key reform essential to assure strong economic growth in our U.S. marketplace as well as to reduce the chronic U.S. trade deficit, is to upgrade the skill level of our U.S. trade negotiators. America must move our products into foreign markets, and assure that our trade negotiators are trustworthy.  The bill, the Professional Trade Service Corps, would achieve these goals by creating an accomplished professional body of American trade negotiators. Just like diplomats in our Foreign Service, our trade representatives are America's conveyors of our Nation's economic and political interests.  Specifically, the act authorizes the creation of the Professional Trade Service Corps to fill key trade positions in the six Federal agencies with major trade-related functions or offices. It will insure better coordination and continuity of service among the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the State Department, the Commerce Department, the Agriculture Department, the Labor Department, and the Treasury Department in their trade-related functions.  We would not allow graduates of West Point to lead foreign armies against our country. We should not allow trade negotiators trained at taxpayer expense to leave Government service and represent foreign interests against the best interests of our Government. We must treat this situation as seriously as any international proceeding.  There is a revolving door at the highest levels of government service that foreign interests use to manipulate our trade policies and destroy U.S. industries and jobs. This bill will go a long way to establishing standards to remedy this egregious problem.  The Professional Trade Service Corps Act will create a cadre of career trade professionals similar to the Foreign Service, identify key trade-related positions, and staff these positions with broadly trained experts in this highly specialized area. Just as importantly, it establishes a career path for continued government service and advancement, encourages continuity of staffing with the carrot of incentives, and the stick of postemployment restrictions.  This corps of trade professionals will be constituted of applicants chosen through a rigorous selection process. They will be carefully trained to establish a high level of excellence in these key trade positions.  To meet these objectives, this act establishes a Trade Service Corps Institute to provide specialized training which will include: the history of U.S. trade negotiations; trade negotiating strategies; the economics and politics of trade; the cultural and business practices of countries with which the United States has significant trade relations; foreign language instruction; and instruction in the operations within and the interrelationships among the various trade-related agencies.  This act will require the Professional Trade Service Corps members to remain in government service for a period of time at least three times the length of their training, and subject them, as well as the legislative branch, to postemployment restrictions in their representation of foreign interests in trade-related matters.  It is time to stop the revolving door which threatens our trade interests and jobs. This bill is an important step in that direction. The Professional Trade Service Corps Act presents a comprehensive strategy for improving the quality and integrity of our trade negotiators. We must protect our economic and trade interests; to do otherwise is to compromise our national security.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of all of my distinguished colleagues and ask that they join me in cosponsoring the Professional Trade Services Corps Act of 1997.                          ____________________
