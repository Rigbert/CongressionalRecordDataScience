Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This gives us 14\1/2\ months of certainty for critical programs with the FAA. It is a bipartisan product. I would rather that we had been doing a long-term authorization, more substantial policy, but this is an acceptable resolution.  The safety title gives the FAA authority to more rigorously go after people who use laser pointers, idiots who use laser pointers, potentially causing catastrophic accidents and high damage; to go after people who are interfering in stopping firefighting efforts with drones; shore up cybersecurity for safety critical aviation infrastructure.  The FAA, something I have been pursuing for years, will step up its oversight of overseas aircraft repair and overhaul facilities, where more and more work is being done, where they do not live up to U.S. standards. Some of the people at the FAA had come up with a brilliant new idea which was disqualifying people eminently qualified and already working as air traffic controllers from becoming air traffic controllers. We fix that problem. We balance the need for integration of drones with the need to protect the general public and the national airspace and a number of other critical provisions.  With that, I recommend my colleagues support the legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.
