I thank the gentleman for continuing to yield, Mr. Chairman, and respond that it will happen over time, as financial inducements are provided. As some of our colleagues pointed out earlier in the debate, when money is provided, some women may be induced to sell their eggs; and many thousands, if not tens of thousands of eggs will be produced over time. There will be a magnet provided to these women, especially the poorer women, to offer up their eggs for this kind of operation.
