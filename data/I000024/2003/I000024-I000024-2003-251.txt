Not many people are aware of the fact that Senator Voinovich was the head of the National Governors Association Clean Air Committee and has been working on it for a long time.  I only add to his comments and ask him if he is in agreement that we have 180 pages here, and almost all of this was done during the Clinton administration. All the data that would be available for the NAS is found in the results that are very positive in this report. So I certainly hope this is an accommodating way for the Senator from North Carolina to say, yes, we want the input of the NAS; we don't want to wait 6 more months.
