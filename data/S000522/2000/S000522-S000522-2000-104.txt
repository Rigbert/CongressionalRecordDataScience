Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, this House should not go on record as taking these kinds of funds out of these other important programs, and I would relate to just one, the BEA, the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce.  This amendment would reduce its funds by almost 20 percent. Chairman Alan Greenspan rarely goes on public record of suggesting increased funding for any agency. In the BEA, as he has suggested, for the importance of that statistical calculation, we need more money in that agency. Already we have shortchanged, we have reduced the funding for that agency in the last few years by a real 12 percent.  This amendment would take an additional 20 percent out of their funds, that is the basis of over a $100 billion in revenue sharing. It is the basis of the projections of OMB and CBO. We should not go on record of this kind of drastic reduction in these kinds of agencies.                              {time}  1230
