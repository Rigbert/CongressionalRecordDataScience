 President, I would like to share with my colleagues a letter I have written to a family in Kentucky that is going to have a very special ceremony. Tomorrow, February 27, in Louisville, KY, the family of 1LT John V. Scanlan will receive on his behalf the Prisoner of War Medal.  Lieutenant Scanlan, of Louisville, served in the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II and was lost in 1945 when he was shot down over Japan. Now, more than 60 years later, he will be honored for the full extent of his valiant service to this Nation.  So I ask my colleagues to join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to the family of 1LT John V. Scanlan on their very important day. We must let them know that their sacrifice will always be revered by our Nation.  Mr. President, the letter reads as follows:       Dear Catherine Wiggins and members of the Scanlan family,       It is never too late to honor bravery and sacrifice. That's      why you have my respect and gratitude today as you accept the      Prisoner of War Medal for First Lieutenant John V. Scanlan.       On June 23, 1945, Lieutenant Scanlan climbed aboard his P-     51 Mustang aircraft and set out from Iwo Jima for what would      be his final mission. Only later would his family learn about      that mission's terrible end. I cannot imagine your family's      horror at learning what happened to a good and brave man at      the hands of the enemy.       And yet that was not the end of your family's service to      America. John's two brothers also wore their country's      uniform. One of them, Colonel Joseph William Scanlan of the      U.S. Air Force, was a career officer who raised his family      all over the world. And his daughter Catherine remembers the      trips to Arlington Cemetery on Veterans Day, when her father      would tell her about the Uncle Jack she never knew.       Those who receive the Prisoner of War Medal set an example      of courage and patriotism that inspires us all. Through      unspeakable conditions, they uphold their oath to defend      America with honor and dignity. You have always known of      Lieutenant Scanlan's heroism from stories passed down through      generations. With this ceremony, his fellow citizens will      know it too.       First Lieutenant John V. Scanlan flies a different mission      now. He served his country with pride, and has earned his      well-deserved peace. Our nation cannot be grateful enough for      his immense sacrifice. May God bless him, and may He continue      to bless your wonderful family.           Sincerely,                                                  Mitch McConnell,     United States Senate.                          ____________________
