First, give credit to the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi. He began this effort 14 years ago. He is a small businessman by profession and when he came to the Senate he saw a problem that needed to be solved and he has done yeoman's work to reach this point in the debate.  I salute him for that effort. I thank him for allowing me to join and bring it to the floor this day. Special thanks to Senator Alexander from Tennessee, who has been an able partner in allowing us to bring this matter before the Senate.  This is an issue every American can understand. We now live in the Internet age. Internet retailers are selling things over the Internet that we are buying every single day. Estimates are that $150 billion in sales are made each year over the Internet. That is part of America. It is part of our economy. But it has created an unfairness which we need to address with this legislation.  Back home in Massachusetts, in Illinois, in Tennessee, in Florida, there people with shops and businesses who get up every morning and open those shops, watch their employees file in and do business locally. When they make their sales of goods and services, they collect the sales taxes which each State requires and they collect other taxes as well.
