President, Organ transplantation is one of the most remarkable success stories in the history of medicine. No longer is it considered experimental. Today, transplants are accepted as the best treatment for certain diseases, including End Stage Renal Disease. Approximately 28,000 organ transplants were performed last year in the U.S. The vast majority of transplants are provided to patients in need of a kidney.  Our Medicare system provides health care to millions of aged and disabled Americans, as well as those living with ESRD, each year. Thousands of Americans receive a Medicare-covered kidney transplant each year through the Medicare ESRD Program, which also covers dialysis, immunosuppressive drugs, and other medically important services.  Unfortunately, there are long waiting lists for people who need an organ. Today there are over 98,000 individuals waiting for a transplant. For those lucky enough to receive one, the next challenge is to obtain coverage for immunosuppressive drugs--medications that organ transplant recipients must take every day for the life of their transplant to reduce the risk of organ rejection.  In 2000, Congress wisely eliminated the 36-month time limitation for Medicare-aged and Medicare-disabled beneficiaries who had Medicare status at the time of transplant. Today, for an older or disabled person on Medicare, coverage for immunosuppressive drugs is covered for the life of the transplant.  However, we still have an unfair and unrealistic gap in coverage for people with ESRD who are neither disabled nor elderly. For those transplant recipients, coverage for immunosuppressive drugs ends 36 months after transplantation. For example, Medicare would pay for a 26-year-old womanliving with ESRD to have lifelong dialysis at $50,000 per year. Medicare would cover the cost of a transplant for her at $100,000 per transplant operation. But, the immunosuppressive drugs she would need to ensure the organ is not rejected by her body are only covered by Medicare for 36 months, even though the drugs cost the Government only $15,000 per year.  This is economically inefficient and morally wrong. Without regular access to immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection, many patients find themselves back in a risky and frightening place--in need of a new kidney. This senseless cycle of care costs taxpayers a lot of money and puts thousands of lives on the line.  I am pleased to introduce today, along with my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Thad Cochran, the Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients Act. This legislation would alleviate the disparity between coverage for immuno-suppresive drugs among Medicare beneficiaries. It is time to provide lifetime coverage for immunosuppressive drugs through Medicare. We will reduce the need for dialysis and kidney re-transplants and provide reliable, sustained access to critically important, life-saving medications for thousands of Americans. In the long run, we will save money and lives.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2320       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
