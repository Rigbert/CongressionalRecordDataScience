 President, later today the Senate will take up and attempt to pass the JOBS Act. So we find ourselves once again on the cusp of passing a bipartisan jobs package that will make it easier for entrepreneurs and innovators to get the capital they need to build businesses and create jobs.  As I said yesterday, this bill had overwhelming bipartisan support over in the House. Nearly 400 Members voted for it, and the President himself says it will create jobs. He supports it, and he would sign it when we get it to him.  Yet for some reason some in the Democratic-controlled Senate seem intent on slowing it down. Others want to essentially take a step actually backward and undermine a critical provision sponsored by Senators Toomey, Carper, and Hutchison included in the House bill, and that was just this week, endorsed by the SEC's Forum on Small Business Capital Formation. The Reed amendment could subject thousands of businesses to SEC regulation unnecessarily, and the Senate should reject it.  So, once again, I ask them to reconsider. Let's put politics aside and pocket this important bipartisan jobs bill.  The JOBS Act is a great example of the type of legislation we should all be able to agree on, and there is simply no good reason for delay. Let's get this done. Let's get it to the President's desk and have him sign it into law.                          ____________________
