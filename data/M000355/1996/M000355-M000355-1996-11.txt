 President, I rise today to recognize an icon of Kentucky journalism. For over 20 years, Al Smith has been part of what he calls ``front-porch, cracker-barrel kind of discussion'' on Kentucky radio. But part of that career, and part of a Kentucky tradition, has ended with his announcement of retirement.  Albert P. Smith, Jr., was born in Sarasota, FL, but has lived in Kentucky since 1958. When Al was 15, he entered the American Legion's high school oratorical contest. Living with his parents and grandparents in Hendersonville, TN, he received coaching for the contest from his grandmother and won the top national prize, a $4,000 college scholarship. He then traveled to New England, the Midwest and the South giving the speech in cities throughout the region. It was on this trip that Al sharpened his speaking skills.  In the mid 1960's, Al bought a 10 percent interest in the Russellville News-Democrat and Leader. That interest eventually grew to his ownership of six weekly newspapers. In 1974, while Al was editor of the News-Democrat, he became a household name as host of the radio program, ``Comment on Kentucky.'' Once a week, he would drive 180 miles to host the show. The man who hired Al to do that job, O. Leonard Press, told the Lexington Herald-Leader, ``I can't imagine the Kentucky landscape without Al.''  Al is still host and producer of ``Comment on Kentucky,'' Kentucky Educational Television's longest-running show. But last month, Al retired from his job as host of ``PrimeLine with Al Smith'' which is broadcast statewide via radio. He never planned to retire from the show; but recent health problems have necessitated a change in his busy lifestyle. His regular listeners will miss him greatly.  But perhaps Al's biggest fan is his wife of 29 years, Martha Helen. In an interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader, Martha Helen said of Al, ``I still believe Al is the most interesting person I ever met.''  Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Al Smith for his dedication to Kentucky journalism and I wish him great happiness in his retirement.                          ____________________
