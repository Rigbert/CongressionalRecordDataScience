  In section 3, Section 1085(e)(2) of the bill, you prohibit the use of an agent or proxy to place wagers unless the agent or proxy is acting on behalf of a licensed parimutuel facility ``in the operation of the account wagering system owned or operated by the parimutuel facility.'' What if a facility licensed to operate an account wagering system engages a separate company to provide the technical expertise necessary to implement an interactive account wagering system on its behalf. Would such an agency fall within the scope of the permitted agency provisions of the bill referenced above?
