President, let me say at the outset that the modification requested by Senator Conrad is one that merely defines a term within the bill and does it in a fashion that I think is entirely reasonable. It says that if land has not been cropped or planted because it has been in a disaster status, certainly, that will not be covered by the amendment which I have limiting the opportunities for Federal payment. This is entirely reasonable. I am happy to accept it.  On the modification by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, I have agreed to this, even though I have serious misgivings about it. But I have the assurance of the Senator from Texas, and all Senators who are now engaged in this debate, that we will continue to look at this extremely closely as we approach the conference committee to make certain we have done something that is fair and reasonable.  But it is in the spirit of moving this forward for the 260,000 legal immigrants who will now be eligible for food stamps in our country that I have agreed to and accept this second-degree amendment.  As the Senator from Indiana has alluded to, what we have done is twofold. What we have said is, if you have cropland in America that has not been planted, or you have not produced on that land at least 1 year out of the last 5, or 3 out of the last 10, in that circumstance, you cannot qualify for Federal assistance.  That is an effort to make certain we don't encourage overproduction for Federal subsidy.
