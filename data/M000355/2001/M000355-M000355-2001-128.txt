 President, this has been a long and interesting debate, and before I begin my final remarks I would like to thank my superb staff, the senior member of which is Tam Somerville. Now staff director of the Rules Committee, she is a long-time veteran of these wars going back to the filibusters of 1988--a good friend and a great colleague. I thank her for her outstanding work over the years on this subject. And Hunter Bates, my chief of staff, has done superb work on this and a great many other mattersover the years, and an old friend going back well over a decade. And new members of the team: Andrew Siff, the general counsel of the Rules Committee, who Senator McCain and I would have to agree sort of staffed both sides at times during this debate and did an outstanding job; Brian Lewis, also of the Rules Committee, and John Abegg of my staff, who have been marvelous in this whole debate.  Now, Mr. President, the theory of this bill, the underlying theory, is that there is too much money in politics, in spite of the fact that last year Americans spent more on potato chips than they did on politics.
