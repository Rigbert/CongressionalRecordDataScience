 Speaker, I am pleased to be joined tonight by several other Members who will be speaking in a moment.  Mr. Speaker, most of the discussion today dealt with the need for welfare reform, of which there is not a whole lot of disagreement, but I was rather shocked at how superficial in many ways the discussion about welfare reform today has been.  Illegitimate children and the problem of drug addiction and the very serious crime problem that we face as a Nation are not the causes of poverty and are not the causes of the need for welfare. Rather, to a large degree, it is the reverse, the opposite that is true.  In many respects, our country is becoming a poorer and poorer Nation. And not to talk about the causes of poverty, the loss of millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs, the decline in the wages that our working people are receiving, the growth of low-wage jobs, not to talk about that reality when we talk about welfare is absolutely absurd.  Mr. Speaker, between 1979 and 1992, the number of full-time workers earning wages under the poverty line increased from 12 to 18 percent. Eighteen percent of our workers now are earning poverty wages. Between 1990 and 1992, half of the women in the United States who found full-time jobs were earning the poverty wage.
