President, I have a simple unanimous consent request, but before I do, I congratulate the new Senator from Alabama. It is unusual that I have someone here taller than I am.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to yield the remainder of my time on the issue before us to the senior Senator from New York.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator has that right.  The Senator from Virginia.
