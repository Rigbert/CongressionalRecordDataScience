 President, the C-SPAN viewers of America rarely have seen the Senate in applause such as they saw it a few minutes ago, but also it illustrates how well we have worked together on a bipartisan basis to try to address the significant crisis confronting our country's financial system.  We have seen, over the last 2 weeks, a coming together. Both of the candidates for President of the United States are here tonight. We had unprecedented cooperation between the majority leader and the Republican leader and our designees, Senator Gregg and Senator Dodd, who did a superb job bringing both sides together to craft a package we could proudly passtonight for the American people on a bipartisan basis.  This is a big moment in the Senate. This is the kind of vote we were sent by our people to cast, and I wish to express my pride and my gratitude to Members, my pride in the institution, and my gratitude for Members who wrestled with this very difficult challenge and who have helped us come together with a package we believe will address the Main Street problems facing America as a result of the credit crunch.  Right in the middle of the heat of a Presidential election, we have been able to put that aside and come together and do something important for our country. I think it is one of the finest moments in the history of the Senate. I congratulate all Members of the Senate for participating in this, and I obviously urge that it be supported.  I yield the floor.
