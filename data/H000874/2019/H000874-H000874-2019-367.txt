Speaker, I thank the Speaker for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate   Don Young, who the minority leader and the Speaker have both indicated loves this House. The minority leader then added apparently you haven't worked a day in your life, at least that is how I interpreted it, Don. That was a liberal interpretation, you know, this side of the aisle. What can I tell you?  We just lost the longest-serving Member of the House just a few weeks ago, and as I sat here, I thought, what a resemblance there is between the longest-serving Democrat of the House and the longest-serving Republican of the House: irascible comes to mind; caring about this institution comes to mind; faithful to principle comes to mind; blunt, speaks truth, not only to power, but to everybody else as well.   Don Young has made a difference.    Don Young comes from Alaska, as all of us know, although the Speaker and the minority leader recognized that he came from California, but, Don, you have really made a difference, particularly for your State.  As chairman of Natural Resources, you were focused like a laser on making sure that your State was treated fairly. I know there are still some things you didn't accomplish that you would like to have accomplished, and you have much time left to do that, but the fact is all of us have benefited, I think, from your honesty, your recognition of how the House ought to work, and, yes, your regular order, which you demanded and didn't always get.  Of course, you took that with just very low-key responses, as I recall, walking by your seat from time to time.                              {time}  1415  But Don Young is an institution. Don Young is an institutionalist. Don Young is the kind of Member that makes this House, over the decades, work as constructively as it can, not as constructively as it should.  Hopefully, we will follow Don Young and John Dingell's example, because both of them are lions of partisanship, but both of them were not only willing but thought it appropriate to work across the aisle to reach objectives that they could hold in common.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Don for his service. Don and I have served together for 37 years. Between us, we have a little bit of time on us. I look forward to serving with him for some years to come. God bless him and Godspeed.
