 Speaker, if we were to believe the television and radio and even the newspapers, we would think that the most important figures in America are professional athletes, movie stars, rock performers, and financial tycoons.  But we all know that this is not true. There are millions of Americans who do heroic work every day. Some are teachers, some nurses, some work in day care. Some prepare meals for the elderly; others take care of their elderly parents or of spouses or children who are ill or disabled. Men and women all over America go off to work each day, sometimes at two or even three jobs, to make sure that there is food on the table for their families, and money to send their children to college.  Today, I want to recognize five citizens of Vermont who are heroes: Mary Jean Inglee, Emma Katherine Ely, Bev Priest, Theresa Emmons, and Christina Crawford. They come from every corner of Vermont, and each has been tireless in advocating for the needs of the low-income citizens of our state.  Mary Jean Inglee was born in Whitehall, New York and raised in an Irish Catholic Democratic family. She graduated from Whitehall High School, Class of 1968, and married Harold Inglee in November of that same year. She and her husband now live in Rutland; they have two daughters and three granddaughters.  Mary Jean Inglee's interest in low-income issues started when she was a child, when a poor family lived in a shack on the rocky area above her house. To Mary Jean's own family, it was a natural thing to share what they had with that family. Her parents provided them with rides to doctors and food and clothing whenever they could.  Mary Jean at times got in trouble at school because she believed it was her duty to advocate for classmates that were being treated unfairly. She remembers those classmates as the kids who experienced the cruel realities of poverty.  Mary Jean worked in the public school system for 10 years in a special education classroom. She had a first-hand look at how state systems worked--and how they didn't work for kids that had the least going for them. Once again some saw her as a troublemaker, for she took advocacy for families who needed extra consideration, very seriously. She says this kind of work brought her to know BROC (the community action agency in southern Vermont), which was a worksite for some of the students she worked with. Going there on a weekly basis, she was able to observe the difficult situation facing clients and workers.  Mary Jean has worked for the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation for the past 15 years, an agency charged with removing barriers to employment for people with disabilities. Most of the people she works with have no income or the minimal benefits of Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability payments. This translates into poverty. She advocates every day for programs, training, and dollars to help people improve their lives.  A new opportunity to help came in 1992 when she was asked to join the BROC Board of Directors as a low-income representative. The timing was perfect for Mary Jean to be called into service. Her husband was ill and not able to work. This gave her an instant ``reminder course'' in what it was like to owe rent and wonder how it would be paid. In their 35 years together, they have been there a few times, but unlike many of the people BROC serves, there was usually someone in the family who could help out.  Mary Jean has worked tirelessly for others, but she has also pursued a path of learning for herself. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Services from Springfield College in 2002. She is currently a Masters Candidate and expects to receive her Masters in Human Services with a concentration in Community Psychology in the spring of 2004.  Emma Katherine Ely is another outstanding advocate for low-income people. During the past 15 years (and probably longer than that!) Ms. Ely has served the low-income community of northeastern Vermont. While being a parent in the program--she is the mother of ten children--Ms. Ely served on the Champlain Valley OEO Head Start Policy Council. That interest in parent advocacy led to seats on the New England Regional Head Start Board and also on the Vermont State Head Start Parents Association. For the past 10 years, Ms. Ely has played a central role organizing the Vermont Early Childhood Conference. In addition to this work, Ms. Ely has been active in many rolesat the King Street Youth Center in Burlington. She currently organizes the Holiday Program at that Center.  She represents the needs and interests of the whole community, not just of children. Ms. Ely has also been a member of the Chittenden Emergency Food Shelf Advisory Board for the past 14 years. She is currently a low-income representative on the Champlain Valley OEO Board of Directors, and is at the present moment serving in her second term. She does all of these things as a dedicated, spirited advocate.  Bev Priest is another dedicated advocate for low-income people. A resident of Jay, Vermont for over 25 years, she served as a low-income representative on the Northeast Kingdom Community Action Board of Directors for 10 years. During that time, she regularly attended the Low-Income Association meetings, Physically Disabled Association meetings, and other meetings in the state capital of Montpelier: at all of them she unstintingly shared with everyone her knowledge of what she learned.  Bev Priest opened a food shelf and clothing center in the Jay Town Clerk's building and provided many holiday baskets to the local families. During the Christmas season she often played Santa at the low-income children's Christmas parties; she herself acquired many of the gifts that were distributed. She has been a consistent advocate for people in crisis; she has assisted in any way she could in helping people in crisis locate the resources they needed. Bev would many times call the NEKCA office stating, ``If I had transportation I would be on your desk right now.'' As one Vermonter in her community stated, ``Bev promoted the continual awareness of others of the struggles that low-income families face by `pointing out the squeaks in the wheel'.''  Theresa Emmons has been involved with the Central Vermont Community Action Council for over 20 years. It is safe to say that without her influence, CVCAC would not have accomplished as much as it has. Theresa served on the Board of Directors as a representative of the town of Washington in Orange County. She also has the distinction of having the longest tenure on the CVCAC Board, which she has served in every possible way: as President, as Vice President, as Treasurer and as Secretary.  As if this weren't enough, she has also served on the Head Start Policy Council and has been a leader in the Vermont Head Start Parent's Association. She has been a long time volunteer for the USDA Commodity food distribution program and local food shelves; she was also involved in the conception and growth of the Vermont Food Bank. As far as Theresa is concerned, if people are in need they deserve to receive help. If there is a cause that will help someone in need, that cause deserves to be supported--and Theresa is always first in line to volunteer and to recruit others to volunteer.  Christina Crawford of Springfield, Vermont has been an outstanding example of persevering in the face of difficulties, and of triumphing over many of them.  It was seven years ago that Chris left an abusive relationship. She left with a broken foot, no transportation, four children and the clothes on her back. After three months of being homeless, she found a place to live. She studied for the GED and passed. She then began taking administrative classes at the local high school as well as taking on a part-time job at an agency where she was given the opportunity to use the skills she was learning, although the job at the agency was temporary.  At the age of 30 Chris took driving lessons and eventually got her driver's license and a vehicle for the first time in her life. She then went to the Employment & Training agency in search of part-time, entry level work in the clerical field. She was offered an opportunity to enroll in an on-the-job training program and was placed at Southeastern Vermont Community Action. Chris has worked at SEVCA for nearly four years now as receptionist.  Three years ago, one of Chris's children was diagnosed as having an autistic disorder. She has since spent much of her time researching her daughter's disability and working tirelessly to put the needed supports in place for her daughter to be able to attend school. Chris is now in the process of trying to form a local support group for parents of special needs children.  Chris currently represents SEVCA and the southeastern part of Vermont on the Vermont Low Income Advocacy Council. She attended her first meeting in September and looks forward to attending as many as she can to use the opportunity to speak out about the struggles she has overcome and the struggles she has yet to face. She hopes to inspire other low-income people to speak out and create change.  In spite of the heavy load Chris continues to carry, she hopes that one day she will be able to go to college and obtain a degree in Human Services.                          ____________________
