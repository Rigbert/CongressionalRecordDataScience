Mr. Chairman, the bill we are voting on today represents a sensible, humane path to a balanced budget. This bill preserves vital Federal programs, but also cuts unnecessary Federal spending.  The purpose of balancing the budget is not to make accountants sleep easier at night. Holding the line on spending is about getting our priorities straightened out. And it also keeps our commitment to create jobs and increase opportunities. The whole point of cutting the budget deficit is about creating economic opportunity and a better future. It's about lowering interest rates, spurring investment, and securing and creating more, better paying jobs.  This bill protects the Federal role and pledge to those who truly need help, and makes sure that their needs will not be ignored. It keeps our commitment to our veterans, $400 million in additional funds for health care; to children in Heathy Start, $93 million; and education programs for the disadvantaged, $7.2 billion; it boosts funding to $738 million for the Ryan White CARE Act to help people suffering from AIDS; and includes $1.34 billion for job and vocational training programs. It also keeps our commitment to seniors, especially older workers in Older Americans Act jobs programs, $373 million.  Equally important, this bill pares back spending by $23 billion. It eliminates some 200 separate programs, many of them wasteful or duplicative. In the era of a $5 trillion dollar debt, we simply cannot afford to spend $18.4 million on the Office of Technology Assessment, $12.5 million for cattle tick eradication programs, and $850,000 for historical society calendars for Members of Congress.  This bill has shown that even in the absence of a comprehensive agreement over how best to reform Medicare and Medicaid, we can still make progress on the budget.  What is not highlighted in the media is that fact that below the surface of these highly visible budget battles, Congress has been able to cut these duplicative and unnecessary Government programs and regulations through the annual appropriations process. Our progress since 1994 has been to cut $43 billion from the deficit.  The Congressional Budget Office's latest fiscal year 1996 deficit estimates are lower than expected--down to $144 billion, from a level almost $200 billion in 1994. And that decline is in large measure the result of Republican votes to put our Government on a diet.  Through careful and judicious cuts, we have changed the entire debate in Washington. When President Clinton submitted his 1993 budget, taxes were raised retroactively. The question now is not if we should balance the budget, but how and when.  Of course, the devil is the details. Raising taxes may be a favorite of the President's, but I am committed to holding the line on spending and taxes, setting firm priorities in spending, and keeping the commitments we made to our constituents.  I think it is worth noting here that H.R. 3019 leaves H.R. 2099--the VA/HUD appropriations bill which Mr. Clinton vetoed on December 8, 1995--virtually unchanged.  Keep in mind that this is the same congressional budget which the VA Secretary called ``mean spirited''. Now we find that this so-called mean spirited budget--which includes a nearly $400,000,000 increase in VA health spending over fiscal year 1995 levels--was really perfectly acceptable to the President all along. After 7 months of leaving the VA without an appropriation, we find that the President had no major problem with what Congress originally passed.  I think, however, that in the end, all sides of the budget debate can hopefully draw some useful lessons from the bill. Here we have a bill that lowers the deficit and puts us ahead of schedule on discretionary spending. And it was done without the Government shutting down, but by rolling up our sleeves and making the tough choices.                          ____________________
