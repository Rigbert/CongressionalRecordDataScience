Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the chairman for his comments and his leadership on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of this important legislation, sponsored by my good friend and our colleague, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson). This legislation has 311 cosponsors, including the Speaker and the minority leader. I understand that a few more have been added even this day.  H.R. 2303 is an extraordinarily timely initiative, given the massive institutional changes which have affected the House over the last few years, and as we move into the 21st century.  Earlier this year, the House recodified its rules for the first time since 1880, another recent useful effort to reexamine and hopefully to improve things which we tend to take for granted. We benefit as Members of the House, and the American people benefit, when Members can take sometime away from the constant pressures of legislating, meeting our constituents, traveling back and forth from our districts and keeping hectic schedules, to think about the environment in which we work and the legacy of all those who came before us. And we have so little time even to do that.  In my earlier career, I was president of the State Senate in Maryland, and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) was president pro tempore of the Senate in Connecticut, roughly equivalent positions in two parliamentary bodies which are older than this House of Representatives. As such, we had some responsibility for managing the work of our legislative institutions and the environment in which State Senators worked, environments rich in history.  Here in Washington it takes real work and effort for Members to learn about the history of the House, however. We rarely think of the historic figures who populate artwork throughout the Capitol as having been persons of great accomplishment in legislation, oratory, and the philosophy of democracy, rather than figures we may notice momentarily as we dart through the corridors from meeting to meeting.                              {time}  1430  Mr. Speaker, the Constitution requires that Congress assemble to do its work and that we can exercise our priorities only by working collectively. Too often Members can feel isolated managing their individual offices tending to constituent problems in their district and come to the floor only for a few minutes to vote. But it was not always like that in this chamber, and we do well to remember that.  It would benefit this House if the public had a better understanding of not only what we do on a daily basis, but what our predecessors did and how we stand up compared to them. Certainly, the public has more than enough exposure to the politics of the House.  The bill offered by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) would offer interested citizens a chance to appreciate, in addition to the politics of the House today, the historic role of the House as the representatives of the popular will.  Mr. Speaker, the bill would direct the Librarian of Congress, at no cost to the Government, I might add, and with the ability to accept private funds, to prepare an illustrated narrative history of the House of Representatives.  The Librarian could use the extensive scholarly resources at his command and would be authorized to consult, commission, or engage the services of eminent historians, Members, and former Members of the House to produce a book accessible to the public at large as well as to the House and to the scholarly community.  The Librarian has informed us, Mr. Speaker, that once the bill is enacted into law he intends to appoint a scholarly advisory board to engage an eminent historian or historians who would conduct the principal work of writing the book.  The Librarian will also consult with the House Administration Committee led by the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas). The bill would also authorize the Librarian to accept materials relating to an oral history of the House as told by its Members and former Members.  The bill states the sense of the House that orientation programs for freshmen Members of the House should include a seminar on the history of the House and that the Speaker should conduct forums on the history of the House.  As ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, I participate in orientation sessions on many occasions; and I believe that they would be benefited greatly from the inclusion of a big picture view of the House, the Members' place in it, and its historical role.  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation and that it has received the strong bipartisan and leadership support needed to give the history of the House project momentum to get it underway quickly and do it thoroughly.
