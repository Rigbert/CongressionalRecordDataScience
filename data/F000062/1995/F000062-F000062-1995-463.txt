 President, the House may be debating the Contract With America, but I ask the Senate today to consider the Contact with America. On Sunday, the people of America will be in contact with one another, eagerly debating, disputing, and disagreeing.  However, I regret to inform this body that they will not be in touch with us. They are of the mind that the issue is far too big for the Senate to tackle or the President to block. Government involvement would be called unsportsman-like conduct. The Supreme Court would be ruled off-sides, and even radio talk show hosts would be flagged for interference.  Of course I mean Super Bowl XXIX--29. This ultimate contact sport presents a real problem for me and my colleague, Senator Boxer, because this year's Super Bowl pits two California teams against one another--the four-time Super Bowl champs, the San Francisco 49'ers and the talented and challenging San Diego Chargers. Normally, if a California team would play a team from some other State, I would willingly wager with the rival Senators. But it would be unseemly for two Senators from the same State to wager against one another. Does my colleague, Senator Boxer, agree?
