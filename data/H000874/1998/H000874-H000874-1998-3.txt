Speaker, I wish to engage the gentleman from Arizona in a colloquy.  I would like to take a moment to clarify a provision included in this bill. There has been confusion as to the scope of subsection (d) of section 117. It was my understanding when subsection (d) was added in conference, that it applies to the entire section, to both the new subsection (f)(1) and (2) of section 1610 of title 28. Is that the gentleman's understanding as well?
