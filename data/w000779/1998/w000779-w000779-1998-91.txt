President, for the past two weeks I have been working with Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Biden and others to reach an agreement so that the legislation reauthorizing the office of the so-called Drug Czar, H.R. 2610, can move forward. I do not object to the reauthorization, but have been prevented from offering an amendment to the measure and will not give my consent to adoption of the Drug Czar bill until we have reached agreement on my amendment. The amendment I wish to offer is bipartisan legislation Senator Gordon Smith and I have sponsored in response to the gun violence that struck Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon. The bill, S. 2169, would provide an incentive for states to enact a 72-hour holding period for students that bring guns to schools so that the students who bring guns to school may be fully and thoroughly evaluated by professionals. The President has endorsed our proposal, and it is my hope that we can reach a consensus that allows the Senate to pass both the Drug Czar measure and the Wyden-Smith bill.                          ____________________
