 President, today the Senate will immediately begin consideration of the foreign operations appropriations bill. It is hoped that significant progress can be made in an effort to complete action on the bill today. I might interject that I think that is certainly possible, maybe by early afternoon.  During today's session, the Senate may also begin consideration of any other appropriations bills on the calendar. It is the intention of the majority leader to complete action on a number of appropriations bills prior to the Fourth of July recess. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout the remainder of the week.                          ____________________
