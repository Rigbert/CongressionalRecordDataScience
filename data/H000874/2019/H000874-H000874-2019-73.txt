Speaker, as usual, the whip did not answer my question. I said, is the President above the law?  But he wants to pound on the table, Mr. Speaker, because neither the facts nor the law is on his side.  The process is consistent with the rules put in place by the current Secretary of State, Mr. Pompeo, and Mr. Trey Gowdy, who was a Member of this body.  Let me ask the gentleman, Mr. Speaker: Does he believe it appropriate that the Congress appropriates $391 million to help an ally confront Russia--which I understand Mr. Putin probably wasn't for--but does he believe that the President should have withheld that money from Ukraine to defend itself on its eastern front?
