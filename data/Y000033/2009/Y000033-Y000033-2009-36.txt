Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  This important legislation, introduced by our California colleagues, Devin Nunes and Jim Costa, is the first step towards improving the water supply situation on the Tule River Indian Reservation. This bill authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study to capture more surface water on the reservation.  Many areas throughout the West, including California, need new water storage to help meet water supply needs for humans, fish and wildlife. This legislation will help the tribe move one step closer to utilizing its water rights. This legislation enjoys universal support from the tribe and nearby communities and is an excellent example of where neighbors have come together for the common good.  I urge my colleagues to support this very bipartisan piece of legislation.  I yield back the balance of my time.
