President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will begin debate on the NATO treaty at 12 noon on Monday. At 6 p.m., the Senate will conduct a rollcall vote on the confirmation of Scott Fleming to be an Assistant Secretary at the Department of Education. It is the leader's hope that before and after that vote the Senate can conduct a vigorous debate on the NATO treaty and possibly have amendments offered during Monday's session of the Senate.  As previously ordered, the vote on the conference report to accompany the State Department reorganization legislation will occur on Tuesday at 2:25 p.m. And I announce to the membership that the vote scheduled for Monday, April 27, will occur at 6 p.m.                          ____________________
