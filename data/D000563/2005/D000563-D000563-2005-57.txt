I was with the Democratic leader when he made the statement about the PATRIOT Act. I took it to mean that we defeated cloture on the conference report on the PATRIOT Act. That was the way I understood it. It has been twisted a little bit by some who want to read more into it. But it is accurate, I believe, to say that.  I will just ask the Senator from Nevada, at least once informally with Senator Frist, and now four different times on the floor of the Senate, we have tried to extend the PATRIOT Act for 3 additional months while we work out our differences--an extension which would not change the PATRIOT Act in any way whatsoever--so that for 90 days, at least, it could continue to be used and enforced without question. Now we have had the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, object to extending the PATRIOT Act for 90 days.  One could reach the conclusion that the Senator from Arizona opposes the PATRIOT Act as currently written if he opposes extending it for 90 days, I might say. I am happy to allow the Senator to reply. If the Senator from Arizona supports the PATRIOT Act as currently written, why would the Senator object to extending the PATRIOT Act for 90 days?
