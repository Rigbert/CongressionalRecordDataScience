The amendment, the substance of the amendment, and the gentleman is a law professor, a very erudite individual, Member of this House; the amendment is simply frankly, in my opinion, unenforceable, or in the alternative, if enforceable, almost impossible to have any rational application of, because there is no, no standard or criteria in here as to the Secretary or other official having it made known on what basis of credibility information or status.  So I would hope that this House in an amendment that could have very serious consequences, very serious consequences on which there has been no hearing, on which there has been this limited debate, would reject this amendment, not because my colleagues agree or disagree with what was done, not because my colleagues voted for or against NAFTA, not because my colleagues would vote for or against similar legislation in the future, and not because, as some would interpret, that they have a motivation to allow the President to do anything he wants, but on the sole criteria that this legislation is inappropriate on this bill and is a dangerous piece of legislation in this context.
