Speaker, I think the gentleman from Utah [Mr. Hansen] has meritorious suggestions before the House, and I would urge Members to support it.  But beyond that, at the moment, I would like to go to another issue which I will not be allowed to raise because of restricted rules of the House, and I would have raised it as a point of privilege to the honor and integrity of the House.  It came to my attention and the attention of a number of other Members that directly below this chamber, in H-137, for a number of days that private-interest lobbyists, paid registered lobbyists, have been conducting what is called the war room right here on Capitol grounds using taxpayer-funded phones, lights, facilities, a beautiful room, something not made available to people who are opposing fast track, but only to a group of industries who are supporting the fast track legislation. I believe that this demeans the integrity of the House.  A number of my colleagues intend to put this question to the Speaker. My understanding is that, because of restricted rules of the House, at the moment we cannot raise it as a privilege on the floor. But this is certainly something that the public and other Members should be aware of.  We do not normally make facilities available to private outside interests and or the National Association of Manufacturers, Boeing Company, and other large corporations, at taxpayer expense, to lobby on behalf of legislation right here in the Capitol right beneath us, absolutely prime real estate. I think it is outrageous. And I think that Members should raise this question with the Speaker privately if we are not allowed to do it publicly.  I thank the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Bishop] for yielding me the time, and I wish him luck with the bill.
