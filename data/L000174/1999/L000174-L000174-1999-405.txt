President, the international community has recognized the urgency of this situation. An international monitoring and police presence throughout East Timor is critical to creating a secure environment.  The Administration is shouldering its share of the costs of the UN monitors and police, and its members who arrived in East Timor several weeks ago already report some progress in stemming the violence.  But far more needs to be done. It is time for the Indonesian Government and military to do their part--to act decisively to ensure that a free and fair vote can occur.  This amendment reinforces what others have said and what the Indonesian Government has already committed to do. I thank the managers of the bill for accepting the amendment.                               Exhibit 1                                               Washington, DC,                                                    June 11, 1999.     Hon. James Wolfensohn,     President, The World Bank,     Washington, DC.       Dear Jim: For many years, we have consistently raised      concerns about the failure of the Indonesian Government to      respect the human rights of the people of East Timor and to      allow them an opportunity to express their right of self-     determination. We are writing to convey our deep concern      about the escalating violence in East Timor, which has put in      doubt the August 8th ballot on East Timor's political future.       We have called on the Indonesian Government to stop      military and paramilitary violence which threatens to      undermine the vote, yet the threats and killings continue      unabated. United Nations officials, East Timorese leaders,      and members of the Catholic Church, including Bishop Belo,      blame the Indonesian military for intentionally seeking to      sabotage the vote. We have called on our own Administration      to work urgently to pressure Jakarta to take the steps      necessary for a free and fair vote.       We believe it is now imperative that the international      financial institutions (IFIs), most importantly the World      Bank, make clear to the Indonesian Government that if the      August ballot is not free and fair, continued large scale      investment by the IFIs will be in jeopardy. Jakarta must be      convinced of what is at stake. If it fails to act decisively      to permit a free and fair vote, it will risk becoming a      pariah state. The government and army must abide by the May      5th UN-sponsored tripartite accord, most specifically by      stopping and disarming the anti-independence militias that      are using the weapons supplied to them by the Indonesian      military to intimidate and attack East Timorese civilians.       We appeal to you to personally press the Indonesian      Government to create a secure environment for the August vote      and to prevent any efforts to restrict aid to East Timorese      who have been displaced by the militia violence.       Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,       Patrick Leahy, U.S. Senator.       Russell D. Feingold, U.S. Senator.       Daniel Patrick Moynihan, U.S. Senator.
