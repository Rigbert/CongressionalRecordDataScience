 Mr. President, recently we have had the opportunity to consider several bills in the Senate to help ease the burdens for our middle-class families and small business owners that they are facing in this recession.  In late June, we brought a bill to the floor that would provide key targeted tax breaks, including a sales tax deductibility for families in my home State, as well as tax breaks to end our dependence on foreign oil.  In July, we introduced a Wall Street reform bill that included the strongest protections for consumers ever enacted and a guarantee that taxpayers would never be on the hook for bailing out Wall Street again.  A few short weeks ago, we worked to extend unemployment benefits to help stimulate economic growth and those who are in desperate need.  Last week, we introduced a bill that would have provided a new small business lending fund to help the backboneof our economy, our small businesses, grow and hire.  It would have jump-started community bank lending and small businesses, while saving taxpayers $1 billion.  All those bills had broad across-the-board support. In fact, outside the Senate, they had a lot of support.
