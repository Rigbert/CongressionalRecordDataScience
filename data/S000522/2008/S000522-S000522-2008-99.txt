Madam Speaker, my wife Marie and I were among the thousands who joined President George W. Bush and Laura on the White House lawn today in welcoming Pope Benedict XVI to the United States.  It was among the most inspiring events of my 28 years in Congress.  Both men--extraordinary leaders for extraordinarily difficult times--spoke eloquently of the challenges, opportunities and duties of global citizenship. Both called us to work harder and more effectively for others, especially the disenfranchised, weak and vulnerable.  President Bush--speaking for us--said to the Pope:       ``Here in America you'll find a nation of compassion.      Americans believe that the measure of a free society is how      we treat the weakest and most vulnerable among us. . . . Here      in America you'll find a nation that welcomes the role of      faith in the public square. . . . Here in America, you'll      find a nation that is fully modern, yet guided by ancient and      eternal truths. . . . Most of all, Holy Father, you will find      in America people whose hearts are open to your message of      hope. And America and the world need this message.''  Pope Benedict said ``I come as a friend. a preacher of the Gospel, and one with great respect for this vast pluralistic society . . .''  He said he hoped his presence would he ``a source of renewal and hope.'' He reminded us that ``Freedom is not only a gift, but also a summons to personal responsibility.'' And the Pope urged us to greater action:       ``the need for global solidarity is as urgent as ever, if      all people are to live in a way worthy of their dignity--as      brothers and sisters dwelling in the same house and around      that table which God's bounty has set for all his children.      America has traditionally shown herself generous in meeting      immediate human needs, fostering development and offering      relief to the victims of natural catastrophes. I am confident      that this concern for the greater human family will continue      to find expression in support for the patient efforts of      international diplomacy to resolve conflicts and promote      progress. In this way, coming generations will be able to      live in a world where truth, freedom and justice can      flourish--a world where the God-given dignity and the rights      of every man, women and child are cherished, protected and      effectively advanced.  Madam Speaker, what follows are both the President and Pope's remarks in their entirety. President Bush Welcomes His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI to White House       President Bush: Holy Father, Laura and I are privileged to      have you here at the White House. We welcome you with the      ancient words commended by Saint Augustine: ``Pax Tecum.''      Peace be with you.       You've chosen to visit America on your birthday. Well,      birthdays are traditionally spent with close friends, so our      entire nation is moved and honored that you've decided to      share this special day with us. We wish you much health and      happiness--today and for many years to come.       This is your first trip to the United States since you      ascended to the Chair of Saint Peter. You will visit two of      our greatest cities and meet countless Americans, including      many who have traveled from across the country to see you and      to share in the joy of this visit. Here in America you'll      find a nation of prayer. Each day millions of our citizens      approach our Maker on bended knee, seeking His grace and      giving thanks for the many blessings He bestows upon us.      Millions of Americans have been praying for your visit, and      millions look forward to praying with you this week.       Here in America you'll find a nation of compassion.      Americans believe that the measure of a free society is how      we treat the weakest and most vulnerable among us. So each      day citizens across America answer the universal call to feed      the hungry and comfort the sick and care for the infirm. Each      day across the world the United States is working to      eradicate disease, alleviate poverty, promote peace and bring      the light of hope to places still mired in the darkness of      tyranny and despair.       Here in America you'll find a nation that welcomes the role      of faith in the public square. When our Founders declared our      nation's independence, they rested their case on an appeal to      the ``laws of nature, and of nature's God.'' We believe in      religious liberty. We also believe that a love for freedom      and a common moral law are written into every human heart,      and that these constitute the firm foundation on which any      successful free society must be built.       Here in America. you'll find a nation that is fully modern,      yet guided by ancient and eternal truths, The United States      is the most innovative, creative and dynamic country on      earth--it is also among the most religious. In our nation,      faith and reason coexist in harmony. This is one of our      country's greatest strengths, and one of the reasons that our      land remains a beacon of hope and opportunity for millions      across the world.       Most of all. Holy Father, you will find in America people      whose hearts are open to your message of hope. And America      and the world need this message. In a world where some invoke      the name of God to justify acts of terror and murder and      hate, we need your message that ``God is love.'' And      embracing this love is the surest way to save men from      ``falling prey to the teaching of fanaticism and terrorism.''       In a world where some treat life as something to be debased      and discarded, we need your message that all human life is      sacred, and that ``each of us is willed, each of us is      loved'' and your message that ``each of us is willed, each of      us is loved, and each of us is necessary.''       In a world where some no longer believe that we can      distinguish between simple right and wrong, we need your      message to reject this ``dictatorship of relativism,'' and      embrace a culture of justice and truth.       In a world where some see freedom as simply the right to do      as they wish, we need your message that true liberty requires      us to live our freedom not just for ourselves, but ``in a      spirit of mutual support.''       Holy Father, thank you for making this journey to America.      Our nation welcomes you. We appreciate the example you set      for the world, and we ask that you always keep us in your      prayers.       Pope Benedict XVI: Mr. President, thank you for your      gracious words of welcome on behalf of the people of the      United States of America. I deeply appreciate your invitation      to visit this great country. My visit coincides with an      important moment in the life of the Catholic community in      America: the celebration of the 200th anniversary of      elevation of the country's first Diocese--Baltimore--to a      metropolitan Archdiocese and the establishment of the Sees of      New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Louisville.       Yet I am happy to be here as a guest of all Americans. I      come as a friend, a preacher of the Gospel, and one with      great respect for this vast pluralistic society. America's      Catholics have made, and continue to make, an excellent      contribution to the life of their country. As I begin my      visit, I trust that my presence will be a source of renewal      and hope for the Church in the United States, and strengthen      the resolve of Catholics to contribute ever more responsibly      to the life of this nation, of which they are proud to be      citizens.       From the dawn of the Republic, America's quest for freedom      has been guided by the conviction that the principles      governing political and social life are intimately linked to      a moral order based on the dominion of God the Creator. The      framers of this nation's founding documents drew upon this      conviction when they proclaimed the self-evident truth that      all men are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights      grounded in the laws of nature and of nature's God.       The course of American history demonstrates the      difficulties, the struggles, and the great intellectual and      moral resolve which were demanded to shape a society which      faithfully embodied these noble principles. In that process,      which forged the soul of the nation, religious beliefs were a      constant inspiration and driving force, as for example in the      struggle against slavery and in the civil rights movement. In      our time, too, particularly in moments of crisis, Americans      continue to find their strength in a commitment to this      patrimony of shared ideas and aspirations.       In the next few days, I look forward to meeting not only      with America's Catholic community, but with other Christian      communities and representatives of the many religious      traditions present in this country.     Historically, not only Catholics, but all believers have      found here the freedom to worship God in accordance with the      dictates of their conscience, while at the same time being      accepted as part of a commonwealth in which each individual      group can make its voice heard.       As the nation faces the increasingly complex political and      ethical issues of our time, I am confident that the American      people will find in their religious beliefs a precious source      of insight and an inspiration to pursue reasoned, responsible      and respectful dialogue in the effort to build a more human      and free society.       Freedom is not only a gift, but also a summons to personal      responsibility. Americans know this from experience--almost      every town in this country has its monuments honoring those      who sacrificed their lives in defense of freedom, both at      home and abroad. The preservation of freedom calls for the      cultivation of virtue, self-discipline, sacrifice for the      common good, and a sense of responsibility towards the less      fortunate. It also demands the courage to engage in civic      life and to bring one's deepest beliefs and values to      reasoned public debate.       In a word, freedom is ever new. It is a challenge held out      to each generation, and it must constantly be won over for      the cause of good. Few have understood this as clearly as the      late Pope John Paul II. In reflecting on the spiritual      victory of freedom over totalitarianism in his native Poland      and in Eastern Europe, he reminded us that history shows time      and again that ``in a world without truth, freedom loses its      foundation,'' and a democracy without values can lose its      very soul. Those prophetic words in some sense echo the      conviction of President Washington, expressed in his Farewell      Address, that religion and morality represent ``indispensable      supports'' of political prosperity.       The Church, for her part, wishes to contribute to building      a world ever more worthy of the human person, created in the      image and likeness of God. She is convinced that faith sheds      new light on all things, and that the Gospel reveals the      noble vocation and sublime destiny of every man and woman.      Faith also gives us the strength to respond to our high      calling and to hope that inspires us to work for an ever more      just and fraternal society. Democracy can only flourish, as      your founding fathers realized, when political leaders and      those whom they represent are guided by truth and bring the      wisdom born of firm moral principle to decisions affecting      the life and future of the nation.       For well over a century, the United States of America has      played an important role in the international community. On      Friday, God willing, I will have the honor of addressing the      United Nations organization, where I hope to encourage the      efforts underway to make that institution an ever more      effective voice for the legitimate aspirations of all the      world's peoples.       On this, the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration      of Human Rights, the need for global solidarity is as urgent      as ever, if all people are to live in a way worthy of their      dignity--as brothers and sisters dwelling in the same house      and around that table which God's bounty has set for all his      children. America has traditionally shown herself generous in      meeting immediate human needs, fostering development and      offering relief to the victims of natural catastrophes. I am      confident that this concern for the greater human family will      continue to find expression in support for the patient      efforts of international diplomacy to resolve conflicts and      promote progress. In this way, coming generations will be      able to live in a world where truth, freedom and justice can      flourish--a world where the God-given dignity and the rights      of every man, women and child are cherished, protected and      effectively advanced.       Mr. President, dear friends, as I begin my visit to the      United States, I express once more my gratitude for your      invitation, my joy to be in your midst, and my fervent      prayers that Almighty God will confirm this nation and its      people in the ways of justice, prosperity and peace. God      bless America.                          ____________________
