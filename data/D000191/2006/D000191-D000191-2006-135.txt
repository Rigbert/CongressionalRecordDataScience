They believe we have resolved the issue of port security, but that is far from the truth. True, for now, the idea of United Arab Emirates operating some of our port terminals has abated. But this is very much just a very small issue regarding port security.  The fact is, our ports are probably today very little less secure than pre-9/11. The grades that the 9/11 Commission give to this administration's efforts on port security were generally failing.  The United States has bound itself to an international agreement through the International Maritime Organization that allowed secret ownership of ships. Osama bin Laden could have a fleet of his own. We are not allowed to know. They fly under flags that countries that provide no supervision, in fact, in the case of Liberia, until recently, didn't even have a government, and barely exist.  They have crews of unknown identity. Yes, they send us a name about the ship lands, but is that really the person. Is that really the background. Do we have fingerprints? No. We don't know who the people are on those ships. The cargo on those ships is not secure. The containers are not secure. It would cost a few dollars to secure a container from loading to unloading in the United States of America and scan it. The Bush administration thinks that is a cost that we cannot afford or would unnecessarily impinge upon free commerce.  Then, of course, the technology, the technology that we don't have at the ports, to adequately scan these containers. Now, we cannot breathe a sigh of relief. Our ports are not yet secure. We depend upon a transmitted manifest. Now, I can just see that the Osama bin Laden line with the terrorist crew is going to send a manifest that says this container has 199 concrete bird baths and one small tactical nuclear weapon, and our intelligence people might even ask to open that container. Who knows, they might not. So we need to do a tremendous amount more.  Then there is another issue. The Bush administration, while Congress is away next week, is intending to put forward a rule that would allow foreign interests to control United States airlines in contravention of a very explicit law which prohibits control by foreign interests. The Bush Administration, using their inherent powers, has decided to reinterpret the meaning of the word control and say Congress just meant they can't control safety and security. We will wall that off.  How are you going to wall it off when you have foreign ownership of a U.S. airline, foreign management and a U.S. airline, foreign board of directors of a formerly U.S. airline, and you are going to wall off safety and security? Oh, come on, give me a break. As the chief operating officer of Continental said, hey, they are against this. They said, hey, I am head of safety, I am the COO, safety and security report to me. I can get someone to do whatever I want in that job, or I will fire them.  That is an extraordinary risk. It risks our civilian reserve air fleet, where we move our troops overseas. Just imagine a future deployment, say to maybe the Taiwan area with a problem with China, and the U.S. troops could be flying on an airline that was owned and controlled by Chinese communist government interests under this rule, which the Bush Administration wants to push through. Or it could be a UAE crew from Dubai, because they are the fastest expanding long-haul airline in the world, with all of their billions of surplus dollars.  We cannot rest easy, because the Bush Administration is continuing to dismantle critical infrastructure. We need a general review of critical infrastructure in this country, and we need to safeguard it. They are saying, no, we shouldn't do that. They are hoping to put the Dubai deal off, you know, and that we will not pay any attention to the threats at our ports or the threats to our airlines and aviation industry, or maybe even under the Bush administration, we will sell our nuclear plants to foreign interests.  Wouldn't that be spiffy if we allowed foreign interests to own our nuclear plants? That would be really, really great for security here in the United States of America. America should not be for sale. It is a symptom of a failed trade policy, and this Bush administration just wants to do more of the same. It is time for change. It is time for new trade policy. It is time to keep bringing jobs home. It is time to make America secure, and it is time to secure our assets.                          ____________________[Page H1122]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                             PORT SECURITY
