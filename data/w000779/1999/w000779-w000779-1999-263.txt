President, today I introduce a measure to bring critically needed relief to Marina Khalina and her son, Albert Miftakhov, who suffers from cerebral palsy. Marina and Albert are Russian immigrants who have made a new home for themselves in the state of Oregon. They love their new life in America, but they face deportation unless Congress steps in and helps them become citizens of this country.  Marina and Albert have been valuable members of their community in Oregon and would make model citizens. They are both people of exceptional moral character. Neither has been arrested or convicted of any crime. Although Albert often has had to miss school for medical operations, therapy, and other treatments, he consistently has been a good student. Marina has worked tirelessly in the United States to support her family and to cover her son's staggering medical costs, which will include additional surgery in the future. Through hard work, determination, and courage, Marina has made sure that Albert receives the medical care he requires.  Forcibly removing them and sending them back to Russia would result in extreme hardship for both of them and would make it virtually impossible for Albert to receive proper medical attention. Albert would be unable to lead a normal life due to the current inability of Russian society to understand and accommodate disabled persons. Even the most basic medical treatment, surgical intervention and physical therapy would be either unavailable or extremely difficult to obtain in Russia.  Although life has not been easy for Marina and Albert, they have both shown bravery in the face of adversity. This bill will allow Marina and Albert to stay in the United States so that Albert can receive the care he needs to lead a normal life. I urge you to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
