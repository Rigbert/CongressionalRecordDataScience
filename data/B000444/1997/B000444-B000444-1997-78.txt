 President, this Sunday, numerous students, parents, and alumni of my Alma Mater, Archmere Academy in Claymont, DE, will be gathering to honor the Rev. Joseph P. McLaughlin, O. Praem. who, during his 26 years as a teacher and headmaster at Archmere, has been more than a pillar of the academy. He has been a vital part of Archmere's spirit, and a tremendous influence In the lives of thousands of young women and men.  One of the cliches that teenagers hear again and again is how their teen years are ``the best years of your lives''. Well, with all due respect, for most kids, it is not that simple. Too many adults have forgotten how those years are often filled with uncertainty and discomfort, as teenagers undergotremendous physical and emotional changes, have their values frequently called into question and their judgement tested beyond their experience, and must make major decisions which will impact the course of their entire lives and careers. At no other time in their lives are they forced to make so many major choices with so little experience and information upon which to base those choices. It is a time when guidance, understanding, and friendship are critical.  For more than a quarter-century, young men and women of Archmere Academy, have counted upon Father McLaughlin for that guidance, understanding, and friendship. And he has always been there for them, guided by his own deep faith, sincerity, and lifelong experience in dealing with young people. Of course, we will never know many of the specific instances of Father McLaughlin's intervention, because he is the soul of discretion and modesty, but there are countless Archmereans who will tell you that when they needed an advisor, a mentor, a friend, Father McLaughlin was there for them.  I graduated from Archmere before Father McLaughlin arrived, but my two sons attended the school during his tenure, and my daughter is currently an Archmere student. Each has had the utmost respect for his commitment, his wisdom, and his generosity of spirit, and all have benefitted from his years of dedicated service.  Having been involved with the school as an alumnus and as a parent, I have seen firsthand Father McLaughlin's tireless efforts result in Archmere's becoming one of the premier high schools--not only in Delaware and the surrounding region, but nationally. It is obvious that he has succeeded splendidly. The school is truly the academic beacon on the hill envisioned by the school's founders, the Norbertines. Archmere historically has attracted students of all backgrounds, and turned out promising young scholars, and, most importantly, fine young men and women with solidly-rooted values and well-placed priorities.  In the longstanding tradition of the late Father Justin E. Diny, Headmaster Emeritus, Father McLaughlin has long recognized that a school's success can not be measured solely by the test scores of its students, or by the number of graduates moving on to prestigious universities--though by either of those standards Archmere is unquestionably an unqualified success--but also by the character of the young men and women who pass through its gates. With his keen sensitivity for the Academy's rich history and tradition--``The Archmere Way'', as it is known on campus and throughout the community--Father McLaughlin saw to it that Archmere graduates were solid, civic-minded citizens with commitment and compassion as well as being outstanding scholars.  As headmaster, Father McLaughlin has been admired for his personal decency, his quiet and gentlemanly way, his ability to listen to all sides before coming to a decision, and his vision for Archmere's mission and its future. He has long recognized that Archmere's future lies in its past, in terms of both history and tradition. In his belief that Archmere alumni--those who have had such a tradition imbued in their characters--should play a vital role in sustaining and nurturing the Academy's atmosphere, Father McLaughlin has uniquely enriched the lives of all those students who attended Archmere during his tenure. As a result of Father McLaughlin's genuine commitment to maintaining the unbroken chain--from Archmereans to Archers to Auks--past and present Archmere alumni continue contributing to the school community long after their campus years are over. It is my fervent hope that this tradition--the one for which Father McLaughlin worked so hard to perpetuate--the idea that an Archmere education is but the first step in a lifetime of involvement, will be a cornerstone of the Academy for all succeeding generations of Archmere students.  Father McLaughlin will now redirect his tireless energies and many talents to his new position as novice master and formation director for the Daylesford Abbey, where he will continue in his familiar role as mentor and counselor, as he matures new members of his order, thus ensuring that his enthusiasm, dedication, and legacy of service to the community will be instilled in yet future generations of teachers, students, and community-minded men and women of faith. As he embarks upon that challenge, all of us who love Archmere and the traditions our alma mater stands for, wish our friend Father McLaughlin him well, for his service should be held up as an example and an inspiration for all who accept the challenge to teach America's youth.                          ____________________
