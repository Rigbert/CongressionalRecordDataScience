President, today, I am pleased to join with Senator Grassley to introduce the Drug Free Communities Enhancement Act of 2010, a bill to authorize additional Drug Free Communities grants to help address major emerging drug issues and local drug crises. It is crucial that communities around the country have the leadership and resources needed to respond to serious drug problems in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. Drug Free Community, DFC, coalitions have been proven to significantly lower substance abuse rates in our communities nationwide.  This legislation will allow current and former DFCs to apply for grants of up to $75,000 per year to implement comprehensive, community-wide strategies to address emerging local drug issues or drug crises. The funds may also be used for DFC members to obtain specialized training and technical assistance to improve the operation of their coalitions. These grants, which must be matched dollar for dollar, would be available to DFCs for up to 4 years.  The DFC program encourages local citizens to become directly involved in solving their community's drug issues through grassroots community organizing and data-driven planning and implementation. Research shows that effective prevention hinges on the extent to which the entire community works comprehensively and collaboratively to implement education, prevention, enforcement, treatment, and recovery initiatives. The DFC program strategically invests Federal anti-drug resources at the community level with those who have the most power to reduce the demand for drugs--namely parents, teachers, business leaders, the media, religious leaders, law enforcement officials, youth, and others. Drug Free Communities grantees execute collaborative strategies to address their communities' unique substance use and abuse issues. This is the optimal way to ensure that the entire community benefits from prevention.  In Vermont, we have felt the presence of drug abuse and drug-related crime in our communities. The myth persists that drug abuse and drug-related crime are only big-city problems, but rural America is also coping with these issues. I have twice brought the Judiciary Committee to Vermont to examine these problems and gain perspectives to help shape solutions, and I hope to hold another field hearing in Vermont soon. I know well that law enforcement alone is not the solution for our communities. I have long advocated an approach with equal attention to law enforcement, prevention and education, and treatment.  Perhaps the most important component in dealing with this crucial problem is collaboration. Community anti-drug coalitions have a unique ability to build on pre-existing relationships among parents, teachers, students, and law enforcement, which make them a critical component in reducing drug use. I have consistently supported funding for these coalitions and was pleased that last year 14 Vermont coalitions were awarded Drug Free Community grants totaling $1.2 million.  Last week, I spoke with a number of Vermonters representing these community partnerships and heard about the innovative frameworks they have implemented to combat drug abuse in their communities, thanks in large part to DFC grants. This bill will enable many of them to secure supplemental funding to continue the important work they do every day. Indeed, communities nationwide who are facing serious drug issues will benefit from these enhancement grants.  The community coalition model has proven extremely effective, and has achieved impressive outcomes. We see significant results when we have people working together at the local, state, and Federal levels, and in the law enforcement, prevention, and treatment fields. We have seen that success in Vermont and throughout the country, but there is more work to be done. Drug abuse and drug-related crime is a persistent problem in America, in major metropolitan areas and rural communities alike. I hope all Senators will support this bipartisan bill so that communities nationwide can sustain effective community coalitions to reduce youth drug use.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3031       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Free Communities      Enhancement Act of 2010''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The epidemiology of drug use indicates that emerging      drug trends increase over a     short period of time and tend to cluster in discrete      geographic areas. Historical evidence shows that emerging      local drug issues and crises can be stopped or mitigated      before they spread to other areas, if they are identified      quickly and addressed in a comprehensive multi-sector manner.       (2) Federal investments in drug prevention should not be      solely based on national data and trends, but must be      flexible enough to address emerging local problems and local      drug crises before they become national trends.       (3) Successful drug prevention must be based on local data      and involve multiple community sectors in planning and      implementing specifically targeted strategies that respond to      the unique drug problems of the community.       (4) Data and outcomes show that effective community      coalitions can markedly reduce local drug use rates for drugs      such as marijuana and inhalants among school-aged youth.       (5) Community coalitions are singularly situated to deal      with emerging drug issues and local drug crises, such as      methamphetamine, cheese (a mixture of black tar heroin and      Tylenol PM), and prescription and non-prescription drug abuse      because the community coalitions are organized, data driven,      and take a comprehensive, multi-sector approach to solving      and addressing locally identified drug problems.       (6) Providing enhancement grants to coalitions to address      emerging local drug issues or local drug crises is a cost      effective way to deal with these drug issues. This approach      builds on existing infrastructures with proven results that      include all of the relevant community sectors needed to      comprehensively address specific emerging drug issues and      crises, and guards against using Federal funding to create      duplicative community based infrastructures for substance      abuse prevention.     SEC. 3. COMMUNITY-BASED COALITION ENHANCEMENT GRANTS TO                    ADDRESS EMERGING DRUG ISSUES OR LOCAL DRUG                    CRISES.
