 The time is charged to the side which puts in the quorum call, unless consent is granted to divide that equally.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four letters from the American Civil Liberties Union, outlining the constitutional infirmities of the McCain-Feingold bill, be printed in the Record. I understand that the Government Printing Office estimates the cost of printing these articles in the Record to be approximately $2,500.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 1997.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Ever since the very first version      of the various McCain-Feingold campaign finance bills were      introduced in the Senate, the ACLU has gone on record to      assert that each version was fatally and fundamentally flawed      when measured against settled First Amendment principles. Now      the Senate is debating a new ``revised'' incarnation of the      bill. While we are     pleased that the sponsors of the new version have abandoned      some of the more egregious provisions that appeared in      earlier versions, the ``pared down'' bill still cuts to the      core of the First Amendment. We once again urge you to reject      McCain-Feingold's unconstitutional and unprecedented assaults      on freedom of speech and association.       Although the bill has a number of constitutional flaws,      this letter focuses on those that impose restrictions      primarily on issue advocacy. It is important to note at the      outset that the recent letter from 126 law professors,      commenting on McCain-Feingold, was silent on the issue      advocacy restrictions in the bill, which are the subject of      this letter.       1. The unprecedented restrictions on issue advocacy      contained in the McCain-Feingold bill are flatly      unconstitutional under settled First Amendment doctrine.       The Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo well understood the      risks that overly broad campaign finance regulations could      pose to electoral democracy because ``[discussion of public      issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are      integral to the operation of the system of government      established by our Constitution.'' 424 U.S. at 14. The Court      recognized that ``the distinction between discussion of      issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of      candidates may often dissolve in practical application.      Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to      public issues involving legislative proposals and      governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the      basis of their positions on various public issues, but      campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.''      424 U.S. at 43. If any discussion of a candidate in the      context of discussion of an issue rendered the speaker      subject to campaign finance controls, the consequences for      free discussion would be intolerable and speakers would be      compelled ``to hedge and trim,'' Id., quoting Thomas v.      Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 535 (1945).       Accordingly, the Court reasoned, under the First Amendment,      campaign finance controls had to be limited and could only      apply to ``communications that in express terms advocate the      election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.''      Conversely, all speech which does not ``in express terms      advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified      candidate'' must be totally free from permissible controls.      ``So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they      want to promote the candidate and his views.'' 424 U.S. at      45. And they are free from reporting and disclosure      requirements as well.       The Court fashioned the express advocacy doctrine to      safeguard issue advocacy from campaign finance controls, even      though such discussion might influence the outcome of an      election. The doctrine provides a hard, bright-line,      objective test that protects political speech and association      by focusing solely on the content of the speaker's words, not      the motive in the speaker's mind or the impact of the      speaker's opinions, or the proximity to an election, or the      phase of the moon. The doctrine marks the boundary of      permissible regulation and frees issue advocacy from any      permissible restraint.       The Buckley Court could not have been more clear about the      need for that bright line test which focuses solely on the      speaker's words and which is now an integral part of settled      First Amendment doctrine. It was designed to protect issue      discussion and advocacy by allowing independent groups of      citizens to comment on and criticize the performance of      elected officials without becoming ensnared in the federal      campaign finance laws. And it permits issue discussion to go      forward at the time that it is most vital in a democracy:      during an election season.       The new version of the McCain-Feingold bill once again      would obliterate the bright line test of ``express advocacy''      which the courts have fashioned over a period of 25 years to      protect the broad range of issue discussion in America from      campaign finance controls. Instead, the bill would impose      unprecedented controls on issue advocacy in clear violation      of settled First Amendment principles.       The new bill attacks issue advocacy on a number of fronts.       It abandons the bright-line test of express advocacy in      favor of a permanent year-round restriction on issue advocacy      redefined in an unconstitutionally vague, overbroad and      watered-down fashion.       It imposes, in effect, a two-month, 60 day blackout before      any federal election on any radio or television advertisement      on any issue if that communication ``mentions'' any candidate      for federal office.       It restrains any communication that expresses ``support for      or opposition to'' anyone who is a candidate for office.       These unprecedented restrictions would effectively silence      issue advocacy by the countless hundreds and thousands of      groups that add to the political debate in America.       These proposals would all undermine the purpose of the      ``express advocacy'' doctrine, which is to keep campaign      finance regulations from overwhelming all political and      public speech. They would do so by dramatically expanding the      statutory definition of express advocacy and thereby      impermissibly sweeping an enormous amount of protected issue      advocacy within the net of campaign finance regulations.       The current version of McCain-Feingold takes a ``new''      approach to silencing issue advocacy, but it is no less      flawed than its predecessors. Once again, the clear purpose      and inevitable effect of the provisions in the revised      McCain-Feingold bill will be to shut down citizen criticism      of incumbent officeholders standing for re-election at the      very time when the public's attention is especially focused      on such issues.       Given the fact that the proposed restraints on issue      advocacy are targeted primarily at criticism of incumbent      legislators during an election season, the danger to the core      purposes of the First Amendment posed by such legislation is      clear and present.       2. The unprecedented and sweeping restraints on the ``soft      money'' funding of issue advocacy and political activity by      political parties raise severe First Amendment problems.       A central critical distinction has informed the Supreme      Court's campaign finance jurisprudence. Contributions and      expenditures made by federal candidates, or those who      expressly advocate their election or defeat, may be subject      to regulation. All other political and issue advocacy and      discussion--even though it might influence the outcome of an      election--may not be subject to governmental control. This      constitutional Continental Divide is compelled by the First      Amendment and is built upon the concept that only ``express      advocacy'' of the election or defeat of specific federal      candidates can be subject to regulation.       Accordingly, while candidate-focused contributions and      expenditures and ``express advocacy'' can be subject to      various restrictions or regulations, the Court in Buckley v.      Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) held that all speech which does not      ``in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a      clearly identified candidate'' is totally free of any      permissible regulation: ``So long as persons and groups      eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the      election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they      are free to spend as much as they want to promote the      candidate and his views.'' 424 U.S. at 45 (emphasis      supplied). The purpose of this profound distinction is to      keep campaign finance regulations from overwhelming all      political and public speech. And it is this distinction      which defenders of the constitutionality of a ban on      ``soft money'' continue to disregard.       The same principles that protect unrestrained advocacy by      issue groups safeguard issue advocacy and activity by      political parties. ``Soft money'' is funding that does not      support ``express advocacy'' of the election or defeat of      federal candidates, even though it may exert an influence on      the outcome of federal elections in the broadest sense of      that term. It sustains primary political activity by parties      such as get-out-the-vote drives and issue advertising.      Because it is not used for express advocacy, it can be raised      from sources that would be restricted in making contributions      or expenditures. Compare Austin v. Michigan Chamber of      Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990) with First National Bank of      Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978).       Indeed, the unrestricted use of soft money by political      parties and non-party organizations like labor unions has      been invited by Buckley (``So long as persons and groups      eschew . . .''), authorized by Congress (see 2 U.S.C.      sections 431 (8)(A)(I) and (B)(xii) which permit soft money      for state elections and voter registration and get out the      vote drives), sanctioned and enhanced by rulings of the      Federal Election Commission and acknowledged by the Supreme      Court last year in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign      Committee v. Federal Election Commission, 116 S.Ct. 2309      (1996), which upheld unlimited ``hard money'' independent      expenditures by political parties on behalf of their      candidates.       Most pertinently, the Colorado Republican Court reached      that conclusion despite arguments that unrestrained soft      money contributions were undermining the Act's limitations on      hard money party funding:       ``We recognize that FECA permits individuals to contribute      more money ($20,000) to a party than to a candidate ($1,000)      or to other political committees ($5,000). . . . We also      recognize that FECA permits unregulated ``soft money''      contributions to a party for certain activities, such as      electing candidates for state office . . . or for voter      registration and ``get out the vote'' drives. . . . But the      opportunity for corruption posed by these greater      opportunities for contributions is, at best, attenuated.      Unregulated ``soft money'' contributions may not be used to      influence a federal campaign, except when used in the limited      party-building activities specifically designated by      statute.'' Id. at 2316.       And the Court's suggestion that Congress ``might decide to      change the statute's limitations on contributions to      political parties''--which has been taken out of context by      defenders of McCain-Feingold's soft money ban--referred to      hard money donations.       Accordingly, we submit that McCain-Feingold's sweeping      controls on the amount and source of soft money contributions      to political parties and disclosure of soft money      disbursements by other organizations continue to raise severe      constitutional problems. Disclosure, rather than limitation,      of large soft money contributions to political parties, is      the more appropriate and less restrictive alternative.       McCain-Feingold's labyrinth of restrictions on party      funding and political activity can have no other effect but      to deter and discourage precisely the kind of political party      activity that the First Amendment was designed to protect.       The ACLU continues to believe that the most effective and      least constitutionally     problematic route to genuine reform is a system of equitable      and adequate public financing. While reasonable people may      disagree about the proper approaches to campaign finance      reform, this bill's restraints on political party funding and      issue advocacy raise profound First Amendment problems and      should be opposed. The bill has a number of other severe      flaws, some old, some new, which we will address in a future      communication. But we wanted to take the opportunity to share      our assessment of two of the most salient problems with the      bill now.           Sincerely,     Ira Glasser,       Executive Director.     Laura W. Murphy,       Director, Washington Office.     Joel Gora,       Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School, and Counsel to the      ACLU.                                                                    ____Questions and Answers About Issue Advocacy (With Specific Reference to                    the Revised McCain-Feingold Bill)                       1. what is issue advocacy?       Issue advocacy can best be defined as any speech relating      to issues and the policy positions taken by candidates and      elected officials. It can be as simple as a statement like      ``Senator Doe's position on school vouchers is grievously      mistaken.'' Or it can be as involved as a multimillion dollar      campaign of broadcast and print advertisements that spreads      the same message. Any group or individual can engage in issue      advocacy.       Under current law, a message stops being considered ``issue      advocacy'' if it is accompanied by ``express advocacy'' or      actual statements advocating the election or defeat of a      clearly identified candidate for office, i.e. ``Senator Doe's      position on school vouchers is grievously mistaken and anyone      who cares about the separation of church and state should      vote against him in November.''       Although issue advocacy can leave the impression that a      listener should support or oppose a particular candidate,      such messages cannot--under current law--be treated (and      therefore regulated) as express advocacy by the Federal      Elections Commission.         2. Why is Congress trying to regulate issue advocacy?       During the 1996 elections, groups across the political      spectrum engaged in intense issue advocacy campaigns. Many      members of Congress felt they lost control of their campaigns      because of the unregulated and undisclosed advertising from      issue groups. Their concern that elections are ``out of      control'' seems to be the driving force in current efforts to      regulate issue advocacy.       Because of this loss of control, some federal lawmakers      seem to believe that candidates' interests should trump the      right of citizen involvement and speech. Also, many members      of Congress believe that issue advocacy became far too      political and powerful during the last election cycle. They      assert that these issue ads are really a subterfuge for      express advocacy communications. Many lawmakers and advocacy      groups think that all communications that could influence      the outcome of elections should be regulated by statute.   3. How will the revised McCain-Feingold legislation affect issue                                advocacy?       The legislation that the Senate will most likely vote on      during the next several days is a revised version of the      McCain-Feingold bill. The ACLU will soon be releasing an      analysis of the new legislation, but in the meantime, we      continue to assert that the issue advocacy provisions of the      revised bill are unconstitutional. Such unconstitutional      provisions include:       A permanent, year-round restriction on issue advocacy      achieved through redefining express advocacy in an      unconstitutionally vague and watered-down manner. The key to      the existing definition of express advocacy is the inclusion      of an explicit directive to vote for or vote against a      candidate. Minus the explicit directive or so-called ``bright      line test,'' what constitutes express advocacy will be in the      eye of the beholder, in this case the FEC. Few non-profit      issue groups will want to risk their tax status to engage in      speech that could be interpreted by the FEC to have an      influence on the outcome of an election.       A two-month black out on all television and radio issue      advertising before primary and general elections. The only      individuals and groups that will be able to characterize a      candidate's record on radio and television during this 60 day      period would be the candidates, PACs and the media. It seems      this ban would exclude issue advertising on cable, the      Internet, in print and in ads on movie screens.       A misleading ``exception'' for candidate voting records.      The voting records that would be permitted under this new      statute would be stripped of any advocacy-like commentary.      For example, depending on its wording, the ACLU (as a      501(c)(4) corporation) might be banned from distributing a      voting guide that highlighted members of Congress who have a      100 percent ACLU voting record as members of an ``ACLU Honor      Roll.'' Unless the ACLU chose to create a PAC to publish such      guides, we would be barred by this statute even though we do      not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.       Redefining ``expenditure,'' ``contribution'' and      ``coordination with a candidate'' so that legal and      constitutionally protected activities of issue advocacy      groups would become illegal. If the ACLU decided to take out      an advertisement lauding--by name--Senators for their      effective advocacy of constitutional campaign finance reform,      this ad would be counted as express advocacy on behalf of the      named Senators and therefore prohibited.       The Senate is threatening to erect a Byzantine set of laws      that pose a formidable barrier to citizen speech. This      barrier to free speech and free participation in the      electoral process is like a barbed wire fence. No individual      or group should try to scale it unless they are willing to      become ensnared in a complicated set of laws that have      significant penalties.       These provisions of the new McCain-Feingold legislation      would silence citizen speech to give candidates more control      over what is said about them prior to an election and      throughout the election year. Similar bans and disclosure      requirements were contained in the original McCain-Feingold      bill.       In addition, many of the pending reform bills in the House      and Senate such as H.R. 2183, the Bipartisan Campaign      Integrity Act of 1997, H.R. 493, the Bipartisan Campaign      Reform Act (which has evolved into H.R. 1776 and 1777, the      Campaign Independence Restoration Act, Parts I and II) and      H.R. 600, American Political Reform Act, among others, would      ban or impose burdensome and unconstitutional disclosure on      issue speech. 4. what are the problems with Congressional attempts to rein in issue                                advocacy?       The proposals being considered in the House and Senate have      manifold constitutional and practical problems.                       A. Constitutional Concerns       All of the proposals violate the First Amendment. Attempts      to regulate and require disclosure of issue advocacy through      statute and through FEC regulation have repeatedly been      declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and lower      federal courts. The Court has always viewed issue advocacy as      a form of speech that deserves the highest degree of      protection under the First Amendment. Not only has the Court      been supportive of issue advocacy, the justices have      affirmatively stated that they are untroubled by the fact      that issue advertisements may influence the outcome of an      election. In fact, in Buckley v. Valeo, the justices stated:       ``The distinction between discussion of issues and      candidates and advocacy of the election or defeat of      candidates may often dissolve in practical application      Candidates, especially incumbents, are often intimately tied      to public issues involving legislative proposals and      governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the      basis of their positions on various public issues, but      campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.      Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) at 42.''       Those of us who truly understand and defend the phenomenon      of issue advocacy freely acknowledge that the advertisements      and statements of issue groups do have political impact. In      fact, many groups hope that the voters will take candidate      positions and voting records into account when voters go to      the polls.       For example, groups like the ACLU want to continue to      discuss candidate positions on civil liberties issues before,      during and after elections, even though we are barred by our      own policies from endorsing or opposing particular candidates      for public office. Forbidding us to do so would make much of      our legislative advocacy irrelevant during large portions of      the year. Would we, for example, be permitted to criticize      Senator Doe for his position on vouchers after September 4?       The premise of the Federal Election Campaign Act and      current campaign reform proposals is that Congress can      control the quantity and qualify of all speech that      influences the outcome of elections in an attempt to make      elections ``fair.''       The Supreme Court has responded on repeated occasions to      this attempt to regulate political speech by invoking the      primacy of the First Amendment instead of deferring to the      concept of ``political speech equalization'' asserted by      Congress and FECA.       The only justification for any regulation of political      speech upheld by the Court has been to guard against the      reality or appearance of corruption. Although many have      criticized issue advocacy, few, if any, are asserting that it      fosters a quid pro quo form of corruption that the Court has      allowed Congress to guard against.       Defenders of the First Amendment know that the freedom to      engage in robust political debate in our democracy will be at      risk if the Congress or the FEC is given the authority to ban      issue ads close to an election, or evaluate the content of      issue ads to determine if they are really a form of express      advocacy. The Supreme Court recognized this danger long      before it decided Buckley. In an opinion issued in 1945 in      Thomas v. Collins, the Court stated:       ``. . . the supposedly clear-cut distinction between      discussion, laudation, general advocacy, and solicitation      puts the speaker in these circumstances wholly at the mercy      of the varied understanding of his hearers and consequently      of whatever inference may be drawn as to his intent and      meaning. Such a distinction offers no security for free      discussion. In these conditions it blankets with uncertainty      whatever may be said. It compels the speaker to hedge and      trim. Thomas v. Collins,'' 323 U.S. 516 (1945).       Given the Court's concern about the chilling effect      regulation has on speech, one     can better appreciate the need for a clear-cut standard for      limiting the kinds of communications that can be regulated by      campaign finance laws. While some are disheartened that the      FEC only has clear authority to regulate communications that      include express advocacy terms like ``vote for'' and ``vote      against,'' ``elect Doe for Congress,'' etc., others are      relieved that the FEC is not free to regulate all      political speech.       It is noteworthy that none of these proposals seek to      regulate the ability of the media to exercise its enormous      license to editorialize in favor or against candidates. If      the sponsors of these proposals to regulate issue advocacy      have their way, the only entities that would be free to      comment on candidates' records would be the press, PACs and      the candidates themselves.       With no proven record of corruption, why are citizen groups      being ejected from political debate during the crucial period      before elections?                       B. Practical Implications       The proposed McCain-Feingold statutory limitations on issue      advocacy would force groups that now engage in issue      advocacy--501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4)--to create new      institutional entities--PACs--to ``legally'' speak within 60      days before an election. The groups would also be forced to      disclose all contributors to the new PAC.       Opportunities that donors now have to anonymously      contribute to issue groups would be eliminated. Not all      members of non-profit organizations want to become members of      PACs. Separate accounting procedures, new legal costs and      separate administrative processes would be imposed on these      groups, merely so that their members could preserve their      First Amendment rights to comment on candidate records. It is      very likely that some groups will remain silent rather than      risk violating this new requirement or absorbing the      attendant cost of compliance.       This new provision may trigger Internal Revenue Service      review of the non-profit status of groups that elect to      create PACs. The IRS may justifiably examine the primary      purpose of the issue groups. Groups could face a loss of      members and tax deductible gifts for exercising their First      Amendment rights.       It is notable that the much ballyhooed Brennan Center      constitutional law professors letter recently released by      Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) is      conspicuously silent on the advocacy restrictions contained      in the bill.   5. Has Congress previously enacted laws regulating issue advocacy?       Yes, in 1974 Congress enacted a similar issue advocacy      disclosure law that was struck down in federal court. The      Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 was amended in 1974 to      require the disclosure to the Federal Election Commission of      issue groups engaged in ``any act directed to the public for      the purpose of influencing the outcome of an election, or      publishes or broadcasts issues to the public any material      referring to a candidate (by name, description, or other      reference) . . . setting forth the candidates position on any      public issue, [the candidate's] voting record, or other      official acts . . . or is otherwise designed to influence      individuals to cast their votes for or against such a      candidate or to withhold their votes from such candidate.'' 2      U.S.C. Sec. 437A.       Such groups would have been required to disclose to the FEC      in the same manner as a political committee or PAC. They      would have to make available every source of funds which were      used in accomplishing such acts.       This provision of the 1974 amendments was challenged by the      ACLU as part of the Buckley case. When the challenge came      before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit (prior to      coming before the Supreme Court), the provision was struck      down because it was vague and imposed an undue burden on      groups engaged in activity that is, and should be, protected      by the First Amendment. The D.C. Circuit Court ruling stated:       ``To be sure, any discussion of important public questions      can possibly exert some influence on the outcome of an      election preceding . . . But unlike contributions and      expenditures made solely with a view to influencing the      nomination or election of a candidate, issue discussions      unwedded to the cause of a particular candidate hardly      threaten the purity of the elections. Moreover, and very      importantly, such discussions are vital and indispensable to      a free society and an informed electorate. Thus, the interest      group engaging in nonpartisan discussions ascends to a high      plane, while the governmental interest in disclosure      correspondingly diminishes.''       It is noteworthy that the FEC did not appeal this aspect of      the Circuit Court's ruling.  6. Has the federal government and the Federal Elections Commission    tried to regulate issue advocacy in a way that would treat it as                            express advocacy?       It certainly has. In one early telling incident, three      elderly citizens with no connection to any candidate or      political party published an advertisement in early 1972 in      The New York Times that condemned the secret bombings of      Cambodia by the United States. The advertisement also called      for the impeachment of President Nixon and printed an honor      roll of those members of Congress who had opposed the      bombings. The honor roll included Senator George McGovern.       Although the ad was a classic example of speech protected      by the First Amendment, it violated a federal campaign      finance law, which effectively barred such expenditures on      the ground that they could influence the upcoming      presidential election by criticizing President Nixon and      applauding one of his possible opponents, Senator McGovern.      On the basis of this law, the U.S. government sued the three      in federal court, seeking to enjoin them from publishing such      ads, and wrote a letter to the Times threatening them with      criminal prosecution if they published such an ad again.       The ACLU represented the three citizens and won. But the      FEC has tried to regulate issue advocacy repeatedly since      then. As recently as October 5, 1995, and on March 13, 1996,      the FEC attempted to issue regulations severely      circumscribing the rights of issue advocacy groups to      communicate information on candidates.       In fact, the FEC has a terrible track record of trying to      broadly interpret current FECA statues to encompass issue      advocacy speech. While it is impossible to go into the facts      of every case, with the narrow exception of FEC v. Furgatch,      869 F.2d 1256 (9th Cir. Cal. 1989), the Supreme Court and the      lower courts have repeatedly rebuffed the FEC in this area.       In addition to Buckley, we suggest you look at the      following decisions: United States v. National Committee for      Impeachment, 469 F.2d 1135 (2d Cir, N.Y. 1972); American      Civil Liberties Union v. Jennings, 366 F. Supp. 1041 (D.D.C.      1973); FEC v. AFSCME, 471 F Supp. 315 (D.D.C. 1979); FEC v.      Central Long Island Tax Reform Immediately Committee, 616      F.2d 45 (2d Cir. N.Y. 1980); FEC v. NCPAC, 470 U.S. 480      (1985); FEC v. NOW, 713 F. Supp 428 (D.D.C. 1989); Faucher v.      FEC, 928 F.2d 468 (1st Cir. Me. 1991); FEC v. Survival      Education Fund, 65 F.3d 285 (2d Cir. N.Y. 1994); FEC v.      Christian Action Network, 110 F.3d 1049 (4th Cir. Va. 1997);      FEC v. GOPAC, 917 F. Supp. 851 (D.D.C. 1996); Maine Right to      Life Committee v. FEC, 98 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. Me. 1996); and      Clifton v. FEC, 114 F.3d 1309 (1st Cir. Me. 1997).                                                                    ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                    Washington, DC, April 14, 1997     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On February 20, 1997, I wrote to      you on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union urging      our strong opposition to S. 25, the Bipartisan Campaign      Reform Act of 1997. In that letter, we set forth the reasons      why we believe that bill is ``fatally and fundamentally      flawed when measured against First Amendment values.''       Thereafter, a letter was sent to Senators John McCain and      Russell Feingold by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU      School of Law. That letter asserted that the ACLU's analysis      of the constitutionality of S. 25 was based on arguments      which had been rejected in the Buckley case and would not      command majority support on the current court. Despite the      eminence of its author, however, the letter is incomplete and      incorrect in a number of key respects. We appreciate this      opportunity to demonstrate why and to respond to the charge      that we presented ``distorted descriptions of existing      constitutional law.''       Those provisions of S. 25 which seek to induce candidates      to adhere to spending limits in Senate campaigns and penalize      those who refuse, which severely restrict political action      committees and which likewise restrain contributions to      political parties are not justified by Buckley or later      cases. They will not survive strict scrutiny. The provisions      of the bill which assault independent political activity and      invade the absolutely protected sphere of issue speech are      precisely condemned by Buckley and its progeny and are all      but per se invalid. The entire sweep of the bill, including      the greatly expanded enforcement powers given to the Federal      Election Commission, is worse than the sum of its parts. It      is as objectionable an assault on political freedom as were      the provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act at issue      in Buckley.       Preliminarily, we would note that our condemnation of three      of the most extreme provisions of the bill--the total and      complete ban on any political contributions by political      action committees (Section 201), the sweeping new public      disclosure requirements targeting people who give as little      as $50 (Section 304) or even $20 (Section 101) to a Senate      candidate, and the xenophobic ban on political contributions      by lawful resident aliens--went unremarked in the Brennan      Center letter. Nothing in Buckley would justify the      constitutionality of these provisions, and we would welcome      the Brennan Center's joining us in denouncing them.         I. S. 25: The Unconstitutional Offer You Can't Refuse       Replying to our assertion that ``S. 25's coercive and      punitive scheme designed to compel candidates to accept      spending limits in Senate elections and to penalize those who      refuse, violates First Amendment principles,'' the Brennan      Center asserts that this is an argument that the ACLU lost in      the Buckley case.       There are three reasons why this is not so and why Buckley      does not control the validity of these provisions of S. 25.       First, we didn't lose that argument in Buckley because we      never made it. The primary contention was that the      Presidential public funding scheme discriminated against      those candidates and parties whom it excluded, not that it      exacted unconstitutional conditions and limitations from      those whom     it benefited, nor that it coerced compliance by penalizing      those who declined the offer.       Second, the Buckley Court did state that Congress could      condition acceptance of public funds on a candidate's      agreement to abide by specified spending limits, because a      candidate may decide voluntarily to forego private      fundraising and accept public funding. But a candidate or      party was free to reject that offer and choose to try to      raise and spend more money than the conditional limits would      permit, without regard to what opposing candidates or parties      did. The choice of one candidate did not affect the rights of      others. Whether that conditional funding scheme would survive      close scrutiny under the Court's unconstitutional conditions      doctrine is a substantial question.       But the scheme in S. 25 is not just a conditional funding      scheme which requires candidates to give up rights in order      to get benefits and which penalizes non-complying candidates      by denying them free television prime time, half-priced      purchased and discounted mass mailings rates. S. 25 is also a      contingent benefits scheme whereby the exercise of protected      campaign spending rights by a noncomplying candidate triggers      statutory fundraising benefits to his or her complying      opponent. Thus, if any noncomplying Senate candidate exceeds      the applicable spending limit by only 5% the complying      candidate's spending limit is raised tenfold by 50%.      Likewise, if a noncomplying candidate's expenditures exceed      155% of the limit, the complying candidate's ceiling is again      raised tenfold to 200%. And in both instances, the      contribution limits for the complying candidate, but not the      noncomplying one, are doubled from $1,000 to $2,000, making      it easier for the complying candidate to raise funds to      ``drown out'' the noncomplying candidate. Adding insult to      injury, noncomplying candidates are subject to more      burdensome disclosure requirements in order to enforce the      triggering mechanism that raises the spending limits and      contribution caps for their complying opponents.       Further, the law mandates that 60% of all contributions      must be raised in state in order to be eligible for the      benefits. Residency requirements can be the basis for who can      vote in an election but should not be the basis for who can      speak about an election. See McIntyre v. Ohio Board of      Elections, 517 U.S. (1995). Moreover, in-state limitations      could deprive particular kinds of underfinanced, insurgent      candidates of the kind of out-of-state support they need.      Just as much of the civil rights movement was fueled by      contributors and supporters from other parts of the nation,      so, too, are many new and struggling candidates supported by      interests beyond their home states. This proposal would      severely harm such candidacies. Perhaps that is its purpose.       In addition, Congress is our national legislature, and      although its representatives come and are elected from      separate districts and states, the issues that are debated      are, by definition, national issues that transcend district      and state lines and may be of concern to citizens all over      the nation. When such issues become central in certain      campaigns, people and groups from all over the country should      be entitled to have their views and voices heard on those      issues. Any other approach takes a disturbingly insular and      isolated view of political accountability and the obligations      of a Member of Congress.       The clear purpose and patent effect overall of this      conditional funding scheme is to chill and deter, dollar for      dollar, any candidate from trying to mount an effective high-     spending campaign. With this contingent limitation scheme,      incumbents, who will almost always opt for the public      funding, have arranged a way to have their cake and eat it      too. That scheme, which coerces candidates to accept the      limitations by penalizing them if they do not, is a far cry      from anything sustained in Buckley. It is an offer that few      can refuse.                      II. S. 25's Attacks on PACs       The bill whose constitutionality the Brennan Center vouches      for would totally and entirely ban PAC contributions to      Senate candidates, a wholly unprecedented restriction of the      rights of literally millions of Americans, most of them small      donors in the $25 to $100 range, to pool their resources to      amplify their voices. Such small-donor PACs affiliated with      groups running the gamut from the National Abortion Rights      Action League, the Human Rights Campaign Fund and Emily's      List, on the one hand, to the National Right to Life      Committee, the Christian Coalition and the National Rifle      Association, on the other, would be denied the right to      support the candidates of their choice.       Nothing in Buckley sustains such a radical restraint on the      right of freedom of speech and association. Buckley upheld a      $5,000 limit on political action committee contributions      to individual federal candidates, not the $0 limit, total      ban that Section 201 of S. 25 would impose on all Senate      campaigns.       Even the ``fall back'' provision that would impose a 20%      cap on the amount of PAC contributions that any Senate      candidate could receive operates, effectively, as a $0 limit,      total ban once that limit is reached. Once any Senate      candidate has received PAC contributions totaling 20% of the      applicable spending limit, all other groups are barred from      supporting that candidate and effectively silenced. In      Buckley the Court said that ``[g]iven the important role of      contributions in financing political campaigns, contribution      restrictions could have a severe impact on political dialogue      if the limitations prevented candidates and political      committees from amassing the resources necessary for      effective advocacy.'' 424 U.S. at 22. The Court found that      the contribution limits there survived close scrutiny under      that test, in large part precisely because the Act, though      limiting individual contributions to $1,000, permitted PACs      to contribute five times that amount, and provided for a      proliferation of PACs to fill the fundraising gap. Id. at 23,      29-30. A total or near-total ban on PAC contributions would      fail the Buckley test.       That is why reducing the PAC contribution ceiling to $1,000      is also extremely suspect. In 1976 dollars, that would be      about a $350 ceiling on contributions. It is simply      incredible to believe that the Buckley Court would have      upheld that low a limit on individual or PAC contributions,      especially when so many PACS are small donor PACs where the      concern with corruption is attenuated. The Brennan Center      letter is simply wrong in its assertion that ``in the years      since Buckley, the Supreme Court has upheld every      contribution limit that has come before it in an election      context.'' (p. 2). In Citizens Against Rent Control v.      Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290 1981), cited in our earlier letter,      the Court, by a vote of 8 to 1, invalidated a $250 limit on      personal contributions to local referendum campaigns. S. 25's      limits would be similarly vulnerable.           iii. s. 25's attacks on issue advocacy and speech       One of the central tenets of the Supreme Court's campaign      finance jurisprudence has been the critical distinction      between contributions and expenditures made by federal      candidates, or their campaigns or those who expressly      advocate their election or defeat, on the one hand, and all      other political and issue advocacy and discussion and      activity, even though it might influence the outcome of an      election, on the other. This constitutional Continental      Divide is compelled by the First Amendment and is built upon      the concept that only ``express advocacy'' of the election or      defeat of specific federal candidates can be subject to      regulation.       It is not that there is an inherent distinction between      issue speech and electoral advocacy. Quite the contrary, as      the Buckley Court recognized: ``For the distinction between      discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election      or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical      application. Candidates, especially incumbents, are      intimately tied to public issues involving legislative      proposals and governmental actions. Not only do candidates      campaign on the basis of their positions on various public      issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public      interest.'' 424 U.S. at 43. But Buckley held that if any      mention of a candidate in the context of discussion of an      issue rendered the speaker or the speech subject to campaign      finance controls, the consequences for the First Amendment      would be intolerable.       Accordingly, while candidate-focused contributions and      expenditures and ``express advocacy'' can be subject to      various restrictions or regulations, the Court clearly held      in Buckley that all speech which does not ``in express terms      advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified      candidate'' is totally free of any permissible regulation:      ``So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they      want to promote the candidate and his views.'' 424 U.S. at 45      (emphasis supplied). The purpose of this profound distinction      is to keep campaign finance regulations from overwhelming all      political and public speech.       The effect of the distinction has been manifold. It is the      express advocacy concept that defines the notion of ``soft      money'' which is political funding that is used for party-     building, get-out-the-vote activities and generic advertising      (``Vote Democratic''), all activities which do not      ``expressly advocate'' the election or defeat of specific      federal candidates. Because it is not used for such express      advocacy, it can be raised from sources that would be      restricted in making contributions or expenditures. It is the      express advocacy concept that separates an illegal corporate      expenditure advocating the election or defeat of a specific      candidate from an allowed issue advertisement discussing      public and political questions. Compare Austin v. Michigan      Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990) with First National      Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978). It is the      express advocacy concept that defines and cabins the concept      of independent expenditures and determines the permissibility      of coordinated expenditures. It is the express advocacy      concept that protects the myriad on non-partisan, issue-     oriented groups like the ACLU in their right to comment on      and criticize the performance of elected officials without      becoming ensnared in the federal campaign finance laws. See      Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F.2d 817, 832 (D.C. Cir. 1975).       And it is that critical constitutional distinction which S.      25 seeks to blur beyond recognition.                             A. Soft Money       As indicated, soft money is funding that does not support      ``express advocacy'' of the election or defeat of federal      candidates, even though it may exert an influence on the      outcome of federal elections in the broadest sense of that      term. It sustains primary political activity such as get-out-     the-vote drives     and issue advertising. That is why, contrary to the Brennan      Center's letter, the relevant precedent is not Austin which      involved express advocacy by corporations, but Colorado      Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal Election      Commission, 116 S.Ct. 2309 (1996), which upheld unlimited      independent expenditures by political parties on behalf of      their candidates.       Indeed, the unrestricted use of soft money by political      parties and non-party organizations like labor unions has      been invited by Buckley (``So long as persons and groups      eschew . . .''), authorized by Congress (see 2 U.S.C.      sections 431 (8)(A)(I) and (B)(xii) which permit soft money      for state elections and voter registration and get out the      vote drives), sanctioned and enhanced by rulings of the      Federal Election Commission and acknowledged by the Supreme      Court in last year's Colorado Republican case. In that case,      and despite a brief filed by the Brennan Center with charts      and graphs detailing large individual and corporate soft      money contributions to the two major parties and contending      that ``soft money contributions to local political parties      have cascaded into a flood of dollars from corporations,      labor unions, and wealthy donors that threaten the integrity      of the Act's federal contributions restrictions. . . .''      (Brief, p. 8) the Court nonetheless stated:       ``We recognize that FECA permits individuals to contribute      more money ($20,000) to a party than to a candidate ($1,000)      or to other political committees ($5,000). . . We also      recognize that FECA permits unregulated ``soft money''      contributions to a party for certain activities, such as      electing candidates for state office . . . or for voter      registration and ``get out the vote'' drives. But the      opportunity for corruption posed by these greater      opportunities for contributions is, at best, attenuated.      Unregulated ``soft money'' contributions may not be used to      influence a federal campaign, except when used in the limited      party-building activities specifically designated by      statute.'' Id. at 2316.       Accordingly, S. 25's sweeping and convoluted limitations on      the amount and source of soft money contributions to      political parties (Section 211 to 213) and disclosure of soft      money disbursements by other organizations (Section 211) are      not justified by precedent. Disclosure, rather than      limitation, of large soft money contributions to political      parties, is the appropriate remedy.       Nonetheless, we recognize that during the last election      cycle, many candidates for federal office spent as much time      responding to issue advertising and independent expenditures      as they did campaigning against the advertising emanating      from their opponents. The solution to this problem is not to      tamp down on issue advocacy, independent expenditures or soft      money contributions in a vague, overbroard and      unconstitutional manner. Rather, Congress should lift the      individual and PAC contribution limits so that candidates      have better control and access to the larger sums of money      necessary to finance their own campaigns, subject, of course,      to timely and appropriate disclosure.                      B. Independent Expenditures       The Court has repeatedly stated that independent      expenditures are at the core of the First Amendment's      protection because they embody citizen commentary on      government, politics, and candidates for elective office. See      Buckley v. Valeo, supra; FEC v. National Conservative PAC,      470 U.S. 480 (1985); Colorado Republican Federal Campaign      Committee v. FEC, supra. In our initial letter we identified      a number of ways in which S. 25 burdens and restrains      these core First Amendment rights.       First, S. 25 broadly expands the definition of      ``coordination'' so that virtually any person or group who      has had even the most casual interaction with a candidate or      a campaign is therefore barred from making independent      expenditures. Section 405.       Second, the bill imposes a number of new and burdensome      reporting and disclosure requirements on those who would make      such expenditures. Sections 241, 405. For example, any person      or group who spends more than $1,000 to place a small      political advertisement in The New York Times--a very small      ad--within three weeks of an election must file a report with      the government within 24 hours of when they arrange for the      ad--before it even runs. Section 241. Failure to do so can      result in civil monetary penalties or injunctive suits by the      Federal Election Commission. And what triggers the      application of these extensive new controls is any political      content which the government might deem ``express advocacy''      under the patently unconstitutional definition of that      concept contained in this bill. See infra.       Ignoring these serious concerns, the Brennan Center letter      focuses solely on the question of coordination between a      party and its candidate. Section 404. But even there the      letter ignores the fact that the Colorado Republican case      rejected the validity of a conclusive conclusion of      impermissible coordination whenever a party made an      expenditure in favor of its candidates. Yet S. 25 replaces      the rejected automatic conclusion with an all but conclusive      factual presumption of coordination and therefore limitation.                           C. Issue Advocacy       S. 25's worst assault on settled First Amendment principles      is its efforts to obscure the bright line test of ``express      advocacy'' that has been fashioned by the courts for 25 years      to protect the broad range of issue discussion in America      from campaign finance controls. The Buckley Court could not      have been more clear about the need for that bright line,      objective test which focuses solely on the speaker's words.      That test is an integral part of the First Amendment, no less      than the ``actual malice'' rule of New York Times Co. v.      Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964) in defamation cases, or the      ``incitement test'' of Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444      (1969) in subversive advocacy cases.       Indeed, the ACLU's initial encounter with campaign finance      laws was to defend against their very first use to try to      muzzle a small handful of dissenters who had published an      advertisement in The New York Times criticizing the President      of the United States. The government claimed that the ad was      ``for the purpose of influencing'' the outcome of the 1972      Presidential election. The government was resoundingly      rebuffed, and the courts ruled that the campaign finance laws      could not be used in such an open-ended fashion to control      issue speech. United States v. National Committee for      Impeachment, 469 F.2d 1135, 1139-1142 (2d Cir. 1972); see      also, American Civil Liberties Union v. Jennings, 366 F.Supp.      1041, 1055-57 (D.D.C. 1973, three-judge court); Buckley v.      Valeo, 519 F.2d. 817, 832 (D.C. Cir. 1975, en banc); Buckley      v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 42-45 and 76-80. Instead, ``express      advocacy'' would be the bright dividing line between campaign      advocacy and issue speech.       Now, S. 25 attempts to replace that time-honored concept      with the kind of vague and over broad formulas that Buckley      and other courts rejected, and the circle has turned full      round. Buckley said the First Amendment required that the law      could only regulate ``expenditures for commutations that in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate for federal office.'' Id. at 44, 80. The      very language and concepts that the Buckley Court rejected as      permissible definitions of regulatable electoral advocacy      have now reappeared in this bill. In Buckley the Court      rejected a triggering provision that regulated advocacy      speech ``relative to a clearly identified candidate.'' S. 25      regulates advocacy speech that ``refers to a clearly      identified candidate.'' Section 406. and any communication by      a political party to the public which ``refers to a clearly      identified candidate'' would be subject to regulation,      without more.       Beyond that, First Amendment rights would turn once again      on such vague and subjective concepts as whether the      communication ``conveys a message'' that advocates the      election or defeat of a particular candidate or that ``a      reasonable person would understand as advocating the election      or defeat'' of a candidate and that is ``made for the purpose      of advocating the election or defeat of the candidate as      shown by . . . a statement or action by the person making the      communication, the targeting or placement of the      communication, or the use by the person making the      communication of polling, demographic, or other similar data      relating to the candidate's campaign or election.''      Publication of ``box core'' voting records would be allowed      only if ``limited solely to providing information about the      voting record of elected officials on legislative matters and      that a reasonable person would not understand as advocating      the election or defeat of a particular candidate.'' That's      how incumbents would impede dissemination of information      about their voting records and official actions.       In an effort to defend these suspect provisions, the      Brennan Center letter distorts the meaning of the concept of      ``independent expenditure'' as defined by the Court. A      communication cannot be defined as an independent expenditure      because it is ``designed to affect the outcome'' of a federal      election or because the speaker's ``purpose and effect was to      advocate the election or defeat of an identified candidate''      or because the speaker's ``predominant intent'' was to do so.      The courts have rejected these subjective tests as      treacherously dangerous boundary lines to mark First      Amendment rights. Under the First Amendment, an independent      expenditure is only one which ``expressly advocates the      election or defeat'' of a specific candidate. And references      to ``so-called `issue ads' '' or ``phony `issue ads' ''      (Letter, pp. 5, 6) cannot change that fact. It is not      surprising that the letter cites no precedent for its support      of a bill which would undue 25 years of bright line      protection for issue-oriented speech.       S. 25 remains ``fatally and fundamentally flawed when      measured against First Amendment values.'' It contains 87      pages of tortured twists and turns seeking more and more      limits on political funding and therefore on political      speech. As we all know, that approach has not worked, and we      think it will not work, politically or constitutionally. We      think it is time instead, to explore ways to expand political      participation and opportunity that do not entail restricting      political speech such as meaningful and constitutional public      financing. We look forward to working with you to do so.           Sincerely,     Ira Glasser,       Executive Director.     Laura W. Murphy,       Director, Washington Office.     Joel Gora,       Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School, and Counsel to the      ACLU.                                                                         ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                Washington, DC, February 20, 1997.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing this letter to set      forth my views and those of the American Civil Liberties      Union National Office with respect to the constitutionality      of S. 25, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1997. A year      ago, I presented the opposition of the American Civil      Liberties Union to S. 1219, last year's campaign finance      bill. Once again, you have a bill before you which is fatally      and fundamentally flawed when measured against First      Amendment values. And one again we must oppose it.       The ACLU has long maintained that limitations on      contributions and expenditures used for the purpose of      advocating candidates and causes in the public forum violate      the First Amendment. Under the First Amendment, as properly      construed in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), Congress      cannot ration or restrict the political funding that      nourishes and sustains political speech. ``In the free      society ordained by our Constitution it is not the      government, but the people--individually as citizens and      candidates and collectively as associations and political      committees--who must retain control over the quantity and      range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.''      424 U.S. at 51.       I was an ACLU staff attorney who helped shape our pleadings      and argued before the Court in the Buckley case, which was a      landmark of political freedom. And, as a Professor of Law at      Brooklyn Law School, I have worked with the ACLU on these      issues ever since. Just last year, the continuing validity of      the First Amendment principles recognized in Buckley  was      reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, by a wide 7 to 2 margin, in      Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal      Election Commission, 116 S. Ct. 2309 (1996), a ruling which      struck down limitations on independent expenditures by      political parties.       In a number of critical respects, S. 25 runs afoul of these      cherished principles. For example:       S. 25's coercive and punitive scheme, designed to compel      candidates to accept spending limits in Senate elections and      to penalize those who refuse, violates First Amendment      principles.       The ban and severe limitations on political action      committees cuts to the heart of freedom of association.       The unprecedented restrictions and controls on raising and      spending `'soft money'' by political parties and even non-     partisan groups trammel the First Amendment rights of parties      and their supporters in a manner well beyond any compelling      governmental interest and violate the ruling in the Colorado      Republican case.       The radically expanded definition of ``coordinated''      expenditure will improperly restrict the core area of      independent electoral speech and wreak havoc on freedom of      association.       Worst of all, the new definitions of what constitutes      ``express advocacy'' are so vague and overbroad that they      transgress the great Constitutional Divide between partisan      electoral advocacy, subject to some regulation, and the      absolutely protected sphere of issue discussion, subject to      no permissible restraint. For twenty-five years courts have      fashioned and fostered that bright-line distinction in order      to protect the core values of the First Amendment. S. 25      seeks to undo those carefully crafted categories and      obliterate those constitutionally compelled distinctions.       The reduced record keeping threshold for contributions and      disbursements, from $200 down to $50, or for ``eligible''      candidates as low as $20, is a gross invasion of political      privacy.       The ban on political contributions by persons not eligible      to vote is an insult to the First Amendment which guarantees      free speech to all within our shores.       Last, but by no means least, the new enforcement powers      given to the Federal Election Commission to go to court in      the midst of a campaign to enjoin ``a violation of this Act''      pose an ominous and sweeping threat of prior restraint and      political censorship.       Let me elaborate briefly on these concerns.       1. S. 25's coercive and punitive scheme designed to compel      candidates to accept spending limits in Senate elections and      to penalize those who refuse, violates First Amendment      principles.       Title I of the bill, providing ``spending limits and      benefits'' for Senate campaigns, is an attempt to coerce what      the law cannot command, a backdoor effort to impose campaign      spending limits--which almost always benefit incumbents--in      violation of essential free speech principles and the      doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. The provisions for      ``voluntary'' expenditure limits and other campaign funding      controls, imposed in order to induce candidates to accept      ceilings and restrictions on political speech and penalize      and disadvantage those who will not do so, raise serious      First Amendment problems.       The receipt of public subsidies or benefits should never be      conditioned on surrendering First Amendment rights. That      would penalize the exercise of those rights. See Perry v.      Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972); FCC v. League of Women      Voters, 468 U.S. 364 (1984); Board of County Commissioners v.      Umbehr, 116 S. Ct. 2342 (1996). Since candidates have an      unqualified right to spend as much as they can to get their      message to the voters, and to spend as much of their own      funds as they can, and to raise funds from supporters all      over the country, they cannot be made to surrender those      rights in order to receive public benefits.       In Buckley the Court suggested that Congress might      establish a system where candidates would choose freely and      voluntarily between public funding with expenditure limits      and private spending without limits, so long as the non-     participating candidate remained free to engage in unlimited      private funding and spending. In that setting, the purpose of      the public financing of Presidential campaigns was ``not to      abridge, restrict or censor speech, but rather to use public      money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and      participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a      self-governing people.'' 424 U.S. at 92-93.       S. 25 fails this test, for its overall purpose and effect      are to limit speech, not enhance it. The bill imposes      substantial penalties on those disfavored, non-complying      candidates who will not agree to limit their campaign      expenditures, while it confers significant fund-raising      benefits upon those privileged candidates who adhere to the      limits. Privileged candidates get free broadcast time, and      sharply reduced broadcast and mailing rates. Disfavored      candidates must pay double promotional costs for the very      same communications. The bill contains triggers which      dramatically raise the spending ceilings and the contribution      caps for privileged candidates whenever disfavored candidates      threaten to mount a serious, well-funded campaign, or      whenever independent groups speak out against a privileged      candidate.       In effect, the bill tries to insure that privileged      candidates will always be able to counteract the messages of      disfavored candidates and their supporters. The law stacks      the deck against the candidate who will not agree to limits,      which will usually be the challenger trying to defeat      an incumbent. In short, this scheme does everything      possible to enable the candidate who agrees to spending      limits to overwhelm the candidate who does not. That is      not a level playing field. Lower courts have been quick to      invalidate such one-sided, lopsided ``voluntary'' schemes.      See Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Maupin, 71 F.3d      1422, 1426 (8th Cir. 1995) (``We are hard-pressed to      discern how the interests of good government could      possibly be served by campaign expenditure laws that      necessarily have the effect of limiting the quantity of      political speech in which candidates for public office are      allowed to engage.''); Day v. Holohan, 34 F.2d 1356 (8th      Cir. 1994).       2. The various limitations on PAC contributions violate      freedom of speech and association.       Section 201 of the bill would ban all political      contributions by political action committees. This would cut      to the heart of the First Amendment's protection of freedom      of political speech and association. The bill would give a      permanent political monopoly to political parties and      political candidates, and would silence all those groups that      want to support or oppose those parties and candidates. PACs      come in all sizes and shapes and provide vehicles for      millions of Americans to amplify their voices. There is not a      word in Buckley or any case which suggests that the Court      would uphold a total ban on PAC contributions to federal      candidates and still all those voices. Frankly, this is just      political grandstanding. That's why there is a ``fall back''      provision which would impose a $1,000 cap on PAC      contributions, which is also of very doubtful      constitutionality. See Committee Against Rent Control v.      Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290 (1981); Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414      (1988); Carver v. Nixon, 72 F.3d 633 (8th Cir. 1995). In any      event, this provision is fatally overbroad because it treats      all PACs alike, even those made up only of small      contributors.       Likewise, the ban on ``bundling'' of individual PAC      contributions would abridge the freedom of association which      the Supreme Court has recognized as a ``basic constitutional      freedom.'' Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 57 (1973). As the      Court has pointedly observed, ``the practice of persons      sharing common views banding together to achieve a common end      is deeply embedded in the American political process.''      Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 294      (1981).       Finally, the cap of 20% on PAC contributions that may be      received will simply make it harder for candidates to raise      funds, intrude upon freedom of speech and association and act      like yet another backdoor effort to limit overall campaign      expenditures, all in violation of Buckley's core principles.       3. The unprecedented controls on ``soft money'' are      unjustified restraints on political parties and other      organizations, as are the restraints on coordinated      expenditures.       Sections 211, 212, 213 and 221 of the bill would severely      limit and restrict the sources and use of soft money by      political parties and other organizations. The new sweeping      limitations and controls on ``soft money'' contributions to      and disbursements by political parties and other      organizations, federal, state or local, would expand the      reaches of the FECA into unprecedented new areas, far beyond      what any compelling interest would require. The reach of      these proposals is breathtaking and unprecedented.       Indeed, just last June, the Court cast grave doubt upon the      constitutionality of these various provisions. By a 7 to 2      margin, the Court ruled that even candidate-focused, ``hard      money'' expenditures by political parties were fully      protected by First Amendment principles and the Buckley      precedents.     In Federal Election Commission v. Colorado Republican Federal      Campaign Committee, supra, the Court gave full constitutional      protection to unlimited party independent expenditures and      invalidated the FEC rule that treated all candidate-focused,      independent party expenditures as though they were      ``coordinated'' with the candidate and therefore subject to      limitations. In language powerfully relevant here the Court      held: ``We do not see how a Constitution that grants to      individuals, candidates, and ordinary political committees      the right to make unlimited independent expenditures could      deny the same right to political parties.'' 116 S.Ct. at      2317. The case for thorough protection for ``soft money'' is      even stronger, since it is used by definition for voter      registration, get-out-the-vote, ``generic'' advertising like      ``Vote Democratic'' and other party-building activities.       Equally significant, the Court squarely rejected the      sweeping claims that soft money spent by political parties      was ``corrupting'' the system and had to be stopped: ``We      also recognize that the FECA permits unregulated `soft money'      contributions to a party for certain activities. . . . But      the opportunity for corruption posed by these greater      opportunities for contributions is, at best, attenuated.''      116 S.Ct. at 2316.       Finally, Section 404, the new provision that tells      political parties that they can continue to make      ``coordinated'' expenditures on behalf of their candidates      only if they forfeit their Colorado Republican Committee      right to make independent expenditures supporting that      candidate is yet another example of how this bill coerces the      surrender of one constitutional right in order to exercise      another. That kind of coercion should be rejected out of      hand.       4. The new restrictions on independent expenditures      improperly intrude upon that core area of electoral speech      and impermissibly invade the absolutely protected area of      issue advocacy.       Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity after      twenty years of campaign finance decisions. First,      independent expenditures for ``express'' electoral advocacy      by citizen groups about political candidates lie at the very      core of the meaning and purpose of the First Amendment.      Second, issue advocacy by citizen groups lie totally outside      the permissible area of government regulation. See Buckley v.      Valeo, 424 U.S. at 14-15, 78-80, First National Bank of      Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978); FEC v. Massachusetts      Citizens For Life, 479 U.S. 238, 249 (1986). This bill      assaults both principles.       First, Section 405 of the bill vastly expands the concept      of ``coordinated'' expenditures so that virtually any person      who has had any interaction with a candidate or a campaign is      therefore barred from making independent expenditures. These      definitions and limitations embody an impermissible kind of      ``gag order by association.'' See De Jonge v. Oregon, 299      U.S. 353 (1937). Second, if significant independent      expenditures are made ``in support of another candidate or      against'' an eligible, privileged candidate, the spending      limits of the latter are raised to make it easier to      counteract the independent. speech. Finally, new and expanded      reporting requirements are imposed on independent speakers.      All of this is designed to chill and deter core electoral      advocacy.       Worst of all is S. 25's blunderbuss assault on issue-     oriented speech. The weapon is an unconstitutional expansion      of the definition of ``express advocacy'' in order to sweep      classic issue speech within the zone of regulation as      independent expenditures. The bill abandons the bright line      test of express advocacy (words which in express terms      advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, such as      ``Vote for Smith,'' ``Vote Against Jones,'' ``Elect,''      ``Defeat''), a test which the Supreme Court held was mandated      by the First Amendment. Instead, Section 406 of the bill      would treat as express advocacy any communication ``that      conveys a message that advocates the election or defeat of a      clearly identified candidate'' or, worse, ``that a reasonable      person would understand as advocating the election or defeat      or a candidate.'' A safe harbor provision, for a      communication that ``is limited solely to providing      information about the voting record of elected officials on      legislative matters and that a reasonable person would not      understand as advocating the election or defeat or a      particular candidate'' is circular and no safe harbor at all.      Indeed, the prospect of subjecting free speech rights to the      post facto assessment of a ``reasonable person'' test would      undo decades of First Amendment jurisprudence designed to      protest First Amendment rights against the vagueness and      uncertainly of such a standard.       This provision attacking issue ads and legislative advocacy      would sweep in the kind of essential issue advocacy which      Buckley and cases predating Buckley by a generation, see      Thomas v. Collins 323 U.S. 516 (1945), have held immune from      government regulation and control. It seems to be targeted      exactly against the kind of voting record, ``box score''      discussion that emanates from the hundreds and thousands or      issue organizations that enrich our public and political      life. In Buckley, the Court adopted the bright line test line      test of express advocacy in order to immunize issue advocacy      from regulation: ``So long as person or groups eschew      expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or      defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to      spends as much as they want to promote the candidate and his      views.'' Id. at 45.       Most significantly, the Act at issue in Buckley contained a      similar provision regulating issue-oriented groups because of      their ``box score'' ratings of public officials and      comparable activities. That provision was unanimously held      unconstitutional by the en banc Court of Appeals, without any      further appeal by the government. See Buckley v. Valeo, 519      F.2d 817, 832 (D.C. Cir 1975). Circuit Judges running the      gamut from Bazelon and Wright to Robb and Mackinnon were      unanimous in their condemnation of that effort to control      issue speech. The new and expanded definition of ``express      advocacy'' in S. 25 is similarly, grievously flawed.       5. The bill gives unacceptable new powers of prior      restraint and political censorship to the Federal Election      Commission.       With all of these problems with the bill, particularly      those that pertain to issue advocacy and independent      expenditures, giving the Federal Election Commission sweeping      new powers to go to court to seek an injunction on the      allegation of a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . .      . is about to occur'' is fraught with First Amendment peril.       Where sensitivity to the core constitutional protection for      issue advocacy is concerned, the Commission has, in the words      of one appellate judge, ``failed abysmally.'' See Federal      Election Commission v. CLITRIM, 616 F.2d 45, 53-54 (2d Cir.      1980)(Kaufman, C.J. concurring). And ever since then, non-     partisan, issue-oriented groups like the ACLU, the National      Organization for Women, the Chamber of Commerce, Right-to-     Life Committees and many others have had to defend themselves      against charges that their public advocacy rendered them      subject to all the FECA's restrictions, regulations and      controls. The kind of ``chilling effect'' that such      enforcement authority generates in the core area of protected      speech makes the strongest case against giving the Commission      additional powers to tamper with First Amendment rights.       S. 25 is not the way to reform campaign finance. It is bad      constitutional law and bad political reform. True reform      would expand political participation and funding, without      limits and conditions, not restrict contributions and      expenditures by which groups and individuals communicate      their messages to the voters.       Thank you for the opportunity to set forth these views.           Sincerely,                                                 Joel M. Gora,                                                 Professor of Law,                                              Brooklyn Law School.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there was an editorial in Friday's Wall Street Journal entitled ``The Beltway's Hale-Bopp'' with regard to the bill before us today. And I ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 3, 1997]                        The Beltway's Hale-Bopp       Campaign finance reform, also known as McCain-Feingold,      isn't merely a legislative proposal. Campaign finance reform      is now a religion.       Somehow in the past several years, campaign finance reform      transmuted from a cause into a belief system. It is the      Beltway's version of the Heaven's Gate cult, in which the      powers attributed to the Hale-Bopp comet have been      transferred to the McCain-Feingold bill. It has become the      mothership that will transport the American people away from      the failings of modern politics and toward a purer system of      government. One can almost hear the pundits' plaintive chorus      preparing for the bill's passage: ``Knock, knock, knockin' on      heaven's door.''       Interestingly, most of the McCain-Feingold cult's adherents      aren't run-aways or overworked computer programmers. Instead,      they hold down jobs in the print and electronic media.      Articles and editorials evangelizing for McCain-Feingold pour      forth like a river. An acquaintance of ours had the      misfortune of finding herself flying cross-country recently      seated next to a McCain-Feingold fundamentalist. It was an      arduous six hours.       We raise these matters not in a spirit of rank partisanship      (the Anti-Partisans being another aborning Beltway cult,      incidentally), but out of concern for these loved ones. By      nature, our media brethren are a skeptical lot. A managing      editor once told us that some of his reporters declined his      entreaties to get involved in the life of their local      communities because ``it might compromise my objectivity.''      Normally, excepting the occasional marches on behalf of      abortion rights, these are hard cases.       So how else, other than religious belief, to explain why so      many have become so attached to a legislative proposal that      is objectively unconstitutional, that would cheerfully allow      federal bureaucrats to regulate political speech while      shrinking from, as if from sunlight, the regulation of      pornography?       One of the two most important components of McCain-Feingold      would explicitly forbid ``issues ads'' that mention a      candidate's name within 60 days of a federal election. The      Supreme Court made no dent with a whole series of decisions      starting in 1976 with Buckey v. Valeo, which held that     the law may be able to limit contributions, but that limits      on expenditures, even from the personal fortune of an actual      candidate, violate the Constitution. But the crusade rolls on      even in the face of a Supreme Court decision as recent as      last year's Colorado Republican Party v. Federal Election      Commission, in which the court struck down limitations on      official party spending on behalf of its candidates. That is      to say the second half of McCain-Feingold, the ban on ``soft      money,'' is also unconstitutional. Justice Breyer wrote for      the court: ``The independent expression of a political      party's views is `core' First Amendment activity.''       Then, of course, there is the phrase with which the First      Amendment closes, about making no law abridging the right      ``to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.''      That is, lobbying. Now admittedly the Founding Fathers were      rationalists who lived in the shadow of the long-ago      Enlightenment. In our newer age no stronger article of faith      abides around the Beltway than that anyone who ``lobbies''      the Congress about their grievances against, say, the Clean      Air Act, is corrupting the vestal virgins who inhabit that      place. McCain-Feingold, according to Senator McCain, would      thwart the lobbies from interfering with the deliberations of      Congress. That is to say, the politicians who command a third      of all the money in the Gross Domestic Product want to pass      laws against taxpayers trying to influence them.       At the end of the day we remain skeptics, less so of      McCain-Feingold than of its advocates' professions of      nonpartisanship. The problem with campaign finance as it      exists is not so much the inevitable corruptions, but that      these corruptions are so secret, as the tortuous hearings of      the Thompson Committee have proven. Full disclosure--daily,      publicly, electronically--of contributions from whatever      source, from cloistered Buddhist nuns to ethanol fanatics,      would let voters decide for themselves which imperfect soul      they wished to vote into office.  Mr. McCONNELL. Further, Mr. President, there was an op-ed piece in the Washington Times by Peggy Ellis of the Cato Institute entitled ``10 Big Lies About Campaign Finance Reform. . . .'' I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 7, 1997]            10 Big Lies About Campaign Finance Reform . . .                            (By Peggy Ellis)       Lie No. 1: The American people are clamoring for campaign      finance reform. Outside of Washington and the political      elites, campaign finance reform finishes at the bottom of the      list of issues people care about (3 percent). Most voters      believe that whatever reforms are passed, politicians will      find a way around the new rules (73 percent). By huge      margins, voters are less likely to vote for their member of      Congress if they vote for reforms that are unconstitutional      (88 percent), make it easier for them to get re-elected (71      percent), make it more difficult for citizens' groups to      inform voters of candidates' voting records (80 percent) or      increase the relative power of the media (69 percent)      (Tarrance Group, June 1997).       Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican known as      the ``Darth Vader of campaign finance reform,'' won re-     election last year with a 160,000 vote margin--without the      endorsements of the two largest newspapers because of his      stance on ``reform'' and with the maximum contributions      allowed by law from the tobacco companies. Rep. Linda Smith,      Washington Republican, won her first election while being      hugely outspent by the incumbent. She then became the darling      of campaign finance reformers and almost lost.       Lie No. 2: Only wealthy special interests have access to      members of Congress. Poppycock. The first item on all      members' calendars is, and will always be, constituents.      Members of Congress meet with lobbyists and policy experts      all day long and then go vote the way they want to. Further,      it is part of every legislative aide's job to meet with all      sides to best prepare their boss for whatever the issue might      be. As Senator Bob Bennett, Utah Republican, said at a recent      hearing, ``I'll tell you who has access to me--anyone      registered to vote in the state of Utah.''       Lie No. 3: Banning soft money is the only way to ensure      that the scandals of the '96 presidential election don't      happen again. The best way to make sure the abuses of '96      don't happen again is to punish those who have broken the      law. Soft money was banned in the original 1974 rules and the      1976 election was run without soft money. Parties were so      strapped for cash that traditional activities such as bumper      stickers and get-out-the-vote drives were sharply curtailed.      One of the primary purposes of the 1979 amendments to federal      election law was to restore soft money. Traditional party-     building activities are clearly not what the reformers want      to control. It is the issue ads run by the parties--which are      the essence of First Amendment protected speech. To eliminate      this distortion, eliminate the limits on party contributions      to their candidates. It is bizarre that political parties      cannot give directly to their candidates as much as they      want. No claims can be made of a corrupting relationship      between a candidate and his or her political party. And for      those who want to open up the political process and loosen      the grip of incumbents political parties are the one group      that will always support a challenger.       Lie No. 4: You can constitutionally control issue advocacy.      It is often forgotten that in the original 1974 amendments to      the Federal Elections Campaign Act, Congress sought to limit      issue ads, just as many do now. The Supreme Court overturned      these rules. Nothing is more central to the core of what our      country was founded on than the ability of private      individuals and groups to discuss, criticize and protest      their elected officials and those that seek office. A 20-year      string of court decisions reaffirm that free and unencumbered      political speech enjoys the highest First Amendment      protection and cannot be regulated by the federal government.       Lie No. 5: Most issue ads are ``thinly veiled campaign      ads'' and, therefore, can and must be regulated by the      Federal Election Commission. Nothing is more central to the      First Amendment than the rights of individuals and groups to      participate openly and freely in our nation's political      debate. Reformers and misinformed senators claim that, since      issue ads are clearly intended to influence an election, they      should be regulated. Buckley vs. Valeo anticipated this      argument. Of course, the Court held, these ads are intended      to influence elections, but our First Amendment rights are so      central to our political freedom that unless the words ``vote      for'' or ``vote against'' are used, these ads are issue      advocacy and cannot be regulated by the government.       Lie No. 6: McCain-Feingold will open up the system. In      fact, McCain-Feingold could be renamed the Incumbent      Protection Act. The stratospheric incumbent re-election rate      we have today is a direct result of the 1974 rules.      Contribution and spending limits and tighter controls on      issue advocacy are blatant incumbent protection. All the      distortions in the current system are results of the 1974      rules--the 90 percent incumbent re-election rate, the      explosion of issue advocacy and soft money and the increase      of millionaires in office, the amount of time candidates have      to spend raising money, the increase in the relative power of      the media and celebrities. More of the same is not the      answer.       Lie No. 7: Buckley was a 5-to-4 decision and ``a close      call,'' vulnerable to future court tests. On the contrary--we      have years of court decisions reaffirming the central      findings of the Buckley decision. In the area of issue      advocacy alone, in the years since Buckley was decided, both      the Supreme Court and lower courts have, time and time again,      reaffirmed the reasoning and holding of that decision as it      pertains to the protection of issue advocacy. The 126      ``constitutional scholars'' currently said to endorse McCain-     Feingold do not endorse the issue advocacy restrictions at      all--only the soft money and spending limits. In fact, the      Fourth Circuit was so disturbed by the FEC's attempts to      redraw the lines defining issue advocacy that the court      demanded in April that the FEC pay Christian Action Network's      court costs.       Lie No. 8: Campaign costs are spiraling out of control.      This ``explosion'' is outside of candidate spending.      Candidate spending was virtually flat from 1994 to 1996, with      an explosion of issue ads outside of the campaigns      themselves. The answer, however, is not to trample the First      Amendment rights of private individuals, but to lift the      contribution limits on parties and candidates. Let the money      spent on many of the issue ads flow directly to the      candidates. As for the anger many members have at private      groups expressing their views and--absolutely--trying to      influence their election: too bad! Politics and political      campaigns belong to the people, not to the candidates and      certainly not the federal government. The right to seek to      persuade fellow citizens at election time is as fundamental      as the right to vote itself.       Lie No. 9: Obscene amounts of money are spent in political      campaigns. Congressional candidates spent approximately $740      million in 1996. This is only slightly higher than the      approximately $700 million spent in 1994. It's a lot of      money--but not when compared to what we spend as a society in      other areas. These congressional totals average less than $4      per eligible voter. If you look at every race in the country,      from dog catcher to president, the amount spent is less than      $10 per eligible voter. As a society, we spend more on potato      chips, Barbie dolls, yogurt and a host of other commodities      than we do on politics. While many of us may like Barbie      dolls and potato chips more than we like politics, only      politics has control over every aspect of our lives.       Lie No. 10: We must control the amount of money spent in      campaigns because candidates and members of Congress have to      spend all their time raising money. It is the ridiculous      $1,000 contribution limit that has limited the ability of      challengers to raise the money they need to mount a      successful campaign--and the reason members of Congress have      to spend so much time raising money. The answer is not to      control the amount candidates can spend, which would only      further entrench incumbents, but to eliminate the      contribution limits. Let the money flow directly to the      candidates and, with almost-instant electronic disclosure,      let the voters decide.
