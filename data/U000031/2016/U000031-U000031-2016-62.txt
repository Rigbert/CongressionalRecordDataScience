Speaker, today really does mark a milestone, a milestone for our majority, a milestone for this Congress, and a milestone for the American people, as we make great strides to update our Nation's chemical safety laws.  Folks said it could not be done, especially with Republicans in Congress and a Democratic President. This was a multiyear effort that dates back to at least the last Congress. But we took the time, and we did the hard work.  We put in countless hours of discussions and negotiations virtually every weekend, and it paid off. This legislation will have monumental impacts for commerce, the environment, and public health.  In 1976, under the leadership of Michigan's great President Jerry Ford, TSCA was a novel approach to regulating interstate commercial activity to address unreasonable risks presented by a chemical.  It was not meant to examine every piece of chemical manufacturing and use, but, rather, to provide a backstop of protection when suspicions about dangerous chemicals were not being addressed.  In the nearly 40 years since TSCA's enactment, there have been persistent concerns about the pace of the EPA's work on chemicals, the ability of the Agency to meaningfully use its existing authority, and whether the statute prevents certain regulatory efforts.  Over the last 3 years, the House Energy and Commerce Committee has conducted nine hearings, all on the aspects of TSCA. We learned that there is public confusion about chemical-specific safety claims. We learned that people think that the EPA should clear up that confusion and be more diligent on risky chemicals.  Finally, we learned that companies and workers were disadvantaged in a domestic and global marketplace where conflicting regulatory standards, indeed, hamper trade.  Within the last decade, a variety of factors, including the EPA's slow pace in regulating chemicals already on the market, have led to several new State chemical control statutes.  Some States have passed laws ranging from specific chemical restrictions to general chemical labeling requirements, like Prop 65 in California. Meanwhile, some retailers have called out for an objective scientific assessment of chemicals in consumer products.  Almost a year ago our committee unanimously reported this bill and the House passed it 398-1. In December, the Senate approved a package of TSCA reforms. The Senate's bill was quite different from the House, but the compromise agreement--this one--includes many of the Senate policy details.                              {time}  1500  The resolution before us gives EPA more direct tools in obtaining testing information on chemical substances, specifying key points in the evaluation and regulatory process where EPA may order testing. In addition, the compromise text reduces animal testing required under TSCA. It restructures theway existing chemicals are evaluated and regulated. The bill clarifies the treatment of trade secrets submitted to EPA.
