 We obviously last week agreed on how much we were going to spend, so the question of spending has been removed. The 302(b) allocations were completed yesterday. Our friends on the other side said they were happy with them. They are running out of excuses, but the end result is the same: They are still not allowing us to go forward on the Defense bill.  I would say to my friend and colleague from Texas that I heard these conspiracy theories that we had some trick to play here. I made it clear not only to my counterpart the Democratic leader but to other Democratic Senators that there is no nefarious scheme. We thought, all objections having been removed, the appropriate thing to do would be to try--by pursuing regular order, try to pass some of the appropriations bills, given the limited amount of time we have left. Yet they kept on doing the same thing with the exception of the veterans bill. It is a mystery.  The level of dysfunction the other side seems to be promoting is bad for the institution and bad for the country.
