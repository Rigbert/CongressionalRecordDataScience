Yet, the same Senators blocking Patricia Millett's confirmation were not concerned when an unnecessary shutdown of the government cost the taxpayers billions of dollars.  I also note that under President Bush, there were 11 judges on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals with a lower caseload. Now there are 8 judges with a higher caseload. The numbers are the numbers.  President Obama is being treated differently than President Bush was. Patricia Millett is being treated differently than John Roberts was. It is not fair, it is not an extraordinary circumstance, and there is no justification for it.
