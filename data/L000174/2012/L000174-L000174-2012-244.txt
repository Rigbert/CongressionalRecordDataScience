I do not say that for self-congratulations because we should acknowledge that we had already confirmed 150 of President Bush's circuit and district court nominees 9 months earlier, in September of his third year in office.  In other words, to have matched what we had done so far for President Obama, we would have had to have had this number late last year. I mention that because it is one measure of how far behind we are in the consideration of President Obama's nominees. Part of that is because a very large number of nominees who went through the Judiciary Committee unanimously last year who would normally be confirmed by voice vote within 1 week or so after they went through Committee were delayed on the Executive Calendar until this year.  I would point out another thing, which is that today is June 11, but by June 15 of President Bush's fourth year in office, the Senate had already confirmed 180 Federal circuit and district court judges--150 for President Obama, 180 for President Bush--30 more judges for President Bush than we have been allowed to consider and confirm during President Obama's administration to date.
