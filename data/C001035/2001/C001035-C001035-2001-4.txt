President, I also would like to briefly speak on the LPD-17 program, which is a critical ship for the modernization of the Navy's amphibious force. Each of these ships can carry more than 700 Marines and their equipment to shore to perform their mission. The LPD-17 program is critical to replace four aging classes of ships and to significantly increase the operational capabilities of the Marine Corps.
