 President, I ask unanimous consent to have my letter to Senator McConnell dated December 17, 2015, printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                Washington, DC, December 17, 2015.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington,          DC.       Dear Leader McConnell: I request to be notified before any      unanimous consent agreement is agreed to regarding the      nomination of David Malcolm Robinson to be Assistant      Secretary for Conflict and Stabilization Operations and      Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization. This      request is intended to be made publicly and will be disclosed      in the Congressional Record so my name need not be withheld.       Thank you for your assistance.           Sincerely,                                          Charles E. Grassley,                                                         Chairman,     Committee on the Judiciary.                          ____________________
