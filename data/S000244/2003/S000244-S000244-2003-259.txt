Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, this substitute is identical to H.R. 809, and that bill is a phony ban which would grant a giant loophole that allows abortionists to perform partial-birth and third-trimester abortions at will. The substitute, which would prohibit the performance of an abortion after the unborn infant became viable, would not prohibit any abortion, from the substitute, ``if, in the medical judgment of the attending physician, the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the woman or to avert serious adverse health consequences to the woman.''  The proponents of this substitute admit that their measure would allow any abortion at any stage of pregnancy if the mother's mental health is at risk. Thus, by its own term, this bill would not prohibit partial-birth abortions, nor would it prohibit late-term abortions because it grants the abortionist, who has a financial interest in performing as many abortions as possible, unbridled discretion to determine whether a partial-birth or third-trimester abortion may be performed.  Abortionists have demonstrated that they can and will justify any abortion on the grounds that it, in the judgment of the attending physician, is necessary to avert serious adverse health consequences to the woman. For example, Dr. Warren Hern of Colorado, the author of the standard textbook on abortion procedures who also performs many third-trimester abortions, has stated, ``I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.'' This is a man who has a financial interest in performing the abortion, and this is the physician who under the Greenwood substitute would be able to certify that the loophole is proper and the abortion can be performed.  I will quote from Dr. Hern again: ``I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.''  The substitute sponsors have stated that even psychological trauma caused by the pregnancy could justify an abortion, including a partial-birth abortion at any stage of pregnancy, including the third trimester.  The substitute would also have no effect on most partial-birth abortions because the bill only prohibits abortions after the fetus is viable in the vast majority of partial-birth abortions are performed on babies 4\1/2\ to 5\1/2\ months in development. Before it can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a given baby is viable, remember we are dealing with criminal statutes here; and prosecution, if this bill becomes law, the substitute becomes law, must prove that the fetus is viable in order for the ban to kick in.  The lung development of babies at this stage of pregnancy is such that most of them cannot survive if delivered from the mother's womb prematurely. Many of them can survive, but the percentages are such estimates of 39 percent of babies born at 23 weeks that it would be impossible for the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any given one of these babies would have survived in a given case.  Given the substitute's failure to define the term ``viable,'' it would not be sufficient to show that the baby had a one in three or one in two or even a three in four chance of survival. Unless the baby was in the seventh month of pregnancy or later, reasonable doubt would remain as to whether that particular baby would have survived outside the womb.  Furthermore, the notion that viability is a prerequisite for giving any legal protection to a child is misguided. Premature infants who are born before the third trimester with little or no chance of survival are fully entitled to the protections of law while they are alive. A person could not, for example, just walk into a neonatal intensive care unit and kill an infant who was born 23 weeks into the pregnancy and is in an incubator struggling to survive. That child has only a 39 percent chance of surviving, but his ultimate viability has no bearing on whether or not he is entitled to the protections of the law.  In the same way, partially born children with little or no chance of survival outside the womb are entitled to the protections of law. Viability is simply not a prerequisite for legal protection of born or partially born children.  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against the substitute.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1845
