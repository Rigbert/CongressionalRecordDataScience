Speaker, this irresponsible shutdown of the government has deprived Oregonians of many federal services that they rely on. For the time being the Veterans Administration has been able to use reserve funds to continue providing benefits and medical services to our nation's veterans. Today the Republicans put a disingenuous bill on the floor, H.J. Res. 72, that claimed to fund the VA while the rest of the government remains shut down. H.J. Res. 72 would cut the VA budget by $6.2 billion. It provides no funding for prosthetic research, VA cemeteries, construction of VA facilities including the new CBOC in Eugene, Oregon, and many other critical services. This is unacceptable. I refuse to cut funding for our nation's veterans. For that reason I voted against H.J. Res. 72. The Republican House leadership needs to ignore the small faction of their party that insists holding our veterans and other Americans hostage. They need to bring the Senate passed funding bill to the floor for a vote so that we can reopen the government. Our veterans deserve no less.   I strongly support H.R. 813, which would authorize advance appropriations for all VA discretionary accounts. I fought for years to get advance appropriations for the VA, which we finally secured for medical accounts. It is time to ensure that all of the VA receives advance appropriations so that veterans are never again used as a political football. I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 3181, which would make sure that every account at the VA is exempt from any future across-the-board sequestration.
