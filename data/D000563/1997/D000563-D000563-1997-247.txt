Senator Barbara Boxer of California and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa could not be here for this debate, but they wanted to have their names joined in support of our effort.  In conclusion, I will say that my colleague from Rhode Island brings home the conclusion to this debate; that is, if we shirk our responsibilities to these working families, if we walk away from a Medicare promise of over three decades, we will end up with people in unfortunate circumstances, many of them sick, presenting themselves for care without any health insurance, without Medicare. Of course, most hospitals and most health care providers in this country will do their best to treat them anyway. Then the cost of that care will be borne by everyone, borne by those who pay into insurance and those Government programs that insure, as well. Unfortunately, people wait until they are in acute and critical conditions before they come to a hospital under those circumstances. Then the care is more costly, and many times they sacrifice their health and their lives. In the name of balancing the budget, let us not include a provision raising the eligibility for Medicare that creates such a disadvantage and such pain and suffering for so many working families across America. This is not an idea whose time has come. This is an idea that should be shelved until our commission working on the future of Medicare can come up with sensible suggestions that really reflect the reality of the world that many seniors face today.  Mr. President, at this point, I understand that before I make my point of order I must ask that all pending amendments be laid aside. I make that request.
