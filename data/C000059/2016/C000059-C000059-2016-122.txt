The existing definition was put in place through a rulemaking initiated by the Clinton administration and finalized by the Bush administration. That rule harmonized the definition on the books of the Corps and EPA so both agencies were working within the same definition.  Any attempts to redefine this important definition could significantly negatively impact the ability of all earthmoving industries--road and highway construction and private and commercial enterprise--to obtain vital CWA section 404 permits.  Changing the definition of fill material could result in the loss of up to 375,000 high-paying mining jobs and jeopardize over 1 million jobs that are dependent upon the economic output generated by these operations.  For these reasons, I support the underlying language and oppose the amendment.  Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
