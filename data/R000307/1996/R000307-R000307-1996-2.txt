Speaker, I have asked permission to revise and extend my remarks for the last time.  Mr. Speaker, like others before me, I rise to voice my strong support for the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Act, and I also want to thank my chairman, the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], who has been an outstanding leader in this effort, the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Utah [Mr. Hansen], a distinguished gentleman and friend, and that great athlete, the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], for his help in regards to this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I am interested in this because it contains a particular park designation, the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve Act, that will create the first and only unit of the national park system solely devoted to the preservation of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem.  Mr. Speaker, like others have already stated on the floor, if the good Lord and certain Senators are willing, we will get this package through. I would urge my colleagues to contact everyone in the other body to that goal.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time for the last time.
