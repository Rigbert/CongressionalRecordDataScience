 President, section 114(d) of H.J. Res. 59, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, allows the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and levels filed on January 14, 2014, pursuant to section 111 of H.J. Res. 59, for a number of deficit-neutral reserve funds. These reserve funds were incorporated into the Bipartisan Budget Act by reference to sections of S. Con. Res. 8, the Senate-passed budget resolution for 2014. Among these sections is a reference to section 302 of S. Con. Res. 8, which, in subsection (c), establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for unemployment relief. The authority to adjust enforceable levels in the Senate for unemployment relief is contingent on that legislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through 2018 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through 2023.  I find that amendment 2874, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2014, to H.R. 3979 fulfills the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for unemployment relief, including not increasing the deficit over either of the 2013 through 2018 or 2013 through 2023 budget windows. Therefore, pursuant to section 114(d) of H.J. Res. 59, I am adjusting the budgetary aggregates, as well as the allocation to the Committee on Finance.  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the revisions be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES    [Pursuant to section 111 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and          section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974]------------------------------------------------------------------------          $s in millions               2014       2014-18      2014-23------------------------------------------------------------------------Current Budgetary Aggregates:*    Spending:        Budget Authority.........    2,928,080          n/a          n/a        Outlays..................    2,939,218          n/a          n/a    Revenue......................    2,311,031   13,699,529   31,095,846Adjustments Made Pursuant to section 114(d) of the Bipartisan Budget Act: **    Spending:        Budget Authority.........        9,875          n/a          n/a        Outlays..................        9,875          n/a          n/a    Revenue......................        1,632       15,668        8,469Revised Budgetary Aggregates:    Spending:        Budget Authority.........    2,937,955          n/a          n/a        Outlays..................    2,949,093          n/a          n/a    Revenue......................    2,312,663   13,715,197  31,104,315------------------------------------------------------------------------n/a = Not applicable.
