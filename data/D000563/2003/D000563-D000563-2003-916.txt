Do I believe there are some internal memoranda and writings generated within the Department of Justice that should not be subject to public disclosure? I certainly do. I think lines should be drawn.  In the Bork case, the lines were drawn. They said some of the documents you have requested we will produce in the spirit of cooperation; some we cannot and should not produce. And if that is the responsefrom the Department of Justice when it comes to Miguel Estrada, we may quarrel with their dividing line, but at least it would demonstrate a cooperative effort to work with the Senate Judiciary Committee.  So if they say to us they can give certain memoranda, but they draw the line on others, at least we are moving forward in the process. But at this moment in time, I say to my colleague and friend, the Department of Justice has said flat out: No, not ever; we will not produce anything.
