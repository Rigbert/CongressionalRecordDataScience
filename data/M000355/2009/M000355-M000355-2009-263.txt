 President, reserving the right to object, and I will not be objecting, I just want to make a point for all of our colleagues. The very important debate on the Supreme Court nominee will commence in a while. It is important for people not to wait until the end. We need to get people on over to make their speeches. I know there are a number of Members on the Republican side of the aisle who do intend to speak to the nomination. I encourage them to begin that sometime soon.
