Speaker, today, I am pleased to introduce the Highway Rail Grade Crossing Safety Formula Enhancement Act, which is designed to provide a more effective method of targeting available Federal funds to enhance safety at our Nation's most hazardous highway rail grade crossings. This bipartisan legislation, which is the companion bill to legislation sponsored by Senators Lugar and Coats, will provide a more effective method of targeting available Federal funds to enhance safety at our Nation's most dangerous highway rail crossings.  Specifically, this bill would improve the Federal funding formula to account for risk factors that identify which States have significant grade crossing safety problems. The factors considered in the bill include a State's share of the national total for public highway rail grade crossings, its number of crossings with passive warning devices, and its total number of accidents and fatalities caused by vehicle-train collisions at crossings.  The Rail-Highway Crossing Program, also known as section 130, currently provides States with crossing safety funds as part of a 10 percent set-aside in each State's Surface Transportation Program [STP] funds. The program's goal is to provide Federal funds for State efforts to reduce the incidence of accidents, injuries, and fatalities at public railroad crossings. The States use these funs to build underpasses and overpasses, install passive or active warning devices, and improve pavement surfaces and markings.  Several hundred people are killed, and thousands more injured, every year in the United States as a result of vehicle-train collisions at highway rail grade crossings. A significant number of these accidents occur in rail-intensive States, such as Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Kansas, and Texas. More than one quarter of the Nation's 168,000 public highway rail grade crossings are located in these five States. One third of deaths caused by vehicle-train collisions nationwide between 1993-95 occurred in these states.  With 6,587, my home State of Indiana ranks fifth in the Nation for the number of highway rail grade crossings, and Indiana is annually among the top five States nationwide in terms of accidents and fatalities caused by vehicle-train crashes. Just 2 weeks ago, a 15-year-old boy from Valparaiso, IN was struck by a train while traveling to school. Several years ago, my own mother, fortunately, survived a vehicle-train collision at a crossing where there were no warning devices. This legislation will help prevent senseless accidents like these.  Maximizing the return from Federal funds requires that they be targeted to areas with the greatest risk. In a 1995 report to Congress on the status of efforts to improve railroad crossing safety, the General Accounting Office [GAO] found anomalies among the States in terms of the funds they received in proportion to three key factors: Accidents, fatalities, and total crossings.  With the legislation I am introducing today, we have a unique opportunity to maximize existing resources, improve safety at highway rail grade crossings, and save lives. The establishment of a new funding formula is an innovative step in that direction. By targeting funds to States on the basis of risk factors, we can put scarce resources to work and use a commonsense approach by allocating Federal dollars where the need is greatest. This legislation does not call for new Federal spending, but rather a more equitable and effective distribution of existing highway funds to states to enhance safety at dangerous highway rail grade crossings.  States that would benefit under the revised formula are: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin.  Finally, I would point out that my bill addresses the grade crossing safety problems by refining a key provision of the existing Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. Using my proposal as a foundation, I will work with my colleagues to help assure that Congress passes highway reauthorization legislation that makes the best use of available Federal resources for rail crossing safety. In the 104th Congress, I introduced a similar measure, in conjunction with the entire Indiana delegation, which I testified in support of last July during Surface Transportation Subcommittee hearings regarding ISTEA policy. I believe that continued emphasis on finding new and better ways to target existing resources to enhance safety at highway rail grade crossings will contribute to the overall effort in Congress and in the States to prevent accidents and save lives.                          ____________________
