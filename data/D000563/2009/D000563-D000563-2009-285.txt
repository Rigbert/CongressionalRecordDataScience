I would say to those who call our plan a single-payer plan, what we are trying to do is to get fair treatment from private health insurance companies for consumers and families across America and to give them choices. The Senator from Vermont, I assume, is part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. So am I. Most Members of Congress belong to the program. Eight million Federal employees and Members of Congress are part of this program. It may be the best health insurance in America. And we can shop. I just got a notice in the mail that says open enrollment is coming. If you don't like the way you were treated by your health insurance plan last year, you can change. You can pick a new one. If it is a generous plan, more money will be taken out of your check. If it is not, less money will be taken out. We can shop. What we do on the insurance exchanges in this bill is say to these Americans who wouldn't otherwise have options, go shopping. Find the best health insurance plan for your family. Exercise your choice.  I would say to Senator Harry Reid, who drafted this bill, I thank him for his hard work. He includes a public option, a not-for-profit health insurance plan with lower costs that people can choose, if they care to. Giving people that choice, giving them an option to go shopping for the most affordable, best health insurance plan is what we enjoy as Members of Congress and what every American family should.
