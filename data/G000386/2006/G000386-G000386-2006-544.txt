 President, I disagree with the proposal in two important parts.  First, the proposal does not extend to 2009 several provisions that are very important to both sides, bipartisan--specifically, the section 179 expensing, which encourages the growth of small business in our country, and the college tuition deduction, which will give parents more certainty in the planning of their children's education, and the low-income savers' credit, which assists families who make less than $50,000 in saving for their retirement.
