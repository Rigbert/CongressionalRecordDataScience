 President, I wish to pay tribute to an authentic hero, Michael Garafano, who died tragically in Rutland, VT on August 28, 2011, during Tropical Storm Irene.  Michael Garafano was the water treatment and resource manager in the Rutland City Department of Public Works, a position he held since 1981. He was known by his coworkers as someone who always went above and beyond the call of duty, and his work ethic was second to none. He took his responsibilities of protecting the Rutland water supply very seriously. He was a model of a dedicated public servant.  So it was not unusual that the night of August 28, as the heavy rains from Tropical Storm Irene started assaulting Rutland, Mr. Garafano, went to check on the city reservoir one more time, looking out for his fellow citizens as he had done so often, and so well, and with such dedication, over three decades. Tragically, his life was taken by the raging storm. Compounding his tragedy is another: Michael Garafano took his son Michael Jr. to check the city reservoir when he went out that night. Michael Garafano Jr. never returned from that journey and is still missing.  Alan Shelvey, Rutland Commissioner of Public Works, said of Michael Garafano, ``He was doing what he always did--trying to make sure everything was right and the water supply was protected. We're going to miss him tremendously. He can't be replaced. People say that about people--in this case that's true.''  Michael Garafano represented what is best about Vermont and about America: he worked hard and with great dedication, he loved his work, he cared about those who lived in the community where he lived. When there was a job to be done, a responsibility to be met, he responded with generosity and directness. He was the epitome of public service, and lost his life doing the job he cared so deeply about.  Michael Garafano was devoted to his family, and he was a friend to many who knew they could count on him when they were most in need.  It is people like Michael Garafano who make our communities and our entire Nation work and prosper, who make our cities and towns into communities and not just random groups of people. The State of Vermont grieves the loss of one of its unsung heroes.  He will be sorely missed by his family, by the city of Rutland, and by the many people whose lives he touched and enriched.                          ____________________
