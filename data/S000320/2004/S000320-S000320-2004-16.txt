 President, I rise today in recognition of Mr. Henry Moody, a dedicated civil servant from Alabama, who passed on April 26, 2004.  Born on April 1, 1932, in Jemison, AL, to Henry and Mattie Moody, Henry was one of 13 children. He was raised on the Moody Farm in Jemison, attended Jemison High School and Auburn University. Upon graduating from college, he enlisted in the military and went on to receive many honors.  Following Henry's military service, he began work at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Montgomery, AL, where he dedicated 36 years of his life. He served in a number of capacities including loan examiner and appraiser and chief appraiser with the Construction and Valuation Service. In 1976, he was appointed to assistant loan guaranty officer, and in 1982, he became loan guaranty officer. Henry served this position with dedication and commitment, and was regarded as a top loan guaranty officer in the country.  There are few people in this world who dedicate so much of themselves to their work. Everyday, Henry Moody remembered the mission of his job--to provide quality housing for all veterans. Despite his numerous accomplishments, Henry retained a humble spirit. He always banked a person's character and not just their worth, and wanted every person who came into his office to leave with a good experience. He never allowed his office staff to use the excuse, ``the computers are not working.'' If that was the case, Henry would find the files himself since many families had driven for miles to see him. His favorite part of working at the VA was that every day was different, providing him with new challenges, and with new people to meet. Everyone who came in contact with him was encouraged by his smile and his helpful spirit.  Henry was recognized for his dedication and devotion to his job with many honors including induction into Home Builders Association of Alabama's, HBAA, prestigious Alabama Building Industry Hall of Fame in 1990. Additionally, former Alabama Governor Fob James proclaimed July 3, 1995, as ``Henry Moody Day.'' Both awards were a fitting tribute for Henry's commitment to providing quality housing to our country's veterans.  Henry Moody will be remembered as a pioneer who served as an example for others. He made an impact on all who had the pleasure of meeting and knowing him. He lived by two important phrases, ``This too shall pass,'' and ``God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.'' Alabama is certainly a better place for having Henry Moody as one of our own. He will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
