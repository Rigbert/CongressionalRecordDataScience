BOXER. That is correct, they have. In a letter to Representative Waxman, who has kind of uncovered this entire matter--if it was not for him, this thing might be buried somewhere in somebody's drawer--they said, we are now completing--this is the Department of the Army: We are now completing the competitive acquisition strategy and plan, preparing the statement of work, and preparing the solicitation that will request proposals to perform work. The solicitation will be advertised on the Federal Business Opportunities Web site by late spring or early summer and the estimate for the award of the contract is approximately the end of August.  So they have given a date by which they say they will be able to take the rest of this contract and bid it out.  By the way, there is nothing to say that the Halliburton subsidiary, Brown & Root, can't compete on the rest of the contract when it goes out. It ought to be open.
