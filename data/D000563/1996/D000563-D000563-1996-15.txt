Chairman, Members on both sides have strongly held feelings about this issue, but consider this simple fact situation: A Federal employee who is a woman works late, goes to her car at night, is attacked and brutally raped. She goes home to her family and learns to her dismay several weeks later that she is pregnant. She, here doctor, her husband, and her family decide that terminating that pregnancy from that rape is the right thing to do.  Because she is a Federal employee, the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Smith] would deny her hospitalization insurance coverage for that abortion service.  What the gentleman goes on to say is that virtually every other incident involved in abortion, rape, incest, he wants to make the decision. He wants to make the decision. He says this is about respect.  I say to the gentleman from New Jersey, I do not believe that he is respecting the rights of these families to make the right decisions for their families. This is a decision that should be made by Federal employees, by their families and their doctors, not by their government.
