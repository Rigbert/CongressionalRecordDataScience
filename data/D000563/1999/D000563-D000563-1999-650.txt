President, I listened to the debate on this bill, S. 96. It is an important bill. It is an important bill because it protects American business.  There are elements of this bill which I think are wise policy. I am certain that at the end of the debate, if the amendment process is a reasonable one, we will pass legislation along these lines protecting business.
