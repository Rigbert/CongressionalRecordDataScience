Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy) for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader about the schedule for the week to come.  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and at noon for legislative business.  On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. No votes are expected in the House on Friday.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today.  Mr. Speaker, since next Monday is Tax Day, the House will also consider four commonsense bills aimed at protecting all taxpayers.  First will be H.R. 1206, the No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act, sponsored by Representative David Rouzer, and will ensure that IRS employees--the very people who are responsible for collecting taxes from every American--pay their own taxes.  H.R. 4885, the IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending Act, sponsored by Representative Jason Smith, will require fees collected by the IRS to be subject to congressional appropriations so that there is proper oversight into how the taxpayer money is spent.  H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act, sponsored by Representative Kristi Noem, will prohibit the IRS from rehiring someone who has been fired for cause.                              {time}  1130  Finally, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4890, the IRS Bonuses Tied to Measurable Metrics Act, sponsored by Representative Pat Meehan, will ban IRS bonuses until they can demonstrate improved customer service. It just doesn't get any more common sense than that.
