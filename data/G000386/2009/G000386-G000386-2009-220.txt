S. Trade Representative.  Demetrios is well known to all of us on the Finance Committee. For 4 years, he has very ably served Chairman Baucus--most recently as the Democratic chief international trade counsel. So he has played a central role in all of the committee's efforts on trade policy during this time.  Not only is Demetrios a very sharp trade lawyer and policy adviser, he is also a skilled negotiator. That will serve him well in his new position. I am grateful for the genuine spirit of bipartisanship that Demetrios brought to the Finance Committee, and I am sorry to see him depart. His energy and good nature will certainly be missed.  At the same time, I am comforted by the fact that our Nation will continue to benefit from Demetrios' commitment to public service. He assumes a very important portfolio at the Office of the United States Trade Representative, as a trade Ambassador to Asia and Africa, and also with responsibility for the trade and development portfolio, as well as for labor and the environment.  I therefore look forward to engaging Demetrios in efforts to open up new market opportunities for U.S. exporters in the Asian region. I also look forward to working with him on a reform of our unilateral trade preference programs. We must address these key trade priorities in the 111th Congress, so I expect that we'll continue to see Demetrios on a regular basis for some time to come.  In closing, I commend Demetrios for his outstanding service to the Finance Committee, and I wish Ambassador Marantis every success in his new position.                          ____________________
