Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, as the prime sponsor of the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 2000 and 2001, H.R. 3427, signed by President Clinton on November 29, 1999, I rise in very strong support of this legislation, S. 248, legislation that alters that Act and provides additional flexibility in pursuing our goals of reforming the operations of the United Nations while strengthening our efforts to build a coalition against this terrorist threat that we all face.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3427, which authorized appropriations for the Department of State, contained dozens of reforms for our State Department, refugee protection, freedom broadcasting and a host of other things. As a matter of fact, the embassy security portion of it provided $5.9 billion over 5 years to try to beef up our efforts and to mitigate the threats against terrorists abroad. It also contained what is commonly referred to as the Helms-Biden provisions, Title IX, which contained specific reforms for the U.N. in exchange for payment of U.S. arrearages.  In the first year, the new law required that before arrearages were to be made, the Secretary of State had to make a number of certifications concerning U.S. sovereignty. That satisfied, the arrears payments were released. In the second year, which is the focus of this legislation we are considering today, the Secretary of State is required to make certifications requiring reductions in assessments as mandated by law. Specifically, our legislation required that the assessment of the U.N.'s regular budget be lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent, and the U.S. share of any peacekeeping operations be reduced to no greater than 25 percent of the total cost.  In December of last year, as my colleagues, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) have pointed out, following negotiations with the U.S. Representative to the U.N., the General Assembly agreed to lower the assessment for the regular budget to 22 percent, as required.  In addition, an agreement was reached to lower the peacekeeping share borne by the U.S., although at a more gradual pace than envisioned. Under the negotiated agreement, the U.S. share would drop from approximately 31 percent to 28.15 percent beginning in January of 2001. Subsequently, the rate would drop from 27.5 percent on July 1, then to 26.5 in 2002, and further reductions are anticipated, until we get down to the 25 percent within a 6-year time period.  Mr. Speaker, while this reduction is not as great as we had called for in the legislation, it does represent a significant reform of the United Nations, and will save American taxpayers about $2 billion over the next 10 years.                              {time}  1500  Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, by accepting this negotiated settlement, we provide a clear signal to the world community that the United States is serious about acting together with other nations of the world.  Mr. Speaker, S. 248 will amend our law to fall in line with the negotiated reductions. I think it is a good bill and it deserves, I believe, the unanimous backing, especially during this time of crisis, of every Member of this Chamber.
