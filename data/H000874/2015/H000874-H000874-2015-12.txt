 In any event, Mr. Speaker, the Members, as the majority leader has indicated, will not be having votes until, at the earliest, 6:30 on Tuesday.  I believe that the balance of the week--or such time as may be necessary in order to complete the work of this session of the Congress--will dictate the length of time that we go on the schedule. Is that accurate?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. McCARTHY. Yes. It is my intention that we will stay until we get our work done, but when we get our work done, we will depart for the holiday season.
