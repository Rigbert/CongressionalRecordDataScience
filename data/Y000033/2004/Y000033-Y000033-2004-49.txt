Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Chairman, this bill reinstates the discretionary spending caps for fiscal year 2005 and 2006 and extends the highway and transit firewalls for fiscal years 2004 through 2009 at the levels contained in H.R. 3550, as passed by the House earlier this year.
