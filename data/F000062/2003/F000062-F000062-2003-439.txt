 President, I would like to make a couple of points on this amendment. I ask the distinguished Senator two questions. The first is, is he aware that Germany has allowed over 60,000 U.S. troops to pass through U.S. Air Force bases in Germany--all troops bound for Iraq? Is he aware that the Germans have helped in many ways?  Second, is he aware that there are already contracts out from our Department of Defense with firms that would be nullified under this bill? Also, I would like to ask the question, if he does know, to what extent would those contracts be nullified by this legislation?
