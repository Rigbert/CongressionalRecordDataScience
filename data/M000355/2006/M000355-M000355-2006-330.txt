 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider Calendar Nos. 751 and 811. I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.
