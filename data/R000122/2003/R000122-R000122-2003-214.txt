President, again, I am also operating on some knowledge, but not complete knowledge, of why this provision is in the managers' amendment. I am prepared to accept the underlying agreement; I just have this one question which I find, at this point, important with respect to this Compassionate Capital Fund.  But as far as your assertions, which I appreciate, and the underlying legislation, I have no problem with this consent; it is just that one point about the managers' amendment.  I don't know what you would like to do to try to resolve that, though.
