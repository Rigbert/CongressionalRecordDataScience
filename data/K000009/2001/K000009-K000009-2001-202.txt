Speaker, 11 years ago, the 101st Congress marked the bicentenary of this institution by compiling and printing a volume entitled Women in Congress, 1917 to 1990, a compendium of photographs and brief biographies of the 129 women who had served in the House and Senate as of that time.  The senior congresswoman in the House then, Congresswoman Lindy Boggs of Louisiana, who was later appointed as the United States of America's first woman ambassador to the Vatican, took responsibility for the printing of that document.                              {time}  1215  Since then, another 79 women have served. Thus, a new addition of ``Women in Congress'' would gather in one updated volume useful information for teachers, students and others about the 208 women who have served to date through all of America's history, including the 61 who now serve here in the House and the 13 serving in the other body. Currently we have 74 women serving in both the House and Senate, and 461 men.  Mr. Speaker, as we enter the 21st century, the time has come to update and reprint ``Women in Congress.'' With it America marks the progress and substantial contribution that women are making in this most democratic legislative body on Earth.  I am confident that a revised volume will quickly become, like the previous edition, a tremendous historical resource and serve to inspire readers across America to seek careers in public service. I hope my colleagues in the House support this resolution. It is important especially that we do this and introduce this resolution during Women's History Month; and thus the concurrent resolution that I have introduced would provide for the reprinting of that revised edition of the House document.  It is a particular privilege to announce this resolution in that it is cosponsored by every single woman serving in the House, as well as every single Member of the Committee on House Administration. I thank each and every one of them for their support and especially the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who has been a force inside this institution for an equal voice for women.  During the first 128 years of America's history, no woman served in either House of the Congress. That is nearly a century and a quarter. Finally, in the early years of the 20th century, decades of struggle for women's political and social equality began to bear fruit. In 1917, Jeanette Rankin of Montana became the first woman to serve in this House of Representatives; and then 5 years later, Rebecca Felton of Georgia became the first women Senator. So our history, the written word and the spoken word, of women in political environments is still very, very fresh.  Since Representative Rankin and Senator Felton broke the congressionalgender barrier, dozens of women have followed in their footsteps.  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to sponsor the resolution that I have dropped today to reprint and update the edition of ``Women in Congress, 1917-1990,'' to make it current for this new 21st century when all opportunities are available to young women across our country; and, indeed, America is an ideal for so much of the world to follow.                          ____________________
