Speaker, I rise today to recognize efforts in Northwest Ohio to celebrate the beginning of National Volunteer Week in America. It is very hard to imagine our country without its corps of ready, willing and able volunteers. So strong and proud is America's history of volunteerism, that the concept and nature of ``American Volunteerism'' has become an institution by which the world recognizes and understands our national identity of compassion and caring for our fellow humankind.  Has there ever been a time in our history that there were not volunteers ready to lend a hand? Beginning with Paul Revere and extending right through to the response of emergency and medical personnel to last week's tragedy in Oklahoma--Americans have always been ready to help their fellow citizens.  While volunteerism in America does not always manifest itself in terms as dramatic as when every available doctor and nurse within a 100-mile radius and beyond rushes to the scene of a tragedy, it is no more important or devoted than the millions of Americans who respond daily and regularly to the unsatisfied needs of their communities.  Here in our community, volunteers feed the hungry, shelter and minister to the homeless, reach out and touch minds that are eager to learn and spirits that yearn to fly. Even in the lives of those whose needs are not borne from necessity, but whose pursuits are dedicated toward service and improvement, volunteers make the day.  I know my colleagues join me in recognizing National Volunteer Week and in saying to every citizen in our community and country who works for a recompense that no amount of money can satisfy, thank you for answering the call, thank you for helping make our country a better place.                          ____________________
