 President, with this amendment we are making very certain that farmers are a high priority with this bill and with this body.  This amendment is a major package of tax benefits for farmers: No. 1, the farmers savings account; No. 2, fixing a number of misguided IRS decisions that are very detrimental to farming and not within the intent of Congress; No. 3, repealing the draconian installment sales provision which is a No. 1 provision that small business seeks; No. 4, to increase bonding for beginning farmers.  I thank Senators Roth, Roberts, Brownback, Lugar, and Grams for their contributions. I urge its adoption.
