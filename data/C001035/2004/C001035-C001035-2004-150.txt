They have raised an important issue. It is, as they have recognized, a difficult and controversial issue, and I am very grateful to both of them for being willing to raise the issue but not press forward with their amendment at this time. I look forward to continuing to work with both of them. Both of them are leaders in military and intelligence matters, and I very much respect their judgment and their knowledge.
