Mr. Speaker, I really want to thank the gentleman for being patient. I understand that our Financial Services Committee Democrats stand ready to work on a bipartisan basis on this, and they have asked for a markup as soon as possible. Since time is running out, I would like to ask my colleague why we could not simply take up H.R. 1153, a bill that is a largely bipartisan product that the Financial Services Committee reported last fall, but never acted upon.
