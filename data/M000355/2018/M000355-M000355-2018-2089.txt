 Mr. Foley was killed last Wednesday when his truck collided with an Amtrak train carrying many of my fellow lawmakers to a conference in West Virginia. He was just 28 years old. He leaves behind his fiancee Adriana and Rylan, their 1-year-old son.  Our thoughts are with them especially, along with Christopher's family, his community, and his colleagues at Time Disposal. They and all those who were injured in the accident are in our prayers.  Our heartfelt thanks are with the first responders who rushed to the scene. It is too easy to take for grantedthat our brave law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency personnel will be there for us on our worst days, forgetting that, for them, heroism and service are everyday realities. I would like to recognize some of our own colleagues who immediately sprang into action to assist the wounded. Senator Cassidy and Congressmen Wenstrup, Burgess, Roe, and Bucshon are all doctors by training, as are Senator Cassidy's wife Laura and Congressman Bucshon's wife Kathryn. All of them sprang into action and rushed to aid the victims, alongside our attending physician, Dr. Brian Monahan. Senator Flake and several others also hurried to help.  I thank all of them for their efforts when every moment counted, and I am proud to call them colleagues and friends.                          ____________________
