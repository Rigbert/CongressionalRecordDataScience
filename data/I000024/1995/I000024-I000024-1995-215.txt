President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ray Stowers, D.O., a constituent of mine. Dr. Stowers, a native Oklahoman, is an osteopathic, family practice physician from Medford, OK, who is a true example of the pioneer spirit in America.  In the pioneer spirit, Ray's contributions have resulted in so many ``firsts'' in his life, both for the State of Oklahoma, for the osteopathic medical profession, and for the patients that he has reached into the rural communities to help.  It is because of his most recent ``first'', that I rise today to congratulate Ray on his recent appointment to the Physician Payment Review Commission [PPRC]. Ray Stowers represents what is best about medicine and physicians in America today. During a time when the trend to become a specializing physician is so strong and promises such great rewards, Ray Stowers has remained dedicated to the path of providing solo, rural, family medicine for 21 years. Yet from this path, Ray has been able to pioneer programs that enhance the numbers of physicians who share this important commitment.  One of Ray's many successes occurred when the Governor of Oklahoma appointed him to serve on the board of the Task Force and Rural Planning Committee which was responsible for advising the Governor on the State's health care manpower needs, and for convening a statewide conference to discuss rural health care delivery issues.  As well, Ray had the vision to see Oklahoma's need for rural health clinics, ensuring care for Oklahoma's hardest to reach populations. While he saw the need for, and began, the first rural health clinics in this State, within 5 years that number had burgeoned into 38 rural health clinics. Now, Oklahoma's hard-to-reach and underserved communities are assured access to a doctor and good medical care.  In addition to his many appointments, since 1993, Dr. Stowers also has been a presence on the American Medical Association Relative Value Update Committee [RUC]. As the first osteopathic physician appointed to serve on this prestigious committee, Ray has facilitated greater understanding, collaboration, and teamwork between the osteopathic medical profession and the allopathic physician community, and has lent his considerable expertise on physician practices to the RUC proceedings.  Dr. Stowers has served his family, his profession, his community, and his State with strength and integrity that symbolizes a modern pioneer. Dr. Stowers, the great State of Oklahoma is proud of your accomplishments. And [[Page S6033]] I am honored to join your family and friends and colleagues in wishing you every success as you embark on your next journey; serving on the Physician Payment Review Commission.                          ____________________
