 President, I rise tonight to give to the Senate the status on the confirmation process in the Intelligence Committee of Anthony Lake, who has been nominated by President Clinton to be the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  As I have said on many occasions, I intend to treat the confirmation of Anthony Lake, President Clinton's nominee to be Director of Central Intelligence in a serious, thorough and fair manner.  The Central Intelligence Agency and the intelligence community deserve a strong and independent leader to carry them into the 21st century. I believe that everyone in the Senate recognizes that.  This leader must be able to guide the fine men and women that serve our country and keep watch on our adversaries, sometimes under the most trying and dangerous of circumstances.  And, this leader must be deserving of the confidence of the President, the Congress, and the American people.  This is a controversial nomination, we have known this from the beginning. And it is essential that we address all of the issues associated with Mr. Lake's fitness to lead the intelligence community, and his ability to make the transition from White House insider to apolitical provider of intelligence information.  I'd like to comment on the six areas in which the committee has considerable work to complete as we proceed with Mr. Lake's confirmation hearings which will begin on Tuesday. We want to get the process moving, but it is important that we have the fullest cooperation from the White House.  These six areas are, among others: First, investigation of the role the National Security Council, under Mr. Lake's leadership, had in questionable DNC fund-raising practices, as well as any knowledge Mr. Lake may have had, if any.  Second, Mr. Lake's use and interpretation of intelligence provided to him as National Security Advisor, including how he helped translate this intelligence into administration policy.  Third, the Justice Department's settlement of Mr. Lake's ethics violations and the potential irregularities in this settlement.  Fourth, the way in which Mr. Lake handled the ``no instructions'' policy toward Iranian arms shipments through Croatia to Bosnia.  Fifth, review of Mr. Lake's FBI background investigation.  Sixth, review of written answers Mr. Lake provided to the committee's questions for the record, many of which require further explanation than was provided.                   NSC Interactions with DNC Contacts  We will continue our investigation into the role of the NSC staff, under Mr. Lake's direction, in the expanding controversy over foreign campaign contributions.  At issue is the extent to which Mr. Lake knew of the ties the White House was building with questionable fund-raisers and foreign contributors and what effect this might have had on administration foreign policy.  It is apparent that his staff had knowledge of the involvement, and although on many occasions advised against it for either political or foreign policy reasons, never seemed to raise the flag of illegality.  And if Mr. Lake was fully informed, did he participate in decisions to continue this involvement or were any admonitions he might have given regarding the nature of these meetings completely ignored?  This question goes to the heart of Mr. Lake's ability to be an effective Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  The committee must consider this issue in great detail and determine if Mr. Lake could become embroiled in a potential independent counsel investigation into these matters, as we read in the press.  The intelligence community deserves a leader that will not be distracted by such an investigation, if it occurs.  The information supplied by Mr. Lake could be the tip of an iceberg, and more inquiry is required. For example, Mr. Lake does not appear to shed any light as to why his staff met with Pauline Kanchanalak, the Thai businesswoman and lobbyist whose contributions to the DNC were eventually returned.  New allegations about Ms. Kanchanalak appear in the press every day all over America, and perhaps the world.  For example, last Tuesday, the New York Times reported, and I quote: ``One Justice Department official said subpoenas also were served on the United States-Thai Business Council, a trade-promotion group formed in part by Pauline Kanchanalak, a lobbyist who helped raise $250,000 in political donations that have since been returned by the Democratic National Committee.''  The article goes on to say: ``Government officials said the Justice Department two weeks ago subpoenaed records from the Export-Import Bank concerning Ms. Kanchanalak's efforts to help Thai investors * * *''  I ask for unanimous consent that this and other articles about Ms. Kanchanalak be entered into the Record at this point in their entirety.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 1997]                 Inquiry Into Gifts to Democrats Widens                         (By Christopher Drew)       The Justice Department today subpoenaed the records of      Johnny Chung, a California businessman who gave $391,000 to      the Democratic Party, and others who made large donations      while seeking access to the White House, Government officials      said.       One Justice Department official said subpoenas also were      served on the United States-Thai Business Council, a trade-     promotion group formed in part by Pauline Kanchanalak, a      lobbyist who helped raise $250,000 in political donations      that have since been returned by the Democratic National      Committee.       The subpoenas show that a Justice Department task force is      continuing to widen its investigation into alleged      improprieties in the Democrats' drive to raise huge sums for      last year's elections.       The committee also is reviewing the donations made by Mr.      Chung and others. It has already returned nearly $1.5 million      in questionable donations. And one Democrat familiar with      that review said today that the party is likely to return an      additional $1 million, either because it could not verify the      sources of the money or because the donations seemed      improper.       Mr. Chung and Ms. Kanchanalak have declined to speak to      reporters, and their lawyers could not be reached for comment      last night.       Mr. Chung, an engineer who was born in Taiwan and is now an      American citizen, has captured attention for his intense      efforts to exploit his donations for commercial gains. Since      mid-1994, he has visited the White House at least 50 times,      sometimes bringing business associates from China and other      Far East places that he wanted to impress.       Mr. Chung took two Chinese beer executives to a White House      Christmas party in 1994, where they were photographed with      President and Mrs. Clinton. The beer company later placed the      photo in a glass display case promoting its product in one of      Beijing's main shopping districts.       It could not be learned exactly what records were sought in      the subpoenas issued today. But Justice Department officials      have said they were examining whether any foreign money might      have been improperly funneled into Democratic Party coffers.       Mr. Chung's lawyer, Brian A. Sun, told The New York Times      last week that his client, who runs a fax-services business      in Torrance, Calif., had received more than $3 million from      investors over the last three years. Mr. Sun estimated that      nearly $1.5 million of that total had come from foreigners as      Mr. Chung expanded into consulting for foreign businessmen      who wanted to make deals in the United States.       Mr. Sun said that Mr. Chung had done nothing wrong, and      that Mr. Chung's foreign partners were not involved in his      decisions to make the contributions. But it also is likely      that the Justice Department investigators would want to trace      the flow of money into Mr. Chung's accounts.       California records show that Mr. Chung incorporated seven      companies with investors from China and Hong Kong over the      last two years, and Federal election records show that      several of his largest political donations were made at about      the same time as the incorporations.       Mr. Chung also donated $50,000 to the Democratic Party in      March 1995, shortly after he took high-level Chinese      businessmen to watch Mr. Clinton give a radio address. Aides      to Donald L. Fowler, then the national chairman of the      Democratic Party, have said they arranged that White House      visit at Mr. Chung's request. Mr. Fowler has said he was not      personally involved and did not solicit a donation from Mr.      Chung in return for the favor.       Ms. Kanchanalak, a Thai citizen who lives in Virginia, got      help from John Huang, the former Democratic fund-raiser who      is at the center of the Federal inquiry, in setting up the      United States Thai-Business Council.       Government officials said the Justice Department two weeks      ago subpoenaed records from the Export-Import Bank concerning      Ms. Kanchanalak's efforts to help Thai investors win      financing to build 105 Blockbuster video stores in Thailand.      Ms. Kanchanalak has denied doing anything wrong.                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 27, 1997]                   FBI Inquiry on Funding Is Widening                (By David Rogers and Edward Felsenthal)       Washington.--A Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into      foreign influence in Democratic fund raising could lead      Director Louis Freeh to ask Attorney General Janet Reno to      seek appointment of an independent counsel for the case.       Mr. Freeh briefed senior senators yesterday on the      investigation, and officials later described the continuing      FBI investigation as larger than previously reported and      carried on outside the purview of the White House.       Serious evidence has been found of China's potential      involvement in steering money to Democrats. That involvement      appears to have been driven largely by business interests      seeking influence and following the model of rival Taiwanese.       Pauline Kanchanalak, a major Democratic fundraiser who has      represented Thai companies with large investments in China,      has emerged as a key figure in the probe, officials said.      While refusing to comment on details of the briefing, senate      Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said the      evidence of foreign influence was ``deep and disturbing.''       ``We need an independent counsel if we ever needed an      independent counsel,'' the Alabama Republican said.       The Justice Department last night painted a less dire      picture of Mr. Freeh's briefing, and Attorney General Reno      continued to say that career prosecutors in the department      can handle the fund investigation. Neither Sen. Shelby nor      other officials familiar with the briefing were prepared to      say what Mr. Freeh's final recommendations would be. But      lawmakers of both parties said the investigation is regarded      very seriously by the director, who has committed substantial      resources to it.       FBI spokesman John Collingwood last night would say only      that it is ``a matter that is entirely within the purview of      the attorney general.''       Ms. Kanchanalak's role is important both because of her      foreign clients and past access to National Security Council      staff at the White House. As such, her prominence could pose      additional problems for former NSC adviser Anthony Lake,      whose nomination to direct the Central Intelligence Agency      already faces opposition in the Senate. Ms. Kanchanalak      couldn't be reached for comment.       Critics of the Clinton administration have recently stepped      up their demands for an independent counsel, particularly      with the disclosure this week that the president himself      played a role in encouraging the use of the White House as a      fundraising vehicle. Federal law requires the attorney      general to ask the federal appeals court here to appoint an      independent counsel when there are ``credible'' and      ``specific'' allegations of criminal wrongdoing against an      official. The law explicitly applies to the president,      cabinet members and some campaign officials; the attorney      general has the discretion to apply it to others as well.       Some say that threshold has clearly been crossed. ``I      thought [Ms. Reno] had gotten past the point where she didn't      have much choice under the statute some time ago,'' said      Theodore Olson, a Washington lawyer who was assistant      attorney general during the Reagan administration. Several      lawmakers--including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of      Mississippi, GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic      Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York--have called for an      independent counsel.       Ms. Reno said yesterday in a hearing before a House      committee that she still hasn't seen enough evidence to      justify such an appointment. She added that she is still open      to the idea if sufficient evidence emerges ``as we proceed      with the very comprehensive investigation that we now have      under way.'' Ms. Reno has appointed a task force of career      prosecutors to monitor the matter and to alert her if they      conclude an independent counsel is necessary.       Lawyers agree that the independent-counsel law is fairly      straightforward, requiring only a barebones determination by      the attorney general of whether further investigation is      necessary. But the question of what makes up a ``credible''      allegation is obviously a judgment call. In addition, given      the complexities of the campaign-finance laws, it isn't      always clear what constitutes a violation.       Some lawyers believe that the attorney general should err      on the side of naming an independent counsel and leave it to      the appointee to decipher the law.       But Justice Department officials maintain that Ms. Reno has      very little discretion. People think that ``whenever there's      a mess, there's [supposed to be] an independent counsel,''      said a spokesman for Ms. Reno. ``Congress could have written      the law that way, but they didn't.''       At a news conference yesterday, President Clinton      reiterated his position that the decision was up to Ms. Reno.      ``It's a legal decision the attorney general has to make,''      he said. ``I'm not going to comment.''
