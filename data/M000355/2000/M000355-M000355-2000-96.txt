 President, we received a request April 21 to allow fiscal year 2001 outlays--not budget authority--to be disbursed early into a Federal Reserve account. We have never structured accounts around outlays before, so we are looking at the scoring implications as well as what this will provide to Egypt in security assistance.  I am not prepared to write a blank check to any government. It is possible that this request could generate an additional $35 to $40 million for the Egyptians to spend on military equipment.  I would like to know what they plan to spend these resources on and no one can tell me. I think we need to be better informed before signing off on this approach.  Another problem with the proposal concerns actual control of the resources. The reason there are no scoring consideration is the entire amount is deemed obligated to Egypt once the funds are transferred into this account. That means the Egyptians could default or cancel a contract with an American company and we would have very little recourse because the money is already in their account. We must be sure that we will continue to have transparency and ongoing U.S. management of these resources, both the funds put into the account and the interest generated by the account.  Let me add, separate and apart form concerns about the actual account structure, I am not sure we should be increasing U.S. security assistance to Egypt. A short while ago, President Mubarak paid a visit to Lebanon and issued a statement of support forHezbollah's terrorist war against Israel. At this delicate juncture with rising concern about cross border violence against Israel, Mr. Mubarek's comments were and are extremely damaging to peace and stability, to say nothing of safety of Israeli civilians. I am not sure what signal it sends to increase military aid after such unfortunate remarks. After all, the aid is provided in recognition of Egypt's service to the peace process established at Camp David--the President's comments undermined those very principles and prospects.  In the State Department briefing justifying the request, U.S. officials urged our support because of Mubarek's need to address the requirements of ``his key constituents, the military.'' Frankly, I think Mr. Mubarek needs to worry less about satisfying the military and spend more time and effort shoring up democratic institutions and civic society.  Once again this year he demonstrated a heavy handed political style be extending for three more years the State of Emergency which grants him far reaching powers. He has granted and maintained this sweeping authority for nineteen years. Press censorship and restrictions on political parties and activities are among many authoritarian measures which are routinely enforced in Egypt--not characteristics of the most open democracy.  In spite of my concerns about the trends in Egypt, I am prepared to consider this request fully and carefully in consultation with the chairman and others who I know are interested and expect we will have a recommendation by the time we get to conference.                           amendment no. 3528
