 Speaker, the gentleman said, well, why should we not repeal the estate tax. Let me tell him why. There are millions of Americans in this country, senior citizens, who suffer and die because they cannot afford prescription drugs. And this country does not have a strong program to say to the sick that they can get the prescription drugs they need without taking money out of their food budget.  What the gentleman is doing today is giving the wealthiest 2 percent of the population, billionaires, a huge tax break. And then my colleagues will come before the American people and say, gee, we do not have the money to protect the sick and the old.  In my district there are middle-class families who are going deeply into debt so that they can send their kids to college, and some of these kids graduate college $50,000 in debt. And what my colleagues are saying today is, hey, Bill Gates and his friends, who contribute huge amounts of money to the political process, to the Republican Party, they need a tax break. I say that is immoral.  There are families in this country who work 40 hours a week and they sleep in their cars because we have not put money into affordable housing. Yet my colleagues say, hey, I have millionaire friends who have gone to a $25,000 a plate fund raiser, we have to give them a tax break. And my colleagues say, we do not have money for affordable housing, we do not have money for education. There are 44 million people in this country who have no health insurance, but my colleagues say we cannot afford that because they are too busy giving tax breaks to the richest people in this country.  I have heard my Republican friends use the word immoral and unjust to describe the estate tax. I will tell them what is immoral and unjust. It is immoral and unjust that we give tax breaks to those people who do not need it while we ignore the suffering of millions and millions of people who need help today. That is why.
