Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago today, Secretary of State Christopher unveiled the Clinton administration's Bosnia policy while lamenting the fact that the West had repeatedly missed earlier opportunities to effectively address the conflict and prevent it from deepening.  During his presentation, Christopher outlined United States interests and strategic concerns at stake in Bosnia. ``Our conscience revolts at the idea of passively accepting such brutality,'' he said, and ``it tests our commitment to the nurturing of democracy * * *'' Recognizing the implications of the Bosnian crisis he warned, ``The world's response to the violence in the former Yugoslavia is an early and crucial test of how it will address the concerns of ethnic and religious minorities in the post-cold war world.''  One year ago, in the aftermath of the marketplace massacre in Sarajevo, President Clinton echoed this view when he said, ``This century teaches us that America cannot afford to ignore conflicts in Europe. And in this case, our Nation has distinct interests.'' He concluded, ``While the cold war may be over, the world is still full of dangers and the world still looks to America for leadership.''  President Clinton had it right when he vowed in his inaugural address that, ``When our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act, with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary.''  Mr. Speaker, our interests have been challenged.  The will and conscience of the international community have been defied.  Peaceful diplomacy has failed.  And the world still looks to America for leadership * * *.                            ____________________
