Obviously we share the view that this is an important bill. We understand that the act has some time before reauthorization needs to be done, but in light of the fact that it came out of committee with very bipartisan support, and Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. Watt, and others workedvery hard on this bill, we are hopeful it can move as soon as possible so the Senate can itself consider it.  The next bill that we had thought was going to be on the calendar last week, the Labor-Health bill, is not listed for this coming week. I have noted some of your comments in the papers, but obviously this bill, as you know, includes an increase in the minimum wage, which was voted out of committee on a bipartisan vote, and we believe that if it is brought to the floor, it will be approved on a bipartisan vote.  But can the gentleman tell me what the expectations are for the Labor-Health bill?  I yield to my friend.
