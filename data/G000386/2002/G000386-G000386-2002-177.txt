 President, on the eve of President Bush's European visit, it is appropriate to point out how attitudes have changed regarding the President's actions with respect to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. A little more than a year ago there was widespread concern over President Bush's decision to withdraw the United States from the ABM treaty. Recently there has been a general change of mind. It appears that many of Bush's biggest critics incorrectly guessed Russian President Vladimir Putin's reaction. Instead of renewing cold war tensions by increasing nuclear arsenals, the United States and Russia have continued to strengthen their friendship.  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of an article in today's Washington Post that underscores President Bush's foresight in dealing with Russia and the ABM treaty.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     Criticism Softens on ABM Move                           (By Dana Milbank)       A year ago, on President Bush's first presidential trip to      Europe, allies in Western Europe and congressional Cassandras      worried about the administration's plan to abrogate the 1972      Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia.       They argued that Bush's plans for a missile defense system,      at the same time NATO was expanding to Russia's border, would      throw the world into a nuclear arms race. ``We need to      preserve these strategic balances, of which the ABM Treaty is      a pillar,'' said French President Jacques Chirac. German      Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder joined Chirac in issuing a joint      statement defending the ABM.       As Bush arrives tonight in Berlin for a seven-day overseas      trip, European leaders still oppose the White House's policy      on issues ranging from Iraq to global warming. But many      concede Bush may have been right about Russia and the ABM.       The United States pulled out of the ABM Treaty, and NATO      expansion in the Baltic nations is on track. Instead of an      arms race and hostility resulting, Bush and Russian President      Vladimir Putin became fast friends. They agreed on an accord      reducing nuclear weapons and are pursuing new ways to      cooperate in commerce, intelligence and defense.       ``We were worried a year ago that Bush's position would      create a terrible confrontation,'' a senior German diplomat      said. ``Maybe we underestimated Putin's creativeness and      farsightedness.''       Bush loyalists say the administration had a clearer view      than Western Europeans did on Russia. Bush, like Putin,      understood the conflict had shifted from one of East against      West to a new struggle of wealthy democracies against      dictatorial regimes and stateless terrorists. Bush also      perceived that Putin wished to be on the side of the wealthy      democracies.       ``It has been a pattern for 50 years that people yell      Chicken Little any time we ask the Russians to do anything,''      said Kenneth Adelman, who ran the Arms Control and      Disarmament Agency in the Reagan administration. ``It's all      been wrong and predictably wrong.''       In the new, ``asymmetrical'' warfare against rogue states,      the Russians are allies, Adelman said. ``They'll be with us      on these issues probably more than France, and they'll be      more important. They fear Islamic radicalism, they fear      weapons of mass destruction, and they need Western investment      and Western ways and means.''       Officially, the Bush administration is not gloating. But      Bush aides did compile a list of Chicken Little remarks made      by politicians and commentators last year. Its title:      ``Quotes of Criticism on ABM Withdraw and National Missile      Defense.''       The list, mostly Democrats, includes Clinton national      security adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger saying Bush had      put the nation on a ``collision course'' with Russia and NATO      allies.       Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) declared:      ``I believe it would be a grave mistake for the United States      to unilaterally abrogate the ABM treaty in order to deploy a      robust national defense system. Unilateral actions will      trigger reactions all around the world. Those reactions      themselves could make our nation less secure.''       House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) vowed to      block any missile defense system that violated the ABM      Treaty. ``Europeans are worried,'' Gephardt said, saying the      administration may ``prevent us from seizing a historic      opportunity for engagement with Russia.''       And former president Jimmy Carter said Bush's missile      defense plan, which required abrogating the ABM Treaty, was      ``technologically ridiculous'' and would ``re-escalate the      nuclear arms race.''       One Republican made the compilation. Sen. John W. Warner      (Va.) said Bush should leave ``some vestiges of the ABM      Treaty in place'' to assure allies.       Included in the collection of quotes was a press release      quoting Washington arms control expert Daryl G. Kimball      predicting Bush's missile defense idea and ABM position would      ``set off a dangerous action/reaction cycle, involving the      United States, Russia, and China.''       Gephardt spokesman Erik Smith, asked about his boss's old      remarks, acknowledged that ``the White House has made      progress'' with Russia. But he said Bush has yet to make      progress with Russia on nuclear proliferation, Iraq and      dismantling nuclear weapons. ``There were several other      points . . . that have not been addressed,'' Smith said.       Kimball was unrepentant about his earlier words. ``I stand      behind the quote,'' he said. ``The potential for a dangerous      action/reaction cycle remains, especially because the Bush      administration has failed to lock in verifiable reductions of      Russia's nuclear forces.''       Bush aids dismiss such concerns.       ``What keeps Russia and the United States from going to war      today is not the number of nuclear weapons that they have on      either side or the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty or some      outdated notion of strategic stability,'' national security      adviser Condoleezza Rice said. ``It's that they have nothing      to go to war about.''
