 Speaker, I am introducing a bill that would name the United States Post Office in Fair Haven, Vermont, in honor of Matthew Lyon, one of our nation's early defenders of the First Amendment, a former member of the Vermont House of Representatives, and Vermont's fourth Representative to the United States Congress. Matthew Lyon is also recognized as the founder of Fair Haven, Vermont.  Matthew Lyon plays an important role in the history of our country. He was the first person to be tried and convicted under the repressive 1798 Sedition Act. The Sedition Act was sweeping legislation passed during a period when America was engaged in hostilities with France. The purpose of the legislation was to punish Americans who opposed President John Adams' foreign policy toward France. This legislation was unquestionably a direct attack on rights explicitly protected by the First Amendment of the U.S Constitution.  Matthew Lyon's only crime was writing a letter to the editor critical of President Adams' foreign policy towards France and submitting another person's similar writings to a local newspaper that published them. Solely for expressing his views and exercising his First Amendment rights, Matthew Lyon was sentenced to four months in jail, required to pay the cost of his prosecution, and fined $1,000. He was, however, subsequently pardoned by President Thomas Jefferson.  At a time when we find ourselves struggling to balance the security of our nation with the liberties we cherish, I can think of no better time to honor one of our nation's champions of the First Amendment's right of free speech. Naming the Fair Haven Post Office in honor of Matthew Lyon would be a fitting tribute to him and his fight for liberty, and would serve as a reminder of Fair Haven's connection to this great American patriot. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the House Government Reform Committee to move this bill through committee and onto the House Floor.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E658]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]          INTRODUCTION OF MATTHEW LYON POST OFFICE NAMING BILL                                 ______                                                           HON.
