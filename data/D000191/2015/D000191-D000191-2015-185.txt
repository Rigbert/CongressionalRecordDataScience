Speaker, this week, September 13-19, is designated National Truck Driver Appreciation Week and is set aside to honor the 3.4 million professional truck drivers in the United States. Trucking employs more than 7 million people, making it not just essential to our economy, but one of our country's largest sources of employment as well.  Citizens in every community around the nation rely on trucks--for the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the products we use. As Ranking Member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I know first-hand how important truckers are to the strength and well-being of our great nation.  But trucks don't move without highly skilled drivers. I have long fought to ensure the safety of American roads and to preserve American trucking jobs. I have also advanced measures to ensure that all truck drivers have the opportunity make a decent living.  In order for our truckers to do their jobs, they need Congress to do its job and pass a long-overdue, robust highways reauthorization. Truck drivers are on the front lines and face the effects of Congressional inaction every day.  More than 147,000 bridges in the United States are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete (one of every four bridges). Nearly two thirds of the nation's roads are in less than ``good'' condition. Congestion is a ballooning problem, affecting 42 percent of America's major roads and costing the economy $121 billion a year.  While our infrastructure has deteriorated, Congress has been asleep at the wheel, passing short-term patches that prolong uncertainty and force states to delay critical projects to fix decrepit, weight-restricted bridges that can't handle freight trucks or pockmarked highways that blow out tires.  As our needs have increased, surface transportation programs have been limping along with flat funding since 2009. The federal gas tax pays for highways and public transit, but it has not been raised in 22 years, and its purchasing power has fallen 40 percent. We need to do more than the status quo.  This must change. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is currently working on a bill to improve the conditions of our nation's roads, bridges, and intermodal facilities by reauthorizing surface transportation programs. A long-term bill is the only responsible action for Congress to take.  Robust levels of Federal investment make a truck driver's workplace--our highways--safer and more efficient. The Federal government needs to continue its leading role in promoting an interconnected interstate system vital to the timely movement of goods and people. This system must be paid for with guaranteed, sustainable funding that will bring our economy into the 21st Century--and not myopic solutions to replace a strong Federal role, such as tolling or privatization.  National Truck Driver Appreciation Week is an opportunity to reflect on the vital role that truck drivers play in supporting and sustaining our economy and our society. The best way Congress can honor truck drivers is to pass a fully funded, long-term authorization bill.                          ____________________
