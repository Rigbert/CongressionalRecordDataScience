 REID. No, not right now. This is absolutely untoward, what is happening here. We have tried to get this done every day. Oh, it is just we have to do a little bit more. We have this agreement that was agreed to by all of the parties, but, of course, now there is no agreement.  I am deeply disappointed that my Republican colleagues are preventing the Senate from passing additional critical sanctions against Iran. If they want to embarrass the President, this is a strange way to do it. Two months ago I came to the Senate floor and said we needed to pass these sanctions immediately. The fastest way forward was to pass the bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Johnson and Shelby, which passed out of the Banking Committee unanimously. But Republicans then said no, as they are saying today. Republicans said they wanted to include ideas from Senator Kirk, Senator Paul, and wished to move forward with S. Res. 380 on containment.  We heard their objections. We have tried mightily to address them, with the goal of getting this bill passed and protecting our own national security and that of our ally Israel. This deal includes a bipartisan managers' package sponsored by Senators Shelby and Johnson, with items of importance to Senators Menendez, Kirk, Paul, and Johnson.  The American Israel Public Affairs Committee has expressed strong support for this package to Senator McConnell and to me. In a letter today, AIPAC urged us to move forward with this package as quickly as possible. I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               The American Israel                                     Public Affairs Committee,                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2012.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We understand that you      are bringing the Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Human      Rights Act of 2012 (S. 2101) to the floor for consideration.      On behalf of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, we      would like to express our support for this critically      important bipartisan legislation. We also want to take this      opportunity to thank you for your ongoing strong efforts to      thwart Iran's nuclear program, and for your overall      leadership on behalf of a vibrant U.S.-Israel relationship.       In our view, this legislation has been further strengthened      in important ways by a managers' amendment that reflects the      views of a number of senators. We appreciate your leadership,      together with that of Senators Johnson, Shelby, Menendez and      Kirk in enabling this legislation to move forward to the      floor and ultimately to conference with the House.       We understand that Senators Menendez and Kirk have      additional valuable ideas to improve the bill being      considered by the Senate but have graciously agreed to defer      their amendments at this time to enable the bill to move      forward as rapidly as possible. We applaud their efforts and,      like them, want to see the strongest possible legislation      enacted. We believe that their amendments fall within the      scope of the conference committee, and urge you to ensure      that they will be given appropriate consideration during the      course of the conference deliberations.       We are deeply appreciative of the role played by the Senate      under your leadership to do everything possible to stop Iran      from using its nuclear program to further destabilize the      Middle East. By its legislation and oversight, Congress has      kept this issue in the forefront and forced Iran's leaders to      face the choice between compliance with its international      obligations and international opprobrium.       We look forward to working in support of your efforts.           Sincerely,     Howard Kohr,       Executive Director.     Marvin Feuer,       Director, Policy & Government Affairs.     Brad Gordon,       Director, Policy & Government Affairs.
