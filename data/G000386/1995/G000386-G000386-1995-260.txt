 President, we have to keep our eye on the problem. The problem is that the Medicare Program is going broke. And this means that out-of-control spending in the program must be addressed. We cannot address out-of-control spending by spending more.  Medicare spending is growing rapidly. The part A Program, which pays for the hospital care of beneficiaries, will grow 8.3 percent annually for the forseeable future. Part B, which pays doctor bills, will grow at 14.1 percent per year. The overall program will grow at 10.5 percent per year.  Evidence of the difference between income to the program and spending by the program is the pending bankruptcy of the part A program. Under current estimates, this program will not be able to pay its bills in the year 2002. The trustees of the fund, the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services recently addressed the financing shortfall of the trust fund. They said: ``the projected year of exhaustion for the HI Trust Fund is 2002.''  The situation is really no better, probably worse, for the part B program. The part B program doesn't present the crisis aspect that the part A program presents, but only because 70 percent of the funds for the program come from general revenues. Surely we cannot tolerate 14 percent annual growth in a program of this size.  The public trustees of the Medicare Program have tried to bring the situation facing the Medicare Program to the attention of the Congress and the general public. The public trustees serve as trustees of the program together with the Cabinet Secretaries I mentioned a moment ago. One is a Democrat, one a Republican. Their terms have just expired. They have no axe to grind. They both have long experience in government. They worked in leadership positions in agencies with responsibility for retirement programs. They are substantial people, whose views must be taken seriously.  They said, in the 1995 Trustees' Report, that ``the Medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its present form * * * it is now clear that Medicare reform needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct legislative initiative''. The administration officials serving as trustees, the Secretaries of Treasury, Labor, Health and Human Services, together with the Commissioner of Social Security and the Health Care Financing Administrator, said in the 1995 Report that ``the trustees urge the Congress to take additional actions designed to control HI program costs.'' They also said that ``the trustees believe that prompt, effective, and decisive action is necessary.''  The budget resolution we are considering attempts to address the serious problems in the Medicare Program identified by the trustees. In this budget, the Medicare Program will continue to grow at 7.1 percent per year. Over the 7 years covered by the budget resolution, the program will grow 59 percent from $161.1 billion in 1995 to $256.7 billion in 2002. This will be a per capita increase of 49 percent. The average annual per capita growth rate is 5.4 percent. This is a real per capita increase of 2.4 percent per year.  Some have argued that the real per capital change in   spending must be calculated using the medical CPI. And it is true that, were we to use this index to measure the change in per capita Medicare spending, there would be a real decrease in that spending. Yet, the Congressional Budget Office stopped using the medical CPI several years ago. They concluded that that measure was seriously flawed. Among other things, it cannot adequately account for the increases in quality of health care services. In addition the index uses list prices rather than actual transaction prices. And, these days, list prices have little to do with the actual cost of services.  I am not trying to argue that the spending slowdown will not be difficult and painful. As a Senator representing a rural, Medicare-dependent State, with high-quality and relatively low-cost medical care, I realize this all too well.  But, there are two additional steps in the budget process during which the impact of the Medicare spending slowdown on vulnerable areas of the country can be cushioned. First, the resolution calls for a Commission to suggest how this spending slowdown might best be achieved. I am confident that this Commission will take into consideration the special circumstances of vulnerable regions and vulnerable groups when they develop their recommendations.  Second, the Committee on Finance, of which I am a member, will make the critical decisions about how to change the Medicare Program so as to realize savings. As a member of that committee, I intend to work hard to ease the impact of the spending slowdown on the most vulnerable. Medicare expenditures in rural areas are considerably smaller than are expenditures in nonrural areas. For instance, the part A expenditure in rural areas is only about 13 percent of total part A expenditures. Total program payments in nonmetropolitan statistical areas is about 23 percent of total program payments. In the past, this difference has made it possible to cushion the impact of reconciliation bills on rural areas. Thus, I think that it should be possible to cushion the effects on rural areas of the spending slowdown without adverse effects on other areas. Mr. President, I am concerned about the Medicare Program and all those who depend on it. I do not believe that this budget resolution, with all the sacrifice it calls for, will jeopardize the health care services on which older people depend. I am concerned, Mr. President, that if we do not act to put the Medicare Program on a sound footing, Medicare-dependent States like my own will suffer the most when the day of reckoning ultimately comes.  I am also concerned about the future of our country. If we do not act, we will be faced with Federal deficits into the indefinite future. If we do not act, interest on the national debt will reach $300 billion annually be the end of the decade. That is larger than the Defense budget. That is larger than the Medicare Program. That is larger, in fact, than any item in the Federal budget [[Page S7069]] except the Social Security retirement program.  Surely, Mr. President, we cannot go on like this.                  the future of medicare and medicaid
