 President, today I rise to introduce the Due Process Guarantee Act, which passed the Senate in 2012 with 67 votes as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2013.  Unfortunately, the amendment was taken out in the Conference Committee that year. It is my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation again this year, and this time the House will support it so that it can finally be enacted into law to protect Americans from being detained indefinitely.  The bipartisan bill I am introducing today, with Senator Lee as the lead co-sponsor, is almost identical to the amendment that passed the Senate in December 2012 with 67 votes. The previous version of this bill had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee on February 29, 2012.  This legislation is necessary to prevent the U.S. Government from detaining its citizens indefinitely.  Unfortunately, indefinite detention has been a part of America's not-too-distant past. The internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II remains a dark spot on our Nation's legacy, and is something we should never repeat.  To ensure that this reprehensible experience would never happen again, Congress passed and President Nixon signed into law the Non-Detention Act of 1971, which repealed a 1950 statue that explicitly allowed the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens.  The Non-Detention Act of 1971 clearly states:       No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained the      United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.  Despite the shameful history of indefinite detention of Americans and the legal controversy over the issue since 9/11, during debate on the defense authorization bill in past years, some in the Senate have advocated for allowing the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens.  Proponents of indefinitely detaining U.S. citizens argue that the Authorization for Use of Military Force, AUMF, that was enacted shortly after 9/11 is, quote, ``an act of Congress,'' in the language of the Non-Detention Act of 1971, that authorizes the indefinite detention of American citizens regardless of where they are captured.  They further assert that their position is justified by the U.S. Supreme Court's plurality decision in the 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. However, the Hamdi case involved an American captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan.  Yaser Esam Hamdi was a U.S. citizen who took up arms on behalf of the Taliban and was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan. The divided Court did effectively uphold his military detention, so some of my colleagues use this case to argue that the military can indefinitely detain even American citizens who are arrested domestically here on U.S. soil, far from the battlefield of Afghanistan.  However, the Supreme Court's opinion in the Hamdi case was a muddled decision by a four-vote plurality that recognized the power of the government to detain U.S. citizens captured in such circumstances as ``enemy combatants'' for some period, but otherwise repudiated the government's broad assertions of executive authority to detain citizens without charge or trial.  In particular, the Court limited its holding to citizens captured in an area of, quote, ``active combat operations'', unquote, and concluded that even in those circumstances the U.S. Constitution and the Due Process Clause guarantees U.S. citizens certain rights, including the ability to challenge their enemy combatant status before an impartial judge.  The plurality's opinion stated:       It [the Government] has made clear, however, that, for      purposes of this case, the `enemy combatant' that it is      seeking to detain is an individual who, it alleges, was `part      of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or      coalition partners' in Afghanistan and who `` `engaged in an      armed conflict against the United States'' there. Brief for      Respondents 3. We therefore answer only the narrow question      before us: whether the detention of citizens falling within      that definition is authorized.''  The opinion goes on to say at page 517 that ``we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we describe . . .''  Indeed, the plurality later emphasized that it was discussing a citizen captured on a foreign battlefield. Criticizing Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion, the opinion says, ``Justice Scalia largely ignores the context of this case: a United States citizen captured in a foreign combat zone.'' The plurality italicized and emphasized the word ``foreign'' in that sentence.  Thus, to the extent the Hamdi case permits the government to detain a U.S. citizen ``until the end of hostilities,'' it does so only under a very limited set of circumstances, namely citizens taking an active part in hostilities, who are captured in Afghanistan, and who are afforded certain due process protections, at a minimum.  Additionally, decisions by the lower courts have contributed to the current state of legal ambiguity when it comes to the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens, such as Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who was arrested in Chicago in 2002. He was initially detained pursuant to a material witness warrant based on the 9/11 terrorist attacks and later designated as an ``enemy combatant'' who conspired with al-Qaeda to carry out terrorist attacks including a plot to detonate a ``dirty bomb'' inside the U.S.  Padilla was transferred to the military brig in South Carolina where he was detained for three and a half years while seeking habeas corpus relief. Padilla was never charged with attempting to carry out the ``dirty bomb'' plot. Instead, Padilla was released from military custody in November 2005 and transferred to Federal civilian custody in Florida where he was indicted on other charges in Federal court related to terrorist plots overseas.  While he was indefinitely detailed by the military, Padilla filed a habeas corpus petition which was litigated at first in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and then in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In a 2003 decision by the Second Circuit known as Padilla v. Rumsfeld, the Court of Appeals held that the AUMF did not authorize his detention, saying: ``we conclude that clear congressional authorization is required for detentions of American citizens on American soil because 18 U.S.C.Sec. 4001(a) the ``Non-Detention Act'', prohibits such detentions absent specific congressional authorization. Congress's Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution, . . . passed shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, is not such an authorization.''  This requirement for ``clear congressional authorization'' to detain is known as the Second Circuit's ``Clear Statement Rule.''  However, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reached the opposite conclusion, finding that the AUMF did authorize his detention. It is worth pointing out, however, that their analysis turned entirely on the disputed claims that ``Padilla associated with forces hostile to the United States in Afghanistan,'' and, ``like Hamdi, Padilla took up arms against United States forces in that country in the same way and to the same extent as did Hamdi.''  Facing an impending Supreme Court challenge and mounting public criticism for holding a U.S. citizen arrested inside the U.S. as an enemy combatant, the Bush administration relented, and ordered Padilla transferred to civilian custody to face criminal conspiracy and material support for terrorism charges in Federal court.  I believe that the time is now to end the legal ambiguities, and have Congress state clearly, once and for all, that the AUMF or other authorities do not authorize indefinite detention of Americans apprehended in the U.S.  To accomplish this, we are introducing legislation again this year which affirms and strengthens the principles behind the Non-Detention Act of 1971.  It amends the Non-Detention Act to provide clearly that no military authorization allows the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens or Green Card holders who are apprehended inside the U.S.  Like the amendment that passed with 67 votes in 2012, the bill creates a new subsection (b) of the Non-Detention Act which clearly states: ``A general authorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any similar authority, on its own, shall not be construed to authorize the imprisonment or detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States apprehended in the United States.''  Like the previous version, this bill amends the Non-Detention Act to codify the Second Circuit's ``Clear Statement Rule'' from the Padilla case. So new subsection (a) will read, ``No citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except consistent with the Constitution and pursuant to an act of Congress that expressly authorizes such imprisonment or detention.''  Making the Clear Statement Rule part of subsection (a) strengthens the Non-Detention Act even more by requiring Congress to be explicit if it wants to detain U.S. citizens indefinitely. Subsection (b) clarifies that an authorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any similar authority does not authorize the indefinite detention of a U.S. citizen or a Lawful Permanent Resident of the U.S., also known as a Green Card holder.  Some may ask why this legislation protects Green Card holders as well as citizens. And others may ask why the bill does not protect all persons'' apprehended in the U.S. from indefinite detention.  Let me make clear that I would support providing the protections in this amendment to all persons in the United States, whether lawfully or unlawfully present. But the question comes, is there enough political support to expand this amendment to cover others besides U.S. citizens and Green Card holders?  Wherever we draw the line on who should be covered by this legislation, I believe it violates fundamental American rights to allow anyone apprehended on U.S. soil to be detained without charge or trial.  The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have proven, time and again, that they are up to the challenge of detecting, stopping, arresting, and convicting terrorists found on U.S. soil, having successfully arrested, detained and convicted hundreds of these heinous people, both before and after 9/11.  Specifically, there have been 556 terrorism-related convictions in federal criminal court between 9/11 and the end of 2013, according to the Department of Justice.  Also, it is important to understand that suspected terrorists who may be in the U.S. illegally can be detained within the criminal justice system using at least the following 4 options:  They can be charged with a Federal or State crime and held; they can be held for violating immigration laws; they can be held as material witnesses as part of Federal grand jury proceedings; and they can be held for up to 6 months under Section 412 of the Patriot Act.  I want to be very clear about what this bill is and is not about. It is not about whether citizens such as Hamdi and Padilla, or others who would do us harm, should be captured, interrogated, incarcerated, and severely punished. They should be.  But what about an innocent American? What about someone in the wrong place at the wrong time? The beauty of our Constitution is that it gives everyone in the United States basic due process rights to a trial by a jury of their peers.  As President Obama said when referring to the indefinite detention of non-Americans at Guantanamo:       ``Imagine a future--10 years from now or 20 years from      now--when the United States of America is still holding      people who have been charged with no crime on a piece of land      that is not part of our country. . . . Is that who we are? Is      that something that our Founders foresaw? Is that the America      we want to leave to our children? Our sense of justice is      stronger than that.''  The same questions could be asked of those who would indefinitely detain Americans arrested on U.S. soil.  Is that who we are?  Does that reflect the America we want to leave to our children?  Now is the time to clarify U.S. law to state unequivocally that the government cannot indefinitely detain American citizens and Green Card holders captured inside this country without trial or charge.  The Federal Government experimented with indefinite detention of U.S. citizens during World War II, a mistake we now recognize as a betrayal of our core values.  Let us not repeat it. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
