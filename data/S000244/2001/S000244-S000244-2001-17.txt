Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what I just heard. We are told that we should not put a death penalty in this bill that relates to implementing a convention against terrorist bombings where a death or serious injury occur because the French do not like it. Well, the last time I read the United States Constitution, the elected representatives of the American people legislate for America, not the elected representatives of the French people. This is an issue of our national sovereignty and whether or not we believe that the death penalty is an appropriate option for those who are accused of crimes under the convention designed to combat terrorist bombings.  The overwhelming majority of the American people support the death penalty, particularly when it is with respect to a terrorist act. We should not let the parliament of any other country in the world make a determination on what the appropriate penalty is for those who are accused of these heinous crimes and are convicted by a unanimous verdict of 12 jurors who believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crimes that are mentioned.  We already have provisions in the United States code providing for the death penalty for terrorist act that result in somebody's death. Without making this law parallel to the other penalties in the United States code, we are setting up a dual system of justice. If a defendant is indicted for violating one section, the defendant is subject to the death penalty. If a defendant is indicted for violating another section of the code as created by this bill, the defendant is not. That, I think, is the wrong message that we ought to send both domestically and internationally with respect to this issue.  I remind Members, Mr. Speaker, that since 1972, the death penalty is not automatic upon conviction of a crime. The same jury that has convicted someone of a capital defense is reimpaneled and hears aggravating and mitigating evidence, and makes a determination whether or not the death penalty should be imposed. Who is better equipped to do that but the jurors that listened to the trial on the merits, saw the demeanor of the defendant in court, whether or not the defendant testified in his or her own behalf, decided which witnesses were telling the truth and which witnesses were not, and were able to see the demeanor of every other participant in that trial.  I think that the message that we ought to send, purely and simply, is that the elected representatives of the American people will decide what these penalties are, not people in France or in Italy or in Sweden or Germany or anyplace else. I think that the American people want the death penalty for these types of crimes as an option when a defendant is indicted.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1030
