Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, the issue is whether the INS should go into more sole-source procurement for information-technology issues. Competitive bidding keeps the cost down to the taxpayers, and it means that various vendors compete against one another on who can provide the best product for the lowest possible cost for what the government needs.  I would remind all Members, but particularly those on the Republican side of the aisle, that the administration has a great deal of concern about this amendment, particularly the OMB. I do not think that as we restructure that agency we should throw out all of the procurement rules relative to computer and information-technology procurement.  The time may come when the new Associate Attorney General for immigration affairs may find this necessary, but let us wait until we restructure the agency and the person who is going to be the overseer of the entire operation makes a determination of whether competitive bidding works or we should make a particular exception.  This amendment puts the cart before the horse. I would urge a ``no'' vote to keep the cart after the horse.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). All time for debate on the amendment has expired.  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.
