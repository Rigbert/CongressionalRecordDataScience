 President, through the course of the debate on the bankruptcy reform bill, it has become clear there are many Senators who have concerns about the numerous aspects of the credit card industry. I want to point out that I am aware of the Senator from Ohio's concerns in particular. I want to indicate for the Record that I recognize these concerns and to note that I have had a longstanding interest in exploring these matters more deeply. Therefore, I am willing to commit to holding hearings in the Banking Committee later this year to examine the credit card industry and the need to reform credit card regulations. I believe the ranking member also shares my interest in holding hearings.
