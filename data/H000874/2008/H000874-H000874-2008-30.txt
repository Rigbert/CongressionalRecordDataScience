 Frankly, I have not seen it, and I don't know. What I do know is that Mr. Arcuri informed me, and obviously has asked us--Mr. Arcuri feels very badly that a different version than was at the desk was given to the minority inadvertently; and as a result, the minority did not have the document in front of it. It was at the desk, but nobody's gone up to the desk to compare the items. And as a result, we think, in fairness, we ought to have that document in front of you.
