Speaker, I have always been a staunch defender of privacy and civil liberties. I voted against the Patriot Act and its extension in 2008 and 2011 because I feared it gave the federal government too much unchecked power over the rights of law abiding citizens and lacked effective oversight tools for Congress. Clearly I was proven right. Thankfully, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the NSA's program to collect telephone records in bulk under Section 215 of the Patriot Act is illegal. This was a big win for privacy and civil liberties advocates, but it is not the end of the fight. Given this decision, it is clear that Congress must do more to rein in unconstitutional intrusion into our personal lives. Unfortunately, today's bill fell short of those reforms.   H.R. 2048 is an improvement from the weakened bill that passed the House last year. However, it falls short of shutting the door on unrestrained government surveillance. The bill does nothing to address ``backdoor'' searches of U.S. citizens under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. This statute is possibly of more concern than the telephone records collected under Section 215. While Section 702 expressly prohibits the government from intentionally targeting the communications of U.S. persons, the NSA has applied an incredibly loose interpretation of this statute and used it to justify collecting not only communications records of U.S. citizens, but also the contents of communications, including email, social media messages, or web browsing history.   While this bill attempts to address bulk data collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the NSA has an unscrupulous tendency to find loopholes in statute and twist the intent of Congress to fulfill their own wishes. I fear that given our past experience, this bill will undermine the Second Circuit's decision and create new legal loopholes for the NSA and law enforcement agencies to collect even more data on millions of Americans.   It is possible to gain information on potential terrorist threats while still protecting the privacy and freedom of American citizens, complying with the Constitution, and preserving adequate congressional and judicial oversight. The original version of the USA Freedom Act, introduced in 2013, balanced these priorities. The bill we considered today did not. I urge the Senate to make the needed reforms to this bill so that it bolsters the Second Circuit's decision and accomplishes the goal of once and for all ending mass government surveillance of law-abiding Americans.                          ____________________
