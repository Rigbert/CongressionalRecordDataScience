President, first of all, I will make this very brief. I appreciate the comments of the majority leader. It was not necessary, but it is very meaningful to me personally.  Also, about Senator Boxer, she and I are at opposite extremes on many issues. I have always said that conservatives should be big spenders in two areas: national defense and infrastructure. We have to look at this in the future so that we don't have to go through it again. I thank all of those on her side and on my side who helped to move this forward.  I thank Ruth VanMark, who has been with me for 22 years. She is now getting off of probation.  Again, I thank all of you for your cooperation.
