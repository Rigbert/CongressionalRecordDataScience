 The agency is plagued by dramatic cost increases on nearly every major task under its jurisdiction. Given the nature of a continuing resolution, the Congress is unable to meaningfully weigh in on important issues such as these. I do appreciate inclusion of support for the United States Enrichment Corporation.  In closing, while I am disappointed in the bill's shortcomings, I am hopeful that collectively Congress can improve upon this bill as it moves to the other body.  Again, I commend our chairman, Mr. Rogers, and Ranking Member Nita Lowey of New York, such a phenomenal leader.
