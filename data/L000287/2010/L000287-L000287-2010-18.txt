Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, my colleague, Chairman Stark, for yielding time.  Mr. Speaker, we as a Nation have a duty to provide the very best health care to our seniors and our disabled brothers and sisters. For them, Medicare is a blessing, a lifeline.  Each time someone steals money from Medicare, it weakens the public trust, it hurts our seniors, and threatens the future of Medicare. We must not, and we will not allow, criminals to rob Medicare. If you defraud Medicare once, you will never, ever do it again.  CEOs who defraud Medicare should not be able to simply move to a different company and continue to bill Medicare. Their companies should not be able to hide behind corporate shells that rob Medicare. This legislation will strengthen the anti-fraud laws and stop these bad practices.                              {time}  1620  I want to thank Mr. Herger and again the chairman of our Subcommittee on Health, Chairman Stark, for working side by side with the Oversight Subcommittee to end these abuses.  I ask all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this necessary bipartisan bill.
