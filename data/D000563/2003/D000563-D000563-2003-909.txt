I hold in my hand a copy of the transcript of the hearings of the Committee on the Judiciary relating to the nomination of William Bradford Reynolds to be Associate Attorney General of the United States. And written within the committee hearings, you will find on page 983 a copy of a memorandum to the Solicitor General, sent by Mr. Reynolds relating to the recommendation on an amicus brief. I ask the Senator from Utah, would he like to at least modify his earlier statement that the Department of Justice has never produced a memorandum to the Solicitor General relating to amicus briefs in light of the fact that it is part of the official transcript of his committee?
