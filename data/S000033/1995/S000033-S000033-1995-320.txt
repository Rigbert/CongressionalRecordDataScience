 I think we should be very clear about what is going on.  In this instance, we are not being rhetorical or cute by saying that literally we are talking about food coming out of the mouths of hungry children in order to provide tax breaks for some of the wealthiest people in this country, and I think that is, you know, there has been a whole lot of discussion about family values. I do not think that cutting back on school breakfast programs, school lunch programs, and in my State of Vermont, the WIC Program, which is the women and infants and children program by which low-income pregnant women are provided good nutrition and little kids are provided good nutrition, to eliminate that program and put it into the block grants is, to me, just incomprehensible.  Furthermore, I think, as you know, and I know this affects your district which also has some cold winter as my district does, as the State of Vermont does, last week one of the subcommittees on Appropriations proposed, voted to, to eliminate the LIHEAP program, which is a program that provides fuel assistance for low income people in our districts where the weather gets 20 below zero. This is a serious matter. It is a question of whether people stay alive or not.  Many of the recipients of that program in the State of Vermont are elderly people. So once more, tax breaks for the rich, increases in military spending, and star wars, and cutbacks for the most vulnerable people in our Nation.                              {time}  2300
