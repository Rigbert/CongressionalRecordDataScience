That is Marco Rubio.  Let's work together to pass an emergency supplemental.  Steve Womack said this:  ``If we fail to deal with the issue and there are hardships that would be posed on society in this country, you wouldn't be able to compute those costs.'' ``It's a dice roll to get into an argument about Zika funding and running the risk in having something catastrophic happen and we own it.''  You will own it if this gets out of hand and we don't have the appropriate resources deployed now. It should have been 30 days ago, 60 days ago, 90 days ago.  Let's not have this become a crisis. Let's act now on the full sum necessary to meet this crisis.
