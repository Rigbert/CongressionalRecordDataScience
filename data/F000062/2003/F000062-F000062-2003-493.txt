 I have called on FERC to make this evidence publicand I want to reiterate my request again.  I am also introducing a bill with Senators Fitzgerald, Harkin, Lugar, Cantwell, Wyden, and Leahy to close a loophole which allows energy trades to take place electronically, in private, with no transparency, record, audit trail or any oversight to guard against fraud and manipulation.  But before I reintroduce this bill, I want to reiterate the important revelations that have been uncovered in the past year and detail what we know about yesterday's filing at FERC.  Last week I came to the floor to update the Senate on recent evidence of fraud and manipulation in the energy sector. Today I want to pick up where I left off and introduce the Energy Market Oversight Act.  Mr. President, I draw my colleagues' attention to a filing made at FERC. This ``Public Version'' is a 27-page summary of the filing with confidential information removed, but it provides a detailed overview of the fraud and manipulation carried out by energy companies during the Western energy crisis.  In addition to testimony by expert witnesses, 348 exhibits, transcripts of depositions, tapes of trader telephone conversations, emails, and other data, the California parties submitted a 161-page brief to FERC. The document I have inserted into the Record includes the Table of Contents, the Introduction and Overview, and the Conclusion of this 161-page document. To be clear, it is part, but not all of the brief filed by the State of California.  Mr. President, the filing submitted by the State of California yesterday shows that there was an extensive and coordinated attempt by energy companies to engage in the following schemes to drive up prices in the Western Energy Market:       1. Withholding of Power--driving up prices by creating      false shortages;       2. Bidding to Exercise Market Power--suppliers bid higher      after the California ISO declared emergencies, knowing the      State would need power and be willing to pay any price to get      it;       3. Scheduling of Bogus Load, aka ``Fat Boy'' or ``Inc-     ing''--suppliers submitted false load schedules to increase      prices;       4. Export-Import Games, aka ``Ricochet or ``Megawatt      Laundering''--suppliers exported power out of California and      imported it back into the State in an attempt to sell power      at inflated prices;       5. Congestion Games, aka ``Death Star''--suppliers created      false congestion and were then paid for relieving congestion      without moving any power;       6. Double-Selling--suppliers sold reserves, but then failed      to keep those reserves available for the ISO;       7. Selling of Non-Existent Ancillary Services, aka ``Get      Shorty''--suppliers sold resources that were either already      committed to other sales or incapable of being provided;       8. Sharing of Non-Public Generation Outage Information--the      largest suppliers in California shared information from a      company called Industrial Information Resources that provided      sellers detailed, non-public information on daily plant      outages;       9. Collusion Among Sellers--sellers were jointly      implementing or facilitating Enron-type trading strategies;       10. Manipulation of the Nitrous Oxide (NOX)      Emission Market--sellers manipulated the market for      NOX emissions in the South Coast Air Quality      Management District through a series of wash trades that      created the appearance of a dramatic price increase that may      have been fabricated. For example, Dynegy, together with AES      and others, entered into a series of trades of NOx      credits in July and August of 2000 by which Dynegy would sell      a large quality of credits and then simultaneously buy back a      smaller quantity of credits at a higher per credit price.  We can assume that the thousands of pages filed by the California parties at FERC detail these examples of market abuse. At this point we cannot know all of the instances because the specifics remain confidential, but we have plenty to go on.  Yesterday I wrote another letter to FERC Chairman Pat Wood asking the Commission to lift its ``Protective Order'' to make this information public so that families and businesses harmed during the Western Energy Crisis can know the extent of fraud and manipulation that occurred.  I believe the filing yesterday presents a key decision for FERC. Clearly the Commission cannot ignore this mountain of new evidence submitted--especially since it comes at a time when other disclosures have been made to show pervasive fraud and manipulation in the Western Energy Market.  Last month Jeffrey Richter, the former head of Enron's Short-Term California energy trading desk, pled guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud as part of Enron's well known schemes to manipulate Western energy markets. Richter's plea follows that of head Enron trader Tim Belden in the fall of 2002. Belden admitted that he schemed to defraud California during the Western energy crisis and also plead guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  The Enron plea came on the heels of FERC's release of transcripts from Reliant Energy that reveal how their traders intentionally withheld power from the California market in an attempt to increase prices. This is one of the most egregious examples of manipulation and it is clear and convincing evidence of coordinated schemes to defraud consumers.  Let me read just one part of the transcript to demonstrate the greed behind the market abuse by Reliant and its traders.  On June 20, 2000 two Reliant employees had the following conversation that reveals the company withheld power from the California market to drive prices up:       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``I don't necessarily foresee      those units being run the remainder of this week. In fact you      will probably see, in fact I know, tomorrow we have all the      units at Coolwater off.'' (The Coolwater plant is a 526      Megawatt plant.)       Reliant Plant Operator 2: ``Really?''       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``Potentially. Even number      four. More due to some market manipulation attempts on our      part. And so, on number four it probably wouldn't last long.      It would probably be back on the next day, if not the day      after that. Trying to uh . . .''       Reliant Plant Operator 2: ``Trying to shorten supply, uh?      That way the price on demand goes up.''       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``Well, we'll see.''       Reliant Plant Operator 2: ``I can understand. That's      cool.''       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``We've got some term      positions that, you know, that would benefit.''  Six months after this incident, as the Senate Energy Committee was attempting to get to the bottom of why energy prices were soaring in the West, the President and CEO of Reliant testified before Congress that the State of California ``has focused on an inaccurate perception of market manipulation.''  Reliant's President and CEO went on to say, ``We are proud of our contributions to keep generation running to try to meet the demand for power in California. Reliant Energy's plant and technical staffs have worked hard to maximize the performance of our generation.''  These transcripts prove otherwise and reveal the truth about market manipulation in the energy sector.  Despite this clear and convincing evidence of fraud, on January 31 of this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chose to only give Reliant a slap on the wrist for this behavior. The company paid only $13.8 million to sweep this criminal behavior under the rug and settle with FERC.  Let me turn to some other recent examples that demonstrate how other energy companies manipulated the Western Energy Market as Reliant did. On December 11th, FERC finally released audio tapes that show how traders at Williams conspired with AES Energy plant operators to keep power offline and drive prices up.  The tapes depict how on April 27, 2000, Williams outage coordinator Rhonda Morgan encouraged an AES operator at the company's Alamitos plant to extend a plant outage because the California grid operator was paying ``a premium'' for power at the time. The Williams employee stated, ``that's one reason it wouldn't hurt Williams' feelings if the outage ran long.''  Later that day, Eric Pendergraft, a high-ranking AES employee called to confirm with Ms. Morgan that Williams wanted the plant to stay offline by saying, ``you guys were saying that it might not be such a bad thing if it took us a little while longer to do our work?'' ``I don't want to do something underhanded,'' Ms. Morgan responded, ``but if there is work you can continue to do . . .'' At this point Mr. Pendergraft interrupted to cut off their suspicious conversation, saying, ``I understand. You don't have to talk anymore.''  Clearly, this is evidence of a calculated intent to withhold power to raise prices. I find it unconscionable.  Let's turn to some other examples.  On January 27, 2003, Michelle Marie Valencia, a 32-year-old former senior energy trader for Dynegy was arrested on charges that she reported fictitious natural gas transactions to an industry publication.  On December 5, 2002, Todd Geiger, a former vice president on the Canadian natural gas trading desk for El Paso Merchant Energy, was charged with wire fraud and filing a false report after allegedly telling a trade publication about the prices for 48 natural gas trades that he never made in an effort to boost prices and company profit.  These indictments are just the latest examples of how energy firms reported inaccurate prices to trade publications to drive energy prices higher.  Industry publications claimed they could not be fooled by false prices because deviant prices are rejected, but this claim was predicated on the fact that everyone was reporting honestly--which we now know they weren't doing.  CMS Energy, Williams, American Electric Power Company, and Dynegy have each acknowledged that its employees gave inaccurate price data to industry participants. On December 19th Dynegy agreed to pay a $5 million fine for its actions.  In September an Administrative Law Judge at FERC issued a landmark ruling concluding that El Paso Corporation withheld natural gas from California and recommended penalty proceedings against the company. Since the El Paso Pipeline carries most of the natural gas to Southern California, this ruling has tremendous implications. The FERC Commissioners are expected to take up this case for a final judgement soon.  These have been the latest revelations in a series of energy disclosure bombshells that began on Monday, May 6th when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission posted a series of documents on their website that revealed Enron manipulated the Western Energy Market by engaging in a number of suspect trading strategies.  These memos revealed for the first time how Enron used schemes called ``Death Star,'' ``Get Shorty,'' ``Fat Boy,'' and ``Ricochet'' to fleece families and businesses in the West.  The filing made yesterday to FERC shows how other companies did engage in these Enron-type trading strategies. The brief submitted by the State of California and others states that suppliers ``were jointly implementing or facilitating Enron-type trading strategies.''  Let us turn to other types of fraudulent trades that many energy firms have admitted to.  Dynegy, Duke Energy, El Paso, Reliant Resources Inc., CMS Energy Corp., and Williams Cos. all admitted engaging in false ``round-trip `` or ``wash trades.''  What is a ``round-trip'' trade, one might ask?  ``Round-trip'' trades occur when one firm sells energy to another and then the second firm simultaneously sells the same amount of energy back to the first company at exactly the same price. No commodity ever actually changes hands, but when done on an exchange, these transactions send a price signal to the market and they artificially boost revenue for the company.  How widespread are ``round-trip'' trades? Well, the Congressional Research Service looked at trading patterns in the energy sector over the last few years and reported, ``this pattern of trading suggests a market environment in which a significant volume of fictitious trading could have taken place.''  Yet, since most of the energy trading market is unregulated by the government, we have only a slim idea of the illusions being perpetrated in the energy sector.  Consider the following recent confessions from energy firms about ``round-trip'' trades:       Reliant admitted 10 percent of its trading revenues came      from ``round-trip'' trades. The announcement forced the      company's President and head of wholesale trading to both      step down.       CMS Energy announced 80 percent of its trades in 2001 were      ``round-trip'' trades.  Remember, these trades are sham deals where nothing was exchanged, yet the company booked revenues from the trades.       Duke Energy disclosed that 1.1 billion dollars-worth of      trades were ``round-trip'' since 1999--roughly two-thirds of      these were done on InterContinental Exchange, which means      that thousands of subscribes would have seen these false      price signals.       A lawyer for J.P. Morgan Chase admitted the bank engineered      a series of ``round-trip'' trades with Enron.       Dynegy and Williams have also admitted to this round-trip      trading.       And although these trades mostly occurred with electricity,      there is evidence to suggest that ``round-trip'' trades were      made in natural gas and even broadband.  By exchanging the same amount of a commodity at the same price, I believe these companies have not engaged in meaningful transactions, but deceptive practices to fool investors and possibly drive energy prices up for consumers.  It is therefore imperative that the Department of Justice, FERC, the SEC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and every other oversight agency conduct an aggressive and vigorous investigation into all of the energy companies who participated in Western Energy Market.  Beyond that I believe Congress must re-examine what tools the government needs to keep a better watch over these volatile markets that are little understood. In the absence of vigilant government oversight of the energy sector, firms have the incentive to create the appearance of a mature, liquid, and well-functioning market, but it is unclear whether such a market exists.  The ``round-trip'' trades, the Enron memos, and the filing at FERC raise questions about illusions in the energy market.  To this end, I believe it is critical for the Senate to act soon on the legislation I offered last April to regulate online energy trading.  I am re-introducing this legislation to subject electronic exchanges like Enron On-Line to the same oversight, reporting and capital requirements as other commodity exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.  I am pleased Senator Fitzgerald, Senator Harkin, Senator Lugar, Senator Cantwell, Senator Wyden, and Senator Leahy have again signed on to this legislation. I am proud of the work we did in the 107th Congress and I hope we can complete action on this bill soon.  Without this type of legislation, there is insufficient authority to investigate and prevent fraud and price manipulation since parties making the trade are not required to keep a record.  Right now, energy transactions are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) when there is actual delivery.  For example, if I buy natural gas from you, and you deliver that natural gas to me, FERC has the authority to ensure that this transaction is transparent and reasonably priced.  However, many energy transactions no longer result in delivery. A giant loophole has opened where there is no government oversight when these transactions are done on internet exchanges.  In 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000 which exempted energy and metals trading from regulatory oversight and excluded it completely if the trade was done electronically.  So today, as long as there is no delivery, there is no price transparency. Again, this lack of transparency and oversight only applies to energy. It does not apply if you are selling wheat or pork bellies or any other tangible commodity.  And it did not take long for Enron Online, and others in the energy sector, to take advantage of this new freedom by trading energy derivatives absent any regulatory oversight.  Thus, after the 2000 legislation was enacted, Enron OnLine began to trade energy derivatives bilaterally without being subject to proper regulatory oversight. It should not surprise anyone that without the transparency, prices soared.  Just yesterday Warren Buffett published a warning in Fortune Magazine saying that ``Derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction.'' In his annual warning letter to shareholders about what worries him about the financial markets, Warren Buffett called derivatives and the trading activities that go with them ``time bombs.''  In the letter, Warren Buffett states, ``In recent years some huge-scale frauds and near-frauds have been facilitated by derivatives trades. In the energy and electric utility sectors, for example, companies used derivatives andtrading activities to report great `earnings'--until the roof fell in when they actually tried to convert the derivatives-related receivables on their balance sheets into cash.''  We clearly saw this with Enron.  Was Enron and its energy derivative trading arm, Enron-On-Line the sole reason California and the West had an energy crisis? No.  Was it a contributing factor to the crisis? I certainly believe that it was. Unfortunately, because of the energy exemptions in the 2000 CFMA, which took away the CFTC's authority to investigate, we may never know for sure.  In the 107th Congress, this legislation was debated during consideration of the Senate Energy Bill and it was the subject of a hearing in the Agriculture Committee, but time ran out before the legislation could be marked up and passed.  Since that time, Senators Lugar and Harkin have made significant improvements to the legislation and we have added stronger penalties for market abuse and wrongdoing.  Today I am pleased to note that the following companies and organizations are supporting this legislation:       The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association,       The Derivatives Study Center,       The American Public Gas Association,       The American Public Power Association,       The California Municipal Utilities Association,       The Southern California Public Power Authority,       The Transmission Access Policy Study Group,       The U.S. Public Interest Research Group,       The Consumers Union,       The Consumers Federation of America,       Calpine,       Southern California Edison,       Pacific Gas and Electric, and       FERC Chairman Pat Wood.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters of support from these organizations and companies be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    Federal Energy                                        Regulatory Commission,                                Washington, DC, February 21, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for bringing to my      attention your proposed legislation on, inter alia, the      penalty provisions in the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the      Natural Gas Act (NGA), refund provisions in the FPA, and      federal oversight of financial transactions involving energy      commodities. Your amendment would expand the penalties      allowed under the FPA and NGA, and also allow oversight by      the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of financial      transactions involving energy commodities.       I support your proposed changes to the FPA and NGA.      Increased penalty authority will help ensure compliance with      the requirements of these statutes. Also, your proposed      changes to the FPA refund provisions will allow greater      protection of utility customers.       Finally, you know how strongly I feel about customers      having access to the broadest range of useful market      information. Greater transparency is needed in energy      markets. Thus, I support providing for, or clarifying, CFTC      or other Federal regulatory oversight of trading platforms      that are relied on for price discovery. However, the details      of your proposed changes to the Commodity Exchange Act would      be better addressed by the CFTC or others and I would defer      to them with respect to any changes to the Commodity Exchange      Act.           Best regards,                                                     Pat Wood III,     Chairman.                                  ____                                             PG Corporation,                               San Francisco, CA, January 8, 2003.     Hon. Thad Cochran,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Cochran: Congratulations on your assumption of      the Chairmanship of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry      Committee. We are writing to communicate our support for an      important bipartisan legislative proposal considered by the      Committee last year to provide oversight of energy      derivatives trading markets.       As you know, the Committee considered last summer a      proposal introduced by Senator Feinstein and co-sponsored by      Senators Harkin and Lugar, S. 2724, to repeal the current      exemption of energy derivatives trading from the jurisdiction      of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''). The      proposal was similar to legislation offered earlier in the      year by Senator Feinstein as an amendment to the Senate      Energy Bill. Enclosed for your information is a letter that      was sent from our corporation to Senator Feinstein last year      concerning her amendment.       The legislation, which we hope Congress will consider again      this year, would re-establish authority over energy      derivatives trading to the CFTC, which has the most relevant      oversight capability, having regulated such trading prior to      2000. As a market participant, we believe that Senator      Feinstein's legislation will encourage transparency of market      information and ensure market stability, which in turn would      enable market participants to better manage risk, reduce      price volatility for electricity consumers and preserve      ultimately the viability of this marketplace.       We appreciate your considering our views on this important      issue, and look forward to working with you in the 108th      Congress.           Sincerely,                                                      Dan Richard,     Senior Vice President, Public Affairs.                                  ____                                                      Calpine,                                   San Jose, CA, February 5, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to let you know of      Calpine's continuing support for additional oversight of      certain energy derivative markets, as intended by the      legislation you plan to introduce again this year. While we      do not believe that energy trading was a primary cause of the      California energy crisis, we do believe there is a crisis of      confidence in the energy markets and that your legislation      will assist in restoring much needed public confidence in the      energy sector.       Specifically, we support the bill's strengthening of the      CFTC's anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority and its      provision for increased cooperation and liaison between the      CFTC and the FERC. We are also pleased that your legislation      addresses concerns about the oversight and transparency of      electronic trading platforms. It is important that such      facilities, which play a significant price discovery role in      the energy trading markets, be subject to appropriate      reporting and oversight by the CFTC.       However, I also understand that typical over the counter      bilateral trading operations, such as those that operate from      a trading desk where various potential counterparties are      separately contacted by phone or email, are not intended to      be treated as electronic trading facilities under your bill.      This is an important distinction and one that may need      further clarification as the bill proceeds through the      legislative process.       Calpine would like to thank you for your leadership in      advocating reasonable measures to ensure the integrity of      important energy trading markets and we stand ready to      provide you with any information or assistance that you may      need.           Sincerely,                                         Joseph E. Ronan, Jr.,                                            Senior Vice President,     Government and Regulatory Affairs.                                  ____                                         Edison International,                                   Rosemead, CA, February 4, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for asking Edison      International for our views on your Exempt Commodities      Transactions Act, soon to be reintroduced in the 108th      Congress. As you know, Edison shares your concern over      manipulation of the California electricity market by some      market participants, which contributed to the serious      problems the state faced from out-of-control energy prices.      Your legislation would provide transparency in the      electricity derivatives trading market, an industry that is      currently exempted from regulation under the Commodity      Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA).       I support your legislation, with a suggestion for your      consideration to further refine it. Our company and others      use energy derivatives trading to protect and hedge the      revenue from our power plants. This is in contrast to      companies that conduct middleman financial trading with no or      few power plants and trade to make money on financial      arbitrage. There should be guidance in the final language      which recognizes the difference between these two types of      businesses, particularly regarding further capital      requirements. Otherwise companies that trade in order to      hedge physical assets may be required to pay twice--once in      order to obtain capital for the assets and a second time in      order to meet any capital requirements to back their trades.       Thank you again for your efforts on behalf of California      consumers and businesses.           Sincerely,                                               John E. Bryson,                                           Chairman, President and     Chief Executive Officer.                                  ____                              American Public Gas Association,                                    Fairfax, VA, January 22, 2003.     Re amending the Commodities Exchange Act.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Public Gas Association      (APGA) is very pleased that you and Senator Lugar have again      taken the lead to amend the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The      provisions you propose, which amend the CEA, are significant      steps towards ensuring that natural gas prices are determined      in a competitive and informed marketplace. We applaud your      efforts to undo special exclusions and exemptions granted in      the closing hours of the     106th Congress, especially when those exclusions and      exemptions were specifically rejected by the Senate      Agriculture Committee.       The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) plays a      front-line role in promoting a competitive natural gas      marketplace. Closing the gaps that impede effective federal      oversight of the natural gas marketplace is essential in      order to foster competitive commodity futures markets and      protect market users and the public from fraud, manipulation,      and abusive practices. APGA fully supports your provisions to      clarify and restore the CFTC's ability to monitor activity in      off-exchange, or over-the-counter (OTC), derivatives markets      that trade substantial volumes of natural gas derivatives.      Your limited and measured steps ensure a fair balance between      free market activities and the necessary protections from bad      conduct, which undermines the confidence and integrity of      market participants and consumers.       Eliminating those special exclusions and exemptions, which      were already rejected three years ago in the committee of      jurisdiction, will help the CFTC meet its obligation to make      sure that no important trading activities fall between the      cracks leaving some energy markets without a federal agency      with oversight authority. The consumers served by public gas      utilities across the country will benefit from your efforts      because they are less likely to be victimized by activities      that occur in a market where the CFTC exercises oversight.       Again, public gas utilities and the hundreds of communities      that we serve commend you for your thoughtful and deliberate      leadership on this very important issue. While there may be      some who will oppose this amendment, one need not look far to      see whether the opposition is looking out for the best      interests of Wall Street or Main Street. We pledge to work      with you in any way we can to pass this much-needed      amendment. Please let me know how I can assist you.           Sincerely,                                                         Bob Cave,     President.                                  ____                            American Public Power Association,                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the American Public      Power Association (APPA), I want to express support for the      intent and thrust of your legislation entitled the ``Energy      Market Oversight Act'' and to commend you for your leadership      in addressing these important consumer protection issues.       APPA represents the interests of more than 2,000 publicly      owned electric utility systems across the country, serving      approximately 40 million citizens. APPA member utilities      include state public power agencies and municipal electric      utilities that serve some of the nation's largest cities.      However, the vast majority of these publicly owned electric      utilities serve small and medium-sized communities in 49      states, all but Hawaii. In fact, 75 percent of our members      are located in cities with populations of 10,000 people or      less.       It is my understanding that your legislation would provide      the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with      jurisdiction over trading in energy derivatives and other      financial products. APPA is particularly supportive of      language in your bill that would increase the Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission's (FERC) ability to investigate market      manipulation and penalize such behavior.       Some of APPA's members may have concerns regarding the      impact the bill may have on public power, and I look forward      to working with you and your staff in an effort to resolve      these concerns. I would also like to join the California      Municipal Utilities Association (CMUA) in raising an issue      that I believe is consistent with the intent of your bill.      CMUA has attempted to get the California ISO to do a      benchmarking study comparing their costs to other ISOs      throughout the United States. The California ISO has informed      CMUA that they cannot conduct such a study because they      cannot get the information from other ISOs. To address this      problem, while keeping with your bill's goal of increasing      transparency, I would use you to add a provision to the bill      that would require FERC to gather such information as is      necessary from each ISO to compare their cost of services on      an annual basis.       APPA looks forward to working with you and your staff on      this legislation and other issues in the 108th Congress.           Sincerely,                                               Alan H. Richardson,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                 New York Mercantile Exchange,                                                     New York, NY.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As a result of concerns surrounding      the Enron bankruptcy, numerous congressional committees,      regulators, and financial institutions are closely examining      the broad impact of the collapse on American markets,      investors and employees. Much attention has been paid to      corporate governance, financial and accounting standards, and      market practices, with considerable focus on the energy      marketplace. On behalf of the New York Mercantile Exchange,      Inc. (``NYMEX'' or the ``Exchange''), we wish to applaud your      efforts to bring more accountability and greater transparency      to this nation's vitally important energy marketplace.       NYMEX is the world's largest forum for the trading and      clearing of energy futures contracts. As a federally      chartered marketplace, it is overseen by the independent      federal regulatory agency, the Commodity Futures trading      Commission (``CFTC''). NYMEX serves a diverse domestic and      international customer base by bringing price transparency,      market neutrality, competition and efficiency to energy      markets, and provides businesses with the financial tools to      deal with market uncertainty.       After studying your legislative proposal, we have concluded      that it is very worthy of support for the following reasons:       The proposal would refine the definition of trading      facility as applied to energy derivatives markets and would      further require that any such market not otherwise regulated      by the CFTC would be accountable to them.       In addition, the proposal would give the CFTC vitally      important tools to monitor such markets, including large      trader reporting and net capital standards.       The proposal would also ensure that the CFTC has the      authority and ability to obtain access to information      critical to market oversight and to make market information      public to the extent that the Commission determines that it      is in the public interest to do so.       With numerous reports of reduced confidence in market      integrity in the wake of the Enron bankruptcy, never has it      been more important to restore faith in the great American      resource, our competitive markets. S. 517's provisions      relating to addressing regulatory gaps in the CFTC regulatory      ``umbrella'' can provide an important and meaningful      improvement in market oversight, and is an important step in      building faith and confidence in a competitive energy      marketplace.       We strongly support your efforts to enhance market      transparency and accountability, and we look forward to      working with you in this important endeavor.           Sincerely,     Vincent Viola,       Chairman.     J. Robert Collins,       President.                                  ____                                               Southern California                                       Public Power Authority,                                                February 28, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Southern      California Public Power Authority (SCPPA), I would like to      express our support for your proposed legislation, the      ``Energy Market Oversight Act,'' which would provide more      authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)      and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to      oversee the trading in energy derivatives and other financial      transactions and to investigate and punish market      manipulation.       SCPPA is a non-profit, joint action agency formed in 1980      to represent the cities of Anaheim, Azusa, Banning, Burbank,      Cerritos, Colton, Glendale, Los Angeles, Pasadena, Riverside,      and Vernon; and the Imperial Irrigation District. The      community-owned utilities that make up SCPPA's membership      serve approximately five million citizens from northern Los      Angeles County to the Mexican border.       We support the intent of your legislation because we      believe it will enhance safeguards for consumers and foster a      more fully functioning competitive market. As you are well      aware, lack of effective market monitoring and market      transparency combined to allow for manipulation of the      markets, to the extreme detriment of California consumers. We      believe that federal legislation that promotes more effective      monitoring and remedies for fraud and market abuses will      improve the climate for investment in new generation,      increase consumer confidence, and reduce market volatility.       We are encouraged that this legislation increases the civil      and criminal penalties for manipulation, allows for prompt      investigatory action by FERC, and allows for an earlier      refund effective date when rates are not ``just and      reasonable.'' We think these actions will provide an improved      regulatory deterrent, as well as a means for swift and      complete refunds to consumers.       SCPPA commends you for taking a leadership role on these      critical issues and looks forward to working with you to      address a few issues of particular concern to our municipal      utility members.           Sincerely,                                                    Bill Carnahan,     SCPPA Executive Director.                                  ____                                           National Rural Electric                                      Cooperative Association,                                  Arlington, VA, January 29, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I would like to take this      opportunity to express the appreciation of the National Rural      Electric Cooperative Association for our efforts to restore      transparency and integrity to the energy markets. We are      pleased that you have introduced legislation with Senators      Lugar, Harkin, Fitzgerald and others (the Energy Market      Oversight Act) that reestablished the ability of the      Commodity Futures Trading Commission to police all energy      derivatives     markets for fraud and commodity price manipulation.       Today, consumers and investors have little confidence that      the energy markets are operating fairly and for the benefit      of all. Much blame for the current crisis in confidence can      be placed on the so-called ENRON exemption, adopted in 2000,      as part of the legislation that deregulated the over-the-     counter derivatives market for energy commodities.       The legislation created a gap in the regulation of energy      derivatives where price and trade manipulation can occur      unchecked by adequate regulatory oversight. Although the      Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has authority to      prosecute fraud and price manipulation that occurs on the      commodity exchanges, the CFTC has no clear authority to      pursue violations of the Federal anti-fraud and anti-     manipulation laws in the over-the-counter energy market.       Energy derivatives contracts, whether traded on well-     regulated commodities exchanges or in the over-the-counter      market, play an important role in determining the costs and      availability of electricity and other energy products to      consumers. But, consumers suffer when much of the market for      energy derivatives lacks transparency and operates without      accountability for manipulation and fraud, which is the case      for the over-the-counter markets.       Recent headlines underscore the need for this important      legislation. The news has been filed with the indictments of      energy traders for manipulation of the energy markets and      admissions by energy companies that they have engaged in      deceptive market practices, including wash trades on an      unregulated over-the-counter exchange.       Consumer-owned electric co-ops now purchase more than 50%      of their electric power on the market and are exposed to the      risks that an unstable market creates. As the representative      of America's 900 consumer-owned electric co-op utilities, the      NRECA believes that it is vitally important to restore      confidence in the energy markets by ensuring that market      participants have access to reliable and credible      information.       Your legislation represents an important step in creating      more transparent energy markets. I want to thank you for your      leadership on this critical issue and offer the support of      America's electric cooperatives in this effort to restore      credibility to the nation's energy markets. We look forward      to working with you and your staff to improve the legislation      as it moves forward.           Sincerely,                                                    Glenn English,     Chief Executive Officer.                                  ____                                               Washington, DC,                                                 February 7, 2003.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing to express our      support for the Energy Market Oversight Act being offered by      yourself and Senators Lugar, Cantwell and Leahy. This      important legislation will assure that over-the-counter      derivatives markets in ``exempt'' commodities such as energy      will be covered by federal prohibitions on fraud and      manipulation. This regulatory assistance comes at a critical      time. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's      Director of the Office of Market Oversight, ``energy markets      are in severe financial distress.'' Along with the decline in      credit quality in these markets, the loss of confidence and      trust has led to a ruin in the liquidity and depth of these      markets. This legislation will go a long way to address this      problem.       Derivatives are highly leveraged financial transactions,      and this allows investors to potentially take a large      position in the market without committing an equivalent      amount of capital. Moreover, derivatives traded in over-the-     counter markets are devoid of the transparency that      characterizes exchange-traded derivatives such as futures,      and this lack of transparency that characterizes exchange-     traded derivatives such as futures, and this lack of      transparency introduces a greater potential for abuse through      fraud and manipulation.       Derivatives are often combined into highly complex      structured transactions that are difficult--even for seasoned      securities traders and finance professionals--to understand      and price in the market. Enron used such over-the-counter      derivatives extensively in order to hide the nature of their      activities from investors. The failure of Enron and the      demise of other energy derivatives dealers has had a      devastating impact of the level of trust in energy markets.       This legislation would help ensure that over-the-counter      derivatives markets operate with proper federal oversight      which will make the markets more stable and transparent. It      is appropriate to place this oversight authority with the      Commodity Futures Trading Commission which, as the principal      federal regulator of derivatives transactions since its      founding in 1975, will provide oversight, surveillance and      enforcement of anti-fraud and anti-manipulation laws. The      CFTC has the experience to handle these complex financial      transactions and to develop the best rules to implement these      protections. The legislation also requires the cooperation of      the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the entity charged      with overseeing the energy markets, in providing a stable and      honest market for the investing public.       At a time when these energy markets are deeply distressed      and the investing public looks skeptically at derivatives      trading and firms engaged in derivatives trading, we should      take decisive steps to ensure that the public is protected      from Enron-like abuses. This amendment is just such a step,      and we support it.       Thank you for introducing this important legislation.           Sincerely,     Adam J. Goldberg,       Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.     Mark N. Cooper,       Director of Research, Consumer Federation of America.

Randall Dodd,       Director, Derivatives Study Center.                                  ____                                               Transmission Access                                           Policy Study Group,                                                February 25, 2003.     Re Energy Market Oversight Act.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I understand that you will be      introducing shortly a stand-alone bill, entitled The Energy      Market Oversight Act, which is similar to the amendment you      offered last season to S. 517, the Energy Policy Act of 2002.      This bill would, among other things, place derivative      products for energy under the jurisdiction of the Commodities      Future Trading Commission (CFTC), and enhance the Federal      Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) remedial and penal      authority.       On behalf of the Transmission Access Policy Study Group      (TAPS), I would like to express our support for the policy      objective of your proposed legislation: better protecting      consumers from manipulation in the volatile energy markets.      We look forward to working with you to refine the bill as it      moves through the legislative process. Expanding the CFTC and      FERC role in preventing and redressing energy market abuses      is one of a number of avenues for enhanced consumer and      market power protection that should be included if an      electricity title moves forward this year. TAPS      representatives would like to sit down with your staff and      discuss the details of your bill and related matters, when      convenient.       The other key related components of any electricity title      are (i) strong consumer protections, as were offered in the      Cantwell amendment (SA 3234) to the Energy Policy Act of      2002, (ii) expanding FERC's merger review authority as was      done in S. 517, (iii) a strong market transparency      requirement, and (iv) further strengthening FERC powers to      remedy and penalize abuses of market power and market      manipulation. Finally, we would strongly urge you to oppose      repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act this year.      Repealing PUHCA would lead to massive consolidation in the      industry, increasing dramatically opportunities for      manipulation of the market.           Very truly yours,                                                       Roy Thilly,                                                    TAPS Chairman.
