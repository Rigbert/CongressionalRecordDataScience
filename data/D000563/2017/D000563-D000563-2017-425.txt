 The inspiration for this bill was a tragic one. On February 29, 2012, a category F-4 tornado tore through southeastern Illinois, causing major damage in the towns of Harrisburg and Ridgway. Eight people in Harrisburg died in that event and 15 people were killed in total. Winds reached 175 miles per hour. It is not too much of a stretch to say these two small towns were almost wiped off the map.  And just last week, on February 28, 2017, another tragedy struck the small towns of Ottawa and Naplate after a category F-3 tornado tore through North Central Illinois. Two people in Ottawa died in last week's storm and at least 50 homes were damaged or destroyed.  Requests for Federal assistance after a disaster are made by the Governor of each State based on State emergency management damage assessments. In the case of the Harrisburg and Ridgway tornado, the Governor's request for a Federal emergency declaration for individual assistance was denied, as was the State's appeal of that decision. With that denial, individuals whose homes or properties were damaged were precluded from direct Federal help.  When I asked FEMA why it denied the Governor's request, I was told that the disaster did not meet or exceed the State's per capita figure. Currently, FEMA multiplies the number of people in a State by $1.43 to determine a threshold of the amount of damage a State would incur to be considered for Federal assistance. In Illinois, that figure is more than $18 million. In other words, because Illinois is a highly populous State, it is presumed it can absorb the costs of cleanup and recovery from disasters up to more than $18 million.  From 2002 to 2012, Illinois was denied Federal disaster assistance seven times. Texas was denied 13 times. Florida was denied Federal disaster assistance eight times during that period, and California, New Jersey, and New York were each denied four times.  FEMA's formula does not work for large, populous States, particularly those with a concentrated urban area, like Illinois.  Illinois ran into this issue again in November 2013 when tornadoes swept through the State. That time, six people were killed and whole neighborhoods were nearly destroyed. The cities of Washington, Gifford, and New Minden, Illinois, experienced some of the worst tornado damage I have ever seen. Their infrastructure was decimated, but because Illinois did not meet one of FEMA's criteria, we were denied Federal public assistance.  In the case of last week's tornado in Ottawa and Naplate, Illinois, may not even be able to request federal help because damage assessments are too low to reach anything close to FEMA's per capita requirement. But for these small towns, covering losses and cleaning up damage of this magnitude can put a real strain on the community.  The Fairness in Federal Disaster Declaration seeks to improve the disaster analysis by assigning a value to each of the factors FEMA must consider when determining whether Federal disaster assistance will be made available. When it comes to individual assistance--funding to help people repair and rebuild their homes--the breakdown would be as follows:  Concentration of damages--the density of damage in an individual community--would be considered 20 percent of the analysis. Trauma--the loss of life and injuries and the disruption of normal community functions--would be 20 percent. Special Populations--including the age and income of the residents, the amount of home ownership, etc.--would comprise 20 percent. Voluntary agency assistance--a consideration of what the volunteer and charitable groups are providing--would make up 5 percent. The amount of Insurance coverage--20 percent. And average amount of individual assistance by State, which includes the per capita analysis, would make up 5 percent of the analysis.  The bill also would add a seventh consideration to FEMA's metrics--the economics of the area, which will receive 10 percent consideration. This includes factors such as the local assessable tax base, the median income as it compares to that of the State, and the poverty rate as it compares to that of the State.  For Federal public assistance, the breakdown would be similar, with a greater emphasis placed on the localized impacts of the disaster, which would warrant 40 percent of the analysis.  It is reasonable that FEMA should take into consideration the size of the State requesting assistance, but current regulations penalize large States. Assigning values to the factors will help ensure that the damage to a specific community weighs more than a State's population.  Illinois is a geographically large State with a concentrated urban area. And downstate communities are being punished for it.  If the cities of Ottawa and Naplate, Washington and Gifford, and Harrisburg and Ridgway cannot qualify under FEMA's current criteria for Federal assistance, something is wrong. The way FEMA evaluates whether to declare an area Federal disaster is not effective. It is working against small communities in States with large populations.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 600       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
