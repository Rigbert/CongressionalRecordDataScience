 President, I am pleased to hear the majority leader shares my concern that we do not have a fully functioning Federal Election Commission. In fact, yesterday, the Democratic nominee for President called the system broken. Today is another example of the broken system.  This battle has been going on for more than 2 years, believe it or not, starting with the recess appointment of very well-qualified and well-respected experts in this field.
