President, this law firm analyzed the legislation, and their conclusion is, particularly with regard to the Washington area snipers, that their cases will be thrown out.  There are two sections of the law which provide an exemption from the categorical dismissal of these cases. They are section (5)(A)(ii) and (5)(A)(iii). Mr. President, (5)(A)(ii) says:       . . . actions against a seller for ``negligent      entrustment'' or ``negligence per se''. . . .  And (5)(A)(iii) says:       . . . actions against a manufacturer or seller who violated      a statute in the sale or marketing of a firearm or      ammunition, where that statutory violation was a proximate      cause of the plaintiff's injuries. . . .  Their analysis concludes that neither of these exemptions would apply in the case of the Washington area snipers. Those cases are already pending. They will be dismissed, thrown out.  It is interesting because we continue to talk about, well, these exemptions will take care of all these cases, but it turns out that they will not, that the various nuances, the wording, the knowing violation of a statute, for example, the arcane cases of negligence entrustment and negligence per se, which are constructs that only a lawyer could fully appreciate and enjoy, all of this is craftily designed to prevent people from going to court, not to give them a fair right in court.  Again, it goes down not to these nuances, to this legal terminology but simple common sense. How can one stand up and say this legislation is designed to protect and insulate injury from the wanton acts of these third party criminals and then also say but, by the way, all of these cases will still go through?  I suspect there are things we could do right now to help these cases go through. ``Dismissal of pending actions'' could be struck. Clearly, that would suggest that the sniper cases would be in order because this legislation is not retroactive.  The thrust is not to give people rights; it is to take them away. It is to protect this one industry at the expense of individual Americans. The legislation is unusually preferential to a small interest group. It defies my understanding of why we would try to protect this industry, which is not financially at risk by their own admissions, at the expense of individual Americans who have been harmed.  I conclude by saying I never met Conrad Johnson, but like all of us in this Chamber, I woke up one morning and read about a bus driver reading his paper, waiting to go to work. I, frankly, thought of my father, who was a school custodian who got up in the morning, read the paper, getting ready to go to work.  He was shot reading that paper, killed. He left a wife and small children. That wife and that family have gone to court to say: Where is our justice? Maybe somebody will be convicted for doing something wrong, but how are we going to live for the next 40 or 50 years? People have been negligent--at least we think they have. There is a Bull's Eye Shooters store that lost 238 weapons and was cited 15 times by the ATF. They are not going to have a day in court to answer to Mrs. Johnson? I cannot understand this legislation.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                                February 11, 2004.       Dear Senator: As active and retired law enforcement      officers, we are writing to urge your strong opposition to S.      659, the so-called ``Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms      Act.'' This bill would strip away the legal rights of gun      violence victims, including law enforcement officers and      their families, to seek redress against irresponsible gun      dealers and manufacturers.       The impact of this bill on the law enforcement community is      well illustrated by the lawsuit brought by former Orange, New      Jersey police officers Ken McGuire and David Lemongello. On      January 12, 2001, officers McGuire and Lemongello were      seriously wounded in a shoot-out with a burglary suspect. The      Ruger pistol used by the suspect was one of twelve guns sold      by a West Virginia pawnshop, Will's Jewelry and Loan, to a      ``straw purchaser'' for a gun trafficker. The all-cash sale,      for thousands of dollars, was so obviously suspicious that      Will's reported it to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and      Firearms, but only after the sale was consummated. The      pawnshop had every reason to believe that, as soon as the      guns left its premises, they would be sold into the      underground market, destined to threaten the lives of police      officers and ordinary citizens.       Officers McGuire and Lemongello are pursuing legal action      against Will's for negligent sales practices and against the      gun's manufacturer, Sturm, Ruger, for distributing guns      without requiring its dealers to adhere to a code of      responsible business practices that would prevent such      obvious sales to gun traffickers. A West Virginia judge      recently ruled that the officers' suit against Will's and      Sturm, Ruger is well-grounded in West Virginia law and should      be heard by a jury. If passed into law, S. 659 would override      this decision and deprive these brave officers of their day      in court.       Police officers like Ken McGuire and David Lemongello put      their lives on the line every day to protect the public.      Instead of honoring them for their service, S. 659 would      deprive them of their basic rights as American citizens to      prove their case in a court of law. We stand with officers      McGuire and Lemongello in urging you to oppose this bill.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2                                Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP,                                    Armonk, NY, February 17, 2004.     Re opinion letter concerning proposed immunity legislation          for gun dealers and manufacturers.     Michael Barnes,     President, The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Barnes: At your request, this letter addresses the      legal implications of the proposed gun dealer and      manufacturer immunity legislation, focusing specifically on      the impact of the legislation on the pending civil lawsuit      brought by the victims of the Washington, DC area sniper      attacks in the fall of 2002. For the reasons discussed below,      it is our judgment that the passage of S. 1805--the current      version of the immunity bill, which incorporates the so-     called ``Daschle Amendments''--would require the immediate      dismissal of the sniper victims' claims against the parties      who supplied the assault rifle used in the attacks. We      further conclude that the legislation would effect far-     reaching, and unprecedented, changes in the law that would      insulate the gun industry from other important pending cases      as well as future accountability.       After providing a brief background concerning the sniper      victims' civil suit and the proposed legislation, we analyze      the impact of the legislation on the pending sniper case. We      then offer some more general observations about the proposed      legislation, including a discussion of its implications for      other significant cases against gun dealers and      manufacturers.                               backgroundI. The sniper victims' legal claims against the dealer and manufacturer                     who supplied the snipers' weapon       For over a month in the fall of 2002, John Allen Muhammad      and Lee Boyd Malvo terrorized the nation's capital and its      surrounding states through a series of sniper attacks on      innocent men, women, and children. From the trunk of      Muhammad's car, the snipers used a deadly-accurate assault      rifle to kill thirteen people, and to seriously injure      another six, in Washington, DC, Maryland, Virginia, Alabama,      Louisiana and Georgia. Among the snipers' victims were a 47-     year-old FBI analyst who was loading a car with her husband      in a Home Depot parking lot, a 72-year-old retired carpenter      who was waiting on a street corner, and a 13-year-old boy who      had just been dropped off at school. Muhammad and Malvo were      apprehended on October 24, 2002, and have since been      convicted for their crimes.       The weapon that Muhammad and Malvo used in the sniper      attacks was a Bushmaster     XM-15 E2S .223 semi-automatic rifle equipped with a bipod and      telescopic sight. The snipers obtained the ``one shot, one      kill'' assault weapon they used in the shootings from Bull's      Eye Shooter Supply in Tacoma, Washington, even though the law      prohibited either of them from purchasing any firearm.      Muhammad was under a domestic violence protective order, and      Malvo was both a juvenile and an illegal alien. Bull's Eye      representatives claim not to have any record of sale for the      weapon and cannot account for how the snipers obtained the      assault rifle.       The publicly-available evidence reveals that in addition to      permitting the snipers' weapon to disappear from its shop,      Bull's Eye Shooter Supply engaged in numerous irresponsible      business practices:       Large Number of Missing Guns. Bull's Eye could not account      for a total of 238 guns that were missing from its inventory      when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives      (``AFT'') inspected the gun dealer in 2000 and 2002. Bull's      Eye's missing gun rate was greater than at least 99.73% of      all federal firearms licensees; 80% of dealers who sell at      least 50 firearms per year can provide records to account for      every one of their gun sales.       Large Number of Crime Guns. Between 1997 and 2001, Bull's      Eye guns were involved in at least 52 crimes, including      homicides, kidnappings, and assaults, placing Bull's Eye in      the top 1% of all dealers nationwide in the supply of guns      used in crimes. That same 1% of gun stores supplies the      weapons traced to 57% of all gun crimes.       Quick Time-to-Crime. The ``time-to-crime'' was less than 3      years for more than 70% of Bull's Eye guns that were used in      crimes between 1997 and 2001. Quick time-to-crime is      considered a ``red flag'' for problem gun dealers because it      indicates that such dealers' guns are quickly getting into      criminal hands through illegal trafficking. In 2000, the      nationwide median time-to-crime was 6\1/2\ years, and the      time-to-crime was under 3 years for only 31% of traced crime      guns. The time-to-crime for the snipers' weapon--which was      received by Bull's Eye in July 2002--was under 3 months.       Large Number of Multiple Firearm Sales. Between 1997 and      2000, Bull's Eye sold 663 guns to 265 individual buyers, as      many as 10 guns at a time. Such ``multiple firearms sales''      are considered to be another indicator that a gun dealer may      be selling to gun traffickers.       Numerous ATF Citations. ATF cited Bull's Eye for violations      at least 15 times between 1997 and 2001, and, following the      sniper attacks, revoked the license of Bull's Eye's former      owner.       Following ATF's revocation of his license, Bull's Eye's      former owner transferred ownership of the store to a close      friend. Bull's Eye continues to operate today, and the      store's former owner retains ownership of the property and      operates a shooting range in the same building.       The manufacturer of the snipers' murder weapon of choice,      Bushmaster Firearms, Inc. of Maine, not only modeled its XM-     15 rifle after military-style assault weapons that Congress      outlawed with the Assault Weapons Ban in 1994, but also      marketed the rifle as an assault weapon designed for sniper      activity. At the time, Bushmaster selected and used Bull's      Eye as one of its sixty distributors nationwide despite      numerous ``warning signs'' concerning Bull's Eye's handling      of its firearms inventory. Bushmaster also allegedly failed      to take certain basic precautions concerning the guns it      shipped to Bull's Eye and others, including, among other      things, declining the Justice Department's offer to assist      Bushmaster in tracing guns that had been used in crimes in      order to determine which of its dealers were supplying such      guns; neglecting to require Bull's Eye to adopt any of ATF's      suggested measures for preventing gun thefts; and failing to      require Bull's Eye to notify it of gun trace requests      initiated by law enforcement agencies or to certify its      compliance with firearms laws and regulations. Even after the      sniper attacks, Bushmaster, through its vice president of      administration, referred to Bull's Eye as ``a good customer''      to whom Bushmaster would continue to sell guns.       Victims of the sniper attacks and the families of victims      who were killed have filed a civil lawsuit in Washington      State Court against Bull's Eye Shooter Supply and Bushmaster      Firearms for their roles in permitting the snipers to access      their murder weapon. According to the complaint: ``In      addition to the intentional acts of Muhammad and Malvo, the      gross negligence of the gun industry defendants caused the      injuries and deaths that resulted from the sniper shootings      by enabling prohibited purchasers Muhammad and Malvo to      obtain the Bushmaster assault rifle to wreak havoc on      innocent persons.'' Specifically with respect to Bull's Eye,      the plaintiffs claim that the gun dealer's grossly      irresponsible business practices routinely permitted guns,      including the snipers' weapon, to disappear from its store.      They further claim that ``Bushmaster deliberately continued      to utilize Bull's Eye as a Bushmaster gun dealer and supplied      it with as many guns as Bull's Eye wanted, despite years of      audits by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and      Explosives showing that Bull's Eye had scores of      missing guns.'' At the heart of plaintiffs' Complaint is      their allegation that if Bull's Eye and Bushmaster had      ``acted responsibly in the sale of their guns, Muhammad      and Malvo would not have been able to obtain the assault      rifle they needed to carry out the shootings.''       On June 27, 2003, Washington Superior Court Judge Frank E.      Cuthbertson upheld the sniper victims' claims against the      defendants' motion to dismiss, concluding that the      plaintiffs' negligence and public nuisance claims were      actionable against both Bull's Eye and Bushmaster. Johnson v.      Bulls Eye Shooter Supply,  No. 03-2-03932-8, 2003 WL 21639244      (Wash. Super. Ct. June 27, 2003). The court found that the      plaintiffs' claims against Bull's Eye could stand based on      ``a common law duty in Washington to use reasonable care in      the sale and distribution of firearms''; that the ``facts in      the present case indicate that a high degree of risk of harm      to plaintiffs was created by Bull's Eye Shooter Supply's      allegedly reckless or incompetent conduct in distributing      firearms''; and that the facts alleged ``demonstrate an      arguably unbroken nexus between the loss of the assault rifle      and the injuries of the plaintiffs.'' The Court further      concluded that the plaintiffs' claims against Bushmaster      should be permitted to reach a jury based on Bushmaster's      entrusting firearms to Bull's Eye even though Bushmaster      allegedly ``knew or should have known that Bull's Eye Shooter      Supply was operating its store in a reckless or incompetent      manner, creating an unreasonable risk of harm.'' Trial in the      case against Bull's Eye and Bushmaster has been set for      November 2004.II. The proposed immunity legislation for gun dealers and manufacturers       On April 9, 2003, the House of Representatives passed a      bill (H.R. 1036) to provide sweeping immunity from pending      and future lawsuits to distributors, dealers, manufacturers,      and importers of firearms and ammunition. Senator Larry Craig      (R-ID) introduced companion legislation in the Senate (S.      659), which, last October, was modified to incorporate      certain amendments that had been proposed by Minority Leader      Tom Daschle (D-SD). The current version of the immunity bill      (S. 1805), which incorporates the so-called ``Daschle      Amendments,'' is expected to be considered by the Senate in      the first week of March 2004.       According to its terms, S. 1805 would foreclose--and      require the immediate dismissal of--any state or federal      ``qualified civil liability action,'' Sec. 3(a), which the      statute defines to include any ``civil action brought by any      person against any manufacturer or seller'' of firearms or      ammunition ``for damages resulting from the criminal or      unlawful misuse'' of such products. Sec. 4(5)(A). From this      blanket prohibition on such civil actions, section 4(5)(A) of      the proposed bill carves out the following exclusive list of      circumscribed exceptions:       (i) actions against a manufacturer or seller who has been      criminally convicted of transferring a firearm with the      knowledge that it would be used to commit a violent or drug-     trafficking crime, if the plaintiff was directly harmed by      the conduct of which the recipient of the firearm has also      been criminally convicted;       (ii) actions against a seller for ``negligent entrustment''      or ``negligence per se'';       (iii) actions against a manufacturer or seller who violated      a statute in the sale or marketing of a firearm or      ammunition, where that statutory violation was a proximate      cause of the plaintiff's injuries;       (iv) actions for breach of contract or warranty in      connection with the purchase of a firearm or ammunition; and       (v) actions for physical injuries or property damages      resulting directly from a design or manufacturing defect in a      firearm or ammunition, when such items have been used as      intended or in a ``reasonably foreseeable'' manner (as that      term is defined in the bill).       Because S. 1805 expressly disclaims any intention to create      causes of actions or remedies, see Sec. 4(5)(D), the above-     described exceptions would only preserve civil claims brought      under otherwise applicable state or federal law. Other than      as specifically preserved by these exceptions, however, the      proposed legislation would preempt, as a matter of federal      law, any state or federal lawsuits against irresponsible      sellers or manufacturers of firearms or ammunition.                                analysisI. The proposed immunity legislation would likely require the immediate                 dismissal of the sniper victims' claims       Close examination of the exceptions enumerated in section 4      of the proposed immunity legislation reveals that none would      appear to preserve the claims brought by the victims of the      sniper attacks and their families against the parties      responsible for permitting the snipers to obtain their murder      weapon. In fact, the passage of S. 1805 would likely compel      the judge in the sniper case immediately to dismiss those      claims. The following analysis focuses on paragraphs      (5)(A)(ii) and (5)(A)(iii) of the proposed legislation      because those provisions contain the only exceptions that      could even conceivably apply to the sniper case. A. The Statutory Violation Exception Embodied in Paragraph (5)(A)(ii)                 Will Not Save the Sniper Victims' Claims       Section 4, paragraph (5)(A)(ii) of the proposed legislation      preserves an ``action in which a manufacturer or seller of a      qualified product violated a State or Federal statute      applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the      violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief      is sought. . . .'' According to well-settled tort law      principles, proximate cause requires that a defendant's      conduct was ``a substantial factor     in bringing about the harm'' suffered by the plaintiff. See      Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 431 (2003); accord      Derdiarian v. Felix Contracting Corp., 414 N.E.2d 666, (N.Y.      1980); Anderson v. Duncan, 968 P.2d 440, 442 (Wyo. 1998).      Where a defendant's statutory violation was not a requirement      to reject claims based on that violation. See, e.g., Fox v.      Bartholf, 374 So. 2d 294, 296 (Ala. 1979) (affirming summary      judgment for defendants where there was no evidence that      truck driver's alleged violation of statute, which prescribed      lawful speed in approaching highway intersections when      driver's view is obstructed, proximately caused plaintiff's      injury); Yates v. Shackelford, 784 N.E.2d 330, 336-37 (Ill.      App. Ct. 2002) (affirming summary judgment for defendants      where defendant driver's violation of left-shoulder parking      ban did not proximately cause collision); Travelers Indem.      Co. of Ill. v. 28 East 70th St. Constr. Co., No. 01 Civ. 3001      (JGK), 2003 WL 23018604 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2003) (granting      defendant's motion for summary judgment where alleged failure      to stamp pipe with manufacturer's identification number in      violation of building code ``clearly did not proximately      cause the pipe to freeze and burst'').       The plain language of paragraph (5)(A)(ii) would appear to      dictate the same result in the sniper case. Despite the      above-discussed evidence of Bull's Eye numerous failings as a      gun dealer, there is no reason to believe that the plaintiffs      in the sniper case will be able to show that Bull's Eye      violated any state or federal statute with respect to the      particular gun that was used by the snipers or that any such      statutory violation was a proximate cause of the sniper      attacks. The evidence concerning the acquisition of the      snipers' weapon supports Bull's Eye's claim that Lee Boyd      Malvo shoplifted the gun. Indeed, after this arrest, Malvo      admitted that he shoplifted the weapon from Bull's Eye in the      summer of 2002. Although the plaintiffs claim that Bull's      Eye's lax security practices permitted Malvo to acquire the      weapon, such proof would not establish a violation of any      state of federal statute.       Of course, the plaintiffs in the sniper case could attempt      to shoehorn Bull's Eye's failure to report the theft of the      snipers' weapon into the illustration provided in      subparagraph (A)(iii)(I), which covers ``any case in which      the manufacturer or seller knowingly made any false entry in,      or failed to make appropriate entry in, any record required      to be kept under Federal or State law.'' Federal law requires      licensed gun dealers to report the loss or theft of a firearm      ``within 48 hours after the theft or loss is discovered.'' 18      U.S.C. Sec. 923(g)(6). The difficulty with this argument,      however, is that Bull's Eye has denied that it knew the gun      was missing until the sniper suspects were apprehended and      authorities had traced the gun to the shop, and there is no      known evidence to refute that claim. (Bull's Eye in fact      reported the missing gun to authorities on November 5, 2002.)      Given Bull's Eye's claim, and the fact that the sniper      shootings were over by the time Bull's Eye's federal      reporting requirement would have been triggered by its      discovery that the weapon was missing, it appears unlikely      that the plaintiffs will be able to avoid dismissal based on      subparagraph (A)(iii)(I). B. The Negligent Entrustment/Negligence Per Se Exceptions Embodied in      Paragraph (5)(A)(ii) Will Not Save the Sniper Victims' Claims       Nor is it likely that the exceptions embodied in paragraph      (5)(A)(ii) of section 4--which covers actions ``brought      against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence per      se''--would save the plaintiffs' civil claims against Bull's      Eye and Bushmaster in the sniper case. As an initial matter,      because the subparagraph (A)(ii) exceptions are specifically      limited to a ``seller'' and, as defined in paragraph (6),      seller does not include firearm manufacturers, the exceptions      would not even apply to the claims against Bushmaster.      Moreover, as explained below, the plaintiffs' claims against      Bull's Eye would not appear to fall within the narrow      ``negligent entrustment'' and ``negligence per se''      exceptions of S. 1805.                        1. Negligent entrustment       For purposes of applying paragraph (5)(A)(ii), the proposed      legislation provides the following definitions of ``negligent      entrustment'': ``the supplying of a qualified product by a      seller for use by another person when the seller knows, or      should know, the person to whom the product is supplied is      likely to, and does, use the product in a manner involving      unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or      others.'' Sec. 4(5)(B). In light of the evidence that Malvo      shoplifted the snipers' weapon from Bull's Eye, the      plaintiffs in the sniper case will face significant obstacles      qualifying for that statutory exception.       Courts have repeatedly rejected negligent entrustment      claims absent evidence that the defendant acted affirmatively      in entrusting--or, in the words of paragraph (5)(A)(ii),      ``supplying''--the dangerous instrumentality in question. See      Butler v. Warren, 582 S.E.2d 530, 532-33 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003)      (affirming summary judgment against plaintiff's negligent      entrustment claim where evidence did not permit finding that      defendants had allowed their truck to be driven off their      property); Mackey v. Dorsey, 655 A.2d 1333, 1338 (Md. Ct.      Spec. App. 1995) (affirming trial court's finding that      defendant was ``not liable for negligent entrustment''; ``We      find it axiomatic that when a vehicle is stolen, as it was      here, the owner cannot be said to have supplied, entrusted,      or `made available' his or her vehicle. The `making      available' of the chattel requires that the supplier do so      knowingly or with the intent to supply the chattel to that      person.''); Kingrey v.

Although courts throughout the country have recognized      separate claims for the negligent storage or security of      firearms, see, e.g., Heck v. Stoffer, 786 N.E.2d 265, 268-70      (Ind. 2003); Gallara v. Koskovich, 836 A.2d 840, 851 (N.J.      Super. Ct. Law Div. 2003); Long v. Turk, 962 P.2d 1093, 1097      (Kan. 1998); Pavlides v.

App. 1985), such claims would be      foreclosed by the proposed immunity legislation.       Furthermore, the narrow definition of ``negligent      entrustment'' in the proposed statute would likely prevent      the plaintiffs from relying on that exception for yet another      reason. The evidence that the snipers' weapon was shoplifted      from Bull's Eye would appear to preclude the plaintiffs from      making the requisite showing under the statute that the gun      shop knew or should have known that the recipient of the gun      (i.e., Malvo) was likely to use the product in a criminal or      otherwise unreasonably dangerous manner.                          2. Negligence per se       The proposed immunity bill does not define ``negligence per      se,'' but to the extent that the negligent per se exception      in paragraph (5)(A)(ii) would permit the survival of state      causes of action, it will not assist the plaintiffs in the      sniper case: the negligence per se doctrine has been      abrogated by statute in Washington State. See RCWA 5.40.050;      Morse v. Antonellis, 70 P.3d 125, 126 (Wash. 2003); see also      Pettit v. Dwoskin, 68 P.3d 1088, 1091-92 (Wash. Ct. App.      2003) (``But the doctrine of negligence per se is no longer      viable in Washington. Rather, violation of a legal      requirement is evidence of negligence.'').       In any event, the negligence per se exception would not      preserve the sniper case because even where that doctrine is      recognized, it requires a violation of a statute or      regulation that is the proximate cause of the plaintiff's      injury. See 57A. Am. Jur. 2d Negligence Sec. 728 (2003);      O'Guin v. Bingham County, 72 P.3d 849, 856 (Idaho 2003);      Elder v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co., 479 So. 2d 1243, 1248      (Ala. 1985). As discussed above, however, it is doubtful that      the plaintiffs in the sniper case will be able to establish      that any such violation was a substantial factor in causing      their injuries.II. The proposed immunity legislation would overturn well-settled legal           principles and jeopardize other important gun cases       The proposed immunity legislation would have far-reaching      implications beyond its likely direct and immediate effect on      the pending civil case brought by the snipers' victims. The      statute would accord gun dealers and manufacturers an      unprecedented immunity. Indeed, under the statute, dealers      and manufacturers of lethal weapons would receive insulation      from lawsuits to which the sellers and makers of virtually      every other product (including even toy guns) would be      subject. As discussed herein, the legislation would close      courtroom doors nationwide to any claims arising out of,      among other things, the negligent security or storage      practices of any gun dealer or manufacturer, the negligent      sale of guns by and dealer to so-called ``straw purchasers''      for illegal gun traffickers, and the negligent failure of any      gun manufacturer to include basic safety devices that would      have prevented tortious or criminal shootings.       The implications of the sweeping immunity proposed for the      gun industry are further compounded by the fact that the      industry is already largely exempt from federal     regulations that apply to the manufacture and distribution of      other products. Guns were specifically exempted from the      jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which      Congress created in 1972 to protect the public from consumer      product injuries. Even ATF--which licenses and oversees gun      dealers--lacks any authority to establish manufacturing or      distribution standards for firearms.       Focusing exclusively on criminal and other statutory      prohibitions, supporters of the proposed immunity legislation      have argued that the bill would simply eliminate lawsuits      against gun dealers and manufacturers who ``have not broken      the law.'' But this oversimplified view ignores the pivotal      role that state and federal common law plays in promoting      public safety and accountability, in addition to ensuring      compensation for the victims of dangerous and irresponsible      conduct. Beyond criminal and other statutory proscriptions on      such conduct, civil common law has long protected the public      by holding businesses and individuals alike to a standard of      reasonable care in all their activities. The broad insulation      from suit promised by the immunity legislation would largely      free the makers and sellers of deadly weapons from such      generally applicable common law standards.       Nor does the fact that gun injuries often result from      criminal acts provide a legal justification for the immunity      legislation. It has long been a settled principle of tort law      that an intervening act of a third party, even if criminal      (e.g., a sniper shooting), will not break the causal chain      from a party's negligence (e.g., the negligent distribution      of the murder weapon) to a plaintiff's injury so long as the      intervening act was reasonably foreseeable. See, e.g., Largo      Corp. v. Crespin, 727 P.2d 1098, 1103 (Colo. 1986) (en banc);      Vining v. Avis Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc., 354 So.2d 54, 55-56      (Fla. 1977); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 302B      (2003) (``An act or an omission may be negligent if the actor      realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable      risk of harm to another through the conduct of the other or a      third person which is intended to cause harm, even though      such conduct is criminal.''). As Judge Cuthbertson correctly      recognized in the sniper case, where a defendant handles a      lethal weapon in an irresponsible manner, through which      criminals and other prohibited persons may access it and      use it to commit dangerous crimes, the question of whether      there is an adequate causal link between the tortfeasor's      conduct and the resulting injuries is for a jury to      decide. Johnson, 2003 WL 21639244, at *3-4.       In addition to the sniper case, the proposed immunity would      likely require the dismissal of several other important cases      that seek to hold allegedly reckless gun dealers and      manufacturers responsible for their conduct, including:       Hernandez ex rel. Guzman v. Kahr Arms, Civ. Act. No.      WOCV2002-01747 (Mass Super. Ct. 2003). Danny Guzman was shot      and killed with a nine millimeter handgun, one of several      guns that had been stolen and resold by employees of the Kahr      Arms factory. According to the lawsuit filed by the      decedent's family, defendant Kahr Arms employed a number of      convicted criminals and drug addicts because it did not      conduct general or criminal background checks on its      employees and did not test prospective or existing employees      for drugs. To make matters worse, the plaintiffs allege that      Kahr Arms did nothing to prevent employees from leaving its      plant with guns--which Kahr touted as ``the smallest,      flattest, most reliable full power compact handguns made''--     even before they had been stamped with serial numbers,      rendering them virtually untraceable. Among the plaintiffs'      other claims, Kahr Arms had no metal detectors, x-ray      machines, security cameras, or security guards; did not check      employees at the end of their shifts; did not use any      inventory-tracking system to determine when weapons or parts      were missing; and could not account for approximately 16      outgoing shipments of weapons that never arrived at their      intended destinations between February 1998 and February      1999. On April 7, 2003, the Massachusetts Superior Court      upheld the plaintiffs' negligence and public nuisance claims      against Kahr Arms' motion to dismiss. The Guzman's family's      right to sue Kahr Arms would be immediately revoked if the      proposed immunity legislation were to pass. As in the sniper      case, the claims against Kahr Arms involve irresponsible      security for deadly weapons, claims that would be foreclosed      by the proposed immunity legislation. First, the plaintiffs'      claims of negligent security against Kahr Arms do not involve      any statutory violation. Moreover, the negligent entrustment      exception would not apply to Kahr Arms for the dual reasons      that it is a firearm manufacturer and that it did not entrust      any weapon to Danny Guzman's shooter.       Lemongello v. Will Company, No. Civ.A. 02-C-2952, 2003 WL      21488208 (W. Va. Cir. Ct. Mar. 19, 2003). New Jersey Policy      Detective David Lemongello and Officer Kenneth McGuire were      seriously injured in January 2001 when they were shot by a      career criminal while performing undercover police work. Even      though the shooter was a person prohibited by law from      purchasing a firearm, he obtained his weapon, a nine      millimeter semi-automatic Ruger handgun, illegally from a gun      trafficker. The trafficker, in turn, was also prohibited from      buying weapons due to a prior felony, so he used an      accomplice (a so-called ``straw purchaser'') to make multiple      gun purchases from defendant Will Jewelry & Loan, in West      Virginia. In their lawsuit against Will Jewelry & Loan and      others, the officers allege that the gun dealer acted      negligently in selling the straw purchaser twelve guns      (including the Ruger used in the shooting of the      two officers) that had been selected in person by the gun      trafficker and paid for in a single cash transaction. The      circumstances of that sale were so suspect that the      defendant dealer reported it to the ATF--but only after      the purchase price had been collected and the guns had      left the store. The officers' suit further charges gun      manufacturer Sturm Ruger & Company with negligently      failing to monitor and train its distributors and dealers      and negligently failing to prevent them from engaging in      straw and multiple firearm sales. Although a West Virginia      trial court has held that the plaintiffs have stated valid      negligence and public nuisance claims under state law, the      proposed immunity legislation would require the immediate      dismissal of those claims. Notwithstanding the plaintiffs'      claims that the defendants failed to exercise reasonable      care in their sales of firearms, neither the dealer nor      the manufacturer violated any statutory prohibition in      selling the guns. Nor could the plaintiffs contend that      their case falls within the ``negligent entrustment''      exception to the proposed immunity legislation because the      gun dealer supplied the firearm to a straw purchaser--not      to someone whom the seller knew or should have known was      likely to, and did, use the product in a manner involving      unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or      others.       Smith v. Bryco Arms, 33 P.3d 638 (N.M. Ct. App.), cert.      denied, 34 P.3d 610 (N.M. 2001). Fourteen-year-old Sean Smith      was seriously injured when a friend accidentally shot him in      the mouth with a .22 caliber handgun, the Bryco J-22. The      shooter believed the gun was unloaded because the ammunition      magazine had been removed; the gun failed to reveal the      hidden bullet in its chamber. Sean Smith's parents sued the      manufacturer (Bryco Arms) and the distributor (Jennings      Firearms) of the J-22 alleging negligence and products      liability claims based on the defendants' failure to      incorporate any of the various available safety features that      would have prevented the accidental shooting, including an      internal ``magazine-out safety'' lock, a ``chamber load      indicators,'' or a written warning on the gun alerting users      that the J-22 could fire even with its magazine removed.      Reversing a lower court decision, the New Mexico Court of      Appeals has held that the defendants could be held liable for      their failure to incorporate long-known, available, and      economically feasible safety devices in the J-22. The      proposed immunity legislation, however, would require the      immediate dismissal of these claims because the shooting of      Sean Smith, even if accidental, constituted an ``unlawful      misuse'' of the J-22, thereby removing the case from the      statutory exception ostensibly intended for cases involving      gun design or manufacturing defects. See Sec. Sec. 4(5)(A)(v)      (preserving ``an action for physical injuries or property      damage resulting directly from a defect in design or      manufacture of the product, when used as intended or in a      manner that is reasonably foreseeable'') & 4(5)(C) (defining      '`reasonably foreseeable'' for purposes of paragraph 5(A)(v)      to exclude ``any criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified      product, other than possessory offenses''). Indeed, given the      fact that virtually any shooting of a person would constitute      a ``criminal or unlawful misuse'' of a firearm, the immunity      legislation would effectively eliminate most claims arising      out of the defective design or manufacture of a firearm.       By preventing these cases, and future cases like them, from      proceeding against irresponsible gun dealers and      manufacturers, the proposed immunity legislation would      undermine the incentives that encourage reasonable business      practices in the gun industry, thereby inevitably failing to      deter avoidable gun injuries and fatalities.       In sum, the proposed legislation would insulate gun dealers      and manufacturers from the obligations to act reasonably and      in good faith that every other business has. If the      legislation were to pass, sellers of products that are among      the most dangerous products would have the least obligation      to act reasonably.       For all of the above reasons, it is our judgment that the      passage of S. 1805 would require the immediate dismissal of      the pending civil case against the gun dealer and      manufacturer who supplied the snipers' murder weapon as well      as other significant cases against gun dealers and      manufacturers. Furthermore, by providing the gun industry      with unprecedented immunity from common law claims directed      at those who engage in irresponsible and dangerous business      practices, the proposed legislation would further insulate      the sellers and manufacturers of deadly weapons from public      accountability for such conduct.           Sincerely,     David Boies.     Sean Eskovitz.
