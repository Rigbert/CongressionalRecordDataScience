According to their constitution, as the Speaker of their Parliament, Bronislaw Komorowski assumed the office of President. And we can see through the magic of television thousands of Poles paying their respects to their lost President and First Lady in front of the Presidential Palace, and it's all peaceful in that great liberty loving land of Poland. And as the gentleman from Indiana has well stated, freedom-loving people who saw their nation wiped off the map of Europe for over a hundred years and then during World War II their nation partitioned and then the great struggle that they endured beginning with labor strikes during the 1950s in places like Poznan to begin to try to roll back that Iron Curtain, we are just so proud to be an ally of this great Nation of Poland.  I yield to the fine Member from Arizona, Congressman Trent Franks, a leader in defense issues and so many other issues, who has come to the floor tonight to pay tribute.
