Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this Titanic Gingrich stall proceeding and the previous question as well as the rule.  Mr. Speaker, throughout the recent history of the Rules Committee, no other major issue has ever been subjected to such a convoluted process as campaign finance reform is being accorded;  By proposing no less than 11 substitutes, and currently considering nearly 600 amendments, a ``doomsday'' scenario is being presented to the American people;  Previously, the Republican leadership blocked reform efforts, made promises for floor action and reneged and delayed, brought up meaningless legislation on the suspension calendar and made a mockery of the House. Today, the effort now is to kill reform by overloading the process;  The Republican leadership is proposing an endless debate that will take us well into the summer, will result in no resolution, and will fail to bring about much needed reform;  As our colleague Joe Moakley has said, ``We'll just go through a lot of motion and not get any action.''                [From the Washington Post, May 21, 1998]  Raft of Campaign Finance Reform Plans May Mean Lengthy House Debate                            (By Helen Dewar)       Rival camps in the fight over campaign finance legislation      got the official go-ahead yesterday for a free-for-all on the      issue in the House that could last well into summer.       Under a procedure approved by the Rules Committee after a      lengthy hearing, the House will begin debate today on a dozen      plans, including alternative proposals to ban or sharply      curtail the unregulated ``soft money'' donations to political      parties at the heart of fund-raising abuses in the 1996      presidential campaign.       No votes are anticipated until after Congress returns from      its Memorial Day recess, and still to be determined by the      committee is the problem of how to deal with an extraordinary      load of amendments, including 586 that have been filed so      far.       Never in the history of the Rules Committee has it faced      such a formidable load of amendments, said committee Chairman      Gerald B.H. Solomon R-N.Y.), who promised to prune the list      to manageable proportions over the recess. He dismissed some      lawmakers' complaints that the process could take all summer.      ``It could but it won't,'' he said. Without interruption, the      bill could be wound up in four days, he added.       Only a couple of months ago, House Republican leaders      resorted to extraordinary means to block votes on the leading      proposals, including a total soft-money ban proposed by Reps.      Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.)      and a somewhat less stringent alternative proposed by a      bipartisan group of freshmen.       But their tactics created an uproar, and, in order to keep      from losing control of the House on the issue, GOP leaders      did a sudden about-face and opted for a wide-open process      providing for votes on a multitude of plans and even more      numerous amendments to them.       As a result, the reform groups, once united in opposition      to the leaders' tactics, are competing against each other,      raising the possibility that none of the plans would get      enough votes for passage--or that all of them would get      bogged down in a struggle over amendments.       Now it was Democratic leaders, as well as their Republican      counterparts, who were getting caught in the squeeze.      Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), who has been      pushing for the Shays-Meehan bill, raised some hackles at a      Democratic caucus Tuesday night when, according to several      observers, he acknowledge without apparent disapproval that      some Democrats would also support the freshmen's bill.       At yesterday's hearing, several lawmakers expressed concern      that the debate might be stretched out over weeks, with      interruptions for other business, making it little more than      ``filler'' to plug into open spaces in the schedule. Several      also objected to allowing amendments to each of the plans as      they come up for votes, instead of holding them in reserve      for action on the final version, saying this could lead to      lethal delays. ``We'll just go through a lot of motion and      not [get] any action,'' said Rep. Joe Moakley (Mass.),      ranking the committee's ranking Democrat.                                  ____                   [From the Roll Call, May 21, 1998]                          Congress Inside Out                        (By Norman J. Ornstein)     message to members: look beyond rhetoric before voting on cfr       Campaign reform is back--for an extended debate in the      House. The ``strange bedfellows'' coalition that Sen. Mitch      McConnell (R-Ky) pulled together for the Senate debate on      campaign reform is alive and well--from the National Right to      Life Committee (NRLC) and the National Rifle Association to      the ACLU.       Encouraged by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) and      McConnell crony Rep. Anne Northup (R-Ky), and led by the      NRLC's Douglas Johnson, this coalition has used the guise of      the First Amendment to fight bitterly and unrelentingly      against any reform, and in particular against any proposal      that changes the free-for-all jungle surrounding all      electioneering communications that do not use ``magic words''      like ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' and thus call      themselves issue advocacy.       The coalition opposes the Shays-Meehan plan in this area,      which would treat electioneering communications in the period      just before an election by the same rules that apply to      independent expenditures--disclosure of donors and ad      sponsors, and contribution limits for groups.       It opposes with equal fervor the freshman Hutchinson-Allen      plan, which is a simple, watered-down disclosure provision      for a narrow category of electioneering ads that covers only      sponsors, not donors--not even very large donors.       It opposed unalterably the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment in the      Senate, which covered disclosure of large donors only for      electronic communications of $10,000 or more within 60 days      of an election, tailored at influencing directly the election      or defeat of a candidate, and banned direct electioneering      contributions from labor unions and corporations.       This anti-reform coalition has already been hitting House      Members hard. The NRLC has made each provision on sham issue      advocacy a right-to-life test, telling Members that a vote      for any reform will harm their pro-life record, a serious      problem for many GOP lawmakers. The group ran harsh negative      radio ads against staunchy pro-life Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-     Ark) for his temerity in supporting any disclosure for any      political ads.       Using the umbrella aegis of the ACLU, the coalition will      cloak itself in the First Amendment, claiming it is just for      free speech. Of course, the ACLU position is simply the      position of the organization's current leadership; as Burt      Neuborne, a former legal director of the ACLU has pointed      out, virtually every previous leader in the ACLU has a      sharply different view than the current elite in the      organization on the constitutionality of campaign reform      proposals.       But whatever the real civil liberties position on reform,      Members of Congress should be more directly aware of what the      members of this broad anti-reform coalition are for and      against:       1. They are against disclosure. Some ``reformers,'' like      Rep. John Doolittle (R-Calif), claim they are for lifting all      limits and stiffening disclosure, relying on the market and      informed consumers to self-regulate the political and      election process. This would be a worthy position for debate      if it were accurate.       But Doolittle, along with the NRLC's Johnson and the ACLU's      Laura Murphy and Ira Glasser, are not for full disclosure. In      fact, they are opposed to any and all disclosure of sources      or sponsors of any political ads except the very narrow class      of those using the few magic words.       They oppose any disclosure for the more than $150 million      in ads run in 1996 that were self-labeled ``issue advocacy''      but, as an analytical study by the Annenberg School of      Communications has shown, were candidate-centered, more      harshly negative than any other category of ads, and clearly      designed to elect or defeat particular candidates.       2. They are for secrecy, obfuscation and misdirection. The      Annenberg study and good investigative reporting around the      country in 1996 and 1997 showed that sham issue-advocacy ads      were often designed to blindside candidates and to obscure      deliberately the origin of the attacks. Funds often were      laundered through two or more organizations, with vague names      like ``Citizens for Reform,'' making it difficult to figure      out the source of the campaign electioneering messages.       Attack campaigns were often run at the end of the campaign,      leaving no time for the attacked candidate or the press to      uncover the source. Very likely, some candidates and/or their      party campaign committees colluded with outside groups to      orchestrate ``issue advocacy'' attacks on their opponents,      leaving the attacking candidate with his or her hands clean,      able to disavow the vicious attack while reaping the benefit.       Absent any disclosure, we will see a whole lot more of this      approach, aimed at confusing voters and blurring      responsibility and accountability. Ask yourself if confusion,      surreptitiousness, irresponsibility and unaccountability are      the values of the First Amendment the Framers intended to put      first.       3. They are for unlimited corporate and labor involvement      in electioneering. Since 1907, corporations have been barred      from using their funds to influence directly the outcome of      elections. The same ban has existed for labor unions and      their dues since the 1940s. Corporations and labor unions can      use voluntary political action committees to mobilize their      executives, employees and members to get involved in electing      or defeating candidates for office.       But the so-called issue-advocacy campaigns have provided a      gigantic loophole to allow corporations and unions to use      unlimited (and undisclosed) amounts of corporate funds and      union dues to target candidates, violating the intent of      those existing laws.       Of course, some conservatives are trying to have it both      ways, using the backdoor approach of ``paycheck protection''      to cripple labor unions while leaving corporations free to do      what they want to shape election results. But the best way to      stop labor unions and corporations from running these      campaigns is to follow the legal traditions and ban their      funds from use in electioneering--an approach opposed by this      coalition.       4. They are for foreign involvement in American elections.      Current laws ban the use of foreign money in American      campaigns. But any source of funds, foreign or domestic, can      be used for these so-called ``issue advocacy'' campaigns. And      we will never know if foreign funds, including funds from the      Chinese government, are used in ads that are clearly designed      to elect or defeat candidates--there is no disclosure.       So here's a message for Members of Congress as you prepare      to vote on reform plans and amendments that address this sham      issue advocacy. Look beyond the threats and the mantra of the      First Amendment offered by opponents of any reform in this      area and consider the implications of the votes you cast:       Do you really want to vote against disclosure of the      authors and funders of vicious attack ads?       Do you want to be on record voting for unlimited and      undisclosed use of labor union dues and funds from corporate      coffers to elect or defeat candidates?       Do you want to endorse a system allowing unlimited,      unregulated and undisclosed use of foreign money to influence      American elections?       Of course, there are reasonable and heavy-handed,      constitutional and unconstitutional, ways to approach      reforming this system. The freshman plan is frankly too week;      it includes disclosure, but only of the groups sponsoring      these ads, not the major sources of funds. The Shays-Meehan      approach (which, in the interest of disclosure, I helped to      craft) is a better one, although I fear that it will be hard      to sell to the Supreme Court.       I am much more comfortable with the approach my colleagues      and I subsequently devised that became the Snowe-Jeffords      Amendment, which puts reasonable if broad limits on      electioneering ads masquerading as ``issue advocacy'' by      providing targeted disclosure of large contributors and      keeping out corporate and labor funds.       Each of these approaches at least tries to apply the spirit      and approach of the Buckley decision and a sensitivity to the      First Amendment rights of issue advocates to a class of ads      that are not issue advocacy and thus defy the intent of the      Court. Whether too weak, too strong or just right, the      zealots from the NRLC and the ACLU will be opposed.       Which side are you on?
