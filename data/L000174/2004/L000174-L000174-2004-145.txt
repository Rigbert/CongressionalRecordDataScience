President, as I said before, the amendment I have offered is the same amendment that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives, with strong Republican support.It says on these very critical--very critical--steps based in the former INS in which they try to weed out possible terrorists on immigration applications that this not be contracted out to a private company but be done by professionals. That is really the bottom line. We can talk about it for hours. We have had the debate before.  I withhold the remainder of my time, and I will ask for the yeas and nays once time is yielded back.
