 President, I want to thank the Senator from Delaware for that very eloquent exposition on taggants.  I must say that it never ceases to amaze me, because outside people are saying they are for legislation to begin to tag explosives where safe and not adding to the volatility. Yet once again, I must tell the Senator, the lobbying of those special interests is starting up again to, one by one, move Senators off of this legislation.  This led me to get a little bit of the history of taggants before this body. While the Senator has been here for a long time, I am a relative newcomer, 2\1/2\ years, and I did not realize this issue has been raised now for 22 years before this body. It might be interesting to go back into a little bit of the history.  It actually began in 1973 when Congress asked ATF to look into possible methods of fighting terrorists in criminal bombings. That year, ATF and the FAA established an ad hoc committee on explosives seeding. That same year, ATF formed an inner agency advisory committee on explosives tagging.  Also in 1973, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which we knew as LEAA, sponsored a study by Lawrence Livermore Lab, managed by Aerospace Corporation, to study the feasibility of identification tagging of explosives.  Several companies, including 3M and Westinghouse, began taggant development. By 1976, this was far enough advanced to be the subject of the pilot tagging program developed by aerospace under the contract with the Bureau of Mines. The results seemed positive, in 1977, with the Omnibus Antiterrorism Act.  Mr. President, was the Senator here in 1977?
