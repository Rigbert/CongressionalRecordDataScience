 President, I would like to call everybody's attention to the House vote that just occurred on the continuing resolution and on the WRDA bill. The continuing resolution passed 326 to 96; 208 Republicans voted for it and 33 voted against it. On the Democratic side, 118 Democrats voted for it and only 63 voted against it.  The WRDA bill passed 360 to 61. Republicans voted for it 222 to 17; Democrats voted for it 138 to 44. The House has clearly--with two overwhelming votes--sent us the last two measures that we need to deal with here before we wrap up this Congress and head home for the holidays.                          ____________________
