 Schumer) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:                              S. Res. 107       Whereas, in the case of United States v. Taubert, Cr. No.      19-21, pending in the United States District Court for the      Northern District of New York, the prosecution has requested      the production of testimony from Erin Kurvers, an employee of      the office of former Senator Al Franken;       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the      Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a)      and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to      represent current and former Members and employees of the      Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for      testimony relating to their official responsibilities;       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United      States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no      evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate      may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from      such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;      and       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or      in the possession of the Senate may promote the      administration of justice, the Senate will take such action      as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the      privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That Erin Kurvers, a former employee of the      Office of Senator Al Franken, and any other former employee      of the Senator's office from whom relevant testimony may be      necessary, are authorized to testify in the case of United      States v. Taubert, except concerning matters for which a      privilege should be asserted.       Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to      represent Senator Franken and any former employees of his      office in connection with the production of evidence      authorized in section one of this resolution.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing the production of testimony and representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a criminal action pending in New York Federal district court. In this action the defendant is charged with making threats, in the course of telephone calls to former Senator Al Franken's office, to kill and inflict bodily harm upon a former President of the United States. A trial is scheduled for March 18, 2019.  The prosecution is seeking testimony from one of the Senator's former staff assistants who heard the statements at issue. Senator Franken would like to cooperate with this request by providing relevant former employee testimony from his office.  The enclosed resolution would authorize that staffer, and any other former employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant testimony may be necessary, to testify in this action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel of such staffers and Senator Franken.                          ____________________
