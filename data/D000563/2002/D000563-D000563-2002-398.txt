 This chart indicates what we can hope to bring out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The chart may be sitting too low to see because it is way down on the chart. I want to make sure that those who are following this debate with rapt attention notice that on the amount we hope to glean from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, even if we voted today to start it, we will not see the first barrel of oil coming out of there until 2009. Look at how little comes out. This larger amount is what we can achieve with efficiency. This smaller amount is what we are debating in a wilderness and refuge area. We should make this commitment part of our energy policy. Why do we have to turn to an area which we declared, as part of our national policy, would remain a wilderness as God created it, bring in the trucks and all of the pipelines and everything that is necessary, and risk the loss of wildlife and changing the face of that area forever, when, in fact, if we take a responsible course on vehicle fuel efficiency, as well as industrial and home efficiency, the savings far outweigh what we could possibly glean from this Arctic National Wildlife Refuge?  I will be happy to yield to my colleague from Alaska.
