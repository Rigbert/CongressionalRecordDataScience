President, I rise today to once again introduce legislation that will address the challenges facing many promising, talented young athletes from other countries who wish to play for sports teams in the United States. Due to the shortage of H-2B nonimmigrant visas for temporary or seasonal nonagricultural foreign workers both this year and last, many American teams who rely on these visas to recruit new talent from abroad have been unable to bring some of their most talented prospects to the United States. This bill would provide a commonsense solution to this problem.  Across the United States, the H-2B visa shortage has been a significant concern to many in a wide variety of industries, including hospitality, forest products, fisheries, and landscaping, to name a few. While we recently were successful in crafting a temporary, 2-year fix for the H-2B shortage, there is more still to be done. We must continue to seek permanent solutions to this problem, and to find practical ways to reduce the demand on this visa category. While there are a number of factors contributing to this high demand, among these is the extremely diverse, ``catch-all'' nature of this visa classification.  What many people do not know is that, in addition to loggers, hotel and restaurant employees, fisheries workers, landscapers, and many other types of seasonal workers, the H-2B visa category is also used by many talented, highly competitive foreign athletes. Specifically, minor league athletes--unlike their counterparts at Major League franchises--are lumped into this same oversubscribed visa category, despite the obvious differences in the nature of the work they perform. The recent H-2B visa shortage has therefore meant that hundreds of promising athletes have been unable to come to the United States to play for minor league and amateur sports teams across the Nation. Not only have many teams been unable to bring some of their most talented prospects to the United States, but this visa shortage has also compromised a traditional source of talent for Major League sports teams. In addition, some very talented ice skaters who have earned roles in a number of popular theatrical productions, such as Disney on Ice, have faced difficulties in coming to the United States.  In my home State of Maine, for example, the Lewiston MAINEiacs, a Canadian junior hockey league team, faced tremendous difficulties last year obtaining the H-2B visas necessary for the majority of its players to remain in the United States to play in the team's first home games in September. These young athletes are among Canada's most talented junior players, but the shortage of H-2B visas threatened their chances of improve their skills with the MAINEiacs and, possibly, graduate to a career in professional hockey. This year, due to uncertainty about the availability of H-2B visas at the end of the fiscal year, the team has had to schedule a later season home opener. It must also attempt to schedule make-up games for the home games that the team would normally play in September. This creates a hardship on the team and its venue, and could mean fewer home games and a loss of revenue for businesses in the surrounding area. I have received a letter from the MAINEiacs, expressing the teams's support for this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  The Portland Sea Dogs, a Double-A level baseball team affiliated with the Boston Red Sox, is another of the many teams that relies on H-2B visas to bring some of its most skilled players to the United States. Thousands of fans come out each year to see this team, and others like it across the country, play one of America's favorite sports. Due to the shortage of H-2B visas, however, Major League Baseball reports that more than 350 talented young, foreign baseball players were prevented from coming to the U.S. last year and early this year to play for Minor League teams, a traditional proving ground for athletes hoping to make it to the Major Leagues. The experience gained in the Minor Leagues is crucial to the development of the best Major League players.  The inclusion of these athletes in the H-2B visa category seems particularly unusual when you consider that Major League athletes are permitted to use an entirely different nonimmigrant visa category: the P-1 visa. This visa is used by athletes who are deemed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, CIS, to perform at an ``internationally recognized level of performance.'' Arguably, any foreign athlete whose achievements have earned him a contract with an American team would meet this definition. However, CIS has interpreted this category to exclude minor and amateur league athletes. Instead, the P-1 visa is typically reserved for only those athletes who have already been promoted to Major League sports. Unfortunately, this creates something of a catch-22: if an H-2B visa shortage means that promising athletes are unable to hone their skills, and to prove themselves, in the Minor Leagues, then they are far less likely to ever earn a Major League contract.  A simple solution would be to expand the P-1 visa category to include minor league athletes and certain amateur-level athletes who have demonstrated a significant likelihood of graduating to the major leagues. I have received a letter from officials from Major League Baseball, which continues to strongly support the expansion of the P-1 visa category to include professional Minor League baseball players. I would ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record. As the League points out, by making P-1 visas available to this group of athletes, teams would be able to make player development decisions based on the talent of its players, without being constrained by visa quotas. The P-1 category, the League argues, is appropriate for Minor League players because these are the players that the Major League Clubs have selected as some of the best baseball prospects in the world.  There is no question that Americans are passionate about sports. We have high expectations for our teams, and demand only the best from our athletes. By expanding the P-1 visa category, we will make it possible for athletes to be selected based on talent and skill, rather than nationality. In addition, we would reduce some pressure on the H-2B visa category so that more of those visas can be used where they are really needed.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 11, 2005.     Re legislation for nonimmigrant alien status for certain          athletes.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senator from Maine, Russell Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I wish to express the Lewiston      MAINEiacs Hockey Club's support for your efforts with regard      to amending the P-1 work visa to enable all of our      non U.S. players to work in the United States.       The Lewiston MAINEiacs Hockey Club is the sole U.S. based      franchise in the 18-member Quebec Major Junior Hockey League      (QMJHL). The QMJHL together with the Ontario Hockey League      (OHL) and the Western Hockey League (WHL) make up the      Canadian Hockey League which comprises a total of 58 teams.      Of these 58 franchises, 9 are located in the United Stats      (OHL-3,WHL-5, QMJHl-1).       The CHL is the largest developer of talent for the National      Hockey League (NHL). More than 70% of all players, coaches      and general managers who have played in the NHL are graduates      of the Canadian Hockey League.       The majority of players in the Canadian Hockey League are      Canadian, although each team is permitted to have a maximum      of 2 Europeans on their rosters. These is also an increasing      number of elite U.S. born players now playing in the league.       The MAINEiacs sophomore season in 2004-fnl2-005 was a giant      success, growing the fan base to over 93,000 fans in the      regular season (2662 per game average). The team easily      advanced through the first round of the playoffs before      losing to the Rimouski Oceanic in the second round. Rimouski      subsequently went on to win the league title. The Lewiston      MAINEiacs also had two of their players drafted into the      National Hockey League in June 2004 with Alexandre Picard      being selected in the first round, 8th overall by the      Columbus Blue Jackets and Jonathan Paiememt being selected by      the New York Rangers in the 8th round. A total of 27 players      in the QMJHL were selected at the 2004 NHL Entry Draft.       In January of 2004, the City of Lewiston purchased the      Colisee in order to complete the first round of renovations      to the facility which was in excess of two million dollars.      The Colisee has undergone a second phase of renovations in      excess of 1.8 million dollars that entails a three-story      addition to the front of the building providing for new      offices, box office, proshop, food and beverage concessions      and a new private VIP suite that can accommodate more than      130 fans per game. The City of Lewiston recently contracted      the day-to-day management of the Colisee to Global Spectrum,      a subsidiary of Comcast-Spectacor, one of the largest and      most successful facility management companies in North      America.       The results of the current visa laws have forced all U.S.      based franchises in the CHL to delay the commencement of      their regular season until or after October 1 of each year      due to the restrictions of the H-2B temporary work visa      regulations. This has caused significant hardship on teams,      their facilities and the 3 leagues. U.S. based franchises are      forced to try and make-up games that would normally be      scheduled in the month of the September later in the season,      putting both the teams and their fans at disadvantage before      the season even commences.       Under your leadership, should congressional legislation      make available P-1 visas to Major Junior players of the CHL,      the success of all 9 U.S. based CHL franchises would be      greatly enhanced by ensuring that all 58 teams have an equal      chance at attracting and developing the best available      talent.       It is the hope of the Lewiston MAINEiacs that your      colleagues in the Senate follow your leadership and endorse      your recommendations for the expanded P-1 work visa to ensure      the viability and success of not only our franchise--but the      8 other U.S. based clubs in the Canadian Hockey League.           Sincerely,                                                    Matt McKnight,     Vice President & Governor.                                  ____                                       Office of the Commissioner,                                        Major League Baseball,                                        New York, NY, May 6, 2005.     Re legislation for nonimmigrant alien status for certain          athletes.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senator from Maine, Russell Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I write to express Major League      Baseball's support for your efforts on behalf of Minor League      professional baseball players. We understand that you are      sponsoring legislation that will enable Minor League players      to obtain P-1 work visas to perform in the United States.       Currently, foreign players under Minor League contracts are      required to obtain H-2B (temporary worker) work visas to      perform in the United States, forcing the Major League Clubs      to compete with employers of various unskilled workers for a      limited number of such visas that are issued. The United      States Citizenship and Immigration Services stopped accepting      H-2B visa applications in early January this year (and in      March, in 2004), citing the nationwide cap in the number of      such visas that can be issued. That action prevented more      than 350 young baseball players from performing in the Minor      Leagues in the United States in 2004 and 2005. Moreover,      Major League Clubs were forced to make premature player      promotion decisions this past off-season, in a race to apply      for H-2B visas before the cap was reached.       Minor League experience is crucial in developing the best      possible Major League players. Unlike other professional      athletes, baseball players almost invariably cannot go      directly from high school or college to the Major Leagues.      Almost all need substantial experience in the Minor Leagues      to develop their talents and skills to Major League quality.      To get that necessary experience, young players are signed by      Major League Clubs and assigned to play for Minor League      affiliates throughout the United States, such as the Eastern      League's Portland Sea Dogs in your state.       Major League Clubs sign many players from the Dominican      Republic and Venezuela and assign them at first to affiliates      in those countries, then seek to promote them to affiliates      in the United States as players' skills progress. Typically,      a Club would seek to promote 3-5 players per season to Minor      League affiliates in the United States, but the visa      restrictions will make those promotions impossible this      season, as they did last year as well. The Major League Clubs      were able to use only approximately 80% of the H-2B visas the      Department of Labor allowed them for the 2004 and 2005      seasons, because current laws prevent them from making      decisions in the late spring and throughout the summer to      promote foreign prospects to United States affiliates. My      staff has learned that at least several Clubs shied away from      drafting foreign (mostly Canadian) players whom they      otherwise might have selected in the annual First-Year Player      Draft in June 2004 and will do so again this year, because      those Clubs know there is no opportunity for those players to      begin their professional careers in the United States the      summer after their selection. For the Canadian players who      were drafted in June 2004, signings declined 80% from 2003.      These results of the current visa laws have deprived Minor      League fans across America from seeing the best young players      possible perform for affiliates of the Major League Baseball      Clubs and have affected the quality and attractiveness of      those affiliates.       Under your leadership, congressional legislation could, by      sensibly making available P-1 visas to professional Minor      League athletes, ensure that the best baseball prospects from      around the world will get the opportunity to develop here in      the United States, without the constraint that the H-2B visa      cap imposes. The National Association of Professional      Baseball Leagues, Inc., also known as Minor League Baseball,      shares our support of your legislation. The Major League      Baseball Players Association also supports allowing the best      young players to develop here in the United States.       Major League Baseball hopes that your Senate colleagues      will follow your leadership and pursue a legislative remedy      to a problem that is threatening to weaken Baseball's Minor      League system.           Sincerely,                                                  Robert A. DuPuy,                            President and Chief Operating Officer.                                 ______                                       By
