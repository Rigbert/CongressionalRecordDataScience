 President, as part of my ongoing commitment to children, I have come to the floor today to draw attention to my efforts to improve the health of American children and young people.  It is clear that many people work hard every day for the well-being of children in this country. However, we all can do--and need to do--so much more. Children's health in my home State of Washington is better overall, including lower infant mortality and better prenatal care. However, immunization rates and child nutrition need improvement.  Across our Nation, over 10 million children are uninsured. One in four children are covered by Medicaid--more than half in working families. And, nearly 200,000 babies were born in 1993 who had no prenatal care, or none until the last 3 months of pregnancy, despite the fact that we know that averting one low birth-weight baby can prevent as much as $37,000 in initial hospital and doctor fees.  Internationally, among industrialized countries, America ranks 16th in the living standards of our poorest children, 18th in the gap between rich and poor children, and 18th in infant mortality.  Certainly, we all can do better for our children's well-being. We know it, and the American people know it.  When I hear from people in Washington State on the topic of children's health, I hear common themes. People from Vancouver to Yakima to Spokane to Tacoma worry about kids not having access to basic health care. They talk about children going to emergency rooms with preventable illnesses and injuries. Parents talk about feeling like they need more and better information to make decisions affecting their child's health.  In response to those concerns, you will continue to see me working in three different areas to improve and protect children's health and well-being:  First, keep effective national standards for health care in place for all children, including those with special needs.  Second, make prevention the centerpiece of our national children's health policy.  Third, increase access to information for families to make the best decisions possible for their children.  There are several ways to do more for children, and not all of them are difficult. One way to help kids is simply to draw attention to the people, programs, and services that are working and doing a good job for children today.  In my home State of Washington, for example, we are helping children to be more healthy in a variety of ways.  In Ellensburg and in Coupeville, through a program now running in four counties that I hope one day goes statewide, parents of young children get two important services that help them make the best decisions for their children.  First, any parent of a child between birth and age 6 gets special mailings and health information sent to their home, including information on well-baby checkups, immunizations, safety, and normal patterns of growth and development. All at no cost to the parents, and all for a total cost of about $10 per child.  Second, parents get reminders and assistance to get the many immunizations their child will need. We know children should be protected from a host of childhood illnesses, from diphtheria and tetanus, and from polio to measles, mumps, and rubella. We also know people are busy, and need reminders, access to affordable vaccines, and lots of information. This program is a good start.  There is also a dental health promotion effort underway in my State. In the past, many dentists' advice to parents has been to bring children in for their first visit about the time they start school, at age 4 or 5. The problem is that many children show up to their first dental visit with decay, gum problems--in many cases so serious that they require dental surgery--because of preventable causes.  The Access to Baby and Child Dentistry [ABDC] program in Spokane, WA, reaches out to families with young children and encourages early dental visits. ABDC dentists remind them to do things like remove baby bottles at the proper age, and not give babies soft drinks or candy bars. In addition, dentists, apply fluoride varnishes and other treatments to baby teeth, and do other clinical procedures to decrease a baby's chances of developing dental problems.  These measum save all of us money in the long run.  Sometimes bringing awareness to a problem is not enough. I mentioned that we need to preserve national standards for children's health. This must happen at the national level.  This Friday, tomorrow, the National Highway Traffic Safety Commission and Prevention magazine will release Prevention's 1996 report on auto safety in America. I hope we all pay attention to their findings. Last year, the report included information on child safety helmets. This year, their report will focus on the things we can do to make automobile travel safer.  Effective national standards for children's health do not have to be some scientific formula. Sometimes it's as easy as retaining a Federal speed limit, or Federal safety regulations. We know that the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit has saved countless children's lives. We know that the automobile industry has made great strides to improve automobile safety. We know air bags improve safety, and that cellular telephone use probably decreases it.  When it comes to the basic safety of our children, it should not depend on which line on a map they just crossed on their family vacation.  As a final note, I want to remind you all that on June 1, the Children's Defense Fund will host Stand for Children, an event in Washington, DC, that will bring Americans together, to show their shared commitment to children. We spend so much time talking about our differences of opinion. We need to respect our opposing view, but get beyond them to common ground and common sense action for children.  I encourage all Americans who can attend this event to do so. It will be aday to rally around our children, and show them how important they are to us all. This will be a day of fun family activies, and togetherness, and of the power of individual action.  I have heard from many people around the country who cannot attend the event. I encourage you to support those at the Lincoln Memorial in your thoughts and prayers, I encourage every American to do at least one thing to make a difference in the life of a child, and June 1 would be a great place to start. If anyone wants more information on the Stand for Children event they can call 1-800-233-1200.  Anyone who is listening can make it easier for one child to get appropriate health care. Offer to provide child care or a ride to the clinic, so someone's child can go to a medical check-up or get immunized.  We all can help prevent health problems to avoid bigger costs later on. Anyone listing can volunteer to distribute information on health screenings, immunizations, or blood drives. Lead a safety committees or fitness day at the local park, school, or community center. Help to find or build affordable housing in your area.  You can stay educated and prepared about children's health. Read about childhood illnesses. Make a personal medical history for each member of your family, so you can be ready in the case of illness or trauma.  Nothing is more vital to a child than her basic health. A child must be healthy to learn well. She must be educated to participate and contribute to our society. But we must start with making sure we do everything we can for her basic well-being.  You will see me doing my best for the health of our children. Please join me in this critical effort.                          ____________________
