Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R 4768, the Veterans' Medical Facilities Management Act of 2004. I thank Congressman Simmons for introducing this important piece of legislation and the Veterans' Affairs Committee for giving it the immediate attention that it deserves. In keeping with our commitment to high-quality veterans' medical care, this measure authorizes $850,000 in funds for the Adam Benjamin Jr. VA outpatient medical facility in Crown Point, Indiana.  It is imperative that we support our Nation's veterans and ensure that their medical care is among our highest priorities. We owe a great debt of gratitude for those who have sacrificed on behalf of all Americans. That is why I strongly support this measure which provides for the consistent supply of quality health care to our veterans.  I urge passage of H.R 4768, an essential step in keeping our commitment to maintaining a strong VA health care service network. I want to recognize the important efforts of all of those who work at the Crown Point VA outpatient clinic, taking up the noble daily effort of caring for our Nation's veterans. And I am proud to honor the veterans of Northwest Indiana who have served our country with courage and distinction. I ask that you and my other colleagues join me in thanking these brave men and women, as well as our other former and current members of the United States military, for their bravery and valor in the face of danger. These men and women risked their lives in order to protect the freedoms that we enjoy each day, and they deserve all of our honor and respect. I am proud to represent them in Indiana's First Congressional District.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation so that our brave veterans may continue to receive the health care they so deserve.
