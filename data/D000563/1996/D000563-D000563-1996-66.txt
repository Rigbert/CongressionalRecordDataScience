Chairman, I would note one fact that was brought up early in the debate, there are 1,500 legal crops in the United States, only 60 of the 1,500 are covered by crop insurance. There are many things the gentleman and I could grow that would not even qualify for crop insurance, and that is the basis for this amendment.
