This is the largest CTFP program currently underway anywhere in the world. Millions of dollars have been appropriated for these programs in recent years, including for the types of defense management, military justice, civil military relations, and other courses thatthe Senator from Missouri and I support. The TNI is participating in the E-IMET program which Congress has funded at the level requested by the Bush administration.  Our law also does not prevent military exercises and other contacts with the U.S. military through officer visits, educational exchanges, and port visits. Perhaps the most visible evidence of this is the U.S. military working side by side with the TNI during the ongoing humanitarian relief operations in Aceh.  With respect to training, U.S. law restricts only the full restoration of regular IMET assistance until the Indonesian Government and the TNI ``are cooperating'' with the FBI's investigation into the August 31, 2002, murders of two American citizens and one Indonesian citizen. By ``cooperating,'' we obviously mean not simply cooperating in limited ways, but fully cooperating. I am concerned with reports that the TNI may have conspired with the shooters in that case, and that the one Papuan individual who has been indicted, who is not a member of the TNI, remains at large even though his whereabouts are reportedly known to the TNI.  With respect to equipment, our law does not restrict the sale of non-lethal equipment to the TNI. Specifically, with regard to spare parts for the C-130's, there has been no change in U.S. law, although I am told that there may have been a relaxation of this administration's policy. Our law does not and never has prevented the sale of spare parts for these aircraft for humanitarian purposes. Over 4 years ago, when the TNI first requested to purchase C-130 spare parts for ``search and rescue'' missions, the U.S. Ambassador and I, as well as, I am told, the Secretary of Defense, informed the Indonesians that this was not prohibited by either U.S. law or policy and that they could purchase these parts from us. For reasons the Pentagon is aware of, the TNI decided to obtain them elsewhere.  The only conditions on the sale of lethal equipment are that the Indonesian Government is prosecuting and punishing members of the TNI for gross violations of human rights, and that the TNI is (1) taking steps to counter international terrorism consistent with democratic principles and the rule of law; (2) cooperating with civilian judicial authorities and with international efforts to resolve cases of gross violations of human rights; and (3) implementing financial reforms to deter corruption.  There are good reasons for these limited conditions. The United States has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in training and equipment to the Indonesian military since the 1950s. Despite the close relationship that developed between the U.S. military and the TNI over four decades, the TNI acquired a reputation for being notoriously abusive and corrupt. After the TNI murdered some 200 civilians in a cemetery in Dili, East Timor in 1992, our IMET assistance was cut off. Our relations with the TNI were further curtailed in 1999, after the independence referendum in East Timor when the TNI orchestrated widespread killings and the destruction of property. Although senior TNI officers have repeatedly vowed to support reform, they have done next to nothing to hold their members accountable for these heinous crimes. Instead, the TNI has consistently obstructed justice.  I should note that these conditions do not apply to the Indonesian navy. Congress specifically exempted the navy because enhancing maritime security is a critical priority.  There are also credible reports that after 9/11, the TNI provided support to radical Indonesian groups that have been involved in terrorism.  Since 1999, restrictions on our relations with the TNI have been narrowed, and today, as I mentioned, we have a wide range of military-to-military activities.  I am disappointed that some Pentagon officials and my friend from Missouri, rather than acknowledging the extent of the United States-Indonesia military relationship and urging the TNI to demonstrate that it is serious about reform by meeting these reasonable conditions, have expressed support for weakening our law.  Indonesia's new President Yudhoyono is a career military officer. He has a reputation as a reformer, and I wish him well. I have always supported substantial economic assistance to Indonesia. In fact, Senator McConnell, the Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, and I have worked to increase this assistance.  Prior to President Yudhoyono's election, there were some important reforms which reduced the TNI's influence in politics. But a key gap remains regarding justice for the victims of atrocities, including crimes against humanity. This is the focus of our law, and it is as important to Indonesia and the TNI as it is for the United States. I believe that President Yudhoyono should agree and want the TNI to make these necessary reforms.  I applaud the U.S. military and the TNI for working together to bring aid to tsunami victims in Aceh. But just as our policy should promote cooperation in humanitarian operations and in counterterrorism, so should it promote respect for human rights, accountability, and the rule of law. These are fundamental to the freedom and democracy that President Bush spoke of in his inaugural address. Our law, which was narrowly written to provide an incentive for reform while allowing military contacts to continue, strikes the right balance.                               Exhibit 1                              IMET/E-IMET       (Allocated FY 04 $599,000; Requested for FY 05 $600,000.)       The International Military Education and Training (IMET)      program continues to be restricted for Indonesia. However,      training is allowed with IMET funding for Expanded-IMET (E-     IMET) courses for both military and civilians.       E-IMET courses have included a wide-range of programs,      including seminars, in-country Mobile Education Teams, and      Masters Programs at Naval Postgraduate School. Topics have      included defense management, national security affairs,      defense restructuring, civ-mil relations, resource      management, military law, peacekeeping operations, and other      important topics.              Counter-Terrorism Fellowship Program (CTFP)       Largest CTFP Program in the world. (Allocated FY B04      $500,000; Supplemental $386,826; FY B05 Allocation $600,000.)      (Allocated B02 ``No Year'' funds in 2002: $3.7 million;      Current Remaining $702,000.)       Note this Remaining B02 money is Programmed through FY 05      and FY 06.       In the FY02 Defense Appropriations Act, the Regional      Defense Counter-Terrorism Fellowship Program was established      under section 8125.       Both civilian and military officers participate in a wide      variety of courses and seminars under this program designed      to improve the professionalism and management skills of TNI.      CTFP training programs include intelligence cooperation,      national level decision-making, civil-mil cooperation in      combating terrorism, and maritime security, as well as      Indonesian attendance at US Staff Colleges, War Colleges,      National Defense University, and English language training      and materials.                  Theater Security Cooperation Program       (Funding provided from various sources per event.)       Indonesian is an active participant in U.S. Pacific Command      TSCP activities, to include regional workshops and seminars      promoting cooperation on security issues, Counter-Terrorism      seminars and workshops, peacekeeping workshops, and Subject      Matter Expert Exchanges.       Activities are limited to non-lethal, non-combat related      events.       In close cooperation with both the ODC and the Defense      Attache Office, PACOM has developed a more robust TSCP      program over the next two years in order to broaden our      engagement with TNI and other agencies within GOI.       Indonesian participation has increased from Zero events in      FY 00 to more than 85-events in FY 04, and more than 132      programmed in FY 05.           Foreign Military Sales/Foreign Military Financing       Foreign Military Sales (FMS): Remain frozen by USG policy.      There remain 38 active cases with an FMS balance of $ 3.5      mil.       Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and other grant programs,      such as eligibility for Excess Defense Articles (EDA), remain      restricted by legislation.       ($11.3 mil requested for FY 06; $6 million recommended by      interagency for FY 06; focus is maritime security and C-130      parts.)       Direct Commercial Sales (DCS): USG policy has established      ``carve-outs'' for specific categories of defense hardware,      such as C-130 spare parts, non-lethal equipment, and ``safety      of use'' items for lethal end items (an example would be CAD/     PADs, propellant cartridges for ejection seats on fighter      aircraft).
