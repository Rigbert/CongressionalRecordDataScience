 President, I was going to ask unanimous consent to speak after all of the votes. I wanted to speak for about 12 minutes, and the other Senator from Washington, Senator Cantwell, wanted to speak for 3 or 4 minutes. I know everyone wants to get to the vote, so I will use my time after the vote.  I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of all of the votes on this package, on final passage, I be recognized to speak for 12 minutes, and the other Senator from Washington, Senator Cantwell, be allowed to speak for 3 minutes.
