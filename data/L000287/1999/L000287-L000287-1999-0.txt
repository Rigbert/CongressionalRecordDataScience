Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this resolution. When I first came here 13 years ago as a Member of Congress from the State of Georgia and met the Reverend Dr. James Ford, I wanted to refer to Dr. Ford not as Dr. Ford or Reverend Ford but, like my colleague from New York, I wanted to call him Father Ford. For this man, this good and wise spiritual leader, is a blessing not just to this body but to our Nation and to all of her citizens.  For 20 years, the Reverend Dr. James David Ford has started our session with the most important motion each day, a motion to the Congress and all Americans to pray and give thanks. Reverend Ford also reminds Congress every day that it is through faith, hope, and love that we serve. Through his selfless counseling and pastoral services to all Members and staff and his spiritual service as a new pastor in 1958 at the Lutheran Church in Ivanhoe, Minnesota, Reverend Dr. Ford, you have personified the very best that public service has to offer.  I will miss you, Dr. Ford. We have traveled many roads together. We traveled together to a free and unified South Africa. You kept us calm. You prayed with us. We had good food together. We shared some good times together, but we shared some very highand lofty moments together. We traveled to Selma, Alabama. We have crossed many racial and religious bridges together. In the journey down the road less traveled together, my friend has made all of the difference to me and to many that you continue to touch and inspire each day.  Dr. Ford, God bless you. May God keep you, your lovely wife, and your five children. We are going to miss you. But we will never ever forget you. Reverend Dr. Ford, my brother, and my friend, thank you for being you. Godspeed.
