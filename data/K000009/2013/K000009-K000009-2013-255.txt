 Tonight, the American people's hopes are for this Congress to pass a bipartisan bill to meet our Nation's financial obligations to give some certainty to our financial markets and to keep our economy growing through new job creation. This is a great victory for the middle class whose taxes will not go up tomorrow.  In places like Ohio, what does it mean? It means doctors who treat Medicare patients are going to receive fair reimbursement and those seniors won't be turned away. It means that unemployment compensation will be extended to the unemployed, who remain in places like Norwalk, Ohio, and Lima and Medina and Elyria, people who haven't gone back to work yet in manufacturing centers across States like Ohio.  This House surely should follow the lead of the Senate, which passed this bill by 89-8 last night. This is the time for the House to act. I rise in strong support of the rule and strong support of the bill. Let's do what the American people have been waiting for for months.                             General Leave
