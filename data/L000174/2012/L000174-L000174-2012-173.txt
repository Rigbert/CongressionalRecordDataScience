If they succeed in their partisan filibuster, it will be another first for them. Never before has the Senate filibustered and refused to vote on a judicial nominee with such strong bipartisan support, who was voted out of the Judiciary Committee with virtually unanimous support.  Their partisan efforts to shut down Senate confirmations of qualified judicial nominees who have bipartisan support do not help the American people. This is a shortsighted policy at a time when the judicial vacancy rate remains more than twice what it was at this point in the first term of President Bush. Judicial vacancies during the last few years have been at historically high levels. Nearly one out of every 11 Federal judgeships is currently vacant. Their shutting down confirmations for consensus and qualified circuit court nominees is not helping the overburdened Federal courts to which Americans turn for justice.  Over his 13-year career as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in the Western District of Oklahoma, Judge Robert Bacharach has handled nearly 3,000 civil and criminal matters, presided over 400 judicial settlement conferences, and issued more than 1,600 reports and recommendations. As an attorney in private practice, Judge Bacharach tried 10 cases to verdict, argued 2 cases before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, and briefed scores of other cases to the tenth circuit and the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated Judge Bacharach unanimously well qualified, the highest possible rating from its nonpartisan peer review.  Judge Bacharach's judicial colleagues in the Western District of Oklahoma stand strongly behind his nomination. Vicki Miles-LaGrange, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, has said of Judge Bacharach:       He is an outstanding jurist and my colleagues and I      enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend him for the      Tenth Circuit position . . . We knew that we were lucky to      have Bob as a Magistrate Judge, and he's been remarkable in      this position for over 12 years. He is an absolutely great      Magistrate Judge. His research and writing are excellent, his      temperament is superb, his preparation is top-notch, and he      is a wonderful colleague to all of the judges and in general      to the entire court family. . . . All of the other judges and      I--Republicans and Democrats alike--enthusiastically and      wholeheartedly recommend Judge Bob Bacharach for the Tenth      Circuit position. All of us believe very strongly that Judge      Bacharach would be a superb choice for the position.  Throughout this very careful and deliberate process in which Judge Robert Bacharach has been thoroughly vetted, considered, and voted on by the Judiciary Committee, I have not heard a single negative word about him. There is no Senator that I know of who is opposed to his nomination on the merits. The only obstacle standing between Judge Bacharach being confirmed to serve the people of the tenth circuit is partisan obstruction.  Nor is Judge Bacharach the only victim of this abuse. In a letter dated June 20, 2012, the president of the American Bar Association urged Senator Reid and Senator McConnell to work together to schedule votes on the nominations of William Kayatta and Richard Taranto, as well as Judge Bacharach. These are three consensus, qualified circuit court nominees awaiting Senate confirmation so that they may serve the American people. I ask that a copy of that letter be printed in the Record, along with an article from the Oklahoman on this nomination.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     American Bar Association,                                       Chicago, IL, June 20, 2012.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell:      Amid concerns that the judicial confirmation process is about      to fall victim to presidential election year politics through      the invocation of the ``Thurmond Rule,'' I am writing on      behalf of the American Bar Association to reiterate our grave      concern for the longstanding number of judicial vacancies on      Article III courts and to urge you to schedule floor votes on      three pending, noncontroversial circuit court nominees before      July and on district court nominees who have strong      bipartisan support on a weekly basis thereafter.       Three of the four circuit court nominees pending on the      Senate floor are consensus nominees who have received      overwhelming approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee.      Both William Kayatta, Jr. of Maine, nominated to the First      Circuit, and Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma, nominated to the      Tenth Circuit, have the staunch support of their Republican      senators. Richard Taranto, nominated to the Federal Circuit,      enjoys strong bipartisan support, including the endorsement      of noted conservative legal scholars. All three nominees also      have stellar professional qualifications and each has been      rated unanimously ``well-qualified'' by the ABA's Standing      Committee on the Federal Judiciary.       As you know, the ``Thurmond Rule'' is neither a rule nor a      clearly defined event. While the ABA takes no position on      what invocation of the ``Thurmond Rule'' actually means or      whether it represents wise policy, recent news stories have      cast it as a precedent under which the Senate, after a      specified date in a presidential election year, ceases to      vote on nominees to the federal circuit courts of appeals. We      note that there has been no consistently observed date at      which this has occurred during the presidential election      years from 1980 to 2008. With regard to the past three      election years, the last circuit court nominees were      confirmed in June during 2004 and 2008 and in July during      2000. In deference to these historical cut-off dates and      because of our conviction that the Senate has a continuing      constitutional duty to act with due diligence to reduce the      dangerously high vacancy rate that is adversely affecting our      federal judiciary, we exhort you to schedule votes on these      three outstanding circuit court nominees this month.       We also urge you to continue to work together to move      consensus district court nominees to the floor for a vote      throughout the rest of the session, lest the vacancy crisis      worsens in the waning months of the 112th Congress. With five      new vacancies arising this month and an additional five      announced for next month, this is not just a possibility; it      is a certainty, absent your continued commitment to the      federal judiciary and steady action on nominees.       Thank you for your past efforts and for your consideration      of our views on this important issue.           Sincerely,                                       Wm. T. (Bill) Robinson III,     President.                                  ____                  [From the Oklahoman, June 15, 2012]   Senate Republicans To Block Vote on Oklahoma Nominee for Federal                              Appeals Court                           (By Chris Casteel)       Washington.--Senate Republicans won't allow a vote before      November's presidential election to confirm U.S. Magistrate      Judge Robert E. Bacharach to a federal appeals court, despite      Bacharach's credentials and support from both Oklahoma      senators, Sen. Tom Coburn said Thursday.       Coburn, R-Muskogee, said Senate Republican leader Mitch      McConnell told him Republicans were following a tradition      used by both parties to block votes on circuit court nominees      a few months before a presidential election.       That means a vote on Bacharach, whose nomination to the      10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cleared the Senate      Judiciary Committee last week, ``is not going to happen,''      Coburn said.       Coburn said the nomination of John E. Dowdell to be a U.S.      district judge in Tulsa still has a ``great chance'' of      clearing the full Senate.       Bacharach is ``an awfully good candidate'' for the circuit      court position, said Coburn, who praised his character and      judicial temperament. Bacharach, who has been a magistrate      judge in Oklahoma City since 1999, was given a rating of      ``unanimously well qualified'' for the appeals court position      by the American Bar Association.       Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Tulsa, praised Bacharach during a      committee hearing last month.       But the selection and confirmation process moved too slowly      to fill the vacancy on the appeals court--which is a step      below the U.S. Supreme Court--given the political timetable      in Washington.       Though the position has been open since July 2010, the      White House didn't make a nomination until January, after      spending months vetting candidates that weren't going to be      acceptable to Coburn and Inhofe.       Then, it took more than three months to schedule a      committee hearing for Bacharach as the staff conducted a      background investigation; Coburn withheld his approval for a      committee hearing until the committee investigation was      completed.       Ultimately, Bacharach may have just narrowly missed a full      Senate vote. The Senate this week, over the objections of      most Republicans, confirmed a nominee from Arizona for      another circuit court. After that vote, McConnell told      Republican senators no other votes on circuit judges would be      held.       McConnell's office declined to comment on Thursday.       Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the Senate      Judiciary Committee, said Thursday, ``This is really a      challenge to the senators who have said that they will not      support these filibusters and this kind of shutdown, and to      those Republican senators who support the circuit court      nominees from Maine and Oklahoma.''       But Coburn said there wasn't anything he could do about the      situation.       The delaying tactic on circuit court judges, which will      likely extend to district court judges later this year, has      become common practice for the party that doesn't control the      White House.       This year, it means Republicans will block votes on      nominees for appeals courts, which can have great influence      on a wide range of legal issues since the Supreme Court      agrees to hear relatively few cases.       The aim of the tactic is to delay making lifetime      appointments to federal courts in hopes their party will      regain the White House and the power to fill judicial      vacancies. Coburn said Bacharach could be cleared late this      year if President Barack Obama wins re-election. If not,      Coburn said, Bacharach would make a great nominee for a      Republican president.
