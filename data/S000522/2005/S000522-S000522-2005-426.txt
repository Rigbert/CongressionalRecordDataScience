Mr. Speaker, as Co-Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I want to inform colleagues of an important breakthrough in combating human trafficking achieved at the recently concluded Ministerial Council meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). There have been growing concerns in recent years that some individuals serving as peacekeeping forces, or civilian contractors involved in international operations and other personnel serving with international organizations have helped fuel the demand side of the human trafficking cycle, particularly for sexual exploitation. These concerns stem in part from shocking revelations of complicity by elements in these operations with trafficking networks profiteering from this contemporary form of slavery.  Serving in my capacity as Special Representative on Combating Human Trafficking for the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, I have pressed for adoption of a zero-tolerance policy regarding trafficking in human beings by personnel involved in peacekeeping missions, along with related education and training.  Overcoming pushback from various quarters, I am pleased to report that agreement was reached earlier this month among the 55 OSCE countries meeting in Slovenia, including numerous countries actively involved in peacekeeping missions around the globe, to ensure the highest standards of conduct and accountability of persons serving on peacekeeping forces and other international missions. Importantly, the OSCE countries have pledged to step up efforts to prevent military and civilian personnel deployed abroad from engaging in trafficking in human beings or exploiting victims of trafficking. Countries with deployed military and civilian personnel have also agreed to work cooperatively with authorities in countries hosting such missions, in efforts to combat trafficking in human beings.  While many of the cases involve sexual exploitation and abuse, the OSCE countries also recognized that cases involving forced labor also need to be aggressively pursued and have committed to enforce relevant standards of conduct and to ensure that any such cases are properly investigated and appropriately punished.  Mr. Speaker, if we are to be successful in combating human trafficking, we must be proactive at home and abroad. The OSCE has proven to be an important forum for building consensus and cooperation on anti-trafficking measures throughout the expansive OSCE region. Developing this consensus has required both tact and tenacity. In this regard, I want to recognize the tireless efforts of Janice Helwig and Maureen Walsh, two outstanding professionals on the Helsinki Commission staff. Having secured this important agreement at the OSCE, the Commission will continue to remain fully engaged in monitoring its implementation.  Mr. Speaker. I submit for the Record a copy of the Ministerial Decision, agreed to by the 55 OSCE participating States.   Decision No. 16/05 Ensuring the Highest Standards of Conduct and  accountability of Persons Serving on International Forces and Missions       The Ministerial Council:       Reaffirming the OSCE commitments to combat trafficking in      human beings, in particular 2000 Vienna Ministerial Council      Decision No. 1, 2002 Porto Ministerial Declaration and      Maastricht Ministerial Decision No. 2/03 and the OSCE Action      Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, as well as its      addendum ``Addressing the Special Needs of Child Victims of      Trafficking for Protection and Assistance'',       Recalling the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress      and Punish Trafficking in     Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the      United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized      Crime, and its comprehensive definition of trafficking in      persons,       Reiterating that trafficking in human beings, a      contemporary form of slavery, seriously undermines the      enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,       Concerned that military and civilian personnel serving on      international peacekeeping forces or other international      missions, including contractors, as well as field presences      of international organizations including the OSCE could be a      contributing factor to the demand side of the trafficking      cycle,       Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations as well as      other international organizations to develop and enforce      ``zero-tolerance'' policies to prevent trafficking in human      beings by both forces and other staff, which, combined with      education and training, are required,       Recalling the ongoing activities in all relevant      international organizations aimed at the development of      common standards and best practices to prevent and combat      trafficking in human beings,       Concerned about reports of misconduct by military and      civilian personnel serving on international peacekeeping      forces or other international missions, including reports      of engaging in trafficking in human beings as defined in      the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and      Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and      Children, strongly condemning such acts, and noting that      they have a detrimental effect on the fulfillment of      mission mandates,       Concerned also about reports of misconduct by military and      civilian personnel serving on international peacekeeping      forces or other international missions including reports of      sexually exploiting and abusing local and refugee      populations, as well as reports of cases of forced labour,      strongly condemning such acts, and noting that they have a      detrimental effect on the fulfillment of mission mandates,       Emphasizing the need for more information and awareness-     raising concerning these issues among personnel serving on      international missions,       Taking note of efforts by the United Nations aimed at      ensuring that personnel serving on peacekeeping forces or      other international missions are held to the highest standard      of conduct and accountability,       1.

In this regard, the participating States will      seek to ensure that their national laws, regulations, and      other relevant documents can be enforced with respect to      their nationals who are serving on peacekeeping forces or      other international missions, with a view to ensuring the      highest standards of conduct and accountability;       2.
