 President, if I could say this before I yield the floor, and I am going to yield the floor right away, first of all, I appreciate the statement by the Senator from Delaware. He may have missed it, but sometime in my remarks tonight I made some commentary about his efforts to help work a compromise and bring up issues that were very important to get settled in order to move to finality.  Also, Mr. President, I want to tell you as well as other Members of this body, this bill is where it is because of the urgency Senator Carper has put on this legislation, to get it passed, because he knows of the need. He also understands the need of bipartisanship.  I hope I have given him proper credit in this way. So many times as we Senators do, we go to breakfasts or lunches to speak to groups that are interested in legislation, and they are always asking us about this bill or that bill. More often than not, particularly when I am talking to small business groups, I am often asked about when are we going to get class action reform. I say, under certain circumstances we will get it. Sometimes people compliment me because I was the prime sponsor of this legislation. But I say at every one of these meetings, they need to thank Senator Carper whenever they see him, because no person in the Senate is trying move this bill along and do it in a bipartisan way, no one more than Senator Carper.  I can say to Senator Carper, I thank him very much for what he has done and I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Who seeks recognition?
