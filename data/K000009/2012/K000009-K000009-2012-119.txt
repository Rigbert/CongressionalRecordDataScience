Speaker, during the Christmas Season we remember people farand near and reminisce about those who are no longer with us. I rise to remember Tom Joseph.  Of one fact I am sure, Tom Joseph passed from this life a very happy man. What a mountain of a human being! What a life force for GOOD! Tom was a born leader--for his family, his chosen profession, for our community and country. He achieved milestones . . . and he left them with us--in his children and loved ones; in the Plumbers & Pipefitters Training Center which his vision and zeal inspired and built; in the form of Frontpath, a transformative health care institution that exists and has helped thousands of citizens obtain more affordable health care because he made it possible. He was one-of-a-kind . . . just brimming with talent and inventiveness. He gave our community backbone!  Words that describe Tom Joseph: rare, strong, loving, good, fierce, free, solid, fun, wise, loyal. Words that capture his essence: ingenious, unselfish, superlative, irrepressible, indefatigable, hospitable, hilarious, irreverent, effective, analytical, creative, extraordinary.  Tom Joseph was a leader of laboring men and women. He dedicated his life as a builder--of family, of friendships, and enduring institutions of community that create a better life for the people of our country. It is not inappropriate to say he was a real Democrat--he felt it to his core and lived it. It did not come as a surprise to me to read in Tom's obituary that he asked donations to be sent to FreeSpeech.org and Habitat for Humanity.  Tom Joseph was Everyman. He lived life large and deeply. His voice was booming . . . you always knew when Tom was in the room. He was always concerned about others, never missed an opportunity to help others in any way he could.  Yet, his absolute first priority was his family. Terri and Tom's life is a love story: they met on a school bus and at 14, she knew she would marry him. Together they raised Angela, Heather and Daniel, and welcomed grandchildren. Through joy and sorrow Terri and Tom were committed to each other, to their children and grandchildren, to parents and siblings and friends. What a rare privilege to have shared a friendship with this extraordinary man. We are all bettered by our association with him. What he gave us will never die. Truly, Tom Joseph was a man for others. And that is no small feat.  Tom Joseph's legacy: what he gave to his family, his union, his community and country, immortalizes the words of newspaperman and labor activist William Cahn, ``The history of America has been largely created by the deeds of its working people and their organizations. Nor has this contribution been confined to raising wages and bettering work conditions; it has been fundamental to almost every effort to extend and strengthen our democracy.''                          ____________________
