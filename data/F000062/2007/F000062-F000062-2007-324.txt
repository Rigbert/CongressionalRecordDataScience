 President, I am pleased to join with Senator Sessions to re-introduce the Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act. Our legislation protects the safety of consumers who wish to fill legitimate prescriptions over the Internet, while holding accountable those who operate unregistered pharmacies.  This legislation imposes basic, commonsense requirements on an industry that presents both promise and peril.  First, this bill establishes disclosure standards for Internet pharmacies.  Second, this bill prohibits an Internet pharmacy from dispensing or selling a controlled substance without an in-person examination by a physician.  Third, it allows a State Attorney General to bring a civil action in a federal district court to enjoin a pharmacy operating in violation of the law, and to enforce compliance with the provisions of this law.  The disclosure requirements contained in this bill will allow patients to differentiate between shady off-shore pharmacies and legitimate licensed ones. Under this legislation, pharmacies must clearly disclose: the name and address of the pharmacy. Contact information for the pharmacist-in-charge. A list of States in which the pharmacy is licensed to operate.  They must also clearly post a statement that they comply with the requirements in this legislation.  The bill states that pharmacies can dispense to patients only if they have a valid prescription from a practitioner who has performed an in-person examination. This requirement will ensure that doctors can verify the health status of a patient and ensure that the drug he or she will receive from the pharmacy is medically appropriate.  This legislation recognizes that in the case of an emergency, a patient may not always be able to see his or her typical physician. For that reason, it allows a doctor to designate a covering practitioner to write a valid prescription if he or she is not available.  Finally, this bill contains real penalties to hold accountable those who continue to operate pharmacies in violation of these requirements.  First, for Internet sales of controlled substances, the bill makes clear that such activities are subject to the current Federal laws against illegal distributions and the same penalties applicable to hand-to-hand sales.  Second, the bill increases the penalties for illegal distributions of controlled substances categorized by the DEA as Schedule III, IV and V substances, with new penalties if death or serious bodily injury results, and longer periods of supervised release available after convictions.  The bill also allows a State's Attorney General to file a Federal motion to stop these pharmacies from operating illegally, no matter where the entity is headquartered. Previously, this type of enforcement would require a filing in every state.  Prescription drug abuse is a growing front on the War on Drugs, with 15.1 million adults admitting to abuse of prescription drugs in a 2003 study. That's a 94 percent increase in the last decade.  Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that deaths from accidental drug overdoses nearly doubled from 1999 to 2004, increasing from 11,155 in 1999 to 19,838 in 2004. Accidental drug overdoses are now the Nation's second-leading cause of accidental death, behind automobile crashes.  The CDC attributed the rise in drug overdose deaths to a higher use of prescription painkillers and increasing numbers of overdoses of cocaine and prescription sedatives. These increases did not occur in our inner cities; instead, the increase was described as being fueled by prescription drug abuse in middle-class, rural America--with overdose death rates doubling in 23 States, mostly in the South and Midwest.  Ready access to controlled substances over the Internet is helping to fuel these addictions. A study conducted by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University found at least 344 websites offering controlled substances.  89 percent of these pharmacies do not require a prescription from a physician, accepting either an online consultation or no prescription at all.  38 percent of these pharmacies claim their drugs are shipping within the United States, putting them within the reach of U.S. law enforcement.  We also know that internet pharmacies fill a disproportionate number of prescriptions for controlled substances. According to data from the National Community Pharmacy Association (NCPA)-Pfizer Digest, controlled substances account for only 11 percent of the business at community ``brick and mortar'' pharmacies. 89 percent of their business consists of non-controlled prescription drugs. In contrast, approximately 95 percent of the business done by internet pharmacies is controlled substances.  To understand how many of these Internet pharmacy websites exist, just visit any Internet search engine. Type in the name of any controlled substance, like Vicodin, Oxycontin, codeine, or even anabolic steroids. Several websites will appear, offering to sell you these drugs without a prescription and without a medical examination. Some of these websites simply ask patients to send copies of medical records, with no verification of their validity. Patients use these pharmacies to obtain addictive drugs like Vicodin and Oxycontin. They can receive these dangerous drugs without a doctor performing a physical exam to ensure that an underlying health condition will not cause a dangerous side effect. Often, a credit card is all that is required.  Law enforcement officials are well aware of this growing problem but face many challenges in trying to find and prosecute rogue pharmacy operators. Last year, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee and warned atthat time how ``the purchase of . . . controlled pharmaceuticals on the Internet is of great concern.'' He said that the Internet's wide accessibility and anonymity ``give drug abusers the ability to circumvent the law, as well as sound medical practice, a[s] they dispense potentially dangerous controlled pharmaceuticals,'' and said that, with ``no identifying . . . information on these websites, it is very difficult for law enforcement to track any of the individuals behind them.''  In January of this year, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales again appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The problem had only grown worse. He described the non-medicinal use of controlled substance prescription drugs as ``the fastest rising category of drug abuse in recent years.'' He noted how ``[r]ogue pharmacies operating illicitly through the Internet increasingly have become a source for the illegal supply of controlled substances,'' and offered to work with Congress to try to adopt additional enforcement tools that may be appropriate.  I believe that the bill I introduce today will address many of these problems that the Attorney General has identified.  At the same time, receiving medications from a legitimate, licensed Internet pharmacy is one of the new conveniences ushered in by the Internet age. This bill preserves the ability of well run pharmacies and well intentioned patients to access controlled substances by means of the Internet.  In closing, I want to share with you the story of Ryan T. Haight of La Mesa, CA. Ryan was an 18-year-old honor student from La Mesa, CA, when he died in his home on February 12, 2001.  His parents found a bottle of Vicodin in his room with a label from an out-of-state pharmacy.  It turns out that Ryan had been ordering addictive drugs online and paying with a debit card his parents gave him to buy baseball cards on eBay.  Without a physical exam or his parents' consent, Ryan had been obtaining controlled substances, some from an Internet site in Oklahoma. It only took a few months before Ryan's life was ended by an overdose on a cocktail of painkillers.  Ryan's story is just one of many. Internet pharmacies are making it increasingly easy for teens like Ryan to access deadly prescription drugs. That is why I support this legislation. It creates sensible requirements for Internet pharmacy websites that will not impact access to convenient, oftentimes cost-saving drugs.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 980       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(d) Online Prescription Requirement.--Section 309 of the      Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 829) is amended by      adding at the end the following new subsection:       ``(e) Controlled Substances Dispensed by Means of the      Internet.--(1) As used in this subsection--       ``(A) the term `valid prescription' means a prescription      that is issued for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual      course of professional practice that is based upon a      qualifying medical relationship by a practitioner registered      by the Attorney General under this part;       ``(B) the term `qualifying medical relationship'--       ``(i) means a medical relationship that exists when the      practitioner--       ``(I) has conducted at least one medical evaluation with      the user in the physical presence of the practitioner,      without regard to whether portions of the evaluation are      conducted by other health professionals; or       ``(II) conducts a medical evaluation of the patient as a      covering practitioner and is not prescribing a controlled      substance in schedule II, III, or IV; and       ``(ii) shall not be construed to imply that one medical      evaluation described in clause (i) demonstrates that a      prescription has been issued for a legitimate medical purpose      within the usual course of professional practice; and       ``(C) the term `covering practitioner' means, with respect      to a patient, a practitioner who conducts a medical      evaluation, without regard to whether the medical evaluation      of the patient involved is an in-person evaluation, at the      request of a practitioner who has conducted at least one in-     person medical evaluation of the patient and is temporarily      unavailable to conduct the evaluation of the patient.       ``(2) In addition to the requirements of subsections (a)      through (c), no controlled substance may be delivered,      distributed, or dispensed by means of the Internet without a      valid prescription.       ``(3) Nothing in this subsection shall apply to--       ``(A) the dispensing of a controlled substance pursuant to      telemedicine practices sponsored by--       ``(i) a hospital that has in effect a provider agreement      under title XVIII of the Social Security Act; or       ``(ii) a group practice that has not fewer than 100      physicians who have in effect provider agreements under such      title; or       ``(B) the dispensing or selling of a controlled substance      pursuant to practices as determined by the Attorney General      by regulation.''.
