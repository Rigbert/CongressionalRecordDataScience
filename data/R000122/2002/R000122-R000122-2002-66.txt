President, I rise today to introduce the Bengin Brain Tumor Cancer Registries Amendment Act. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Fitzgerald, Cantwell, and DeWine in this effort.  This legislation seeks to ensure that all forms of brain tumors are accounted for under the National Program of Cancer Registries. While the distinction between benign and malignant is often the difference between life and death for many kinds of tumors, it is not so clear when it comes to tumors of the brain. Depending on location and size, a brain tumor that is classified as benign can be equally life threatening as a malignant brain tumor.  It is estimated that benign brain tumors account for almost 40 percent of the 35,000 brain tumors diagnosed each year. Currently, 21 States, including my home State of Rhode Island, collect data on malignant as well as benign brain tumors. Yet, there is no mechanism in place to track the incidence of benign brain tumors at the Federal level. Moreover, variation exists in how different states have defined a benign brain tumor. This lack of consistent data on the incidence of benign brain tumors has hindered the ability of the scientific community to invest appropriate resources into brain tumor research.  While our current data is insufficient, disturbing trends related to brain tumors are nevertheless beginning to emerge. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer death for children and the third leading cause of cancer death in young adults ages 15-34. Since 1975, the incidence of brain tumors has increased 25 percent for reasons that remain unknown. Tragically, our limited scientific and medical understanding of brain tumors is related to their incredibly high mortality rates. Only 37 percent of males and 52 percent of females survive five-years following the diagnosis of a primary benign or malignant brain tumor.  By incorporating the collection of benign brain tumor data into the National Program of Cancer Registries, we will take a crucial first step toward better understanding the possible causes of this affliction and enhancing the ability of the medical community to devise improved methods of diagnosis and treatment for all brain tumors.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure swift consideration and passage of this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2558       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Benign Brain Tumor Cancer      Registries Amendment Act''.     SEC. 2. NATIONAL PROGRAM OF CANCER REGISTRIES; BENIGN BRAIN-                   RELATED TUMORS AS ADDITIONAL CATEGORY OF DATA                    COLLECTED.       (a) In General.--Section 399B of the Public Health Service      Act (42 U.S.C. 280e), as redesignated by section 502(2)(A) of      Public Law 106-310 (114 Stat. 1115), is amended in subsection      (a)--       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (5) as      subparagraphs (A) through (E), respectively and indenting      appropriately;       (2) by striking ``(a) In General.--The Secretary'' and      inserting the following:       ``(a) In General.--       ``(1) Statewide cancer registries.--The Secretary'';       (3) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A) (as so      redesignated), by striking ``population-based'' and all that      follows through ``data'' and inserting the following:      ``population-based, statewide registries to collect, for each      condition specified in paragraph (2)(A), data''; and       (4) by adding at the end the following:       ``(2) Cancer; benign brain-related tumors.--       ``(A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the      conditions referred to in this paragraph are the following:       ``(i) Each form of in-situ and invasive cancer (with the      exception of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the      skin), including malignant brain-related tumors.       ``(ii) Benign brain-related tumors.       ``(B) Brain-related tumor.--For purposes of subparagraph      (A):       ``(i) The term `brain-related tumor' means a listed primary      tumor (whether malignant or benign) occurring in any of the      following sites:       ``(I) The brain, meninges, spinal cord, cauda equina, a      cranial nerve or nerves, or any other part of the central      nervous system.       ``(II) The pituitary gland, pineal gland, or      craniopharyngeal duct.       ``(ii) The term `listed', with respect to a primary tumor,      means a primary tumor that is listed in the International      Classification of Diseases for Oncology (commonly referred to      as the ICD-O).       ``(iii) The term `International Classification of Diseases      for Oncology' means a classification system that includes      topography (site) information and histology (cell type      information) developed by the World Health Organization, in      collaboration with international centers, to promote      international comparability in the collection,      classification, processing, and presentation of cancer      statistics. The ICD-O system is a supplement to the      International Statistical Classification of Diseases and      Related Health Problems (commonly known as the ICD) and is      the standard coding system used by cancer registries      worldwide. Such term includes any modification made to such      system for purposes of the United States. Such term further      includes any published classification system that is      internationally recognized as a successor to the      classification system referred to in the first sentence of      this clause.       ``(C) Statewide cancer registry.--References in this      section to cancer registries shall be considered to be      references to registries described in this subsection.''.       (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by subsection (a)      apply to grants under section 399B of the Public Health      Service Act     for fiscal year 2002 and subsequent fiscal years, except      that, in the case of a State that received such a grant for      fiscal year 2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Services      may delay the applicability of such amendments to the State      for not more than 12 months if the Secretary determines that      compliance with such amendments requires the enactment of a      statute by the State or the issuance of State regulations.                                 ______                                       By
