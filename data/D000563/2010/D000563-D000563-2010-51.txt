 Mr. President, I don't know what the most effective way is in Washington to lobby a bill, but I will tell you that there are no more effective spokesmen and spokeswomen for the DREAM Act than the young men and women who have been walking the Halls of the Senate over the last several weeks, months, and years. They wear caps and gowns, as if they are headed for a graduation, which is what they want to do. They have made the case in a way that I could not on the floor of the Senate because of their determination and the dignity they have brought to us.  Stick with us, I say to each one of them. Don't give up. Tomorrow, we are going to try our very best to rally the votes we need because our cause is right and our time is now.
