President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI requires each committee to adopt rules to govern the procedure of the Committee and to publish those rules in the Congressional Record not later than March 1 of the first year of each Congress. On February 26, 2003, a majority of the members of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations adopted subcommittee rules of procedure.  Consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the rules of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:108th Congress Rules of Procedure for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs as Adopted--                           February 26, 2003       1. No public hearing connected with an investigation may be      held without approval of either the Chairman and the Ranking      Minority Member or the approval of a majority of the Members      of the Subcommittee. In all cases, notification to all      Members of the intent to hold hearings must be given at least      7 days in advance to the date of the hearing. The Ranking      Minority Member should be kept fully apprised of preliminary      inquiries, investigations, and hearings. Preliminary      inquiries may be initiated by the Subcommittee majority staff      upon the approval of the Chairman and notice of such approval      to the Ranking Minority Member or the minority counsel.      Preliminary inquiries may be undertaken by the minority staff      upon the approval of the Ranking Minority Member and notice      of such approval to the Chairman or Chief Counsel.      Investigations may be undertaken upon the approval of the      Chairman of the Subcommittee and the Ranking Minority Member      with notice of such approval to all members.       No public hearing shall be held if the minority Members      unanimously object, unless the full Committee on Governmental      Affairs by a majority vote approves of such public hearing.       Senate Rules will govern all closed sessions convened by      the Subcommittee (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the      Senate).       2. Subpoenas for witnesses, as well as documents and      records, may be authorized and issued by the Chairman, or any      other Member of the Subcommittee designated by him, with      notice to the Ranking Minority Member. A written notice of      intent to issue a subpoena shall be provided to the Chairman      and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or staff      officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee Chairman or      a staff officer designated by him, immediately upon such      authorization, and no subpoena shall issue for at least 48      hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from delivery to the      appropriate offices, unless the Chairman and Ranking Minority      Member waive the 48 hour waiting period or unless the      Subcommittee Chairman certifies in writing to the Chairman      and Ranking Minority Member that, in his opinion, it is      necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.       3. The Chairman shall have the authority to call meetings      of the Subcommittee. This authority may be delegated by the      Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when      necessary.       4. If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire the      Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file in the      office of the Subcommittee, a written request therfor,      addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk      of the Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of such      request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of such      request, the Chairman fails to call the requested special      meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar days after the      filing of such request, a majority of the Subcommittee      Members may file in the office of the Subcommittee their      written notice that a special Subcommittee meeting will be      held, specifying the date and hour thereof, and the      Subcommittee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately      upon the filing of such notice, the Subcommittee clerk      shall notify all Subcommittee Members that such special      meeting will be held and inform them of its dates and      hour. If the Chairman is not present at any regular,      additional or special meeting, the ranking majority Member      present shall preside.       5. For public or executive sessions, one Member of the      Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering      of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or      subject matter.       Five (5) Members of the Subcommittee shall constitute a      quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee business other      than the administering of oaths and the taking of testimony.       6. All witnesses at public or executive hearings who      testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.       7. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his      counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a manner      as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with      the orderly administration of such hearing, the Chairman or      presiding Member of the Subcommittee present during such      hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his      representation or any law enforcement official to eject said      person from the hearing room.       8. Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such      witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony      of such witness at any public or executive hearing, and to      advise such witness while he/she is testifying, or his legal      rights, Provided, however, that in the case of any witness      who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a      corporation or association, the Subcommittee Chairman may      rule that representative by counsel from the government,      corporation, or association, or by counsel representing other      witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that the      witness may only be represented during interrogation by staff      or during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal      counsel not from the government, corporation, or association,      or by personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This      rule shall not be construed to excuse a witness from      testifying in the event his counsel is ejected for conducting      himself in such a manner so as to prevent, impede, disrupt,      obstruct, or interfere with the orderly administration of the      hearings; nor shall this rule be construed as authorizing      counsel to coach the witness or answer for the witness. The      failure of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse      such witness from complying with a subpoena or deposition      notice.       9. Depositions.       9.1 Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an      investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be      authorized and issued by the Chairman. The Chairman of the      full Committee and the Ranking Minority Member of the      Subcommittee shall be kept fully apprised of the      authorization for the taking of depositions. Such notices      shall specify a time and place of examination, and the name      of the Subcommittee Member or Members or staff officer or      officers who will take the deposition. The deposition      shall be in private. The Subcommittee shall not initiate      procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement      proceedings for a witness' failure to appear unless the      deposition notice was accompanied by a Subcommittee      subpoena.       9.2 Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition      by counsel to advise them of their legal rights, subject to      the provisions of Rule 8.       9.3 Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath      administered by an individual authorized by local law to      administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by      Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as      to the form of questions shall     be noted for the record. If a witness objects to a question      and refuses to testify on the basis of relevance or      privilege, the Subcommittee Members or staff may proceed with      the deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time,      seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from      the Chairman or such Subcommittee Member as designated by      him. If the Chairman or designated Member overrules the      objection, he/she may refer the matter to the Subcommittee or      he/she may order and direct the witness to answer the      question, but the Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures      leading to civil or criminal enforcement unless the witness      refuses to testify after he/she has been ordered and directed      to answer by a Member of the Subcommittee.       9.4 Filing. The subcommittee staff shall see that the      testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is      transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for      review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual      administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that      the witness was duly sworn in his presence, the transcriber      shall certify that the transcript is a true record of the      testimony, and the transcript shall then be filed with the      Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff may stipulate with the      witness to changes in this procedure; deviations from this      procedure which do not substantially impair the reliability      of the record shall not relieve the witness from his      obligation to testify truthfully.       10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written      statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy      of such statement with the Chief Counsel or Chairman of the      Subcommittee 48 hours in advance of the hearings at which the      statement is to be presented unless the Chairman and the      Ranking Minority Member waive this requirement. The      Subcommittee shall determine whether such statement may be      read or placed in the record of the hearing.       11. A witness may request, on grounds of distraction,      harassment, personal safety, or physical discomfort, that      during the testimony, television, motion picture, and other      cameras and lights shall not be directed at him. Such      requests shall be ruled on by the Subcommittee Members      present at the hearing.       12. An accurate stenographic record shall be kept of the      testimony of all witnesses in executive and public hearings.      The record of his own testimony whether in public or      executive session shall be made available for inspection by      witness or his counsel under Subcommittee supervision; a copy      of any testimony given in public session or that part of      the testimony given by the witness in executive session      and subsequently quoted or made part of the record in a      public session shall be made available to any witness at      his expense if he/she so requests.       13. Interrogation of witnesses at Subcommittee hearings      shall be conducted on behalf of the Subcommittee by Members      and authorized Subcommittee staff personnel only.       14. Any person who is the subject of an investigation in      public hearings may submit to the Chairman of the      Subcommittee questions in writing for the cross-examination      of other witnesses called by the Subcommittee. With the      consent of a majority of the Members of the Subcommittee      present and voting, these questions, or paraphrased versions      of them, shall be put to the witness by the Chairman, by a      Member of the Subcommittee or by counsel of the Subcommittee.       15. Any person whose name is mentioned or who is      specifically identified, and who believes that testimony or      other evidence presented at a public hearing, or comment made      by a Subcommittee Member or counsel, tends to defame him or      otherwise adversely affect his reputation, may (a) request to      appear personally before the Subcommittee to testify in his      own behalf, or, in the alternative, (b) file a sworn      statement of facts relevant to the testimony or other      evidence or comment complained of. Such request and such      statement shall be submitted to the Subcommittee for its      consideration and action.       If a person requests to appear personally before the      Subcommittee pursuant to alternative (a) referred to herein,      said request shall be considered untimely if it is not      received by the Chairman of the Subcommittee or its counsel      in writing on or before thirty (30) days subsequent to the      day on which said person's name was mentioned or otherwise      specifically identified during a public hearing held before      the Subcommittee, unless the Chairman and the Ranking      Minority Member waive this requirement.       If a person requests the filing of his sworn statement      pursuant to alternative (b) referred to herein, the      Subcommittee may condition the filing of said sworn statement      upon said person agreeing to appear personally before the      Subcommittee and to testify concerning the matters contained      in his sworn statement, as well as any other matters related      to the subject of the investigation before the Subcommittee.       16. All testimony taken in executive session shall be kept      secret and will not be released for public information      without the approval of a majority of the Subcommittee.       17. No Subcommittee report shall be released to the public      unless approved by a majority of the Subcommittee and after      no less than 10 days' notice and opportunity for comment by      the Members of the Subcommittee unless the need for such      notice and opportunity to comment has been waived in writing      by a majority of the minority Members.       18. The Ranking Minority Member may select for appointment      to the Subcommittee staff a Chief Counsel for the minority      and such other professional staff members and clerical      assistants as he/she deems advisable. The total compensation      allocated to such minority staff members shall be not less      than one-third the total amount allocated for all      Subcommittee staff salaries during any given year. The      minority staff members shall work under the direction and      supervision of the Ranking Minority Member. The Chief Counsel      for the minority shall be kept fully informed as to      preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings, and      shall have access to all material in the files of the      Subcommittee.       19. When it is determined by the Chairman and Ranking      Minority Member, or by a majority of the Subcommittee, that      there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of law      may have occurred, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member      by letter, or the Subcommittee by resolution, are authorized      to report such violation to the proper State, local and/or      Federal authorities. Such letter or report may recite the      basis for the determination of reasonable cause. This rule is      not authority for release of documents or testimony.                          ____________________
