I know he is opposed to the Ex-Im Bank reauthorization.  As you know, we passed it in a bipartisan fashion when the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cantor) was the majority leader, and the gentleman voted for it. He has changed his mind. Certainly many of us do that from time to time.  But my question to him is: If they don't do what the gentleman suggests--i.e., a clean highway bill--and they send it back, as, apparently, Leader McConnell thought that they would do, consistent with his representation to the Senator from Washington State and others--if they add the Ex-Im Bank to that bill and it comes back--I know the gentleman is reluctant to speculate. But we have a very, very short period of time left in this session before the August break.  Does the gentleman believe that, if it comes back and is in the highway bill, that we would make the Export-Import Bank portion of that bill at least open to amendment?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  And if I just may correct the gentleman, he took the liberty of saying whether I changed my mind. I did vote for the Ex-Im Bank 2 years ago, but I voted for an Ex-Im Bank that had reform in it. I have not seen that reform. I did not change my mind. I kept my principle. The same principle that I have is my best advice to the Senate.  I know you want to talk hypotheticals, and I know our colloquy is about next week. But none of that is scheduled for next week.  But to the gentleman and to the Senate, my best advice for them is to pass our clean highway bill and send it to the President.
