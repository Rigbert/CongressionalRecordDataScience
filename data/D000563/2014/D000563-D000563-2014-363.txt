There was a time in the Senate when you didn't have to have 60 votes to even start debating an issue. But is it my understanding, now that we are building up to a vote on Wednesday to see if five Republicans will cross the aisle and join us so we can have a debate the floor of the Senate on whether we can refinance college student loans, we have to wait 2 days?
