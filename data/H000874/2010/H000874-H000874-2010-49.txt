 I am going to give him the same answer: I am not going to anticipate. I find it not a very productive endeavor to anticipate what the United States Senate will do. I have been so disappointed so often on that speculation that I am not going to enter into such speculation today.  However, I will tell the gentleman, as I have said some weeks running now, that it is my intention that we will have a bill pass this House and pass the Senate, for that matter, that funds the troops prior to our leaving for our August break.
