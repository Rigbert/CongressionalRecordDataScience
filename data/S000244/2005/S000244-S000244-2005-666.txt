Chairman, this amendment that I am offering contains two provisions. The first would amend title XVIII to eliminate any statute of limitations on criminal prosecutions for kidnapping a child, committing a felony sex offense, or a human trafficking violation.  Eliminating these statutes for these crimes reflects the increased use of the success of DNA in solving decade-old crimes. We have all heard about individuals who have been exonerated by DNA evidence. However, there are even more reports of unsolved cases that have been solved and a perpetrator identified by DNA evidence years after the crime was committed.  This provision reflects this new reality and allows Federal prosecutors to prosecute sex offenders and child abusers who have escaped apprehension because of the statute of limitations.  I would note that this same provision was passed by the House in the 108th Congress as a part of the Child Abduction Prevention Act by the overwhelming vote of 410 to 4. It was modified in conference with the Senate as a part of the Protect Act.  The second provision in this amendment raises the class on the existing misdemeanor for failure to report child abuse, thereby raising the maximum penalty for such an offense from 6 months' imprisonment to a year imprisonment.  I strongly urge support of the amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner).  The amendment was agreed to.
