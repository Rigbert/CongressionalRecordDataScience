Jesse J. Morando, 2007-2008 State Commander for the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Department of Indiana. A lifelong resident of Northwest Indiana, Jesse is one of the most passionate and involved citizens that I have ever known, especially when it comes to his service to our veterans. To honor Jesse for his constant efforts to better the quality of life for Indiana's veterans, a testimonial dinner will be held at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 802 Hall in Hammond, Indiana, on Sunday, April 13, 2008.  Jesse James Morando was born in East Chicago, Indiana, the fourth of ten children. After relocating to Whiting, Indiana, in 1958, Jesse attended Immaculate Conception for grade school. Jesse's involvement in community activities began at an early age, when he excelled as a member of the Boy Scouts of America, eventually reaching the rank of Eagle Scout. Recognized as one of Whiting's young leaders, Jesse was even appointed ``Mayor for a Day.'' As a high school student at Whiting High School, Jesse excelled in athletics, participating on both the football and wrestling teams.  Following his graduation from Whiting High School, Jesse joined the United States Marine Corps and served a tour of duty in Vietnam. After receiving his honorable discharge from the Marine Corps in 1973, Jesse returned to Northwest Indiana and accepted a position at the Amoco, now BP, refinery in Whiting, where he has 27 years of service and has completed an apprentice program in pipe fitting and welding. Jesse's service, however, to veterans and to the Northwest Indiana community has remained a constant throughout his lifetime.  While he is well-known as the State Commander of the VFW, Jesse has also been involved in numerous other veterans' and service organizations in Northwest Indiana. Jesse is a life member of the American Legion Post 80 and the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2724 in Whiting, and also a member of the 40/8 Voiture 470 First District of Indiana, the AMVETS Post 64 in Whiting, the Indiana Freemasons, and the Mixtecas Motorcycle Group. Additionally, he is a life member of the VFW National Home.  Early on, Jesse learned that the best way to improve his community and to help people was to get involved. In many different roles, Jesse has remained true to one goal, to make a difference in society. From his service to veterans to his involvement in programs geared toward helping those in need, be it physically or financially, Jesse has always been a driving force in bettering the lives of many people. While it is impossible to list all of the ways in which Jesse has served his community, to name a few, Jesse has been a coach for the Challenger baseball team, where he assisted with obtaining funds to pay for the Field of Dreams in Hammond, Indiana. This outstanding program was aimed at affording physically challenged children the opportunityto play baseball. He has also assisted with the Special Olympics, participated in motorcycle runs for Toys-for-Tots and other organizations to help those in need, been a personal donor for Locks of Love, and for the past six years, he has volunteered his time to the March of Dimes, raising money and assisting participants at an annual event in Highland, Indiana.  A loving husband, father, and grandfather, Jesse's commitment to veterans throughout Indiana is surpassed only by his love for his family. Jesse and his loving wife, Laura, are the proud parents of five children: Jennifer, Samantha, Sara, Elizabeth, and Jesse III, and three adoring grandchildren: Kali Rose, James IV, and Jaslyn.  Madam Speaker, Jesse Morando has selflessly given his time and efforts to not only veterans, but to many other groups as well, throughout his lifetime of service. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him for his leadership and dedication. He serves as a true inspiration in the eyes of a grateful community.                          ____________________
