 President, a few weeks ago the president of the ABA a--purportedly nonpartisan organization--wrote a letter to the majority and Republican leaders regarding nominations and the Leahy-Thurmond rule. I noticed that my good friend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee entered a copy of that letter in the Record.  That letter failed to mention quite a few pertinent facts. The Republican leader and I sent the ABA a letter which highlighted some of those facts. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Office of the Republican Leader,                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2012.     Mr. William T. (Bill) Robinson III,     President, American Bar Association, 321 North Clark Street,          Chicago, IL.       Dear Mr. Robinson: We were surprised to receive your letter      of June 20, 2012 urging, for the first time, confirmation of      particular circuit court nominees despite the existence of      the Leahy-Thurmond Rule. By any objective measure--overall      circuit court vacancy rate, vacancies on the respective      circuit courts, or judicial emergency designation--our      appellate courts are doing, at least as well, and in most      respects much better, now than when our democratic colleagues      invoked the Rule both times during the last administration.      Given this exceptionally fair treatment of President Obama's      judicial nominees, it is curious that your organization would      choose now to urge the Senate not to follow its practice of      suspending the processing of circuit court nominations in the      months preceding a presidential election. This unprecedented      action raises questions about the American Bar Association's      objectivity and neutrality.       While the circuit court vacancy rate in June 2008 was the      same as it is now, there were twice as many judicial      emergencies in the circuit courts at that time. The Fourth      Circuit Court of Appeals, in fact, was in crisis. Fully one-     fourth of its seats were empty, even though the prior      administration had nominated outstanding individuals to till      them. Despite the crisis facing the Fourth Circuit in June of      2008, our democratic colleagues refused to process any of      President George W. Bush's four, well qualified nominees.       For instance, the Senate twice had unanimously confirmed      Judge Robert Conrad to the important positions of United      States Attorney and federal district court judge. By this      time in June of 2008. his nomination to the Fourth Circuit      had been pending for 344 days. Our democratic colleagues      refused to process his nomination, notwithstanding support      from home state senators, a unanimous well qualified rating      from your organization, and--in contradistinction to any of      the three nominees mentioned in your letter--the      Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts had declared the      vacancy to which he was nominated to be a judicial emergency.       Senate democrats refused to process three other qualified      nominees to the Fourth Circuit. Steve Matthews had support      from home state senators, and by this time in 2008, had been      pending for 293 days. Judge Glen Conrad had been confirmed to      the district court in 2003 by the unanimous vote of 89-0.      Both home state senators, one republican and one democrat,      strongly supported his nomination. Rod Rosenstein, the then      and current U.S. Attorney for Maryland, also would have      filled a judicial emergency on the Fourth Circuit.      Nonetheless, democrat home state Senators blocked his      nomination--incredibly--for the reason that he was doing a      ``good job'' as U.S. Attorney and ``that's where [they] need      him.''       Our democratic colleagues' record with respect to these      nominees was so abysmal that even the Washington Post      editorial board called them to task, writing. ``[T]he Senate      should act in good faith to fill vacancies--not as a favor to      the president but out of respect for the residents,      businesses, defendants and victims of crime in the region the      4th Circuit covers.'' The ABA, by contrast, said nothing when      Senate democrats invoked the Leahy-Thurmond Rule and stopped      processing circuit court nominations in June of 2008. These      outstanding nominees, along with others like Peter Keisler--     who by this date in June of 2008 had been bottled up in      committee for an astonishing 727 days--did not merit any      special consideration by the ABA in the months preceding the      last presidential election.       The situation on our circuit courts was equally dismal in      June of 2004 when President Bush was concluding his first      term in office. The overall vacancy rate on our circuit      courts was much higher than it is now. And the Sixth Circuit,      like the Fourth Circuit in 2008, was in crisis, with fully      one-fourth of its seats empty, even though the prior      administration had nominated qualified individuals to fill      those vacancies as well. And as in 2008. the ABA said nothing      when our democratic colleagues cited the Leahy-Thurmond      Rule--this time to justify filibustering several circuit      court nominees in the months preceding the 2004 presidential      election.       The ABA presents itself to the public as a non-partisan.      professional organization. However, it has chosen to advocate      for this Administration's circuit court nominees in the few      remaining months before this presidential election, when it      chose not to do so before either of the last two presidential      elections despite much more compelling circumstances. This      sort of selective advocacy is precisely why so many people      question the ABA's professed neutrality.       We will continue to work with the senate majority to      process judicial nominations, consistent with the practices      of the Senate--practices strongly defended by our Democratic      colleagues during the previous administration and about which      the ABA said nothing. Indeed, the Senate will vote on another      judicial nomination tomorrow. If confirmed, that will be the      151st lower court confirmation already for this      Administration, in addition to two Supreme Court      nominations--a confirmation total far greater than what was      achieved under comparable circumstances during the last      administration. We hope that in the future the ABA will take      a balanced approach to assessing the judicial confirmation      process in the Senate.           Sincerely,     Mitch McConnell,       Republican Leader, U.S. Senate.     Chuck Grassley,       Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee U.S. Senate.                          ____________________
