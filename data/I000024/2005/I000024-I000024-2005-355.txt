President.  First, let me advise everyone where we are right now. We will be having a vote at the conclusion of my remarks on the motion to proceed. Tomorrow there will be actually a vote on the resolution. And tomorrow is the significant vote. There has been a lot of talk about today's motion, but tomorrow's is very significant.  I have to say it appears to me this is highly politically charged, that we would be talking about this at this time. Of course, we have the confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice, as the Senator from Vermont knows. He is very diligently involved in that confirmation process. We have the catastrophe down in Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana. Yet we are taking time to do this.  I have to ask the question, Is there anyone in this Chamber who believes the President would sign legislation to repeal his own administration's rule? As the Senator from Ohio pointed out, the President has already announced he is going to veto this resolution in the event it passes. So we are not really accomplishing anything.  I have to say, this is hardly the time to discuss overturning an existing clean air regulation that relies on an approach that is proven to be effective. There were sceptics back when acid rain came along as to the cap-and-trade procedure. It has worked; we know that.  Let's look at the economics for a minute. No one has talked about that.  This resolution is intended to force the Environmental Protection Agency to impose a very costly and potentially devastating regulation in place of the existing Clean Air Mercury Rule, which relies on an already well-proven market-based approach, as I just mentioned. The current EPA approach will cut mercury emissions by 70 percent--70 percent--at an estimated cost of $2 billion. Supporters of this resolution prefer a maximum achievable control technology--MACT--standard which is not nearly as cost effective.  Supporters also want the MACT standard to cut mercury by 90 percent. The independent Energy Information Administration has found that the implementation of a 90-percent MACT standard within 3 years would cost up to $358 billion. I did not say ``million,'' I said ``billion.''  The additional $356 billion of the MACT--which is much more than the current rule will cost--is projected to only reduce mercury deposition in the United States by about 2 percent more than the current regulation. As we can see from the chart that is behind us, 22-percent higher electricity prices and costs would be $358 billion.  A 90-percent MACT would have devastating consequences on natural gas supplies which are already in a crisis. According to the EIA, the Energy Information Administration, it could increase by 10 percent the natural gas used by utilities that are forced to fuel switch. The Senator from Ohio talked about the fact they would have to switch from coal to natural gas. I think everyone understands that would happen.  This would also cripple industries that rely on natural gas, such as the chemical industry, which has already lost 90,000 jobs since the year 2000 due in large part to the rising cost of natural gas. We have talked about that on the Senate floor. We discussed that in our committee, the EPW Committee.  This last weekend I was in Lawton, Altus, and Frederick, OK. That is in the far southwestern part of the State. The farmers down there have received through their organizations what would be the increased cost of fertilizer. One of the main components of fertilizer is natural gas. They really cannot take any more hits. So it goes far beyond just the chemical industry.  The most effective, most flexible, and least burdensome way to achieve mercury reduction is to build on the most successful part of the Clean Air Act, the acid rain program. Many Senators resisted the acid rain program, saying there would be hot spots and compliance problems, yet there have been no hot spots and, unlike with most of the Clean Air Act, virtually no enforcement problems. As the senior Senator from Vermont said in 1999:       When we were debating controls for acid rain, we heard a      lot about the enormous cost of eliminating sulfur dioxide.      But what we learned from the acid rain program is that when      you give industry a financial incentive to clean up its act,      they will find the cheapest way of doing it.  I think he was correct. That is exactly what the current rule under which we are operating does, the cap and trade, similar to the successful program that was used in acid rain. Moreover, supporters of the resolution that is under consideration assume the cap and trade mercury rule would be replaced with a 90-percent MACT rule. When the EPA first proposed the cap and trade approach last year, it also proposed a MACT approach. The MACT it proposed as complying with the law would only cut mercury emissions by 29 percent--not 90 percent, 29 percent. Yet here we have a rule that cuts mercury by 70 percent, and it costs less because it uses cap and trade. Why would the sponsors of this resolution want to get only a 29-percent reduction in mercury?  Actual deposition and its variety of sources are rarely discussed. Mercury emissions are not exclusive to powerplants. In fact, U.S. powerplants contribute but 1 percent of the globaltotal, according to Josef Pacyna of the Norwegian Institute of Air Research, as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An enormous amount originates in Asia. More than half of mercury emissions are nationally occurring. Given that statistic, mercury will be present in the human bloodstream regardless of whether powerplants are regulated by a cap and trade emissions reduction program or the more costly but less effective MACT standard--or, for that matter, even if all powerplants and manufacturing facilities in the country were to be shut down altogether.  EPA data shows that eliminating U.S. powerplants from the mercury deposition equation would have virtually no effect on reducing actual deposition. Throughout New England, for example, the range of deposition levels would be unchanged. With or without powerplants, deposition levels are between 10 and 15 micrograms per square meter in the overwhelming majority of the area. Where there is a reduction, the amount is negligible.  These four charts created by the EPA using state-of-the-art computer modeling tell the story. As you can see in chart No. 5, throughout the country mercury deposition from all sources ranges from as low as 5 to 10 micrograms, up to more than 20 micrograms per square meter. The next chart, in contrast, shows that powerplants contribute less than 1 microgram per square meter for most of the country, including virtually the entire United States. Nonetheless, it is true that in most of the East, powerplants are responsible for 1 to 10 micrograms per square meter of the deposition. In a small region of the country, they cause as much as 10 to 20 micrograms. That is why the EPA has issued its regulation.  The next chart, however, is revealing. With the EPA's rule, powerplants will contribute less than 1 microgram in the vast majority of the country and less than 5 micrograms anywhere else. Clearly, the EPA rule is effective. Yet despite the effectiveness of the EPA rule, some are advocating overturning a 70-percent emission reduction in the hopes of eking out a slightly greater reduction of 90 percent.  This last chart, No. 8, completes the story. Even if all powerplants in the country were shut down, mercury deposition would be at least 5 to 10 micrograms; that is, if we shut down all powerplants. All we are addressing now is powerplants, and a lot of people are deceived into thinking that powerplants is where you get your problem with mercury. That is not it. One percent of the total is in powerplants. Even if all powerplants in the country were shut down, mercury deposition would be at least 5 to 10 micrograms. In half the country, it is 10 to 15 micrograms. In a significant portion of the country, it ranges from 15 to more than 20 micrograms.  Look at this chart. Now go back to chart 3. It is incredible that some Senators are willing to roll back EPA's current rule when deposition from powerplants will be negligible compared to other sources. EPA believes we should act now to reduce emissions of mercury from the powerplants so we can achieve the progress you see in chart No. 7. Repealing the section 111 rule would be a step backward in our efforts to regulate mercury emissions from powerplants. It would create enormous uncertainty for the States. Keep in mind that prior to 6 months ago, when the President came out with a cap and trade restriction on mercury, we had no restriction on mercury in powerplants. It was nonexistent. In the absence of the mercury rule, there will be no Federal regulation of mercury from existing powerplants, at least in the foreseeable future. Repealing EPA's rule would roll back the 70-percent reductions required by the agency and eliminate incentives for the development of new mercury-specific control technologies.  It is not appropriate for Congress to address this issue. The very people who claim that EPA acted improperly have asked the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to review the EPA's action to determine if their actions were proper or improper. The court would thoroughly review the legal and factual basis for the EPA's determination. There is no reason for Congress to interfere with this process. Congress can take affirmative action on mercury emissions by passing the Clear Skies legislation.  We went through this. We have been working for 2 years to get the President's Clear Skies legislation passed. Clear Skies legislation mandates a 70-percent reduction in SOX, NOX, and in mercury. And for some reason those individuals who claim to be concerned about the environment would rather have no mandated reduction at all. We have the opportunity now to do that. Clear Skies cuts mercury emissions from the power section by 70 percent. The President's Clear Skies legislation is a more effective, long-term mechanism to achieve large scale national reductions of not only mercury but sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Clear Skies legislation applies nationwide and is modeled on the highly successful acid rain program, a program many people have said was not going to work, was not going to be effective. Yet we all now realize it was effective.  We are not talking about just mercury. We are talking about sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide. I believe it would be totally irresponsible to somehow roll back the first attempt that we have to regulate mercury in powerplants. Keep in mind, prior to 6 months ago, it was not regulated at all. That is what this is all about.  Tonight is a vote on the motion to proceed. I don't care about the motion to proceed. Let's go ahead and vote in favor of that. Tomorrow is the main vote. That is a significant vote. I think we need to proceed to that vote tomorrow.  I yield back the remainder of my time.                          ____________________[Pages S9912-S9921]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  DISAPPROVAL OF EPA RULE PROMULGATION
