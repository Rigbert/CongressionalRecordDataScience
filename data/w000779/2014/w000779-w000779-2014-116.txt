The hearing will be held on Thursday, January 30, 2014, at 9:30 a.m., in room 366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building.

However, those wishing to submit written testimony for the hearing record may do so by sending it to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC, 20510-6150, or by e-mail to [email protected].senate.gov.
