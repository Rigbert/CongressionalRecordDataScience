 President, I suggest that we move out of order to Senator Dodd. The chairman and I have accepted a modified Dodd amendment. Rather than have him wait all this time, I would like to suggest he be recognized to speak and that we move on his amendment.                Amendment No. 1189 to Amendment No. 1136
