Speaker, well, the President has asked the United States Congress in the name of the American people to borrow $87 billion to continue the actions in Iraq and to rebuild the nation of Iraq. That is going to be paid for by a couple of generations of working Americans, and there are an awful lot of questions about the request by the President.  Now, let us look at some of the details here: $20.3 billion to rebuild Iraq borrowed by the American people and sent to Iraq, perhaps utilizing some U.S. contractors such as Halliburton. Here are some of the things we are going to pay for: $20 million for executive job training, a 4-week class at the cost of $10,000. I have community colleges in my district that would provide that same class for a tiny fraction of that cost whose budgets are underfunded because of the cuts in the Federal Government's spending on education. $10,000 a person for a 4-week class, send them to my community college. We can house them and educate them for a lot less.  Then we have the $100 million for the witness protection program. What witnesses? Well, the witnesses that might come forward to tell us something about the nonexistent weapons of mass destruction, among other things. That will be to pay for 100 Iraqi families at $1 million each. In the United States of America when we put people in the witness protection program, it generally costs $120,000 per family. So it is going to cost us roughly eight times more per family, but I guess that is because of the high cost of living in Iraq, or the life-style to which they would like to become accustomed. Again, the American people will borrow this money, or the President is asking Congress to borrow it on behalf of the American people.  It is going to cost $255 per person in Iraq to rebuild the electricity infrastructure. They said we are not just rebuilding the bomb damage; they have this horribly outdated system, and we have to rebuild it.  Mr. Speaker, guess who else has a horribly outdated electricity infrastructure system? The United States of America. Did the President notice that the lights went off in one-third of the country? Also, we had a big blackout in the West a few years ago. Our system is operating on the edge. What is the President proposing here, $255 will be borrowed for each Iraqi by the American people, sent to Iraq to rebuild their electricity infrastructure, and the President is asking for 71 cents on behalf of every American here in the United States.  It will cost $45 million to further improve the already fully functioning port of Umm Qasr while the President is proposing zero dollars to dredge ports in my district and elsewhere in the United States because he says we cannot afford it. He is asking to borrow $45 million and send it to Iraq to further improve their ports, but he cannot find a penny for ports in the Pacific Northwest and other parts of the United States.  It is going to cost $150 million for a national 911 system in Iraq. Mr. Speaker, is that so they can call the next time a rogue regime uprises? What does this have to do with the war? The American people are going to borrow $150 million because the President wants it, send it to Iraq to give them a 911 system.  Job centers, 22 centers, $350,000 each. If we took the $20.3 billion the President wants this Congress to borrow and spend on behalf of rebuilding the nation of Iraq, if we matched that dollar per dollar in the United States of America, if we borrowed $20.3 billion to rebuild the infrastructure system in the United States, we could put 1 million Americans to work in the very near future, in addition to investing in our future, our economic productivity, our ports, our highways, our water systems, our electricity grid.  It is one thing to borrow money to invest in the United States of America; it is another thing to indebt the next two generations of Americans to borrow money to spend rebuilding Iraq. Mr. Wolfowitz told us they can pay for their own reconstruction. I guess that guy made about a $50 billion mistake that is going to cost the American taxpayers, but he is still held in highest esteem by the Bush administration. He is still working there. He is still pumping out the same mistakes. How many more billions will he cost us before the President demands his resignation. This is outrageous that the American people are being asked to borrow this money. Instead of borrowing money, investing in infrastructure and putting a million Americans to work here, he is proposing more tax cuts. His last tax cut, the dividend tax cut, returned 5 cents on the dollar to the United States economy. If it is spent on infrastructure, we get $7 for every dollar borrowed.  Mr. Speaker, let us get our priorities straight: America first.                          ____________________
