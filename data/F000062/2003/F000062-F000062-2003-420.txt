 President, I rise in support of legislation introduced by Senators Boxer and Ensign to improve disclosure of stock option grants in company financial statements while, at the same time, delaying the adoption of new accounting standards that could fundamentally distort reported earnings.  I believe that at this time of continued economic weakness it is critical that we take action to both increase transparency and improve corporate governance, without which we cannot hope to restore investor confidence.  The Broad-Based Stock Option Plan Transparency Act would increase the transparency of stock option grants at all levels of public companies, particularly executive compensation, and would provide investors with additional tools to make investment decisions.  Increased disclosure provisions in the bill include: expanded disclosure of the dilutive effect of employee stock options on reported earnings per share; a ``plain English'' discussion of share value dilution, which would allow individual investors to understand the impact of options grants on their investment; more prominent placement and increased comparability of stock option-related footnotes; and a summary of stock options granted to the 5 most highly compensated executives of the company.  These provisions help us fulfill the goal of greater transparency in our markets and improved corporate governance. With passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley accounting reform legislation last summer, we took a major step in that direction, and I believe this bill adds to those achievements.  If individual investors do not feel comfortable with the information reported by public companies or the advice given by banks and other major players in our financial markets, they will not feel comfortable making new investments and our markets are unlikely to recover.  In addition to requiring new disclosure of the impact of employee stock options on a company's earnings per share, this bill also requires the SEC tomonitor the effectiveness of increased disclosure requirements for 3 years.  The bill also specifies that the SEC must examine the impact of broad-based stock option plans on worker productivity and the performance of the firms which use such plans.  As anyone who has spent time in Silicon Valley can attest, the phenomenal achievements of high tech companies in California and across the country would not have been possible without employee stock options.  Stock options give employees a stake in the success of their company and create a degree of employee loyalty, productivity, and achievement that simply would not be possible if cash were the only form of compensation available. Moreover, it has allowed start-ups that are cash-poor to hire and retain talent that might otherwise have been available only to established firms.  A mandatory expensing standard will sharply limit the use of stock options, particularly for rank and file workers, and will slow our economic recovery.  Without a strong high tech sector developing new technologies and bringing new products to market, we cannot hope to return to the robust economic growth of the last decade.  Moreover, mandatory expensing could actually decrease transparency for the average investor. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has indicated it will implement such a rule within the next year, but has not come up with an adequate means of valuing those options for expensing purposes.  The binomial pricing model currently used to value short-term derivatives, also known as Black/Scholes, does not work with the types of long-term, restricted options packages granted to employees. Without an accurate valuation methodology, we risk giving investors a much less accurate picture of a company's financial health than they would have otherwise.  I have spoken with the chief executive officers of a number of companies in my state, including John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Systems, Craig Barrett, CEO of Intel, and Richard Kovacevich, CEO of Wells Fargo. Each one of those corporate leaders has told me that a mandatory expensing standard would lead them to sharply limit the number of options he grants to his employees.  They also told me that it would lead them cut back on hiring and possibly send more jobs abroad. I found those comments disturbing, and they should give us pause and compel us to act prudently. That is why we should support further study of the accounting treatment of stock options, during which period no new accounting rules pertaining tot stock options could be adopted.  I would like to describe briefly the impact of employee stock options on the value of an investor's holdings in the company that granted the option.  In order for employee stock options not to be counted as an expense, they must be set at or above the average closing price of the company's stock during a fixed period. They are also generally restricted, and usually cannot be exercised for several years after their grant date.  Should the value of the underlying shares fall during the life of the option, the options are underwater and are effectively worthless. Should the share price increase, however, the exercise of those options creates no cash charge to the company whatsoever. Instead, it increases the total number of shares outstanding.  To take one concrete example, Cisco Systems recently reported approximately 7.3 billion shares outstanding in their latest annual report. They also reported approximately 600 million options to purchase shares that were ``in the money,'' or had an exercise price below the current share price.  If all those options were exercised, and no shares were repurchased, each share would be entitled to approximately 8 percent less in dividends than before. In fact, the actual dilution would likely be somewhat less.  If options are expensed, however, the impact on Cisco's bottom line would be dramatic, despite the fact that their only tangible impact is on the number of shares outstanding. Had Cisco expensed their stock options for the 2001 fiscal year, their reported profits would have been 171 percent lower. A roughly $1 billion profit would instead have been a nearly $1 billion loss.  Yet the actual value of those options now is almost nil. They were all granted at exercise prices well above the current share price, and may never be exercised.  Options are not a cash expense and represent no tangible exchange of assets. They are a form of incentive pay that may ultimately be worthless. In short, they are nothing like a cash salary.  The legislation introduced by Senators Boxer and Ensign recognizes the need for further study, but does not place an indefinite moratorium on FASB action. It is a balanced bill that will help the average investor and ultimately strengthen our financial markets.  I urge my colleagues to support the Broad-Based Stock Option Transparency Act.                                 ______                                       By
