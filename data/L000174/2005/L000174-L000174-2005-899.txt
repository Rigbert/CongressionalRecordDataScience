I am going to oppose this so-called Class Action Fairness Act for a very simple reason: it is not fair.  This legislation would make it harder for citizens to protect themselves against violations of State civil rights or consumer, health, or environmental protection laws--things we take seriously in my own State and most others do in theirs. It will make it harder because these cases will be forced out of the local State courts. Aside from being convenient, State courts have experience with the legal and factual issues involved in these important cases. This legislation sweeps these cases into Federal courts, erects new barriers to lawsuits, and places new burdens on the plaintiffs.  Let me give you an example. In the case of legal rights it would take from the citizens of my own State, this legislation would deprive Vermonters the right to band together to seek relief in their State courts--even if the harm occurred in Vermont and the principal defendant has a substantial presence in Vermont. That is a highhanded override of the rights of the American people. You have to ask who it would benefit. Obviously, it benefits the wealthy and powerful special interests.  This legislation also overrides the laws and legislatures in our State governments. I find it interesting that many colleagues who have spoken over and over again on how we have to stand up for the rights of our States are so willing, when some of their corporate backers come up with legislation like this, to simply slam the door on their own States. Indeed, the National Conference of State Legislatures wrote to us last week to note that this bill ``undermines our system of federalism, disrespects our State court system, and clearly preempts carefully crafted State judicial processes which have been in place for decades regarding the treatment of class action lawsuits.''  I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            National Conference of                                           State Legislatures,                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2005.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Conference of State      Legislatures (NCSL), I am urging you to oppose passage of S.      5, the ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2005.'' This      legislation will federalize class actions involving only      state law claims. S. 5 undermines our system of federalism,      disrespects our state court system, and clearly preempts      carefully crafted state judicial processes which have been in      place for decades regarding the treatment of class action      lawsuits. The overall tenor of S. 5 sends a disturbing      message to the American people that state court systems are      somehow inferior or untrustworthy.       S. 5 amends the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to grant      federal district courts original diversity jurisdiction over      any class action lawsuit where the amount in controversy      exceeds $5,000,000 or where any plaintiff is a citizen of a      different state than any defendant, or in other words, any      class action lawsuit. The effect of S. 5 on state      legislatures is that state laws in the areas of consumer      protection and antitrust which were passed to protect the      citizens of a particular state against fraudulent or illegal      activities will almost never be heard in state courts.      Ironically, state courts, whose sole purpose is to interpret      state laws, will be bypassed and the federal judiciary will      be asked to render judgment in these cases. The impact of S.      5 is that state processes will be preempted by federal ones      which aren't necessarily better.       NCSL opposes the passage of federal legislation, such as S.      5 which preempts established state authority. State courts      have traditionally and correctly been the repository for most      class action lawsuits because state laws, not federal ones,      are at issue. Congress should proceed cautiously before      permitting the federal government to interfere with the      authority of states to set their own laws and procedures in      their own courts.       NCSL urges Congress to remember that state policy choices      should not be overridden without a showing of compelling      national need. We should await evidence demonstrating that      states have broadly overreached or are unable to address the      problems themselves. There must be evidence of harm to      interests of national scope that require a federal response,      and even with such evidence, federal preemption should be      limited to remedying specific problems with tailored      solutions, something that S. 5 does not do.       I urge you to oppose this legislation.

Sincerely,                                      Senator Michael Balboni,                                New York State Senate, Chair, NCSL                               Law and Criminal Justice Committee.
