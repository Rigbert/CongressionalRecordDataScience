President, I am honored to recognize the J. Warren and Lois McClure Foundation on the celebration of its 20th anniversary. For two decades, the selfless philanthropy of the McClure family has allowed scores of deserving Vermonters to pursue financial stability and academic success.  Established in 1995, the foundation was built upon Lois and her late husband Mac's concept of ``giving with warm hands.'' Inspired by the idea of collaborative philanthropy, the McClures set out to give with the hope it would encourage benevolence among future generations.  For 20 years, the foundation has collaborated with private and public partners to support low-income and first-generation students, adult learners, and veterans. From providing transition services for homeless youth, to promoting single parents' education programs and mental health services for veterans, there are no bounds to the McClure family's encouragement of life-long success.  Institutions such as the Vermont State Colleges, the American Red Cross of Vermont, the Vermont Department of Libraries, the Vermont Vet to Vet Program, and hundreds more have expanded innovative learning programs as a result of the foundation. From cancer patients to legislators, the foundation has touched countless lives, while inspiring those to follow their dreams.  The foundation has also been instrumental in supporting historical preservation projects at the Leahy Center for Lake Champlain and the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum. The McClures' vision to inspire a lifelong cultural and historical education for all Vermonters, meanwhile maintaining a commitment to environmental sustainability, has enhanced multiple facets of our State's diverse landscape for generations to come.  As someone who has met many leaders and legends within public service, I am continually humbled by the McClure family's boundless charity and true dedication to supporting the common good.  Marcelle and I are proud to call Lois our dear friend, and we were blessed and honored to know Mac. We are forever proud of the McClures' undying commitment to Vermonters, and we are thrilled to congratulate the foundation on 20 wonderful years of extraordinary and selfless service.                          ____________________
