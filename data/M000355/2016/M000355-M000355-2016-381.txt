 President, I want to take a few moments to congratulate a fellow Kentuckian and a good friend of mine who has recently taken up the leadership reins of America's oldest and largest war veterans organization.  This summer, Brian Duffy, of Louisville, was elected commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Brian is the first Operation Desert Storm veteran to lead the VFW. His election is good news, not only for his fellow Desert Storm veterans but for veterans of every generation. That is because Brian lives to serve his fellow veterans, and he has been doing so for decades as a proud member of the VFW for 33 years.  Let me give one example of what Brian has done for the veterans of Kentucky. He is the founder of the Bluegrass chapter of an organization called Honor Flight, a group that flies World War II and Korean war veterans to Washington to visit the memorials that were built in dedication of their military service.  The program provides transportation and food for the veterans of this bygone era, those whose numbers, unfortunately, continue to shrink year after year. Without Honor Flight, many of these veterans would never be able to see the World War II Memorial or the Korean War Veterans Memorial. It is important that they know, more thansix decades later, that America still deeply respects and honors their service and sacrifice.  My father served in World War II. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of his contemporaries when they came to Washington to make this important trip. Hundreds of Kentucky veterans have completed this journey, thanks to Brian and subsequent leaders of Bluegrass Honor Flight.  That is just one way Brian has worked to see that America stands up for its veterans, just as they have so bravely stood up for their country. It is one reason why I know he will make an excellent commander in chief for the VFW.  Brian served in the U.S. Air Force as a jet engine mechanic on F-4 Phantom fighter aircraft before becoming a flight engineer aboard a C-141 Starlifter transport aircraft. He has deployed to Grenada and Panama as well as on Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.  Brian and his wife Jean, who has also served in leadership posts for the VFW, live in Louisville and have two children, Tara and Andrew. I am sure his family is proud of Brian, along with many Kentucky veterans, particularly his fellow VFW members at Post 1170.  Let me also congratulate my good friend Carl Kaelin, whom I have also worked with for decades on behalf of Bluegrass State veterans, for his appointment to serve as chief of staff to the commander in chief. Carl and Brian will make quite a team. Kentucky and the Nation are grateful for their leadership and for their service.  Brian has previously served the VFW as its junior vice commander in chief. He also served as the senior vice commander in chief. I know Brian is a huge hockey fan. So he will know what I mean when I say that his election as commander in chief makes quite a hat trick--to the benefit of Kentucky veterans and veterans across America.  In Brian's own words, the VFW is ``an organization of doers'' and ``an organization comprised of patriots.'' Both of these descriptions aptly fit the VFW's new chief. Under Brian's leadership, I am sure the VFW will continue to pay it forward to every veteran who has raised his or her right hand and taken an oath to defend a nation dedicated to the preservation of life and liberty.                          ____________________
