 President, since 1963, the month of May has helped the Nation focus on the contributions and achievements of America's older citizens. The image of those over the age of 65 is dramatically different than it was just a generation ago. Older Americans increasingly redefine modern maturity, re-shape cultural boundaries and dispel age-related stereotypes associated with getting older. They are leaders in our families, in our workplaces and in our communities.  One of these leaders is an 80-year-old woman from Milford, IA. Dorothy Frederick understands the value of helping others. Through her initiative, concern and commitment, she has touched the lives of many in her community.  Mrs. Frederick and her husband, Ted, moved to Milford in 1950 where the couple has owned a hardware business for fifty years. After the couple's five children were grown, Mrs. Frederick's desire to stay active led to her increasing involvement in the community.  Through her church, Mrs. Frederick helped start meals on wheels in Milford more than twenty years ago. Over that time, she has gotten other churches in the community involved in the program. Today, meals on wheels is still going strong in Milford, and Mrs. Frederick continues to be the program coordinator. She is ``on call'' with the program each day and is responsible for finding drivers and coordinating their activities. She even fills in as a substitute driver when needed.  Mrs. Frederick's initiative also led to the establishment of the Dinner Date program in Milford nearly twenty years ago. Every Tuesday, Mrs. Frederick is responsible for serving mealsat the community meal site to senior citizens and others. Her ongoing commitment to these programs has contributed to their success all of these years.  Mrs. Frederick is a woman who likes a challenge. After serving six years on the city council, she was elected Mayor of Milford and served the better part of her six-year tenure while in her sixties. As mayor, Mrs. Frederick made her mark by fulfilling a campaign promise to put a streetlight on every corner in town. Today, she is still known as ``the woman who lit up Milford.''  Mrs. Frederick and her husband have been married for 58 years. The couple's five children and three grandchildren keep them very busy. When asked what she likes to do with her free time, Mrs. Frederick says her main interest is helping people and that all people are important, whether they be young or old.  I think those words are pretty good words to live by and I'd like to thank Mrs. Frederick for her contributions to the people of Milford. Her initiative and compassion for others is an example to us all that we should always be willing to help, no matter what our age.                          ____________________
