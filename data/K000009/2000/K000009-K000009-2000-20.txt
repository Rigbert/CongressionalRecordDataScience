Speaker, I offer a motion to instruct conferees.  The Clerk read as follows:       Miss Kaptur moves that the managers on the part of the      House at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two      Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4461 be      instructed to hold a full and adequate public meeting at      which managers have the opportunity to debate and vote on all      matters in disagreement between the two Houses, and be      instructed to fully resolve all differences between H.R. 4461      and the Senate amendment as part of this conference.                              {time}  1245
