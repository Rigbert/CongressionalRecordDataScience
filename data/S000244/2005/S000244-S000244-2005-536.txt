Speaker, once again, we see games being played by the minority party. The gentleman from Michigan has stood up and said he is opposed to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act so he is qualified to introduce this motion to recommit, and the motion to recommit has to do with price gouging.  Nobody's for price gouging. There are laws on the books that have the Federal Trade Commission investigate price gouging. Every time there has been a spike in fuel prices, petroleum prices, the FTC has been on the case. They have investigated it according to law, and in most cases, they have found that no price gouging has occurred.  There are certain legislative provisions of the Violence Against Women Act that expire on Friday, September 30, 2005, and this amendment, once again, is a poison pill that is introduced at the last minute.  We have heard complaints from the other side of the aisle about legislation not receiving a hearing or formal committee consideration. We heard that earlier today, and what happens is there is a motion to recommit, introduced by an opponent of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, that wants to put something that is completely unrelated into a Department of Justice reauthorization bill.  Whatever happened to State prerogatives, to allow State Attorneys General to investigate whether State law is violated? This motion to recommit blows the concept of federalism into little teeny pieces and will tie the hands of your State Attorney General and mine to look into price gouging.  It is a poorly drafted amendment. It does not relate to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. It is something that is put in in an extremely hostile manner to try and get the job done in the Violence Against Women Act.  If my colleagues are for the Violence Against Women Act being reauthorized promptly, vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit. Vote ``yes'' on the bill.
