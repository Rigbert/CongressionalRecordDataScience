President, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to an editorial in today's Wall Street Journal and particularly the first sentence. It says:       Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and other liberal leaders on      Capitol Hill are gripped by cold-sweat terror. If they permit      a vote on offshore drilling, they know they will lose. . . .
