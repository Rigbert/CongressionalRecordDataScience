Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Hall amendment. Let me tell what has happened in my home State. The State of Illinois put out for competitive bid infant formula, and it turns out that the WIC Program in the United States, which I understand serves 40 percent of the infants in America, obviously is one of the major purchasers of infant formula.  So when a State like mine, as large as it is, decides to ask the companies that make the formula to enter a competitive bid, they had quite a bit of competition and quite a bit of savings.  They ended up with a rebate of $2.06 on every can of infant formula purchased under the WIC Program in Illinois and because they were so successful in competitive bidding, turned around and took this money and expanded the program, just what we want them to do, to be cost efficient, save money and expand the program.  We do not want to create an incentive, or disincentive I should say, for States to enter into competitive bidding. Just the opposite. Let us have them spend their tax dollars as effectively as possible, save the money and help as many families as possible. That is why the Hall amendment should be agreed to.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
