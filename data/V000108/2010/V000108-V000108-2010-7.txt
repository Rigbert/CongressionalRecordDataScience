Res. 1246 to pay tribute to Polish President Lech Kaczynski, First Lady Maria Kaczynska, and the other Polish officials who were lost in the catastrophic plane crash on April 10, 2010. I would like to express my deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the people and government of Poland, the families of those who perished, and Polish Americans, especially those who call Northwest Indiana home, in the wake of this tragedy. This is a devastating loss for Poland, the United States, and the world.  Poland is a very dear friend to the United States, and President Kaczynski was one of America's valued and trusted allies. President Kaczynski played a key role in the Solidarity movement, and was widely admired in the United States as a champion for democracy and an advocate for freedom and human rights in Poland, and around the world.  There is a significant sense of sadness throughout Indiana's First Congressional District, where Polish communities have gathered together to honor and mourn those lost. I share the sadness, and join the Polish people, in Northwest Indiana and around the world, in mourning.
