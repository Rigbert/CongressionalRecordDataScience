President, in November 1996, there was a tragic accident off the coast of California that claimed the lives of 10 out of 11 airmen, the crew of an Air Force Reserve C-130 aircraft out of Portland. All of these crewmen were from my home state of Oregon.  This was a devastating loss for all of us, but most of all for the families of those airmen who lost their lives. After any tragedy like this, the first question on everyone's minds is ``why?'' Why were my loved ones taken from me? This is what the families of these airmen wanted to know, but no one would give them a straight answer.  After many, many months of frustration, these families came to me and my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, to get the Air Force to tell us exactly what happened.  As a result of working with these families, with the Air Force, and with the committee staff, and with Senator Levin in particular, we were able to craft some language that is now included in the Defense Authorization Conference Report that we are considering today. This language takes a two pronged approach to dealing with the pressing issues the families have raised: improving crash investigations, and eliminating the secrecy in which these investigations are shrouded.  Specifically, the language directs the Defense Department to review the way it conducts aviation accident investigations so that they are conducted in as thorough and objective a manner as possible, including making sure crash investigators receive the best training, and ensuring that the military department coordinate and share information on fleet safety. The bill also urges the Pentagon to seek the advice of the National Transportation Safety Board in improving investigation procedures, and I intend to make sure their valuable input is part of their review.  Secrecy has long been the hallmark of these investigations and has kept loved ones in the dark about what happened and why. We have worked to reduce the secrecy involved in the investigations of tragedies, and this legislation takes a solid step forward in providing families and the public with better information.  That's why this language also requires the Department of Defense to issue regulations to provide to family members periodic reports on the progress of investigations. I also spoke with Secretary Cohen about this recently, and he has pledged to make a solid effort to make sure families are kept informed of the progress of investigations.  It's important that we eliminate secrecy from these proceedings. The last thing we should do is add to these terrible tragedies by keeping the families in the dark about the status of these investigations. From day to day, from week to week, from month to month, these families had to cope with not only the incredible pain of losing a loved one, but with the incredible frustration of not knowing the status of the investigation into their deaths. This new language seeks to put an end to this type of treatment. We owe it to the men and women who give their lives for their country.                           tritium provision
