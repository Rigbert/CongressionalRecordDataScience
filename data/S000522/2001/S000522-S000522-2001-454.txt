Mr. Speaker, words are inadequate to convey the utter shock, horror, sorrow, dismay--and anger, over yesterday's supreme act of cowardice against innocent Americans.  Our prayers and hearts go out to the victims--the dead and the wounded--and to those who at this very hour cling to life, horribly trapped under concrete, jagged glass and steel.  Our nation's admiration and respect for the firefighters, police officers and medics, many of whom lost their lives in the lien of duty, in deep. Valor, courage and selflessness were commonplace yesterday, as many rescuers became victims themselves.  Our hearts go out to the victims' families and friends who today must cope with their excruciating loss. As shock abates, the numbing pain of yesterday's terror will leave indelible scars. May god supernaturally intervene with healing, comfort and peace.  Mr. Speaker, the cowards who perpetrated these crimes against God and Humanity must be brought to justice no matter how long it takes. And, by the grace of God and the crafting of wise policy initiatives, this must never happen again.  Two years ago, in light of the growing danger of international terrorism, I authored the Embassy Security Act (H.R. 3427) to provide $6 billion to make America's foreign embassies and missions stronger and safer. This week, we learned that even this large sum was not enough to deter those with an absolute disregard for the value of human life. We must and will do more.  Those who wish us harm should know that Americans are strong, determined and resilient. America is united, not to be underestimated.  In like manner, President Bush is strong and determined, fully in charge, not to be underestimated, and will lead us with boldness and prudence.  Finally, America's foundational strength isn't to be found in its military might or relative prosperity--but in our individual and collective faith in, and faithfulness to, God.  May this horrific act of mass violence compel us to turn anew to God seeking healing, restoration and justice, as well as devine guidance, so that His will will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.                          ____________________
