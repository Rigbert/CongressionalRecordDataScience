 President, I would like to take a moment today to recognize National Secretary-Treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees AFGE, J. David Cox, the recipient of the 2012 Yitzhak Rabin Public Service Award.  This award is given out by the American Friends of the Yitzhak Rabin Center each year to individuals who reflect Prime Minister Rabin's legacy of peace, leadership, and public service. Having come to know and appreciate J. David's accomplishments, I feel that he is more than a fitting recipient of this honor.  Over the course of his decades-long involvement with AFGE and AFL CIO, J. David has worked tirelessly to ensure that Federal employees here in Washington, D.C. and across the nation enjoy the dignity, fair pay, and safe working environment that they deserve. Based upon the number of leadership positions he has been elected to by his fellow Federal workers, it is clear that they approve of his efforts. In the past, he has served as Executive Vice-President of the AFGE National Veterans Affairs Council, President of AFGE Local 1738 in North Carolina, and Co-Chair of the Department of Veterans' Affairs National Partnership Council. In addition to his role as National Secretary-Treasurer, he currently is vice co-chair of the AFL CIO's Union Veterans Council, vice-president of North Carolina State AFL CIO, and was appointed by President Obama to serve on the Federal Salary Council and the Federal Prevailing wage council.  J. David got his start in the Federal workforce in 1983 as a registered nurse within the Department of Veterans Affairs. He served our nation's veterans for 23 years before moving on to AFGE in 2006. As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have come to value J. David as an important advocate for veterans as well as VA's Federal workforce. J. David has testified before us several times over recent years and has established himself as a key asset to the Committee. Throughout his testimony, J. David has always sought to make sure that the doctors, nurses, and other health professionals at VA have the resources they need to provide the best possible care to our veterans. In particular, his vocal support for assured funding and VA budget reform help to lead to the current 2-year appropriations process that VA uses today.  I am grateful for J. David's work and applaud the American Friends of the Yitzhak Rabin Center for selecting him as one of this year's award recipients. I offer my sincerest congratulations to J. David and hope that he continues to fight for Federal employees and veterans into the future.                          ____________________
