 Chairman, I happen to be a supporter of the subcommittee and committee process. I know that they do a whole lot of work. The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) is not suggesting, of course, that we should eliminate the amendment procedure in the House. He is not suggesting that. He is not suggesting, for example, that there is a problem when a radical change to an effective program takes place and we do not involve the States in the process.  It is not fair, I think, in all due respect, to say, oh, we know what the States would say. Let them say it. Let them tell us what will happen if we require a 25 percent input next year. I think they should have been having that discussion.
