Madam Speaker, I am attaching an exchange of letters between Chairman Hyde and Chairmen Davis, Thomas, McKeon and Oxley concerning the bill H.R. 282 ``The Iran Freedom Support Act'' for printing in the Record.                                         House of Representatives,                               Committee on Government Reform,                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 2006.     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman, Committee on International Relations, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to confirm our mutual      understanding with respect to consideration of H.R. 282, the      Iran Freedom Support Act, which the Committee on      International Relations ordered reported on April 13, 2006.      In the bill as ordered reported by your Committee, section      206, specifically the provisions providing Senses of Congress      urging U.S. government pension plan and thrift savings plan      managers to take certain actions (section 206(c) and (d)) and      the provision requiring certain disclosures by managers of      U.S. government pension plans and thrift savings plans      (section 206(e)) are within the jurisdiction of the      Government Reform Committee.       I thank you for your agreement to support the removal of      section 206(e) from the bill and to modify sections 206(c)      and (d) with the addition of language recognizing the      fiduciary duties of U. S. government pension plan managers,      as you work to move this important legislation forward. Given      the importance and timeliness of the Iran Freedom Support      Act, and your willingness to work with us regarding pension      issues, I will not request a sequential referral of this      legislation to the Committee on Government Reform. However, I      only do so with the understanding that this procedural route      should not be construed to prejudice the Committee on      Government Reform's jurisdictional interest and prerogatives      on these provisions or any other similar legislation and will      not be considered as precedent for consideration of matters      of jurisdictional interest to my Committee in the future.      Furthermore, should these or similar provisions be considered      in a conference with the Senate, I would expect Members of      the Committee on Government Reform be appointed to the      conference committee on these provisions.       Finally, I would ask that you include a copy of our      exchange of letters in the Committee Report on H.R. 282 and      in the Congressional Record during the consideration of this      bill. If you have any questions regarding this matter, please      do not hesitate to call me. I thank you for your      consideration.           Sincerely,                                                        Tom Davis,     Chairman.                                  ____         House of Representatives, Committee on International            Relations,                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 2006.     Hon. Tom Davis,     Chairman, Committee on Government Reform, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter concerning      H.R. 282, the Iran Freedom Support Act. I concur with your      assessment that Section 206 of the bill, as ordered reported      by the Committee on International Relations, which deals with      United States Pension Plans, falls within the Rule X      jurisdiction of the Committee on Government Reform--     specifically Section 206(e), which requires certain      disclosures by managers of U.S. government pension plans. In      addition, the Senses of Congress contained in Sections 206      (c) and (d), urging U.S. government pension plan managers to      take certain actions, are also within the jurisdiction of      your Committee.       I thank you for your agreement to support moving this      important legislation forward. Based on our discussions, this      Committee will remove Section 206(e) from the bill, modify      Sections 206 (c) and (d), and add language recognizing the      fiduciary duties of pension plan managers. I appreciate your      willingness to forego seeking a sequential referral of this      legislation. I understand your willingness to do so does not      in any way prejudice the Committee on Government Reform's      jurisdictional interest and prerogatives on these provisions      or any other similar legislation and will not be considered      as precedent for consideration of matters of jurisdictional      interest to your Committee in the future. Should these or      similar provisions be considered in a conference with the      Senate, I will urge the Speaker to appoint members of the      Committee on Government Reform to the conference committee.       As you requested, I will include a copy of our exchange of      letters in the Committee Report on H.R. 282 and in the      Congressional Record during the consideration of this bill.           Sincerely,                                                    Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Ways and Means,                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2006.     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman, Committee on International Relations, Washington,          DC.       Dear Chairman Hyde: I am writing regarding H.R. 282, the      ``Iran Freedom Support Act,'' which the Committee on      International Relations marked up on March 15, 2006.       As per the agreement between our Committees, to be included      in a manager's amendment to H.R. 282, the amended bill would      modify the language in Section 101(a) so that the import      sanctions contained in Executive Order 12959 may remain in      effect under the terms of the Executive Order but would not      be codified by this bill, In addition, Sections 202(a) and      202(b) of the reported bill will remain in the amended      version. These sections would change current law by striking      the statutory option the President currently has to ban      imports against both Iran and Libya.       Because all of these provisions have the effect of      modifying and altering the application of an import ban, they      fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and      Means. However, in order to expedite this legislation for      floor consideration, the Committee will forgo action on this      bill. This is being done with the understanding that it does      not in any way prejudice the Committee with respect to the      appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives      on this or similar legislation.       I would appreciate your response to this letter, confinning      this understanding with respect to H.R. 282, and would ask      that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be      included in your Committee report.           Best regards,                                                      Bill Thomas,     Chairman.                                  ____         House of Representatives, Committee on International            Relations,                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2006.     Hon. William M. Thomas,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing regarding H.R. 282, the      ``Iran Freedom Support Act,'' which the Committee on      International Relations marked up on March 15, 2006.       As per the agreement between our Committees, I will include      in the manager's amendment to H.R. 282 language which would      modify the text in Section 101(a) so that the import      sanctions contained in Executive Order 12959 may remain in      effect under the terms of the Executive Order but would not      be codified by this bill. In addition, Sections 202(a) and      202(b) of the reported bill will remain in the amended      version. These sections would change current law by striking      the statutory option the President currently has to ban      imports against both Iran and Libya.       I concur that these provisions have the effect of modifying      and altering the application of an import ban and, therefore,      they fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways      and Means. I appreciate your willingness to assist in      expediting this legislation by foregoing action on this bill.      This is being done with the understanding that it does not in      any way prejudice the Committee on Ways and Means with      respect to the appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional      prerogatives on this or similar legislation.       As you requested, I will be pleased to include a copy of      this exchange of letters in the Committee Report on H.R. 282      and in the Congressional Record during the consideration of      this bill. If you have any questions regarding this matter,      please do not hesitate to call me. I thank you for your      consideration.           Sincerely,                                                    Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                              Committee on Financial Services,                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2006.     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman, Committee on International Relations, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to confirm our mutual      understanding with respect to the consideration of H.R. 282,      the Iran Freedom Support Act. This bill was ordered reported      by the Committee on International Relations on March 15,      2006. Section 206, ``United States pension plans'', and      section 207, ``Report by Office of Global Security Risks'',      of the bill as ordered reported by your committee are within      the jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services under      clause l(g) of rule X of the Rules of the House of      Representatives.       Ordinarily, the Committee on Financial Services would be      entitled to receive a sequential referral of the bill.      However, I thank you for your agreement to support in moving      this important legislation forward the removal of section      206(e) and section 207 from the bill and to modify section      206(b) by inserting the Secretary of State in lieu of the      President. Given the importance and timeliness of the Iran      Freedom Support Act, and your willingness to work with us      regarding these issues, I will not seek a sequential referral      of this legislation. However, I do so only with the      understanding that this procedural route should not be      construed to prejudice the jurisdictional interest of the      Committee on Financial Services on these provisions or any      other similar legislation and will not be considered as      precedent for consideration of matters of jurisdictional      interest to my committee in the future. Furthermore, should      these or similar provisions be considered in a conference      with the Senate, I would expect members of the Committee on      Financial Services be appointed to the conference committee      on these provisions.       Finally, I would ask that you include a copy of our      exchange of letters in the Committee Report on H.R. 282 and      in the Congressional Record during the consideration of this      bill.

Sincerely,                                                 Michael G. Oxley,                                                         Chairman.                                  ____                                           House of Representatives, Committee on International            Relations,                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2006.     Hon. Michael G. Oxley,     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter concerning      H.R. 282, the Iran Freedom Support Act. I concur that the      bill, as ordered reported by the Committee on International      Relations on March 15, 2006, contains language which falls      within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial      Services. Specifically, Section 206, ``United States Pension      Plans,'' and Section 207, ``Report by Office of Global      Security Risks,'' of the bill are within your Committee's      jurisdiction.       Our two committees have reached agreement that, in the      interest of moving this important legislation forward, the      text of the bill which we will place in the manager's      amendment will remove Section 206(e) and Section 207 from the      bill and will modify Section 206(b) by inserting the      ``Secretary of State'' in lieu of ``the President.'' Given      the importance and timeliness of the Iran Freedom Support      Act, I appreciate your willingness to work with us regarding      these issues and to forego sequential referral of this      legislation. I understand that by doing so, it should not be      construed to prejudice the jurisdictional interest of the      Committee on Financial Services on these provisions or any      other similar legislation and will not be considered as      precedent for consideration of matters of jurisdictional      interest to your Committee in the future. Furthermore, should      these or similar provisions be considered in a conference      with the Senate, I will request the Speaker to name members      of the Committee on Financial Services to the conference      committee.       As you requested, I will be pleased to include a copy of      this exchange of letters in the Committee Report on H.R. 282      and in the Congressional Record during the consideration of      this bill.

Hon. Henry J. Hyde,     Committee on International Relations, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman, I am writing to confirm our mutual      understanding with respect to the consideration of H.R. 282,      the Iran Freedom Support Act. Section 206, United States      Pension Plans, of the bill as ordered reported by your      committee is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on      Education and Workforce--specifically, section 206 (e), which      requires certain disclosures by managers of private pension      plans. In addition, the Senses of Congress contained in      sections 206 (c) and (d) urge private pension plan managers      to take certain actions and are also within the jurisdiction      of the Committee on Education and the Workforce.       I thank you for your agreement to support the removal of      section 206 (e) from the bill and to modify sections 206 ( c)      and (d) with the addition of language recognizing the      fiduciary duties of pension plan managers, as you work to      move this important legislation forward. Given the importance      and timeliness of the Iran Freedom Support Act, and your      willingness to work with us regarding pension issues, I will      not seek a sequential referral of this legislation. However,      I do so only with the understanding that this procedural      route should not be construed to prejudice the Committee on      Education and the Workforce's jurisdictional interest and      prerogatives on these provisions or any other similar      legislation and will not be considered as precedent for      consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to my      committee in the future. Furthermore, should these or similar      provisions be considered in a conference with the Senate, I      would expect members of the Committee on Education and the      Workforce be appointed to the conference committee on these      provisions.

I thank you for your agreement to support moving this      important legislation forward.
