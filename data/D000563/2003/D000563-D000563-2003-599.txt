STABENOW. I don't see anything in here that brings it down. In fact, what we are doing in the underlying bill is adding the profit. We are putting for-profit business into this process, so you are actually adding to the cost of this system. I don't see anything in here that will bring prices down. I think that is why the pharmaceutical industry is very supportive of this plan because, unfortunately, the average retail price of an advertised brand is going up three times the rate of inflation. This does nothing to address that and bring the prices down.
