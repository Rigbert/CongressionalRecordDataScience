President, I am introducing legislation to correct a technical error made by the U.S. Customs Service, and exempt Waldron Pacific from antidumping duties which were retroactively applied by Customs to three import shipments of titanium. This bill is a companion to legislation introduced by Representative David Wu in the House of Representatives.  Waldron Pacific, a small business located in Lake Oswego, Oregon, is a distributor of non-ferrous alloys, such as aluminum, zinc and brass, used in the die casting and foundry industries. With just two employees, Waldron Pacific has been a very successful business operation.  When a customer of Waldron Pacific needed a certain type of titanium not available in this country, the entrepreneurial Waldron Pacific found a supplier outside the U.S., in Russia. Having no import experience, but hearing of potential antidumping duties on certain titanium products, Waldron Pacific sought a binding Classification Ruling from Customs before importing the product. Customs' Classification Ruling indicated that the proper import duty was 15%, and Waldron Pacific began importing the product to fulfill the needs of its customer. After three shipments had been imported, Customs revoked its previous Classification Ruling and applied retroactively an additional 85% antidumping duty on these shipments. The three shipments had already been imported, delivered and paid for by Waldron Pacific's customer, leaving Waldron Pacific liable to pay $42,000 in unexpected duties.  Whether or not the product should be subject to the antidumping order is not at issue nor is that the matter addressed by this legislation. The key point is that Waldron Pacific exercised due diligence in obtaining a Classification Ruling prior to importing the product, and relied upon that Classification Ruling as a basis for importing and selling the product. Even the domestic producers who are protected by the antidumping order agree that Waldron Pacific should not have to pay antidumping duties on these three shipments. Ironically, the antidumping order has since been repealed entirely. Providing Waldron Pacific relief from Customs' mistake and subsequent attempt to retroactively apply a higher tariff is a question of basic fairness.  The legislation I am introducing today would correct this technical error and exempt these import shipments from the unfair, retroactive application of antidumping duties.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2114       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
