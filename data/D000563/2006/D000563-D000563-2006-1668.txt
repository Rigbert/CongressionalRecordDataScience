President, I thank the Senator for bringing this important amendment to debate. I will ask him a question or two about his amendment.  I think the Senator is on the right track in noting that several States have made significant progress in dealing with the asbestos litigation. In some States, there has been an agreement between what are usually warring and opposing parties as to how the system can be improved. I wish to ask the Senator from Texas whether the approach he has suggested to the Senate today would preempt existing State laws and standards in this area?
