 President, I rise to discuss an amendment to create a medical insurance rate authority and rate review process that I filed to the Patient Care and Affordable Choice Act.  Unfortunately, because of the objections of one of my colleagues, my amendment was not included in the final bill before us today.  I am profoundly disappointed. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss why I believe this proposal is so important and why, without it, we can expect to see skyrocketing health insurance premiums.  I am very concerned that health insurance companies will seek to exploit the time between passage of the bill, and 2014, when reforms are fully in place.  Credit card companies provide a useful example. Earlier this year, Congress approved major credit card reform legislation. However, the consumer protections it contains will not be fully effective until February 2010.  Credit card companies have taken full advantage of this interim period to raise rates, with many card interest rates increasing 20 percent over the last year.  I am very worried that health insurance companies will do the very same thing. And I believe the rate authority amendment is essential to stopping them.  In some States, insurance commissioners have the authority to review rates and increases and block rates that are found to be unjustified. According to a 2008 Families USA report, 33 States have some form of a prior approval process for premium increases.
