Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  If one assumes that perhaps we do not adopt a budget resolution, would it still be the intent of the majority to bring forth an enforcement bill, the one that has been considered in committee, or is it a condition for that bill coming to the floor that the budget pass?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. I just speak for this gentleman that I would like to see a Budget Enforcement Act come to this floor. I think it is vitally needed for fiscal discipline in this Congress, and I would anticipate, whether the budget passes or not, that we would see a budget enforcement bill come to the floor.
