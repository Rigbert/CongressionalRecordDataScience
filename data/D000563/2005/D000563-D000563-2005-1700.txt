I do apologize. I mentioned to him a minute or two ago that I was going to ask a question along these lines. I would like to ask Senator Cornyn and Senator Feinstein to consider this. Because if we do not go to that next step and say we are not going to let the House bring in an immigration provision in conference and tie our own hands and not offer important immigration provisions in the Senate, that is unfair. If we are going to make this an immigration and appropriations bill, then we have some pretty important issues to consider.  Senator Kennedy has an issue with Senator Craig--Senator Mikulski, so many do. If this conference is going to be open and the REAL ID provisions come rolling out at us, as difficult as it is, as time consuming as it may be, we have no recourse but to open the issue and open the debate.  I yield the floor.
