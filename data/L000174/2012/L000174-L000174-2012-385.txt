President, when we talk about what the American people want, I am sure the majority leader--and I ask him this as a question--is aware that there are 160 million Americans who are in judicial districts where there are vacancies, because even though they have gone through the Senate Judiciary Committee, the majority leader has been blocked from bringing them to the floor, so that 160 million Americans were denied a chance for justice, denied a chance to go to court? I ask the leader, was thatalso one of the considerations he had on moving forward with these judges?
