President, I wish to briefly speak about the legislation before us and to lend my support to the supplemental appropriations bill. I commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens for a job well done. They took extensive testimony in many hearings to determine the needs for homeland security, as well as many other needs, and they have incorporated those provisions in this bill.  I also salute and commend my colleague from Washington State, Senator Murray, for giving an excellent discussion of the transportation aspects of this bill. She indicated the detailed and the careful deliberation that went into the crafting of this legislation and suggested also the reality that was confronted by the committee in hearing testimony from witnesses who indicated it might take up to 2 years to do a survey of a port when, in fact, the American people are demanding action immediately, not 2 years from now--when the threat is immediate, not hypothetical or 2 years removed.  As a result, I find it ironic, to say the least, that opponents of this bill would simply say we will sacrifice all the needed expenses because the total that we recommend is higher than that recommended by the President of the United States.  Frankly, if you asked most Americans, they would say we are not spending enough on homeland security. If you asked them how much they would want us to spend, it would be: Spend as much as you need to ensure not just one port or one airfield but every port and every airfield, and to ensure every community in America is protected. That is what this bill attempts to do.  This is a downpayment on a much larger bill because the issues and threats we confront will not be banished within a few weeks or a few months. It is long term, ongoing, requiring a tremendous commitment of resources. This is a good downpayment and one that I support wholeheartedly.  The legislation includes within its provisions $14 billion for the cost of our operations in Afghanistan. To delay this bill any longer because of some objections or some overall objection and compromise for delaying funds for Afghanistan, to me, is inconceivable. We have those resources which we must commit and we must spend immediately.  The bill also includes $5.5 billion for the recovery of New York City--again, expenses that we cannot ignore, cannot defer. We have to respond.  There is $4.4 billion for aviation security, once again, a critical aspect of our response to the very real threats we face today because of terrorist attacks on the United States.  The bill contains $1.95 billion for international programs to aid the war on terrorism. These are important complements to our military operations. The administration speaks often, and correctly, about draining the swamp where the terrorists reside. That cannot be done by wishing it away. We have to have resources to deal with profound problems across the globe--inadequate education systems, the overall threat of poverty, lack of economic development--all of those factors that contribute directly sometimes, but certainly indirectly, to the atmosphere that encourages terrorism, encourages those who attack us.  I just returned, with some of my colleagues, from a conference of defense ministers in Singapore. If we look across the globe, this threat is very real and very sobering. We need resources to mount a counteroffensive. Those resources are not just military, they also involve assistance to local governments that are assisting us by intelligence operations, by using their military forces and their intelligence apparatus to help us in this war on terror. For all these reasons, we need to pass this bill and do it promptly.  One of the major provisions of the bill is $3 billion for homeland defense, and that incorporates many issues--first responders, police and fire--to make sure these very brave men and women have the materials and the know-how to confront a wholly different threat. I do not think anyone conceived even a year ago that our police and fire departments would be at the front lines of sophisticated attacks by terrorists against the United States, involving mass casualty operations and massive destruction, yet they are. We have to give them the tools to do the job, to protect themselves, and to protect the communities they serve so well. Those provisions are within this bill also.  We have to protect our nuclear facilities. It was shocking to me--and again this goes to the credibility of the administration saying they oppose this bill because we are spending too much. It was reported recently in the press that the authorities responsible for protecting our nuclear facilities asked for considerably more money and were told by OMB: No, we cannot afford it.  We are not going to accept that answer. We want those facilities protected. Where there are nuclear powerplants, where there are nuclear facilities of the Department of Energy throughout this country, we want those facilities guarded, protected to prevent a catastrophic terrorist attack. That is one aspect of this bill which is important also.  We also have to recognize the issue of biological terror. We witnessed firsthand in this Senate a biological attack. It is expensive, and we simply cannot wait for the next attack. We have to anticipate and, through our wise preventive actions, we hope preclude any type of attack. But that is not the result of wishful thinking and hoping it will not happen. That is putting real resources into prevention, into response, into those things that will prepare us for any type of mass casualty attack--biological, nuclear, or even a conventional weapon that is deployed against our people.  I believe the chairman, the ranking member, and the subcommittee chairmen and women and their counterparts, the ranking members, have done a very good job responding to the concerns.  In the Appropriations Committee when I sat and listened to this testimony from the people who are responsible in the Federal Government, at the State level, and in the local communities, I did not hear: You are spending too much. I heard: We need more help; we have to be responsive. Their position is not sitting here in Washington, it is literally on the front lines of this war on terror.  If we listened to the men and women who are directly responsible for protecting the American people from terrorist threats, I think they would say in a very strong and uniform chorus: Pass this bill now. It is not too expensive. In fact, it is simply a downpayment on significant costs we will face in the foreseeable future.  Our enemies are implacable. They are determined. They are reorganizing to strike again, and if we do not seize the moment and put the resources into a concerted, deliberate, expeditious effort to protect the American people, we will regret it and the American people will suffer the consequences. I urge we pass this legislation as quickly as possible.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
