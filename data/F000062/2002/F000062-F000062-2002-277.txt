       As I testified before the Senate Energy and Natural      Resources Committee last month--  This is the chairman and CEO--       I have long been concerned that the type of exchange run by      Enron before its collapse offered opportunities for      manipulation. Enron was the largest buyer, the largest seller      and operator of an unregulated exchange. In view of the      revelations of the last several months regarding Enron, the      unregulated nature of these markets has raised serious      concerns regarding the ability of the Federal Government to      ensure that energy trading and futures markets are operating      in the interest of the public and market participants.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter, and also a similar letter from PG, be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.
