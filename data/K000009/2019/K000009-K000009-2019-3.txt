 Our focus is on ensuring future economic prosperity. We underpin national security, and we bolster economic security and trade.  Fundamentally, our work together prepares our country to mitigate, adapt to, and intelligently manage the awesome challenges of climate change, including the significant water events across our country, including our Great Lakes region.  Our bill is needed more than ever to move America forward. We are living in a pivotal era. I look forward to answering any questions that individuals may have privately.
