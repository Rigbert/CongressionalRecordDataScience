Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, none of the provisions in what we are considering today are new and a surprise. The base bill is the bill that was produced by the other body. That has been out there for over a week. There have been some modifications made to this bill in an attempt to avoid a conference. Many of the modifications were made at the request of the minority party in the House of Representatives.  Now, I agree that this process is not an ideal process and this is not a perfect compromise, but there are a number of House provisions in this bill, none of which are a surprise that was written in the middle of the night. The bill does not violate the Constitution. It protects our vital fourth amendment rights; and with a clear and present danger facing our country, I believe it is imperative that we act expeditiously.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Barr).
