We are going to have a lot of commentators. We are going to have a lot, under the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, of ``news stories, commentaries and stories distributed under the facilities of any broadcasting station [that] are exempt from its reporting requirements.''  What about the Internet? What about the Internet? Does the distinguished Senator have a view in that regard?  The reason I ask is, just today, like every Senator, you know, you check the Internet and you check your e-mail and all of that. On the Internet, on somebody's web page, there was sort of a semi-newspaper making commentary about one of our colleagues. It indicated down the road anybody but that individual should be supported in the next election. That is pretty express advocacy, it seems to me. They had some issue tied to it. It was interesting.  I am just wondering. As a matter of fact, a lot of people who started newspapers--I don't know if they call them newspapers but they call them, certainly, free and protected speech under the first amendment on the Internet. Who is going to--how are we going to police that? Would the distinguished Senator have a view on that?  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't have a clue and I think the courts will be wrestling with that.  I say to my friend from Kansas, you know that GE owns NBC, Westinghouse owns CBS, and Disney owns ABC.
