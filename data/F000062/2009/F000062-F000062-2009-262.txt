 This is the first year Senator Alexander and I have worked together as chairmen and ranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. I am very pleased to report that it could not have been a better experience. We have consulted on several occasions and worked through several different issues. As a result, I think we have produced a fair, balanced, and workable bill. I thank him very much, and his able staff, for all their hard work and cooperation.  In total, the fiscal year 2010 Interior appropriations bill provides $32.1 billion in nonemergency discretionary spending. That amount is $4.5 billion above the equivalent 2009 enacted level but $225 million below the President's request. I wish to stress that. This bill is $225 million below the President's request.
