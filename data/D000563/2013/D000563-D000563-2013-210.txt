I am wearing a button, as many of my colleagues are, that says thank you to the Capitol Police.  The one I am wearing is not one that was issued today but one I asked to be commissioned after 9/11 because I thought about the extraordinary courage these men and women showed that day when an imminent attack on this building was well known. Yet they did everything in their power to protect all of us who work here and those who were visiting. I give a special thank you to them.  Yesterday was a tragic day. A young woman--it is still unclear what motivated her--was involved in an incident at the White House, backing into a police vehicle and then trying to escape, followed by a Secret Service officer. She drove toward the Capitol Building and, sadly, her life was taken.  It is understandable. We live in an era where this campus, the U.S. Capitol grounds are carefully guarded for obvious reasons. It is a clear, visible target to those who hate the United States. Someone in a car is a threat. We know that because car bombs are so common in some parts of the world and we are wary of vehicles that may be used to harm innocent visitors or people who work in the U.S. Capitol Building.  It will be some time before we sort out all the details of what led to this incident yesterday, but there is something we know very clearly; that is, that the men and women in the Capitol Police stepped forward to defend this Capitol Building and all those who work and visit here. They did this risking their own lives.  This morning's Washington Post has a few paragraphs on this which bear repeating for the record:       What seems beyond doubt is that Secret Service personnel,      Capitol Police and probably many others rushed toward, not      away from, danger--as they are trained to do and as Americans      expect them to do. Inside Congress, aides took cover, traded      anxious text messages and then went on with their work.       Like hundreds of thousands of other federal employees,      these are men and women whose contributions have been      demeaned by the federal shutdown, who are being asked to work      without, at least for the moment, being paid--and who are      doing their jobs with considerably more dignity than the      House of Representatives has mustered.       ``We all owe the Capitol Police a debt of gratitude for      their work every day; no finer examples of professionalism &      bravery,'' tweeted House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).      That's true. But Mr. Boehner owes them, and the rest of the      federal workforce, more than a 140-character message of      thanks. He owes them a paycheck; he owes them a budget; he      owes them an apology.  How many times have we listened on the floor of the Senate as those from the other side of the aisle criticize federal workers, try in some way to demean the contribution they make to this great Nation, trying to find some way to lay them off, if not fire them, or to restrict their pay over and over; they are trampled on; they are political casualties time and again on the floor of the Senate.  Yet each and every one of us, every Member of Congress in the Senate and the House, our staffs and our families and those who visit are safe because of these men and women, these Federal workers. It is about time we realize when we shut down the government, it is the ultimate disrespect to these men and women who simply want to do their job to make this a safer and better nation.  It was very visible on the grounds right off the Capitol Building itself yesterday afternoon. While many of us were told to stay in our offices, don't move, for at least half an hour, these men and women risked their lives during a government shutdown when they aren't receiving a paycheck. It was very visible--and should have been visible to everyone--the irony of this situation that we shut down the government and yet ask them to risk their lives without promise of a paycheck.  I wish to mention one other thing that happened yesterday that may not have been noticed, where the impact of government shutdown is not quite as visible. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Wendy Sherman, Under Secretary of State, testified about the fear of Iran developing a nuclear bomb and sanctions imposed by the United States and the civilized world to persuade them not to develop a nuclear bomb.  She went on to say: The government shutdown that has furloughed 72 percent of the civilian intelligence employees in our government is not making this a safer country or giving us the eyes and ears around the world we need to make sure Iran does not develop a nuclear bomb, a nuclear weapon.  She added: Within the Department of the Treasury, 90 percent, 9 out of 10, of the people working in the agency which has the responsibility of specifically watching that the sanctions in Iran are enforced have been furloughed--90 percent of them.  It isn't only a matter of the visibility of Capitol Police risking their lives, despite this demeaning government shutdown, it is also that less visible, such as 72 percent of our intelligence workers charged with keeping America safe, avoiding another 9/11, have been sent home. Ninety percent of those who are watching carefully so Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon were sent home because of this government shutdown.  This is the third embarrassing, shameful day of this government shutdown. People say how could it possibly end? It could end very simply. Speaker John Boehner has on his desk in the House of Representatives a continuing resolution which is a spending bill which will reopen the government for at least 6 weeks. He should call that for a vote today. He will receive bipartisan support. He shouldn't fear that. He should celebrate it, bipartisan support to reopen this government.  Then I hope he will accept the invitation of Senator Reid and others to meet with Senator Murray, the chairman of the Budget Committee, sit down, plan the spending, plan the savings, and plan the important policy decisions--which we have for 6 months tried to bring to this floor--in a conference committee. Let's do it and do it today. Today should be the end of the government shutdown.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the editorial from today's Washington Post and an article from The Daily Beast on Iran.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 3, 2013] Essential Workers: Those Dedicated to Serving the Public Deserve More                      Than a Brief Message of Thanks       The order went out to Capitol Hill personnel Thursday      afternoon in capital letters: SHELTER IN PLACE. It was a      terrifying moment for a community already on edge. The scare      ended with less carnage than we have come to fear in such      moments--but not before we were reminded again of the      dedication of those who work for the government. Maybe that      reminder will bring some politicians to their senses.       As we write this, investigators are trying to sort out the      series of events that apparently began when a woman tried to      drive her car through a security barrier near the White House      and ended with shots fired near the U.S. Capitol. What the      woman, who was killed, intended, whether police responded      appropriately, what lessons may be drawn about the efficacy      of security barriers: All of that remains to be examined.       What seems beyond doubt is that Secret Service personnel,      Capitol Police and probably many others rushed toward, not      away from, danger--as they are trained to do and as Americans      expect them to do. Inside Congress, aides took cover, traded      anxious text messages and then went on with their work.       Like hundreds of thousands of other federal employees,      these are men and women whose contributions have been      demeaned by the federal shutdown, who are being asked to work      without, at least for the moment, being paid--and who are      doing their jobs with considerably more dignity than the      House of Representatives has mustered.       ``We all owe the Capitol Police a debt of gratitude for      their work every day; no finer examples of professionalism &      bravery,'' tweeted House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).      That's true. But Mr. Boehner owes them, and the rest of the      federal workforce, more than a 140-character message of      thanks. He owes them a paycheck; he owes them a budget; he      owes them an apology.       Beyond the shooting Thursday, Washington was full of the      usual posturing, speculating, rumor-trading and jockeying for      public relations advantage. Maybe the shutdown would be      wrapped into the default. Maybe the Obamacare demands would      be subsumed into ``grand bargain''demands. Maybe this, maybe      that.       Meanwhile, there are mothers who depend on federal      assistance for nutrition for their children. There are motel      owners and workers on Skyline Drive whose livelihood is      threatened because the national parks are closed in what      should be their peak season. There are dedicated scientists      and food inspectors and intelligence analysts who have been      told by Mr. Boehner that he and his fellow Republicans do not      consider their work all that essential to the nation.       Those scientists and inspectors and analysts are not the      nonessential ones.                                  ____                  [From the Daily Beast, Oct. 2, 2013]    Government Shutdown Empties Offices Enforcing Sanctions on Iran                            (By Josh Rogin)       The shutdown has forced the Treasury Department to furlough      most of the employees enforcing sanctions on Iran, just as      the U.S. is beginning new negotiations. Josh Rogin and Eli      Lake report on the potential fallout.       With the government shut down, most U.S. officials      enforcing sanctions on Iran are not at work, potentially      undermining pressure on Tehran as U.S.-Iran negotiations      recommence, according to administration officials, lawmakers,      and experts.       The Treasury Department has furloughed approximately 90      percent of the employees in its Office of Terrorist Financing      and Intelligence (TFI), which is responsible for the      monitoring of illicit activities and enforcement of sanctions      related to several countries, including Iran, Syria, and      North Korea, Treasury officials told The Daily Beast. The      drastic scaling down of personnel working on those activities      comes just as the Obama administration is engaging in its      first set of diplomatic negotiations with the new Iranian      government, led by President Hassan Rouhani (/articles/2013/     09/26/what-hassan-rouhani-really-said-about-the-     holocaust.html).       A subsection of TFI, the Office of Foreign Asset Control      (OFAC), which implements the U.S. government's financial      sanctions, has been forced to furlough nearly all its staff      due to the lapse in congressional funding, said a Treasury      Department spokesman.       ``As a result, OFAC is unable to sustain its core functions      of: issuing new sanctions designations against those enabling      the governments of Iran and Syria as well as terrorist      organizations, WMD proliferators, narcotics cartels, and      transnational organized crime groups; investigating and      penalizing sanctions violations; issuing licenses to      authorize humanitarian and other important activities that      might otherwise be barred by sanctions; and issuing new      sanctions prohibitions and guidance,'' the spokesman said.      ``This massively reduced staffing not only impairs OFAC's      ability to execute its mission, it also undermines TFI's      broader efforts to combat money laundering and illicit      finance, protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system,      and disrupt the financial underpinnings of our adversaries.''       Two other subsections of TFI, the Office of Intelligence      and Analysis (OIA) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement      Network (FinCEN), also are working with a skeleton crew.      According to FinCEN's shutdown plan (PDF (http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Documents/FinCEN%20Shutdown%20Plan_ revised%20FY%202014_      Web%20Version.pdf), 30 of 345 employees were kept on after      appropriations ran out Oct. 1.       Administration officials often tout the various rounds of      sanctions (/articles/2013/09/23/lawmakers-set-a-high-bar-for-     iran-to-escape-sanctions.html) passed by Congress and signed      by President Obama as crucial to pressuring the Iranian      regime to strike a deal to bring its clandestine nuclear      program into accordance with international standards of      transparency and convince the world it is not developing a      nuclear weapon.       ``If the lights are not on, then the Iranians will engage      in massive sanctions busting to try to replenish their      dwindling foreign exchange reserves.''       ``Because of the extraordinary sanctions that we have been      able to put in place over the last several years, the      Iranians are now prepared, it appears, to negotiate,'' Obama      said Monday (http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/09/30/remarks-president-obama-and-prime-minister-netanyahu-israel-after-bilate) after meeting with Israeli Prime      Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. ``But we      enter into these negotiations very clear-eyed. They will not      be easy. And anything that we do will require the highest      standards of verification in order for us to provide the sort      of sanctions relief that I think they are looking for.''       Pressures must be kept in place and even strengthened as      new negotiations with the Iranians begin, Netanyahu      responded. But the furloughs are making it more difficult to     enforce the sanctions during the budget stalemate.       FinCEN processes tips from banks about suspicious activity      and possible money laundering, and shares the data with law      enforcement. The network and OFAC are two of the most potent      tools the U.S. government has used to pressure Iran.       ``Given the fact that the vast majority of FinCEN employees      have been furloughed, important pieces of financial      intelligence will not be sifted through and analyzed by the      agency charged with this task,'' said Avi Jorisch, a former      policy adviser for the Treasury Department's TFI office. The      government is shut down, Jorisch said, but ``money launderers      are certainly not taking vacation.''       Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for the      Defense of Democracies, said Iran could capitalize on the      lack of monitoring and sanctions enforcement to replenish its      coffers and advance its nuclear program while no one is      looking.       ``If the lights are not on, then the Iranians will engage      in massive sanctions busting to try to replenish their      dwindling foreign exchange reserves,'' he said. ``If you      don't have the resources to investigate, identify, and      designate the tens of billions of dollars of Iranian regime      assets, then you've extended the economic runway of the      Iranian regime and increased the likelihood that they could      reach nuclear breakout sooner rather than later.''       In Congress, top Democrats blame House Republicans for      failing to pass a continuing resolution to keep the      government running.       ``Today, we learn that the Republican shutdown is hurting      the Treasury's efforts to implement sanctions against Iran to      prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon,'' Rep. Jerrold      Nadler (D-NY) told The Daily Beast. ``This insanity has to      stop. We must not allow a few extreme members of the      Republican Party to threaten our national security any      longer. Speaker Boehner should put a clean bill on the floor      and allow an up or down vote on reopening the government      today. Any further delay clearly threatens our national      security.''       Top Republicans involved with Iran sanctions said the      administration is to blame for not keeping the Treasury      employees at their jobs.       ``Enforcing sanctions and stopping illicit financial      transactions are core national security missions,'' Sen. Mark      Kirk (R-IL) told The Daily Beast. ``The administration should      not be putting our national security at risk to score      political points. All sides need to find common ground and do      what's right for the American people.''       Treasury officials say they are implementing the shutdown      guidelines given to them by the Office of Management and      Budget and doing the best they can with limited resources.       ``The House Republicans' decision to shut down the      government has real consequences, and it goes to our ability      to execute our mission, which is integral to protecting our      country and advancing our interests,'' a Treasury Department      official said. ``We are still enforcing our sanctions, we are      still capable of taking action if necessary, but it's a hell      of a lot harder and we can't be nearly as nimble and      comprehensive as we could be if Congress would pass a clean      CR.''       Meanwhile, the State Department, which has somehow managed      to avoid any significant staff reductions due to the shutdown      (/articles/2013/09/30/how-the-government-shutdown-hurts-     national-security.html), is beginning a new round of      negotiations with Iran in conjunction with its partners in      the P5+1, set to take place later this month in Geneva      (http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130930/eu-plays-down-deadline-iran-talks-0).       State Department officials told The Daily Beast on      Wednesday that the shutdown won't affect those plans.       ``Dealing with Iran's nuclear program is an absolute top      priority for the State Department, and Undersecretary Wendy      Sherman and the State Department team are working hard every      day on this issue preparing for the next round of talks in      Geneva with Iran and our international partners,'' said Marie      Harf, deputy State Department spokeswoman.
