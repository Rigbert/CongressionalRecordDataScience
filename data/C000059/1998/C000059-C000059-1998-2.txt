Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution and in support of our troops overseas. We as a Nation and a Congress must focus now on the servicemen and women who are risking their lives and standing bravely in the days of adversity to ensure safety for all Americans.  Iraq will continue to be a threat to the United States and the rest of the world as long as Saddam Hussein is in power and has the ability to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein has been given too many chances to comply with United Nations inspections. We cannot continue to play this dangerous game of cat and mouse.  I support the use of force in this region to ensure the safety of America and global interests. In what should be a season of peace, my thoughts and prayers are with our servicemen and women and their families as they help make the world a safer place. God bless them.
