  I continue to add, what we have seen is what we call block grants proposed under the guise of: Well, we are letting the local people decide where the money is going to go. All of us want that to happen. All of us want local people involved in the decisionmaking. But what I have seen in the almost 8 years I have been here is that block grants are reduced dramatically. In fact, the title I funds, under the current bill--when we look in the block grants--are being reduced. So it is pretty easy to reduce a block grant. It is a lot harder to fire 29,000 teachers.
