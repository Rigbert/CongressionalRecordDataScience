President, I will respond by saying that on numerous occasions in my 55 years of flying airplanes, I have done a lot of Good Samaritan things. It never really occurred to me, but one time I went all the way down to Dominica, near Caracas, Venezuela--I was telling the Senator from Iowa about it--leading 10 planes. Eight of us made it down and back. That is something we did not have to do, but no one else would do it.  I believe we can encourage a lot more people to do these Good Samaritan duties if we give them a little bit of relief from liability.  I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from Iowa makes his remarks, I be recognized for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.
