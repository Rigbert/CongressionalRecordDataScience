President, I am pleased to rise today to lend my support for the inclusion of $15,000,000 million for the Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. This important funding brings to completion the creation of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust as specified by PL. 104-58.  During the 104th Congress, we created the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust to commemorate the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The Oklahoma City National Memorial will consist of three components: the actual Memorial, an interactive learning museum, and the Memorial Institute now funded in this legislation.  Fundraising for the symbolic Memorial and the Memorial Center is nearly complete and construction for the symbolic Memorial is complete. With the funding provided in this legislation, the Memorial Institute is one step closer to a reality. Already, an implementation plan for the Memorial Institute is complete and work has begun to prepare for the construction.  In preparation, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation and the Oklahoma City Memorial Trust have entered into a partnership with the Oklahoma Alliance for Public Policy Research to establish an operational relationship for the Memorial Institute. The Alliance consists of all of Oklahoma's research universities (Oklahoma State, University of Oklahoma, and Tulsa University), while the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center will perform the administrative and functional duties as directed by the Institute's management team.  The Alliance meets the joint public-private partnership arrangement provided for in the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust Act. This joint partnership is both prudent and necessary as Oklahoma and the nation begins to consider the broader implications of domestic terrorism.  The Memorial Institute will be the only institute of its kind in the nation dedicated to understanding, deterring, and mitigating against terrorism. Naturally, it is only fitting that such a center is located in Oklahoma given our close, personal relationship with domestic terrorism. Yet this Memorial Institute will go beyond being just another reminder of the tragic event that struck Oklahoma and the nation early in the morning of April 19, 1995.  The Memorial Institute will also provide a collaboration and exchange of knowledge between public and private, Federal and state, and military and civilian efforts to counter terrorism. Another important issue that will be researched at the Memorial Institute is how to better coordinate and integrate health care and medical efforts associated with our response to terrorism. This collaborative research on emerging counter-terrorism projects will lend key insights to ensuring that the events of April 19 never occur again.  Mr. President, I thank the Chairman, Senator Gregg, and the Ranking Member, Senator Hollings, for efforts to secure this important funding for the Memorial Institute. Their efforts will long be remembered by the researchers who spend time at the Memorial Institute and the American public who stand to gain countless benefits from their research. Oklahoma and the Nation thank them.                          ____________________
