Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  We have had quite a discussion of the need to cut, need to get the budget balanced, and as a supporter of the balanced budget amendment. I agree there. We have got to do it with a certain sense of priority.  We have also got to realize there are two ways to get a balanced budget. One is to make cuts, and the other is to raise revenues.  What this rule and consideration of this bill specifically prohibits is an egregious loophole which is being used by foreign corporations and by large corporations in America; that is, the giving away of the mineral lands of the western United States for $2.50 an acre.  Just last year a Canadian corporation which pays no income taxes in the United States, they do pay some employee taxes, but no income taxes, got a $10 billion resource for $9,700. That is the return to the U.S. taxpayers.  Now, if we are really serious, we would allow an amendment to this bill that would allow us to raise revenues to offset some of the unwise cuts in this budget.  What are the unwise cuts? Well, for example, we are going to eliminate the Bureau of Mines of the United States of America at the same time that we are allowing foreign corporations to come here and buy our precious mineral resources at $2.50 an acre. We are eliminating the United States Bureau of Mines, something that has been in existence for more than 100 years, an agency that has already been reformed, an agency which has cut its budget 20 percent in the last 2 years, an agency which helps develop the conservative use of these mineral resources, the safe environmental use of these resources.                              {time}  1915  They provide technical expertise to our small miners and prospectors. They work on safe extraction techniques for the people who work in the mines. They have developed restoration plans for bad mining practices that went on earlier in this century. They have developed ways to classify solid waste. They have developed ways to do in situ purification of heavily polluted waters.  No, we are going to eliminate them. We are going to eliminate the United States Bureau of Mines because we would not want to ask a foreign corporation like American Barrick to pay the American taxpayers a fair return for the extraction of those depletable mineral revenues, and under this bill we will not be allowed to ask those foreign corporations to pay, no. We will eliminate an essential agency, a vital function, investment of the United States Government before we will ask a foreign corporation to pay a penny.  We do not get the same privilege in their country. They should not get it for free here.  We are cutting other vital investments in this bill. We are cutting investments in State and private forestry. We are cutting investments in the O and C lands in the Western United States. We are cutting investment in the National Forest System management. We do not have enough money now to develop the plan proposed by the administration to manage the Federal forest lands in the Western United States or to begin a deliberate program of forest health recovery across the lands that are ravaged in the inner Mountain States, in eastern Oregon, and other States.  We need more investment, and it is the place to get it, but it is not allowed under this bill.
