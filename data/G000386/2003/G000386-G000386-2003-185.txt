 Fuel cell power plants represent a promising means for providing electricity that is generated in environmentally friendly means and from nonconventional sources. They also provide important load-leveling capabilities that will reduce the stress and reliance on our Nation's electricity grid. I am pleased to assure my friend from Montana that I will work to make sure that rechargeable fuel cell power plants, such as those he described, would be eligible for this tax credit.
