 President, for the information of all Senators, the next amendment will be from Senator Harkin, who is in the Chamber and ready to go. I want to also announce that the Republican amendment after that will be offered by Senator Frist of Tennessee, along with a Democratic cosponsor, on the subject of nonseverability, which is one of the most important, if not the most important, amendments remaining before we complete this bill at some point--the leader says--today.  With that, I yield the floor.
