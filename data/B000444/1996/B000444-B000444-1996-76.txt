 President, I rise to introduce the Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act of 1996. This is the President's juvenile justice bill, and I am introducing it at his request.  Over the last several years, a consensus has been building in our Nation, and we are now in the unusual position of having the public and the experts in agreement that juvenile crime and violence is the most pressing problem facing America.  Moreover, we now have the statistics to back up the consensus: This past February, the U.S. Department of Justice released an update to its first national report on juvenile offenders and victims.  The numbers in this report, as well as those in the FBI's most recent uniform crime report, demonstrate what many have been warning of for the last several years--we are facing a devastating rise in juvenile violence and crime.  Between 1988 and 1994 the juvenile violent crime arrest rate has increased by more than 50 percent.  In 1994, there were more than 125,000 juvenile arrests for violent crime offenses and another 131,000 juvenile arrests for drug abuse violations.  A total of more than 2.2 million juveniles were arrested for crimes in 1994.  Between 1993 and 1994, while adult arrest rates remained virtually stable, the total number of juvenile arrests increased 11 percent.  Over this same period, the number of juvenile arrests for violent crime increased 6.5 percent.  Most frightening, the Justice Department study also forecast that, even if the overall crime rate stops growing, the rising number of juveniles will nonetheless produce a 22-percent rise in violent crime arrests.  And, should the violent crime rate continue to grow as it has between 1983 and 1992, the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes will double by the year 2010 to more than 260,000 arrests.  The President's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act includes important provisions to address these increases in chronic, violent offenders, including transferring the most serious offenders to adult court for prosecution, increasing the range of sanctions available to the courts in sentencing a juvenile, increasing the length of time a juvenile can be incarcerated, and increasing the access courts have to a juvenile offender's prior record.  In my view, these provisions take an important first step toward beginning a needed dialog about a problem that is complicated and must be addressed over the long term. I hope that we can build on what the President has proposed, because we face a three-tiered challenge in reforming the juvenile justice system.  As juvenile violence grows, both in rate and intensity, it is, of course, important to reform the juvenile justice system to address the most violent young criminals. The current system was never designed to handle either the number of juveniles or the level of violence being perpetrated by a small number of juveniles. The President's bill focuses on this aspect of juvenile justice reform.  Just as critical--if not more so--if we are to effectively end the rise of juvenile crime rates is to focus on where this new breed of criminals is coming from and work to prevent future increases like the ones we have seen over the past decade.  Allow me to put some of the aforementioned statistics in context.  First, even with the increases in juvenile crime and violence, juveniles accounted for just 14 percent of all violent crimes and 25 percent of all property crimes in 1994.  Second, a small proportion of all children commit most of the violent juvenile crimes--less than one-half of 1 percent of all juveniles were arrested for a violent crime, and approximately 7 percent of youth who commit crime are violent offenders.  This last number is both heartening and frightening. On the one hand, it indicates that there is a small target population which demands our immediate attention, and that targeting this population could have significant results in lowering juvenile crime rates. As I noted, the President's bill addresses this need to crack down on this group.  On the other hand, the President's bill does not address the very real need to address the 95 percent of kids who are not yet committing serious crimes, but are on the crime path and will become part of this 5 percent if left unchecked.  In other words, we must do more to identify those offenders who will end up a part of that dangerous 5 percent and turn them around before they are too far down the road to violence.  Focusing attention only on the violent 5 percent misses the essential point that most kids in the juvenile justice system--95 percent of all juveniles arrested--are not violent. They are also often first-time offenders. These are the juveniles the system was originally designed to handle, and rightfully so, because these are the children who can still be deterred from becoming life-long criminals if we provide juvenile courts with the appropriate prevention and intervention resources at this critical stage.  Today, in most States, a juvenile can commit multiple, nonviolent offenses before they get any real attention from the juvenile justice system. This must change. We must help these 95 percent of juvenile offenders at the time of their first misbehavior and keep them from becoming repeat or serious offenders. This means giving juvenile court judges the ability to impose a range of graduated sanctions designed to prevent additional criminal behavior.  Finally, we must realize that most children are not delinquent--94 percent of children in 1994 did not come before a judge--but these children are in danger of becoming delinquent due to the risk factors many of them face.  Any truly comprehensive juvenile justice plan must address not only those children already in the system, but it must also focus on those children who may enter the system if their needs are not addressed.  This task may sound like an impossible task, but it is not. We know what works and we can implement it. For example, we know that nearly 50 percent of all youth crime occurs during the hours after-school and before dinnertime, as these are the hours that 80 percent of America's children during these hours return to homes where no adults are present to provide supervision.  By providing ``safe-havens'' such as boys and girls clubs and police athletic leagues where children can go after school, we can remove children from the streets and keep them out of trouble.  In addition, we know that most juvenile offenders target other juveniles as their victims. By providing safe, supervised activities for children, we also achieve the goal of ``target-hardening''--that is, we can reduce juvenile crime by removing potential victims from offender's paths.  Mr. President, as I have stated, although I generally support the efforts and initiatives of the President's Anti-gang and Youth Violence Control Act, it can only be one component of an overall juvenile justice initiative if it is to be successful. The President's bill does contain some important initiatives to deal with the most violent youth offenders. Among others, these provisions--which incorporate proposals made by me and other Members of Congress, include programs to initiate drug and gun courts in the juvenile system, to increase penalties for engaging children in drug trafficking, and for increasing controls on dangerous drugs such as Rohypnol and methamphetamine which are becoming increasingly popular among youth.  I commend the President on his efforts, and I urge the President and my colleagues to continue to address theissues of juvenile justice by working with me to develop a comprehensive youth violence control and delinquency prevention plan.                                 ______                                       By
