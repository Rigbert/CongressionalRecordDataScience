President, today, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce will recognize the philanthropic contributions of a longtime Vermonter: Antonio Pomerleau. Businessman, community developer, humanitarian all these terms apply to one of Vermont's most celebrated citizens. As I said in a statement to the Senate earlier this month, Marcelle and I are also fortunate to call him family.  But Tony's family extends beyond the Pomerleaus. It has come to encompass the State of Vermont, and his generosity has touched the lives of thousands of Vermonters.  This weekend, The Burlington Free Press published a story about Tony's legacy. His is a quintessential success story. From stockboy to economic magnet, Tony has become one of Vermont's most prominent businessmen. Along the way, he has donated millions of his own money to help Vermonters recover in the wake of such natural disasters as Tropical Storm Irene, to help renovate and restore mobile home parks for residents, and, notably, to celebrate the contributions and sacrifices of the many members of the Vermont National Guard and their families.  Few Vermonters have had such a footprint on Vermont's economic and social landscape. Antonio Pomerleau's contributions make him a Vermonter of the Year in 2012, but his legacy will benefit generations of Vermonters to come.  I ask unanimous consent that The Burlington Free Press article, ``Tony Pomerleau: The Art of the Dealmaker,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [The Burlington Free Press, Nov. 25, 2012]                Tony Pomerleau: The Art of the Dealmaker                           (By Candace Page)       Newport--Tony Pomerleau leans on his cane and steps into      Mill River Furniture on Main Street, just in time for its      grand opening ceremony. A dozen people converge on him,      filings drawn to a magnet.       The mayor greets him. City councilors introduce themselves.      Two local reporters quiz him about the fate of the city's      only grocery store if plans go forward to redevelop his strip      mall into a hotel and convention center. The head of the      downtown association calls him over for a ribbon-cutting      photo. ``We need you Tony, right in the middle,'' she says.       The 95-year-old, white-maned shopping center king of      Vermont is in his element, back in his native town with a      captive audience. He holds court for nearly an hour while the      furniture store owner whose event this is left in the      background.       ``I was 12 when I started work here,'' Pomerleau begins by      recalling his days as a stockboy and window dresser when this      building was a J.J. Newberry's five-and-dime. ``I had a knack      for windows. This is where I started my success. I learned      the customer has to see the merchandise if you want to      sell.''       Today, he owns the building. ``I put $400,000 into it to      fix it up,'' he says, his words carrying the French-Canadian      inflection he has never lost.       He jokes that store owner Skip Gray was ``kinda chicken''      about moving to Main Street from a much smaller store in the      Pomerleau shopping center. His eyes sparkle. He laughs along      with the audience at his own jokes.       In a voice graveled by age, he detours into stories that      have become his stock in trade. The anecdotes reel off as if      from a tape recorder, told and retold in almost exactly the      same words.       ``It's not what you pay for something, it's what you can      get for it,'' he tells the cluster of people, citing a real      estate deal 40 years in the past. ``I made $237,000 in 90      days'' he says of a tract of farmland bought, subdivided and      sold for three times what he paid.       He laments the just-announced closing of the Eveready      battery plant in St. Albans. The company's problem, he says      with finality, is that they didn't change with the times by      developing new products.       ``You gotta do something different from the other fellow,''      he says. ``There's a time limit on everything--except me.''      The line draws a chuckle from his clutch of listeners, as it      always does.       Grace, the youngest of Pomerleau's 10 children, glances up      from browsing among bedroom sets.       ``He does love an audience,'' she says.       `See the smoke coming out?'       On a late November night, the outside of Pomerleau's big      house on DeForest Heights in Burlington is a neon carnival of      Christmas.       Light-bulb-lit reindeer charge across the west lawn pulling      a sleigh of presents. Shoulder-high candy canes stick from      the north lawn. Christmas lights cling to the eaves and      swathe the trees in all directions.       Pomerleau opens the door for guests and pads down a hallway      in his slippers to point through the windows of his home      office.       ``That's a new one this year,'' he says with childlike      pleasure, pointing to a lighted train on the north lawn.       ``See, the wheels go around,'' he says, as lights on the      train blink to mimic movement. ``See the smoke coming out      there. Isn't that cute?'' More lights blink.       As a very young child, Pomerleau spent four or five years--     the time varies in the telling--in a kind of iron corset      after a bad fall when he was two. His father's Barton farm      burned. The family moved to Newport. The Depression struck.      His father's grocery burned.       In his telling, young Tony went to work barely out of      elementary school, making deals, subcontracting the mowing of      lawns and washing of cars to other kids or out-of-work men      and taking a hefty cut of the pay.       His stories of childhood Christmases are happy ones, of      horses and sleighs lined up outside the church for midnight      Mass, the bells as the sleighs jingled home, the sound of      carols.       But there is another memory as well. He walks into the      living rooms and leans against the piano, its top invisible      under the rows of photos of his children.       ``I was 12 or 13. One day I heard my father say to my      mother, `This is the first Christmas I can't afford any      presents.' I went down to the bank and took out $25--that was      money in those days--to give him.''       ``I came from nothing,'' he often says, setting the      backdrop for stories of his successes.       The big living room where an army of kids once played seems      empty on a pre-Thanksgiving evening. Country station WOKO      plays loudly on the radio.       In the kitchen, an aide is helping Pomerleau's 93-year-old      wife, Rita, with her dinner. Alzheimer's disease has slowly      claimed her.       ``It's the worst damn disease,'' he says. She speaks very      little, but still holds his hand and kisses him, he says.       ``Come back tomorrow night,'' he says as he ushers out his      visitors. ``We're putting up more lights. It's going to look      even better.''       `This business doesn't happen by itself'       Antonio B. Pomerleau made his first million before he was      45 and has made millions more since. His supermarket-anchored      strip malls dot nearly two dozen towns in Vermont and upstate      New York. He and his son Ernie have a staff of 25 to help run      their real estate businesses.       But here is the patriarch, spending a sunny November      afternoon in the artificial light of a windowless Newport      bowling alley two hours drive from his Burlington home,      talking intently and at length to a tenant whose lease      payment cannot amount to more than loose change in the      Pomerleau business.       There are gumball machines along the wall, a Nascar-themed      light over the pool table and an echoing feel to the place. A      lone father and son hurl heavy balls down one of the 10      lanes.       ``How's it going?'' Pomerleau asks as he lowers himself      carefully into a plastic chair beside a row of bowling balls.       ``About like last year,'' Yvan Parenteau, the alley's      owner, says.       ``That wasn't too good,'' Pomerleau says.       In fact, the business is struggling. Parenteau has trouble      making the rent. He is worried about his fate if the mall is      converted to a convention center. Pomerleau makes no      promises, only says no deal has been signed yet. ``I never      skin a bear until I've shot it,'' he's been telling everyone      he meets today.       After an hour, Pomerleau pushes himself up and says      goodbye. He climbs into his Mercedes for the trip back to      Burlington.       ``Now you see my life. This business doesn't happen by      itself,'' he says of his real estate empire.       He lists communities where bowling alleys, some of which he      built, have closed. Changing times, he says. He has adjusted      Parenteau's rent, allowing him to pay more in the winter,      less in summer. He has suggested prize-giving gimmicks to      draw in customers, and arranged for the bowling alley to have      a more prominent sign on the road. Later, Parenteau will say      of Pomerleau, ``You couldn't have a better landlord.''       Still, Pomerleau says, ``If he can't pay the rent, he won't      be here next year.''       `I'm the boss'       A stairlift descends almost noiselessly from the third      floor at Follett House, the elegant 19th-century Burlington      mansion the Pomerleaus saved and restored as their offices.      Tony Pomerleau climbs off the lift, which he has used since a      knee injury.       ``Hello, hello, hello,'' he greets a visitor and leads the      way into his office. He is surrounded by signs of success,      from the million-dollar view of Lake Champlain outside the      window, to the picture of himself with President Reagan.       He rises each day, puts on a suit and tie and goes to the      office. He takes business calls over breakfast and into the      dinner hour.       The Pomerleau family owns shopping centers in 18 Vermont      communities and four in New York. Most are strip malls      anchored by a supermarket. They are small by comparison with      a University Mall or the Williston big-box stores.      Pomerleau's single largest holding is the Shelburne Road      Plaza in Burlington, valued at $14.6 million.       ``What the hell would I want a mall for?'' he says. ``I      make a lot of money the way I do things.''       He spotted the attraction of shopping malls early,      understood the importance of location, pinched pennies,      negotiated hard with his lenders, gave up higher rents for a      percentage of a store's gross.       He has transferred ownership of many of his holdings to his      children, about $50 million worth, he says. Ernie Pomerleau,      65, runs the day-to-day operations of the family businesses      and does many of his own deals.       So what is the elder Pomerleau's role?       ``I'm the boss,'' Tony Pomerleau insists. ``I'm doing deals      every day . . . moving that furniture store to Main Street in      Newport. I got the Merchants Bank moving into my building in      South Burlington . . . lots of deals.''         His speech occasionally stutters. ``And and and so so so .      . .'' he growls. It's not clear whether he's lost his train      of thought, or is simply determined to hold the floor until      he's ready for the next sentence.       He still calculates dollars and cents in his head and      appears never to have forgotten a number.       ``Now Price Chopper,'' he begins, and outlines precisely      what the CEO of the grocery chain expected to gross at a new      store in Champlain, N. Y., and what Pomerleau told him he      would gross--and just how wrong Price Chopper was and just      how right Tony Pomerleau was: many million dollars right--     ``but don't put that in the paper,'' he says of the exact      figure he names. ``Price Chopper wouldn't like it.''       ``I make more money today than I ever made in my life, and      I don't need it. I give it away,'' he says. ``I'm not old,      I'm here every day making all kinds of deals. Everybody has a      time limit--except me.''       No regrets, no failures, no mistakes       It is a long drive from Burlington to Newport and back.      Grace drives, but her father is in control.       ``Turn here,'' he says. As the miles pass by: ``Don't go      that way . . . go this way . . . don't miss the turn . . .      keep going, I'll show you where to stop.''       It's a long enough trip for dozens of familiar anecdotes      starring Tony Pomerleau: The ``$237,000 profit in 90 days''      story. The ``I probably opened the first self-service      supermarket in the country'' story. The ``how I beat two      sharp guys from Boston in a real estate deal and made a      couple million'' story.       The car passes White's Tree Farm on Vermont 15 in Essex.      Hundreds of tiny Christmas trees grow in long rows.       ``There's a guy looking 20 years ahead,'' he says and notes      that he recently bought 18 acres across from the family's      expanding shopping center in Milton. Sometime in the future      ``it'll be worth two, three times what I paid.''       ``There's a time limit on everything--except me,'' he says.       A reporter, probing, asks about him about failures, deals      that didn't work out.       ``I don't remember any,'' he says. Earlier, it was      suggested that his proposal for high rises on the Burlington      waterfront--rejected by the city in the early 1980s--might be      considered a failure. He brushed the thought aside.       Big regrets in his 95 years?       ``No regrets,'' he says.       His biggest mistake?       There is a long pause.       ``The toughest was the wholesale business, but I made a      success of it,'' he says.       `I'm not quite as young as you'       It's 8:30 in the morning when Pomerleau walks into the      conference room at the Shelburne town offices. Town Manager      Paul Bohne and Selectman Al Gobeille stand up. They greet him      enthusiastically.       Around this town, Pomerleau is the hero of the moment. The      future of the little Shelburnewood mobile home park in the      center of town has been in limbo for nearly a decade as the      park's owner tried to sell.       Pomerleau stepped in earlier this year. His wife's two      caregivers live at Shelburnewood and asked him for advice.      They were worried about the future of their modest homes.       He decided to buy the mobile home park, replace the aging      and inadequate water and sewer lines and give the park it to      its residents. He will retain another six acres of the 18-     acre parcel for possible future development.       It is one of many acts of charitable giving that have      become a bigger part of what people know about Pomerleau.      There are the annual children's Christmas parties in      Burlington and Newport, the party for 1,200 Vermont National      Guardsmen and their spouses. There have been million-dollars      gifts to St. Michael's College, the YMCA and to a fund to      help mobile home residents rebuild after last year's tropical      storm.       He is scornful of businesspeople who, their fortunes made      in Vermont, move their official residence to Florida to avoid      higher taxes. ``It's wrong,'' he'll say. ``You made your      money here and Vermont needs you. I pay very big taxes and I      never complain.''       Now, he sits down with Bohne and Gobeille.       ``First of all, I never went into a deal in my life knowing      I was going to lose money,'' he says. ``The main reason I'm      doing this, these people didn't know where the hell they were      going to go.''       He's in the driver's seat. He has agreed in principle to      give the town a right-of-way for a new road through the      Shelburnewood property. The town has a change in      configuration to suggest. Bohne and Gobeille deploy      arguments.       Pomerleau immediately makes clear he is not interested.      Making changes would mean a longer time line for getting the      project done.       ``This would cause a lot of delay and I'm not quite as      young as you,'' he tells them.       ``You've got another 10 years,'' Gobeille joshes.       ``Oh no question, no question,'' Pomerleau says and changes      tack. ``No question your idea is good, but I don't want to do      it. I don't want to delay it for those people. It would kill      them.''       Bohne and Gobeille make one more pitch, then accept his      refusal and drop their proposal.       Pomerleau repeats his objections anyway, one last time.       ``For me, I think I'd rather stay with my plan. I might      live another 10 years. Five, no question, but 10. . . .''       `Everybody has a time limit'       Pomerleau pushes open the gate in the wrought-iron fence      that surrounds the family plot at Resurrection Park Cemetery      in South Burlington. ``Plot'' seems an inadequate word for      this cemetery within a cemetery.       A colonnade of pointed cedars leads to a backless facade      modeled on a Greek temple, its columns also recalling those      at Follett House.       ``I like columns,'' he says. He guides two visitors past      the statue of the Virgin Mary, past a bird bath, granite      planters, stone benches, all carefully swathed in plastic for      the winter. The flowers are beautiful in summer, he says.       ``This was all my idea. I didn't ask anybody. Didn't want      them to tell me what to do,'' he says. He jokes, ``My kids      would probably put me in the woods.''       ``This is my father here, and my mother,'' he says,      stopping by a row of five stones where he has moved the      bodies of his parents, an uncle and an aunt. In an opposite      line are the stones for the two daughters, Anne Marie and      Ellen, he lost to cancer.       ``Go over there,'' he says, ``Look at that one.'' In a      little nook off the main lawn, sits a stone for Jay Lefebvre,      the family's housekeeper of 40 years.       ``I told her before she died, you are part of the family,      you are going to be here with us,'' he says.       He walks slowly toward the line of columns that serves as a      dramatic backdrop. He climbs up three steps. Here, at the      head of the family, a bit above them all, a pair of massive,      polished slabs are set in the ground. Pomerleau's name is      carved on one, his wife's on the other.       The man who constantly jokes that St. Peter has forgotten      him has nevertheless prepared.       But Tony, one of his visitors asks, what about ``everybody      has a time limit--except me''?       ``This is just in case,'' he says.                          ____________________
