 President, I now send a series of amendments to the desk, and I ask unanimous consentthat the amendments be considered read and agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to these amendments be printed in the Record, with all the above occurring en bloc. I would note that these amendments have been cleared on both sides of the aisle.
