Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to California and the City of Temecula are exceptional. Temecula has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Mayor Ronald H. Roberts is one of these individuals. At a celebration on January 27, 2015, Mayor Roberts will be honored as he retires after many years of City Council service to the Temecula community.  About one month after the City of Temecula's incorporation, Ronald began working on the city's first ``Traffic Committee'' in January of 1990. In October of the same year, Ronald was selected to serve on the city's firstTraffic Commission. In November of 1992, Ronald began his service on the Temecula City Council, dedicating his time, talents and efforts to his local community. Throughout his tenure, the main objective of Mayor Roberts was to ensure the quality of life for all Temecula citizens continued to thrive, an objective he continued to champion throughout his twenty two years on City Council. Additionally, during his time as Mayor, he has played a pivotal role in the political landscape of the Temecula community, region and state.  Prior to his work on the City Council, Ronald served his community during his time with the California Highway Patrol, retiring after twenty nine years of valiant service. Ronald also freely gives his leadership and experience to many organizations, serving and chairing many boards at the community, regional, and state levels. These organizations include Habitat for Humanity Inland Valley Board of Directors, Temecula Balloon and Wine Festival, City of Temecula Traffic & Transportation Commission, Western Riverside Council of Government Executive Committee, Southern California Association of Governments, Southern California Association of Governments Transportation & Communications Committee, Riverside County Transportation Commission, Riverside County Transportation Commission Budget & Implementation Committee, Southern California Regional Rail Authority, Southern California Regional Rail Authority/Metrolink Operations Oversight Committee, SCAQMD Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee and National League of Cities Transportation Infrastructure & Services Committee.  As the longest standing City Council Member for the City of Temecula and as a man who has devoted over two decades to this great city, it is only fitting that he be honored as he retires from public service. Mayor Roberts' tireless passion for public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our region and the state and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires and moves onto the next phase of his life.                          ____________________
