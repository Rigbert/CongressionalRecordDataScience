Speaker, this is the last day of Black History Month, a vital commemoration that we celebrate in our Nation each February. I have had the privilege of hosting for 20 years, every year that I have been in Congress, a black history breakfast in my district, to which I have invited extraordinary speakers over the years, including our colleagues, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson); as well as his father; and many other distinguished African Americans and Members of this House.  At the outset, because she has a committee meeting to attend, I would like to yield to one of our newer colleagues but who is not new to the struggle for civil rights in this country and in her city. She is also a leader in her city as a prosecutor and as a judge. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones).
