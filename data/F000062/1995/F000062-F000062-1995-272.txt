 McClellan is an excellent base with superb, state-of-the-art facilities and is one of the most advanced installations in the entire military.  McClellan has its own one-of-a-kind industrial nuclear reactor, a nondestructive aircraft inspection facility, logistics retrofit engineering capabilities, and a technical laboratory with specialized logistics facilities. McClellan is truly a unique asset to our Nation's defense.  Finally with regard to McClellan, if economic impact--particularly cumulative economic impact--is going to be considered, then the impact on the northern California region must be considered when looking at McClellan.  Already in the Sacramento area, Mather Air Force Base and the Sacramento Army Depot have been slated for closure, resulting in the loss of nearly 7,000 direct jobs. And, in nearby Vallejo, the closure of Mare Island Naval shipyard will result in the loss of an additional 9,000 direct jobs.                       Long Beach Naval Shipyard  I do not believe that the Pentagon's recommendation to close Long Beach Naval Shipyard makes sense. In 1993, the Base Closure Commission addressed the issue of whether to close the Shipyard, and the Commission recognized the vital role that Long Beach plays in support of the Pacific Fleet and kept it open.  Long Beach Naval Shipyard is strategically located in southern California--near 70 percent of the Pacific Fleet in San Diego--and has a large dry-dock capable of docking every class of ship in the U.S. Navy's inventory, including large aircraft carriers. Other Naval shipyards are long distances from the west coast mega-port: Puget Sound is located 1,135 nautical miles from San Diego and Pearl Harbor is located 2,600 nautical miles away.  Long Beach is also the most cost-effective shipyard in the Navy. It is the only one of the eight Navy shipyards that operates in the black with annual retained earnings. In just the last 6 fiscal years, Long Beach has been consistently under budget and $102.7 million has been returned to the Navy budget.  The closure of Long Beach Naval Shipyard will also have a devastating economic impact. 13,000 jobs and $539 million in annual economic activity will be lost if Long Beach closes. Los Angeles County has taken the brunt of the State's defense downsizing and Long Beach previously suffered from a large base closure: Long Beach Naval Station.  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell may have provided the best defense of Long Beach when he said in 1991 that the:       closure of Long Beach Naval Shipyard would seriously      degrade the dry dock capability for all large ships in the      Southern California area. Alternatives in Hawaii and      Washington simply could not provide the services found at      Long Beach.  General Powell was right. Long Beach Naval Shipyard should not be closed.                          Onizuka Air Station  Onizuka Air Station has existed in Sunnyvale since the mid-1950's and was created to provide a place where the Air Force satellite control mission and other classified Defense Department tenants could function in collocation.  While the Air Force has proposed realigning Onizuka and shifting many of its functions to other bases outside California, the Air Force's proposal actually amounts to a stealth closure of this state-of-the-art base. In the short-term, nearly 3,000 jobs will be lost as a result of Onizuka's realignment. In the long term, Onizuka's closure will cost several thousand additional jobs.  In addition to the economic impact on the northern California region, I believe that Onizuka's realignment could have an adverse impact on U.S. national security, particularly with regard to the Nation's satellite control and communication network. I also question the cost-effectiveness of Onizuka's proposed realignment in light of the long pay-back period--7 years--and the fact that the base will continue to operate well into the next century.  I am also concerned that the recommendation to realign Onizuka could have been tainted by a 1993 internal Air Force study on the closure of Onizuka. This study was conducted outside of the official BRAC process and estimated the true cost to close Onizuka at hundreds of millions of dollars more than originally estimated by the Air Force. Unfortunately, the existence of this study--which was originally denied by the Air Force--was uncovered late in the BRAC process, thus impeding its full utilization.  I ask unanimous consent that the copy of a 1993 Air Force letter, which initiated a study of Onizuka Air Station's closure outside of the official BRAC process, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
