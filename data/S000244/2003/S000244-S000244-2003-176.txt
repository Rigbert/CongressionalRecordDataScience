Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 1437 on March 25, 2003, along with the ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).   The Office of Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives has prepared this bill and submitted it to the Committee on the Judiciary under Section 285(b) of Title 2, United States Code. Pursuant to Rule X of the House of Representatives, the Committee on the Judiciary maintains jurisdiction over the revision codification of statutes of the United States.   Last year, the House passed by voice vote H.R. 2068 which codified, without substantive change, certain general and permanent laws relating to Public Buildings, Property, and Works of Title 40 of the United States Code.   After Senate passage, H.R. 2068 was signed into law as Public Law 107-217 on August 21, 2002. H.R. 1437 makes necessary technical and conforming changes to Public Law 107-217 and Title 40 of the United States Code, and it does not change the substance of the existing law.   I am not aware of any controversy with respect to this bill, and I would encourage all Members to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
