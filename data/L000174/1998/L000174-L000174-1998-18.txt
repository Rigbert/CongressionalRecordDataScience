President, last Friday, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my good friend from Utah, spoke on the floor about juvenile justice legislation. He indicated that he will be urging the Majority Leader to make this issue one of the top legislative priorities in the 106th Congress. It is indeed unfortunate that the Senate has failed to consider legislation in this important area.  Improving our Nation's juvenile justice system and preventing juvenile delinquency has strong bipartisan support in Congress and in the White House. That is why I and other Democrats have introduced juvenile crime legislation both at the beginning and the end of this Congress. Within the first weeks of the 105th Congress, I joined Senator Daschle in introducing the ``Youth Violence, Crime and Drug Abuse Control Act of 1997,'' S. 15, and last month introduced, with the support of Senators Daschle, Biden and other Democratic members, the ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' S. 2484. That is why the Administration transmitted juvenile crime legislation, the ``Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act of 1997,'' S. 362, which I introduced with Senator Biden on the Administration's behalf in February 1997.  Given the strong interest in this issue from both sides of the aisle, the failure of the Senate to consider juvenile crime legislation would appear puzzling. Indeed, the House passed juvenile justice legislation three times this year, when it sent to the Senate H.R. 3 on May 8, 1997, H.R. 1818 on July 15, 1997, and both these bills again attached to S. 2073 on September 15, 1998. The Senate juvenile crime bill, S. 10, was voted on by the Judiciary Committee in July 1997, and then left to languish for over a year.  The Republicans have never called up S. 10 for consideration by the full Senate. Instead, in early September they rushed to the floor with no warning and offered terms for bringing up the bill that would have significantly limited debate and amendments on the many controversial items in the bill. For example, although the substitute juvenile crime bill that the Republicans wanted to debate contained over 160 changes from the Committee-reported bill, the majority wished to limit Democratic amendments to five. This offer was unacceptable, as the Republicans well knew before they ever offered it.  We should recognize this offer for what it is: a procedural charade engaged in by the Republicans in a feeble effort to place the blame on the minority for the majority's failure to bring up juvenile justice legislation in the Senate. Nevertheless, I suggested a plan for a full and fair debate on S. 10. On September 25, 1998, I put in the record a proposal that would have limited the amendments offered by Democrats to the most controversial aspects of the bill, such as restoring the core protection for juvenile status offenders to keep them out of jail, keeping juveniles who are in custody separated from adult inmates, and ensuring adequate prevention funding.  I never heard back from the Republicans. They simply ignored my proposal, and failed to turn to this issue again on the floor of the Senate. These facts make clear that assertions about Democrats refusing proposals to limit the number of amendments to S. 10, and refusing to permit a conference on House-passed legislation, could not be farther from the truth. Indeed, no proposal to agree to a conference was ever propounded on the floor of the Senate.  During the past year, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate and at hearings on numerous occasions about my concerns with S. 10, including on November 13, 1997, January 29, 1998, April 1, 1998, June 23, 1998, and September 8, 1998. On each of those occasions, I expressed my willingness to work with the Chairman in a bipartisan manner to improve this bill. Since Committee consideration of the bill, I have continued to raise the areas of concern that went unaddressed in the Committee-reported bill. Specifically, I was concerned that the bill skimped on effective prevention efforts to stop children from getting into trouble in the first place.  Second, I was concerned that the bill would gut the core protections, which have been in place for over 20 years to protect children that come into contact with the criminal justice system and keep them out of harm's way from adult inmates, to keep status and nonoffenders out of jail altogether, and to address disproportionate minority confinement.  Third, I was concerned about the federalization of juvenile crime due to S. 10's elimination of the requirement that federal courts may only get involved in prosecutions of juveniles for offenses with which the federal government has concurrent jurisdiction with the State, if the State cannot or declines to prosecute the juvenile.  Finally, I was concerned the new accountability block grant in S. 10 contained onerous eligibility requirements that would end up imposing on the States a one-size-fits-all uniform sewn-up in Washington for dealing with juvenile crime. I know many States viewedthis bill as a straight-jacket, which is why it was opposed by the National Governors' Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties and the Council of State Governments.  Unfortunately, productive negotiations on this bill did not commence in earnest until the final days of this Congress. The fact that negotiations began at all is due in no small part to the efforts and leadership of Representatives Bill McCollum, Charles Schumer, Frank Riggs, Bobby Scott and John Conyers. They and their staffs have worked tirelessly on this issue and to address many of the concerns that were raised about the juvenile crime legislation.  Over the past week, I have worked with Senators Hatch, Sessions, Biden, Kennedy, Kohl, Feingold and Bingaman, and our House counterparts, to craft bipartisan legislation that could be passed in the final days of this Congress. While our last-minute efforts to complete action on this bill were unsuccessful, I appreciate the good faith in which these bipartisan, bicameral negotiations took place and recognize the important compromises that were offered on all sides. Time ran out in this Congress to get our job done on this legislation.  I appreciate the frustration of many of my Republican colleagues about our inability to achieve consensus on juvenile justice legislation because I know that those frustrations are shared by me and my Democratic colleagues. It is unfortunate that the majority did not chose to begin these negotiations, and did not chose to start addressing the significant criticisms of this bill, until the last minutes of this Congress.  When the 106th Congress convenes, and we again turn our attention to juvenile justice legislation, my hope is that the good work we have accomplished over the last week is the starting point. If not, I fear that the 106th Congress will end up at the same place we are today: with no juvenile justice legislation to show as an accomplishment for all of us. I thank all who have been willing to make the effort in the final days, and look forward to completing this work early next year.                          ____________________
