 President, I rise today to voice my support for immediate passage of the Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of 2001, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee in July.  This important legislation would simply give States the option to provide health insurance coverage to pregnant women under the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Such coverage would include the full range of care, both during pregnancy and postpartum.  This means that a pregnant women would have access to epidurals during the birthing process and any health-related services necessary postpartum. It also means that a pregnant women who has other health conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, would be able to receive treatment for such disorders. Even life saving surgery for a pregnant woman appears to be not covered under the propose rule.  Keeping the mother healthy is not only in her best interest, but clearly in the best interest of the child. Providing a mother with access to health care services could help ensure that her child will have the opportunity to be raised by a healthy mother who will hopefully live a long life.  Additionally, providing the mother with access to health care services during pregnancy could also help eliminate complications during childbirthand postpartum. This could potentially cut down on health care costs.  Passage of this legislation is particularly important since last week the administration issued a final proposed rule that would give States the option to provide health insurance through SCHIP to a fetus. No mention is made of providing the same coverage to the woman carrying the fetus. Woman are completely left out of the equation. It simply makes no sense to issue a regulation that provides for health insurance for a fetus but not the woman preparing to give birth. In my mind, it makes more sense to simply expand access to prenatal and postpartum care.  In a country as prosperous as the United States, it is disturbing that we still rank 26th in the world in maternal mortality. This could all be avoided if we only did a better job of ensuring that all pregnant women, regardless of their income or status, had access to the full-range of health care services throughout the continuum of their pregnancy.  Currently under SCHIP, only women under the age of 19 are covered for pregnancy-related services. However, what happens to a woman who turns 20 halfway through her pregnancy? A 20-year old woman would not be able to access the same services under current law but would certainly need access to prenatal and postpartum care to ensure a safe pregnancy and maximize the chances of giving birth to a healthy child. This legislation would eliminate this discrepancy.  States can currently apply for a waiver to provide coverage to pregnant women. Many States have applied for such a waiver. The waiver process is often burdensome and timely. Why not just give all States the option to provide such coverage?  HHS Secretary Thompson himself said on March 6, 2002, before the House Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee: ``And so, if you can pass the bill, we don't need the rule. Let's pass the legislation.''  I echo Secretary Thompson's sentiment. In the remaining days of Congress, let's pass this commonsense legislation. It is a good investment. It will help protect our Nation's pregnant women by providing them with access to vital health care services, and will help ensure that our Nation's children are born to healthy mothers who have been given the foundation necessary to lead a long and healthy life.                          ____________________
