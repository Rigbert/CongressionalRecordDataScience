Chairman, I would like to speak for two Members who are not here tonight at the moment who I know would like to be here, my colleague the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), who serves on the Page Board, along with my good friend the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe). And for all Members, we are so appreciative of all the work that you did.  You do see us long days, long hours, early in the morning, and certainly again late at night. I have had the opportunity to appoint a number of students, wonderful students, from my district that have served. And it is terrific to watch them work and know who the Members are and understand a little bit of the process.  After they have left here, I have often seen them back at their schools back at home. And I correspond with them after they have left, even many years after they have left. And as I talk to their parents, I know that it is an opportunity that they will never ever forget.  It is a great privilege for all of you to be here. It is a privilege for us to have you be here, as well. And even though some of us might look like a page from time to time, particularly if we wear a blue coat, I just wanted to say for all of us, thank you. You do a wonderful job.
