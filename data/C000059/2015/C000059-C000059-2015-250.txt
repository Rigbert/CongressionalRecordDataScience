Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to his country are exceptional. Throughout the history of our republic we have asked young men and women to voluntarily step forward to guard and protect the freedoms we hold so dear. U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Eric Matthew Seaman of Murrieta, California, took that step forward and assumed the duties, responsibilities and sacrifices that are required of all Americans who join the finest military in history. Today I ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible young man who died in service to his country.  As a decorated Marine Corps helicopter crew chief, Sgt. Seaman was called upon when a devastating earthquake ravaged the impoverished nation of Nepal. The disaster has killed more than 8,500 Nepalese citizens and destroyed more than half a million homes, many of which are in remote areas that are now cutoff from medical and food supplies due to landslides. Sgt. Seaman was selected to be a member of Joint Task Force 505, which was activated to support the government of Nepal by conducting humanitarian disaster relief operations. During the mission, Sgt. Seaman and other Task Force members distributed critical supplies to rural, hard to reach communities and provided impacted Nepalese people with the life sustaining supplies they so desperately needed. Tragically, on May 12, 2015, Sgt. Seaman, along with five other U.S. Marines and two Nepalese soldiers, died when their helicopter crashed during a supply mission in the Charikot region of Nepal.  President Ronald Reagan said, ``Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference. The Marines don't have that problem.'' Sgt. Seaman embodies that sentiment and made invaluable contributions to the cause of liberty around the globe since joining the Marine Corps in 2009. Having deployed to Afghanistan and to Nepal, Sgt. Seaman bravely put himself in harm's way in order to carry out his mission, protect his country, and save the lives of innocent civilians. Those, Mr. Speaker, are the actions of a hero.  Sgt. Seaman is survived by his wife, Samantha, as well as a young son and daughter, and his parents, Bruce and Cheryl. The burdens and grief that they are left to endure are beyond calculation, but it is my hope that they can find some solace in knowing that their husband, father, and son served our country proudly and made truly life-saving contributions to people in tremendous need. Mr. Speaker, I know you and the entire House of Representatives join me in expressing my prayers and heartfelt condolences to Sgt. Seaman's family and friends.                          ____________________
