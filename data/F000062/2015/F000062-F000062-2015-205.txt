 President, I wish to pay tribute and thank a dedicated and capable individual, Lorenzo Goco, who retired from the Senate on Friday after 20 years of expert service.  For the past 6 years, Lorenzo has served as the deputy staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, SSCI. He has worked on the committee since 1995, when he was brought over by Senator Bob Kerrey. He has seen the highs and the lows of Senate life, and has made a valued contribution to the committee, to the Senate, and to the national security of the United States.  Since the beginning of my chairmanship of the committee in 2009, Lorenzo has been the heart of the Democratic staff. Without drawing attention to himself, he has gotten things done--whether it meant setting the schedule and wrangling agency witnesses to attend on short notice, assisting the intelligence community to see the wisdom of the committee's approach, or bridging the divide between the majority and minority in the rare case of disagreement, Lorenzo kept the committee on track and headed in the right direction.  As the deputy staff director, Lorenzo is responsible for everything but gets the credit for nothing. He has represented the SSCI at the weekly meeting of Democratic staff directors more often than the actual staff director, and he has had my full faith in representing the committee and me countless times. Often, a line of committee staffers will build in front of his door as people seek his advice on how to handle an issue or ask a question about a program.  Classification prevents me from relating on the Senate floor most of the projects that Lorenzo has contributed to or overseen in his time on the committee staff. But they include numerous reviews of CIA covert actions, reviews of acquisition programs by the National Security Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office, and the budget review of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  Due to CIA's declassification of the underlying information, I can say that Lorenzo was part of the committee's excellent work in investigating CIA's role in a shootdown of a missionary plane in Peru. He was instrumental in the committee's report on the prewar intelligence assessments of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and a constant force behind the staff's work on the Study of CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.  The committee's success in enacting six intelligence authorization bills in the past 6 years is in good measure a result of Lorenzo's work in drafting the legislation and the classified annexes the contain, working with other committees in the Senate and the House, and negotiating provisions with the executive branch.  There are plenty of congressional staff that are passionate advocates for aggressive action for this cause or that. Other staff focus on protecting their boss and as a result are more judicious and deliberate. Some are experts on process; some are experts on substance. Lorenzo is all of the above. His depth of experience on intelligence matters is unparalleled today in the Senate. He fights strongly for what he believes in, and has at times pushed me to be stronger on a cause than I might otherwise be. But he is always cool, calm, and collected, and manages to navigate the buffeting winds and tempestuous times that we face all too often.  I am sorry to see a key part of my team go, but I wish Lorenzo the best of luck. I have no doubt that he will have more time to spend with his wonderful wife Audrey and his three boys, whom I know are the source of unending pride, and perhaps the occasional bout of parental frustration. With any luck, they'll grow up like their father.  Thank you, Lorenzo, for your steadfast service.                          ____________________
