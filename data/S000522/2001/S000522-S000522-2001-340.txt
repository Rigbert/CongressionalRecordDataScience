Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 99) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Lebanon, Syria, and Iran should call upon Hezbollah to allow representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit four abducted Israelis, Adi Avitan, Binyamin Avraham, Omar Souad, and Elchanan Tannenbaum, presently held by Hezbollah forces in Lebanon.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H. Res. 99       Whereas on October 7, 2000, Hezbollah units, in clear      violation of international law, crossed the Lebanese border      into Israel and kidnapped three Israeli soldiers, Adi Avitan,      Binyamin Avraham, and Omar Souad;       Whereas on October 15, 2000, Hezbollah announced that it      had abducted a fourth Israeli, Elchanan Tannenbaum;       Whereas these captives are being held by Hezbollah in      Lebanon;       Whereas the 1999 Department of State report on foreign      terrorist organizations stated that Hezbollah receives      substantial amounts of financial assistance, training,      weapons, explosives, and political, diplomatic, and      organizational assistance from Iran and Syria;       Whereas Syria voted in favor of the Universal Declaration      of Human Rights in the United Nations General Assembly;       Whereas Lebanon voted in favor of the Universal Declaration      of Human Rights in the United Nations General Assembly;       Whereas Iran voted in favor of the Universal Declaration of      Human Rights in the United Nations General Assembly;       Whereas the International Committee of the Red Cross has      made numerous attempts to gain access to assess the condition      of these prisoners; and       Whereas the International Committee of the Red Cross has      been denied access to these prisoners: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of      Representatives that Lebanon, Syria, and Iran should call      upon Hezbollah to allow representatives of the International      Committee of the Red Cross to visit four abducted Israelis,      Adi Avitan, Binyamin Avraham, Omar Souad, and Elchanan      Tannenbaum, presently held by Hezbollah forces in Lebanon.
