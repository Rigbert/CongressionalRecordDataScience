President, Vermont is known for its small and large businesses alike. Vermonters take pride inbuying locally, and as a result, businesses like the Vermont Coffee Company have been able to expand and become forces in their respective industries.  When Paul Ralston started the Vermont Coffee Company over 30 years ago in the small town of Middlebury, VT, he did so based on the belief that coffee creates community. Today, he continues his commitment to a high-quality farmer-friendly coffee blend by using only fair trade, certified organic coffee beans from around the world.  Paul's passion for coffee has created an opportunity for him to forge his own path to success, and he has expanded Vermont Coffee Company's distribution to retail outlets throughout the Northeast and along the Atlantic coast. His business continues to expand, and his success is just one hallmark of the respected Vermont Brand. I congratulate his success, and I ask that the text of an article appearing in the Burlington Free Press on February 20, 2014, about his success be printed in for the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 20, 2014]         Middlebury Coffee Roaster Still Growing After 30 Years                          (By Melissa Pasanen)       Middlebury, VT.--Vermont Coffee Company in Middlebury was      ahead of the curve when it started roasting organic, fair      trade beans 30 years ago. Its continued success is based on a      simple philosophy.       In the front hall of Vermont Coffee Company's offices and      production facility, dozens of photos of happy people, some      with coffee cups in hand, smile down from the wall.       In keeping with the company's longtime tagline--``Coffee      roasted for friends''--these are not just customers, founder-     owner Paul Ralston clarified on a recent tour: They are      friends.       ``Before there was Facebook,'' Ralston, 61, said. ``We had      our friends' wall.''       Ralston has always been a little ahead of the curve, since      his first foray into roasting coffee beans some 30 years ago      as a tiny bakery-based operation.       There have also been plenty of curves in the road he has      traveled since then, but this year Ralston expects Vermont      Coffee Company to purchase half a million pounds of green      coffee beans, which will be roasted in its recently doubled      15,000-square-foot facility and shipped to accounts ranging      from a small, highly regarded group of New York City coffee      shops to Costco.                             Coffee culture       It was during his ownership of Bristol Bakery from 1977 to      1983 that Ralston first stumbled upon the smoky and aromatic      process of coffee-roasting in Manhattan's Bowery neighborhood      while shopping for used bakery equipment. The smells conjured      up memories of the strong espresso his Italian grandmother      carefully brewed every Sunday when he was a child.       When he came back to Bristol, Ralston serendipitously found      a classic turn-of-the-20th-century roaster, installed it in      the bakery's front window and began roasting batches of green      coffee beans well before the trend of small, local coffee      roasters swept the country.       After selling the bakery, Ralston returned to school at      Burlington's Trinity College to study business administration      and planned to pay some of his tuition bills by running a      Church Street espresso cart. But Starbucks was just opening      its first Seattle coffeehouse and most people didn't know      what to make of his cart. ``It was a huge flop,'' he said      ruefully.       More than a decade went by, during which Ralston spent time      in the San Francisco Bay area working in nonprofit arts      management and appreciating the region's vibrant cafe culture      before he and his wife, Deb Gwinn, returned to Vermont where      he helped grow the cosmetics and skincare company Autumn Harp      to $6 million in annual sales. That led to a job with The      Body Shop in England where, he noted, ``There was a coffee      drought, so I drank tea.''                            Brown-bagging it       In 1997, Ralston and Gwinn returned again to Vermont and to      the antique Royal Roaster #4, which had been gathering dust      in their Bristol garage. ``I hooked it up in the garage and      started roasting and taking the coffee to gatherings for      feedback,'' Ralston said. As he developed his new business      idea over the next few years, he kept things simple, both by      design and by default.       Like back in the Bristol Bakery days, Vermont Coffee      Company used brown paper lunch bags to package the coffee and      a friend made a rubber stamp to label the bags. ``The brown      bag was the starting principal,'' Ralston said. ``When you      would get something fresh and from a local shop, there      wouldn't be a lot of packaging.''       ``We started with just dark and decaf,'' he said. ``What      else do you need?'' And the coffee was available only as      whole bean. ``We refuse to grind coffee. As soon as you grind      it you start the staling process,'' Ralston explained.       Ralston's approach was also influenced strongly by his      former boss, Body Shop founder, Anita Roddick, who he      described as ``a pioneer in trade, not aid,'' cultivating      mutually beneficial trade relationships with developing      countries and communities to help them become self-sufficient      rather than simply providing financial or other aid. When he      first told Roddick he was thinking of getting back into      coffee, he recalled that she said to him, ``Your coffee      should be 100 percent organic and 100 percent fair trade.''      There wasn't a brand like that at the time, ``and it turned      out there was a good reason for that,'' Ralston said.      ``Everyone thought I was nuts. At the time, organic was just      gnarly vegetables.''                         Window of opportunity       Count Vermont coffee expert Dan Cox among those who thought      Ralston was a little nuts. Cox had been the first full-time      employee of what was then Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. He      worked there for a dozen years before he founded his own      Burlington-based coffee-testing business, Coffee Enterprises,      which does analysis for many major national coffee companies.      ``Paul came to me and said, I want to learn everything about      roasting,''' Cox recalled. ``He told me he wanted to be like      Peet's [a leading San Francisco Bay area coffee roaster],      which is like the Guinness of coffee. I said, This isn't the      Bay area. The East Coast is not into dark roast. Like with      Guinness, for every customer you turn on, you'll turn four      off.'''       In addition, Cox remembers Ralston outlining his ``folksy''      marketing plan with the brown bags and emphasis on selling to      friends. ``I said, That's a little far-fetched, pal.' And he      said, That's all I've got.'''       Ralston spent six months learning how to evaluate green      coffee beans, blend, roast and control quality and despite      Cox's initial concerns, he carved out a niche and grew      steadily. ``He was still there in five years and then another      five,'' Cox said. ``He was very savvy, always asking for a      better way to do something . . . and he has stayed true to      his style. His packaging is still relatively unsophisticated      but it works for him. He makes a respectable coffee and a      pretty darn good decaf.''       A few other factors worked in Ralston's favor, Cox added:      ``Number one, he had a passion for it, and number two, nobody      really came right after him. He had a window of opportunity      that doesn't exist today.''                              Solid focus       As Cox noted, the competitive frame is very different today      with new micro-roasters popping up regularly, but Ralston has      stayed focused on his initial vision.       Since its official launch in 2001, Vermont Coffee Company      has expanded to retail outlets all over Vermont, as well as      New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire with      distribution growing at a healthy clip around the Northeast      and down the Atlantic coast. The company has about 23      employees, about half of those full-time and many part-time      by choice, older and partly retired or younger with children.      ``Part of our business model is a flexible workforce,''      Ralston explained.       Ralston, who is sole owner, would not share sales figures      but Vermont Coffee Company projects 20 percent growth in      2014. The flagship line of retail packaged whole beans      remains simple and straightforward in its descriptors: Dark,      Medium, Mild and Decaf. The down-to-earth brown bag packaging      remains, although it takes the form of a brown box for      Costco.       With the exception of one line from the Dominican Republic,      rather than emphasizing single-sourced coffees from specific      regions like many other small roasters, Vermont Coffee      Company has always led with its blends.       ``We are blenders. There's nothing magical about our      beans,'' said Ralston. ``The goal is to keep our blends      tasting the same, month to month, year to year.''       Vermont Coffee Company buys certified organic beans      following principles set by the International Fair Trade      Federation, Ralston said. The annual coffee harvest occurs at      different times in different climates and over a year beans      could be sourced from Ethiopia, Indonesia, Peru, Bolivia,      Guatemala and Nicaragua, among other countries.       The beans are stacked high in burlap bags in a large      storage room in Middlebury all tagged with their country,      producer, and lot number. As he demonstrated how the beans      are pulled for evaluation through a long hollow spiked tool      that can dig deep into each bag, Ralston explained how      different beans contribute to the overall blend. Coffee from      Guatemala, for example, he said, ``We call them our spice      beans. They add fruity and floral notes.''       The company's modest marketing budget still emphasizes      grassroots relationship-building (now via social media),      coffee sampling and offering loyal customers Vermont Coffee      Company merchandise such as t-shirts and mugs for returning      proof-of-purchases, which they do by weaving strips of brown      bags into quilts, folding them into origami and even, in one      case, using them to craft a collage of Johnny Cash drinking      coffee ? black, of course.       Another thing that has not changed, Ralston noted with a      smile: ``We always smell like coffee. When we go to the bank,      they know who we are . . . It's a sensory business. We're in      it for what it smells and tastes like.''                        Slow roast, slow growth       Changes have come gradually, many in the form of process      improvements such as the     adoption of the Japanese production scheduling system,      Kanban; new pieces of equipment to mechanize jobs previously      done by hand like bag-folding; and increased roasting      capacity.       In the roasting room recently, a brand new, shiny stainless      steel roaster with capacity of 150 pounds was in the process      of being installed. It cost about $350,000 to purchase and      install and would double Vermont Coffee Company's roasting      capacity, Ralston said.       ``The thing that makes it big, bold coffee is how we roast      it,'' Ralston explained, pausing in front of one of the      company's two smaller roasters where a small circular window      gave a peek into the pre-roasted, dull grey-green beans while      the glossy dark brown, roasted beans swirled below. Vermont      Coffee Company roasts its beans about twice as long as many      other larger roasters, Ralston said. He believes the longer,      slower roast is key to building rounded flavors, similar to      slowly caramelized onions or the depth of a long-cooked Cajun      or Creole roux sauce base. ``It's a long, slow caramelizing      roast,'' he said, ``which results in coffee with more body      and sweeter, chocolate, caramel notes and a smoky tang and      lower acidity.''       With a similar careful approach, Ralston has planned and      budgeted for growth. Over his varied career, Ralston said,      ``I've made all the mistakes you can make.'' He has seen      firsthand, he said, that ``growth offers new ways to screw      up.''       ``We follow a model called bootstrapping,'' he said. ``We      use yesterday's cash flow to finance growth. We're not      extravagant.'' The company's credit line, he said, usually      has a zero balance. An additional challenge these past four      years has been Ralston's commitment to the Vermont      legislature to which he was elected in November of 2010. He      ran, he said, because ``I think there is a need for more      people with active business experience in the legislature.''       He feels good about what he has accomplished there, he      said, but it's been ``very hard'' balancing the four-month,      four-day-a-week commitment with running an actively growing      business. ``I think we would be further ahead if I hadn't      done it,'' he said.       Looking ahead 15 years, Ralston said with a smile, ``I hope      to still be grooving on coffee.'' He also hopes to be able to      spend more time ``at origin,'' in countries where coffee is      grown. ``It happens to be warmer than here,'' he added.       At home in Vermont, Ralston imagines a slightly bigger      office ``with a wood-burning stove, a couch and a bigger      coffee table where friends will come by to visit and sit to      have a coffee.''                     ____________________
