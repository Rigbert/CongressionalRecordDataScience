Speaker, reclaiming my time, the point is in 1985 we passed, what was it, Gramm-Rudman, and put us on this glidepath to the balanced budget. You know what happened. By 1990, it had disappeared.  We cannot let that happen again. Each one of these appropriations bills, and let me just digress for a minute, the reason it happened was because in each succeeding year, we did not follow through, and those appropriation bills, as the gentleman knows, did not follow the balanced budget.
