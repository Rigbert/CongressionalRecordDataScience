  Madam President, I wish to speak through the Chair to the Senator from West Virginia. I am going to speak not specifically against your amendment, but you have identified closing corporate tax loopholes as one way of raising revenue to offset yours. I am going to take advantage of my time against your amendment to speak because Members on your side of the aisle have used this approach in the past, and I want to say how there are some problems doing that.  Virtually all Democratic Members had a common theme in their amendments--raising taxes for more spending.
