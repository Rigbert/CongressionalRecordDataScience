 We have been told that $20 billion is a drop in the bucket. I don't think $20 billion is a drop in the bucket. We have been told that maybe $75 billion is not enough for State aid.  We have to be fiscally responsible as we approach this. I do not fault the good intentions behind people who have higher figures in mind, including the amendment by the Senator from Washington. There are Members on both sides of the aisle for whom fiscal relief is a key component of any larger tax and jobs package. I have worked hard to accommodate Members' priorities relative thereto.  A number of provisions in this amendment have been addressed by the State fiscal conservative relief amendment offered by Senator Collins. The State fiscal relief amendment offered by Senator Collins represents a significant boost to States. It provides $20 billion. To me, that is lots of money. This is much more money than some would like to spend at all. However, there will be those for whom no amount of spending will ever be enough.  I am not saying Senator Murray is one of those for whom no amount of money would ever be enough. All I am saying is that at some point we have to determine a final dollar amount for State aid.  We have an amendment that provides $20 billion for States, and I think we should stick with that number. Therefore, Senator Murray's amendment at $40 billion is too expensive and must be opposed. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. I urge them to support the Collins amendment.  I yield the floor.
