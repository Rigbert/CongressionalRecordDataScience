 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning-hour debate and noon for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The complete list, Mr. Speaker, will be, as usual, disclosed by the end of business today.  In addition, we will consider H.R. 2920, the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009; the 2010 Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act; the 2010 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act; and possibly the Food Safety Enforcement Act of 2009.  In addition, Members ought to be advised that on Tuesday, July 21, we will take the official photograph for the 111th Congress. We don't have a time on that, but we will try to give Members time for that as soon as possible. I imagine it will be sometime after the first votes.
