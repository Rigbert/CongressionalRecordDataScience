 After we complete today's vote on Ambassador Kelly Craft, whom we confirmed a month ago to serve as Ambassador to the United Nations, we will turn to several more public servants whom the President has asked to serve at the Departments of State, Treasury, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs, among others.  Meanwhile, the Appropriations Committee is working to produce government funding legislation. With a good-faith, bipartisan, bicameral approach, we will be able to build on the agreement the President signed into law last month and ensure adequate funding for the American people's priorities. As always, I know my colleagues and I are grateful to Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy for their work. I hope we are able to consider significant bipartisan funding legislation here on the floor this month before turning to a temporary continuing resolution while work continues.                          ____________________
