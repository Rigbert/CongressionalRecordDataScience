Speaker, as the New York Times recently reported, it is a steep, nearly insurmountable uphill journey to Japan for United States autos and auto parts. It is also an expensive journey, as rigged prices in Japan serve as significant nontariff barriers to higher sales of our goods in that country.  In my hometown of Toledo, OH, the world-renowned Jeep Cherokee is manufactured having a factory price of $19,100. By the time that Jeep Cherokee clears customs, passes through Japan's Byzantine distribution system, is checked for compliance with 238 regulations and is inspected in no less than 3 places, the sticker price of the same Jeep Cherokee in Nagoya is $31,372, a 52-percent markup.  Japan claims to be one of the world's greatest competitors. This label seems to be true in every market except their own. The Clinton administration is right to keep its foot on the accelerator of the unfair trade practices of Japan.  Open up your market, Japan. It is long overdue.                          ____________________
