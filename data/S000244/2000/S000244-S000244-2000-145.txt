Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to our distinguished colleague, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, the gentleman from Virginia, Representative Tom Bliley. Tom Bliley has served his constituents in Virginia for over 30 years, both on the local and national levels. His dedication to public service has taken him from the Richmond City Council, to the position of Mayor of Richmond, and then to this House where he has risen to chair this body's oldest committee.  Throughout his legislative career, Tom Bliley has accumulated a list of accomplishments most of us can barely imagine. For the last six years, he has led one of the most successful, efficient, and constructive committees in Congress. He oversaw passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which brought fairness, competition, and increased consumer choice to the industry. He led the charge to override President Clinton's veto of the Contract with America, at the same time overhauling and reforming the nation's securities laws. Finally, Tom Bliley led the effort needed to pass the Mammography Standard Act of 1998, life-saving legislation that will ensure the quality of many women's lives for years to come.  These are only a few of the legislative accomplishments we attribute to our colleague from Virginia. They illustrate his commitment to sound fiscal principles, a balanced budget, increased opportunities for individuals and small business owners, and common sense government. More importantly, they are among the reasons that Tom Bliley's constituents know that they can count on him to look after their best interests.  I know I join Tom Bliley's many friends in Virginia's Seventh Congressional District, as well as his many friends and colleagues here in the House, in wishing him the best in the years to come. He has served us well, and we will all miss the dedication and leadership he brought to his work.                          ____________________
