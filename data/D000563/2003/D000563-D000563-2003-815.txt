President, I have an amendment which I will be offering. At this point, I am prepared to commence debate on the amendment. I see the majority leader in the Chamber. If there is no other business to come before the Senate this evening, I will just continue the debate on the issue before us.  I would like to bring the attention of my colleagues to an amendment which I will bring to a vote tomorrow afternoon. This is an amendment which I have prepared and offered with a number of cosponsors. I would like to acknowledge their support in offering this amendment with me. They include a bipartisan group of Senators who, frankly, are on different places on the political spectrum when it comes to the issue of abortion. This may be one of the only amendments to be offered which brings together people who don't see eye to eye, usually, on this issue. It is a good-faith effort on the part of myself and the cosponsors to bring this amendment forward in an effort to find a reasonable way to resolve an extremely difficult issue.  I have said in previous debates, and I repeat that those who are on both sides of the issue come to it in good faith. Anyone who is in political life knows this is not an issue on which you are ever going to win. When it comes to the issue of abortion, there are a substantial portion of Americans who believe very strongly against a woman's right to choose, and a substantial portion who strongly favor a woman's right to choose. No matter which position you take, you are bound to make some enemies.  What I have found is that between these two positions on the issue, you will find most Americans. And most Americans when pressed come to the following conclusion: They believe that we should keep abortion procedures safe and legal but make them as rare as possible, do not encourage them, have them available in extraordinary situations, but do not encourage them.  That is the nature of the amendment which I am offering tomorrow, an amendment which I hope goes to the heart of the issue before us.  We are debating what is known as the partial-birth abortion procedure. It has been graphically described during the course of this debate, and I am sure will be described again. It is one of the procedures that is used to terminate a pregnancy.  There are those, including medical doctors, who argue that there is no such thing as a so-called partial-birth abortion. This was a term created for political purposes and that, in fact, when you look at all of the various abortion procedures available, you won't find this one listed. Some have called this the D procedure, dilation and extraction. Others say, no, it is somewhat different.  The reason the definition of that procedure is important is that across the street from the Senate in the Supreme Court, they have thrown out State statutes that just refer to partial-birth abortion by saying that it is so vague, they can't reach a conclusion as to what the State legislature in that case intended.  We come in this general debate on partial-birth abortion to the same impasse. The procedure is not well defined. But the amendment I offer is not an amendment that focuses on this procedure. What I focus on with the amendment is all abortion procedures postviability.  That is an important distinction. What we are saying is that regardless of the abortion procedure you are talking about, I am looking at that period of time after it is medically determined that the fetus that the mother or woman is carrying is viable, could survive outside the womb. That was a critical distinction made in Roe v. Wade over 25 years ago. They said, when it comes to a case where that fetus could survive and is viable, only under the most extraordinary circumstances could you end a pregnancy, could you terminate with an abortion.  That is reasonable. My amendment says that all abortion procedures postviability, after the fetus is viable, are prohibited except in two specific instances. You can only terminate a pregnancy legally through an abortion procedure after the fetus is viable if the life of the mother is at stake--same thing as said by my colleagues offering S. 3--or a woman, if she continued the pregnancy, has a risk of grievous physical injury. I will explain these terms a little later.  We also go on to say that in order to determine whether that late in the pregnancy, after the fetus could nominally survive outside the womb, in order to determine whether a woman's life is at risk to continue the pregnancy, or if she faces a grievous physical injury if she continues that pregnancy, you need not one but two doctors to certify that. But a reason that the two-doctor certification is important is that arguments were made that the same doctor performing the abortion would happily certify that the woman is eligible for the abortion. I don't believe that, but the critics have raised that point.  To overcome that point, we have added the requirement for a second medical certification of a doctor who is not performing the abortion procedure--a doctor who will certify that continuing the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother, or would expose this mother to grievous physical injury.  Then we add a very tough section in the bill that says that doctors who certify need to tell the truth. If they falsify information to justify a termination of a pregnancy, they face not only substantial fines of $100,000 in the first instance, $250,000 in the second instance, but in either case, if they falsify information about whether a woman's medical condition qualifies her for a late-term abortion, they can lose their licenses to practice medicine. That is about as serious a penalty as you can impose on a doctor.  So when you look at the span of what this amendment will do, it, in fact, limits all late-term abortions, regardless of the procedure--limits all late-term abortions, only allowing them in two cases: where the life of the mother is at stake if she continues the pregnancy, or whether she faces grievous physical injury--which we define--if she continues the pregnancy. She needs two doctors to stand by her.  We create an exception for an emergency. A woman late in her pregnancy, whose life is at risk, may not be able to find a second doctor; and if she can have a certification that it is an emergency situation, the second doctor's opinion will not be necessary. But that is the only exception. I think this is a very strict approach. I think it is one that is reasonable.  There has been a lot said on the floor as to whether the partial-birth abortion procedure is ever medically necessary. I have said repeatedly in debate that I am not a doctor; I cannot reach that conclusion on my own. I have to turn to others for advice. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it is never the only thing you can do, but in some cases it may be the most appropriate thing for you to do.  I have a statement of policy from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists which restates their earlier position of 1997. I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               American College of                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2003.     Hon. Barbara Boxer,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Boxer: The American College of Obstetricians      and Gynecologists (ACOG) reaffirms its Statement of Policy on      Intact Dilation and Extraction, initially approved by the      ACOG Executive Board in 1997.           Sincerely,                                                   Ralph Hale, MD,                                         Executive Vice President.       Attachment.                        ACOG Statement of Policy                (As issued by the ACOG Executive Board)             statement on intact dilatation and extraction       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit a method of      abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth      abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has prompted      questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to      respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague      and do not     delineate a specific procedure recognized in the medical      literature. Moreover, the definitions could be interpreted to      include elements of many recognized abortion and operative      obstetric techniques.       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists      (ACOG) believes the intent of such legislative proposals is      to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation      and Extraction'' (Intact D). This procedure has been      described as containing all of the following four elements:       1. deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a      sequence of days;       2. instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling      breech;       3. breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and       4. partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a      living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but      otherwise intact fetus.       Because these elements are part of established obstetric      techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four      elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an      intact D       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving      the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed      after 16 weeks, intact D is one method of terminating a      pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient,      must choose the most appropriate method based upon the      patient's individual circumstances.       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention      (CDC), only 5.3 percent of abortions performed in the United      States in 1993, the most recent data available, were      performed after the 16th week of pregnancy. A preliminary      figure published by the CDC for 1994 is 5.6 percent. The CDC      does not collect data on the specific method of abortion, so      it is unknown how many of these were performed using intact      D Other data show that second trimester transvaginal      instrumental abortion is a safe procedure.       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances      to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact      D is one of the methods available in some of these      situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no      circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above,      would be the only option to save the life or preserve the      health of the woman. An intact D, however, may be the best      or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to      save the life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the      doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the      woman's particular circumstances can make this decision. The      potential exists that legislation prohibiting specific      medical practices, such as intact D, may outlaw techniques      that are critical to the lives and health of American women.      The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decision      making is inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.       Approved by the Executive Board, January 12, 1997.
