Speaker, throughout this country of ours there are a few individuals who, because they contribute so generously of their time and talents to help others, are recognized as pillars of their community. Charles and Rebecca Gunnoe are two individuals who have combined their forces over the past 25 years, both in medical practice and in the community. I would like to take this opportunity to honor and praise them for their commitment to family, community, and the well-being of the Nation as a whole.  Early in his career, Dr. Gunnoe began the practice of advocating quality care for patients and firmly believes that it is possible for one physician to make a difference. He moved to Corona in 1954 and quickly became involved in many community activities. He began by serving as co-chairman on a committee of Corona citizens to recommend specialized needs and priorities for the future of Corona. He was also the Charter President of the Corona Junior Chamber of Commerce and helped develop and dedicate the first Boys Club of Corona. In addition to establishing a family life in Corona, Dr. Gunnoe founded the Circle City Hospital which is now part of the Corona Regional Medical Center. He also built the Corona Clinic where he continues to practice today.  Along with working on a daily basis with her husband, Mrs. Gunnoe too has demonstrated a commitment to the community in the development and funding of the Corona chapter of the Trauma Intervention Program, or TIP. This volunteer based organization assists families of victims in tragic situation.  Together they have provided funds and assistance in the development of a Christian school library, supported community resources such as the YMCA, Lion's Club, and other service organizations such as the Cancer Society, Foundation of Circle City Hospital and Corona Regional Medical Center, United Way, and Police and Sheriff Relief Funds.  I am fortunate to have Chuck and Becky Gunnoe as members of my district and personal friends. Their commitment to family and community is one that should serve as a model for others to follow. I thank them for their innumerable contributions and wish them the best of luck in all of their future endeavors.                          ____________________
