 President, I wish to inquire of my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Labor, HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, about the nature of funding in this measure for the care and treatment of unaccompanied alien children.  As my friend knows, in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Congress transferred responsibility for the care and treatment of unaccompanied alien children from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), effective March 1 of this year. Fiscal year 2004 will be the first full year during which ORR will be responsible for this important function, andit is critical for ORR to have adequate funding to exercise its new responsibilities.
