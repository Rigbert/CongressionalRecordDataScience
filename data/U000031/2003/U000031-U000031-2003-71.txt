Speaker, I offer an amendment to the Preamble.  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment to Preamble offered by Mr. Upton:       Strike the preamble and insert:       Whereas, on June 16, 1903, then 39 year old Henry Ford and      11 associates, armed with little cash, some tools, a few      blueprints, and unbounded faith, submitted incorporation      papers to Michigan's capital, Lansing, launching the Ford      Motor Company;       Whereas the Ford Motor Company began operations in a      leased, small converted wagon factory on a spur of the      Michigan Central Railroad in Detroit;       Whereas the first commercial automobile to emerge from the      Ford Motor Company in 1903 was the original 8-horsepower,      two-cylinder Model A vehicle with a two speed transmission,      28 inch wheels with wooden spokes, and 3 inch tires;       Whereas, between 1903 and 1908, Henry Ford and his      engineers went through 19 letters of the alphabet, creating      Models A through S, with some of these cars being      experimental models only and not available to the public;       Whereas, on October 1, 1908, the Ford Motor Company      introduced its ``universal car'', the Model T (sometimes      affectionately called the ``Tin Lizzie''), which could be      reconfigured by buyers to move cattle, haul freight, herd      horses, and even mow lawns, and Ford produced 10,660 Model T      vehicles its first year, an industry record;       Whereas the Ford Motor Company inaugurated the first      automotive integrated assembly line in 1913, changing the old      manner of building one car at a time through moving the work      to the worker by having parts, components, and assemblers      stationed at different intervals, and beginning a new era of      industrial progress and growth;       Whereas Henry Ford surprised the world in 1914 by setting      Ford's minimum wage at $5.00 per an 8-hour day, which      replaced the prior $2.34 wage for a 9-hour day and was a      truly great social revolution for its time;       Whereas that same year, 1914, Henry Ford, with an eye to      simplicity, efficiency, and affordability, ordered that the      Model T use black paint exclusively because it dried faster      than other colors, which meant more cars could be built daily      at a lower cost, and Ford said the vehicle will be offered in      ``any color so long as it is black'';       Whereas Ford's self-contained Rouge Manufacturing Complex      on the Rouge River encompassed diverse industries, including      suppliers, that allowed for the complete production of      vehicles, from raw materials processing to final assembly,      was an icon of the 20th century, and, with its current      revitalization and redevelopment, will remain an icon in the      21st century;       Whereas, in 1925, the company built the first of 199 Ford      Tri-Motor airplanes, nicknamed the ``Tin Goose'' and the      ``Model T of the Air'';       Whereas consumer demand for more luxury and power pushed      aside the then current model, and on March 9, 1932, a Ford      vehicle with the pioneering Ford V-8 engine block rolled off      the production line;       Whereas, while Ford offered only two brands through 1937      (Ford and Lincoln), due to increased competition, the first      Mercury was introduced in 1938, a car with a distinctive      streamlined body style, a V-8 engine with more horsepower      than a Ford, and hydraulic brakes, thus filling the void      between the low-priced Ford and the high-priced Lincoln      brands;       Whereas one of the largest labor unions in the Nation was      formed as the United Automobile Workers (UAW) in 1935, and      after a rather tumultuous beginning, won acceptance by the      auto industry and became a potent and forceful leader for      auto workers, with Ford building a strong relationship with      the union through its policies and programs;       Whereas by government decree all civilian auto production      in the United States ceased on February 10, 1942, and Ford,      under the control of the War Production Board, produced an      extensive array of tanks, B-24 aircraft, armored cars,      amphibious craft, gliders, and other materials for the World      War II war effort;       Whereas Ford dealers rallied to aid the Ford Motor Company      in its postwar comeback, proving their merit as the public's      main point of contact with the company;       Whereas, on September 21, 1945, Henry Ford II assumed the      presidency of Ford and on April 7, 1947, Ford's founder,      Henry Ford passed away;       Whereas a revitalized Ford met the postwar economic boom      with Ford's famed F-Series trucks making their debut in 1948      for commercial and personal use, and the debut of the 1949      Ford sedan, with the first change in a chassis since 1932,      and the first integration of body and fenders which would set      the standard for auto design in the future;       Whereas these new models were followed by such well-known      cars as the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, the retractable hardtop      convertible Ford Skyliner, the high performing Thunderbird,      introduced in 1955, the Ford Galaxie, introduced in 1959, and      the biggest success story of the 1960s, the Ford Mustang,      which has been a part of the American scene for almost 40      years;       Whereas, in 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower christened      the new Ford Research and Engineering Center, which was a      milestone in the company's dedication to automotive science      and which houses some of the most modern facilities for      automotive research;       Whereas Ford's innovation continued through the 1980s with      the introduction of the Ford Taurus, which was named the 1986      Motor Trend Car of the Year, and which resulted in future      aerodynamic design trends throughout the industry;       Whereas this innovation continued through the 1990s with      the debut in 1993 of the Ford Mondeo, European Car of the      Year, the redesigned 1994 Ford Mustang, and the introduction      in 1990 of the Ford Explorer, which defined the sports      utility vehicle (SUV) segment and remains the best selling      SUV in the world;       Whereas, as the 21st century begins, Ford continues its      marvelous record for fine products with the best-selling car      in the world, the Ford Focus, and the best-selling truck in      the world, the Ford F-Series;       Whereas the Ford Motor Company is the world's second      largest automaker, and includes Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Aston      Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo, and Mazda automotive      brands, as well as other diversified subsidiaries in finance      and other domestic and international business areas; and       Whereas, on October 30, 2001, William Clay Ford, Jr., the      great-grandson of Henry Ford, became Chairman and Chief      Executive Officer of the Ford Motor Company, and as such is      concentrating on the fundamentals that have powered the Ford      Motor Company to greatness over the last century and made it      a world-class auto and truck manufacturer, and that will      continue to carry the company through the 21st century to      develop even better products and innovations: Now, therefore,      be it
