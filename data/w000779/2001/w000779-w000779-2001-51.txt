President, I wish to bring to the Senate's attention a serious legal matter currently impeding Federal criminal investigations in many States, especially Oregon, and legislation that I am joining the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, in introducing today to correct this problem.  Enacted at the end of the 105th Congress as Section 801 of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill (Public Law 105-277), the Citizens Protection Act, commonly known as the ``McDade law,'' has hampered Federal law enforcement efforts aimed at combating child pornography, drug trafficking, and terrorism, particularly in the State of Oregon.  In the Gatti case [Gatti, 330 Or. 517 (2000)] in early 2000, the Oregon Supreme Court held that a private attorney had acted unethically by intentionally misrepresenting his identity to the employees of a medical records review company called Comprehensive Medical Review, CMR. The attorney, who represented a client who had filed a claim with an insurance company, believed that the insurance company was using CMR to generate fraudulent medical reports that the insurer then used to deny or limit claims. The attorney called CMR and falsely represented himself to be a chiropractor seeking employment with the company. The attorney was hoping to obtain information from CMR that he could use in a subsequent lawsuit against CMR and the insurance company.  The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the State Bar's view that the attorney's conduct violated two Oregon State Bar disciplinary rules and an Oregon statute, specifically, a disciplinary rule prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; a disciplinary rule prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of law or fact; and a statute prohibiting willful deceit or misconduct in the legal profession. In doing so, the court rejected the attorney's defense that his misrepresentations were justifiable because he was engaged in an investigation to seek evidence of fraud and other wrongful conduct. The court expressly ruled that there was no `prosecutorial exception' to either the State Bar disciplinary rules or the Oregon statute. As a result of this decision, prosecutors in Oregon may not concur or participate in undercover and other covert law enforcement techniques, even if the law enforcement technique at issue is lawful under Federal law.  Soon after this Oregon Supreme Court decision, the Oregon U.S. Attorney's Office informed the Oregon FBI Field Office that it would not concur or participate in the use of long-used and highly productive techniques, such as undercover operations and consensual monitoring of telephone calls, that could be disallowed by the State Bar. Several important investigations were immediately terminated or severely impeded. The Oregon U.S. Attorney even refused to certify the renewal of the Portland Innocent Images undercover program, which targets child pornography and exploitation. Without the U.S. Attorney's certification, the program was shut down and a significant criminal problem has since gone unchecked.  The Federal Investigation Enhancement Act that I am introducing today with Senator Leahy will clarify that Federal attorneys may, for the purpose of enforcing Federal law, authorize, concur, direct, and supervise covert investigations even though such activities may require the use of deceit or misrepresentation. In doing so, our legislation will make it possible for Federal authorities to continue their efforts to investigate and apprehend the most dangerous criminals.  It is my hope that the Senate will act quickly on this legislation that will correct the most serious problems caused by the McDade law. It will be of enormous help to Federal law enforcement efforts in Oregon and across our country who are prosecuting these crimes.                                 ______                                       By
