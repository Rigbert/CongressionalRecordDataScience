I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for clarifying that point.  If there are any additional modifications, I hope you will bring them to our attention as well.  Let me tell you what we are proposing with this tax stimulus package: a one-time tax refund check for all people who pay income or payroll taxes of $600 per couple and $300 per individual. A new 10-percent tax bracket applies to the first $12,000 of income for every married couple in America, whatever their gross income may be, and $6,000 for single filers.
