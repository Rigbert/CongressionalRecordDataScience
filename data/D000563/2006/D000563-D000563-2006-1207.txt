We should no longer ask taxpayers to give up royalties which they were entitled to because the oil companies frankly are doing well and the discounted oil was designed for the times when they were doing poorly.  If I understand what the Senator is saying, the same oil companies have been going to court challenging the Federal Government when it comes to these royalty payments and royalty discounts, so with all the talk about too much litigation, it turns out some of these oil companies believe litigation is a healthy thing if it protects their profit margins and protects their Federal subsidy.  If the Senator from Oregon would be kind enough to explain to me exactly what the impact of his amendment would be on this bill and how much money it could bring back to the Treasury for purposes already outlined--whether it is the LIHEAP program or money for education or health care, whatever it might be, that currently is going to oil companies that are doing well and experiencing record profits.
