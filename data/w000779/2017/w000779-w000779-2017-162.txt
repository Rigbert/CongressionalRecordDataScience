President and colleagues, thank you for your courtesy.  During the TrumpCare debate, it was clear that unraveling the consumer protections that Americans count on today causes the whole system to come apart at the expense of those who need healthcare the most.  I have heard the authors of this bill argue that the States will be able to keep the Affordable Care Act or do it their own way, but this bill asks each State to do a whole lot more with a whole lot less. That does not sound like a prescription for State innovation; it sounds like more of the same failed, partisan approach that the public witnessed earlier this year.  I know a bit about State innovation and have enjoyed talking with the distinguished President of the Senate about it. I wrote the provision that is currently in law that says that States have a chance to do better, not worse. What the States have been most interested in up until now is something called reinsurance, and the States that have been making headway in terms of their getting the green light from the Federal Government have used the existing law that I wrote. Yet the idea of letting States do worse is a different story, and it sure looks to me as if we will be seeing benefits cut and insurance plans being worth little more than the paper on which they are written. On top of that, Americans in red States should not be subjected to worse healthcare than those in blue States simply on the basis of their ZIP Codes.  So I come back to the bottom line in terms of bipartisanship in healthcare. I think that the way one makes lasting change in the American healthcare system is to find common ground across the aisle. I talked about some of the key principles behind it. I mentioned the fact that Chairman Hatch and I came together last night on a general framework for the children's health insurance bill.  Now, I have been approached by colleagues about this legislation, so I can only assume that means it is going to be pushed forward through the deeply partisan process known as reconciliation. That did not end well previously, and I am sure going to fight with everything I have to block partisan reconciliation tactics in the days ahead.  I close by saying let's try to pick up on the kind of approach Chairman Hatch and I tried to pursue last night--with a bipartisan effort on CHIP. Let's try to find common ground. I think healthcare is a basic human right. I also think Republicans have valid points with respect to there being a significant role for the private sector. I am interested in approaches that give all Americans the ability to have affordable, good-quality healthcare, and I think that we get it best if we pursue bipartisan approaches. I believe many of my colleagues here in the Senate share these views, and I hope the Senate will not have yet another knockdown, drag-out battle over a partisan reconciliation bill that will harm the American people but will instead pick up on the kind of bipartisan principles I have discussed tonight.  I thank the Presiding Officer and Senator Hoeven for the courtesy of having the additional time.  I yield the floor.
