. Senate.  I don't think it is any exaggeration to say that, without the leadership and dogged insistence of Judd Gregg and Kent Conrad, there would have been no Presidential Deficit Commission.  As a member of that commission, I want to say to Senator Gregg: I will get you back for that one.  In all seriousness, serving on the Deficit Commission was not an easy assignment. But I believe the commission's work, and the way we went about our work, shows that Democrats and Republicans can still reason together and act together for the good of our nation. I thank Senator Gregg for helping to remind us of that important truth.  You might remember a few years back when Senator Gregg won about $850,000 in a Powerball payoff. A bunch of us on our side of the aisle tried to convince him that he ought to do what all big lottery winners do: quit his job. He said no--there was more he wanted to do in the Senate.  Judd and I served together in the House and the Senate and, as I said, on the Deficit Commission. We're one of the Odd Couples of Capitol Hill. He's Felix and I'm Oscar.  We haven't agreed on a whole lot. But we have been allies on some big, important fights. Judd was an indispensible leader in the effort to finally give the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco. His work on that bill will save thousands and thousands of lives in America and around the world and I am proud to have been his partner on it.  I understand that Judd Gregg is the only person in New Hampshire history ever elected Senator, Congressman, Governor and Councilor. Little-known fact: I think he was also the model for the Old Man in the Mountain.  When Judd claimed his Powerball winnings, he told reporters, ``Even Senators get lucky sometime.'' I am lucky to have worked with Judd Gregg in both the House and the Senate for almost 15 years. We have had some spirited differences--always will. But I respect him as an independent-minded conservative, a tough negotiator and a man who believes in public service.  I wish Judd, Kathy and their family the very best in the next chapters of their lives.                               Judd Gregg
