President, I rise in opposition to the Hatch amendment. In a time of surging Chinese imports, high unemployment, and widespread economic pain, the Hatch amendment would make it harder for workers, companies, and farmers to obtain trade adjustment assistance in order to be able to compete in the global economy. Specifically, the Hatch amendment would take Congress back to a standard for qualifying for TAA benefits that was a demonstrated failure in the early 1980s.  Chairman Baucus and Chairman Camp have put together a reasonable TAA agreement. It is bipartisan. That bipartisan agreement ought to be preserved, which is why the amendment by the Senator from Utah should be rejected.  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.
