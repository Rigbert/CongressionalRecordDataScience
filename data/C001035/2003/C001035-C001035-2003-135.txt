President, I rise today to express my strong and unconditional support for our troops in Iraq. As the war continues to progress, I have every confidence in their capabilities, their courage, and their commitment. The passage by unanimous vote last week of a resolution in support of our troops sent a message to all the world that Congress is united behind our men and women in the gulf.  I have also come to express my sincere condolences to the families of those brave individuals who have already made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation. Last Friday, I learned that my State of Maine had suffered two losses early in the fighting, two marines with ties to the State of Maine: CPT Jay Aubin and CPL Brian Kennedy were among those killed when their helicopter crashed in the Kuwaiti desert. Captain Aubin grew up in Skowhegan, ME, and his parents, Thomas Aubin and Nancy Chamberlain, live in our State still. Corporal Kennedy's mother lives in Port Clyde, ME. No words can express fully my sorrow over their loss and mythanks for the service of their sons. Their brave sacrifice will never be forgotten.  On many occasions in recent months, this institution has debated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Individual Senators have had honest disagreements about the right course to take in confronting Saddam Hussein. Now that our troops are engaged in battle against the forces of Saddam Hussein, we must speak with one voice.  The outcome of this conflict is not in doubt. Our military is the best equipped with the best trained force in the world's history. As the representative from Maine on the Senate Armed Services Committee, it has been my privilege and honor to work side by side with our military leaders to ensure this is the case.  If there is any message we could continue to send to the Members of the Iraqi military, it would be to express the ultimate futility of their continued resistance. The President has made clear, we come not as conquerors but as liberators.  War is a harsh, painful, brutal reality even when the goals are noble, even when the goals are security and freedom. As we have already seen, there is very little certainty in combat. In the fog of war, there are innumerable factors that might affect the course of battle. We often receive conflicting reports, confusing media accounts, and distorted descriptions of the battlefield. But one thing should never be in doubt, one thing is unmistakable: Our troops will prevail, and they will receive whatever support they need to bring this conflict to a successful end as rapidly as possible.  I express my gratitude to the families of the young men and women currently in harm's way who have been left behind. They truly carry a heavy burden, and they deserve the respect, the thanks, and the admiration of every American. As we have seen so painfully over the weekend, victory will not come without cost. While our military leaders will continue to do everything they can to minimize the danger that our troops will face, there is still much risk and much danger.  To the wives, the husbands, the parents, and the children of troops, thank you for your bravery, your strength, and your patriotism. Thank you for your love of country.  When I first came to the Senate over 6 years ago, I would not have imagined this moment. We lived in a different world then. But today, as our troops engage in battle, let us all show our unwavering support for our troops, thank them for their service, and express our heartfelt hope for their safe return.                          ____________________
