 President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2567       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Spokane Tribe of Indians of      the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable      Compensation Settlement Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) from 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the      Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its      tributaries to determine sites at which power could be      produced at low cost;       (2) the Corps of Engineers--       (A) identified a number of sites, including the site at      which the Grand Coulee Dam is located; and       (B) recommended that power development at those sites be      performed by local governmental authorities or private      utilities under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et      seq.);       (3) under section 10(e) of that Act (16 U.S.C. 803(e)), a      licensee is required to compensate an Indian tribe for the      use of land under the jurisdiction of the Indian tribe;       (4) in August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission, an      agency of the State of Washington, received a preliminary      permit from the Federal Power Commission for water power      development at the Grand Coulee site;       (5) in the mid-1930's, the Federal Government, which is not      subject to the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.)--       (A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project; and       (B) began construction of the Grand Coulee Dam;       (6) at the time at which the Grand Coulee Dam project was      federalized, the Federal Government recognized that the      Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville      Reservation had compensable interests in the Grand Coulee Dam      project, including compensation for--       (A) the development of hydropower;       (B) the extinguishment of a salmon fishery on which the      Spokane Tribe was almost completely financially dependent;      and       (C) the inundation of land with loss of potential power      sites previously identified by the Spokane Tribe;       (7) in the Act of June 29, 1940, Congress--       (A) in the first section (16 U.S.C. 835d) granted to the      United States--       (i) all rights of Indian tribes in land of the Spokane      Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations that were required for      the Grand Coulee Dam project; and       (ii) various rights-of-way over other land under the      jurisdiction of Indian tribes that were required in      connection with the project; and       (B) in section 2 (16 U.S.C. 835e) provided that      compensation for the land and rights-of-way was to be      determined by the Secretary of the Interior in such amounts      as the Secretary determined to be just and equitable;       (8) in furtherance of that Act, the Secretary of the      Interior paid--       (A) to the Spokane Tribe, $4,700; and       (B) to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation,      $63,000;       (9) in 1994, following 43 years of litigation before the      Indian Claims Commission, the United States Court of Federal      Claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the      Federal Circuit, Congress ratified an agreement between the      Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the      United States that provided for damages and annual payments      of $15,250,000 in perpetuity, adjusted annually, based on      revenues from the sale of electric power from the Grand      Coulee Dam project and transmission of that power by the      Bonneville Power Administration;       (10) in legal opinions issued by the Office of the      Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, a Task Force      Study conducted from 1976 to 1980 ordered by the Committee on      Appropriations of the Senate, and hearings before Congress at      the time at which the Confederated Tribes of the Colville      Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act (Public Law 103-     436; 108 Stat. 4577) was enacted, it has repeatedly been      recognized that--       (A) the Spokane Tribe suffered damages similar to those      suffered by, and had a case legally comparable to that of,      the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation; but       (B) the 5-year statute of limitations under the Act of      August 13, 1946 (25 U.S.C. 70 et seq.) precluded the Spokane      Tribe from bringing a civil action for damages under that      Act;       (11) the inability of the Spokane Tribe to bring a civil      action before the Indian Claims Commission can be attributed      to a combination of factors, including--       (A) the failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to carry      out its advisory responsibilities in accordance with that      Act; and       (B) an attempt by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to      impose improper requirements on claims attorneys retained by      Indian tribes, which caused delays in retention of counsel      and full investigation of the potential claims of the Spokane      Tribe;       (12) as a consequence of construction of the Grand Coulee      Dam project, the Spokane Tribe--       (A) has suffered the loss of--       (i) the salmon fishery on which the Spokane Tribe was      dependent;       (ii) identified hydropower sites that the Spokane Tribe      could have developed; and       (iii) hydropower revenues that the Spokane Tribe would have      received under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.)      had the project not been federalized; and       (B) continues to lose hydropower revenues that the Federal      Government recognized were owed to the Spokane Tribe at the      time at which the project was constructed; and       (13) more than 39 percent of the land owned by Indian      tribes or members of Indian tribes that was used for the      Grand Coulee Dam project was land of the Spokane Tribe.     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to provide fair and equitable      compensation to the Spokane Tribe, using the same      proportional basis as was used in providing compensation to      the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, for the      losses suffered as a result of the construction and operation      of the Grand Coulee Dam project.
