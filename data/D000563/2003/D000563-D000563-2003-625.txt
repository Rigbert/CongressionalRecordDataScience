President, I am pleased to join Senator Harkin today in introducing Kevin's Law, which is an essential piece of legislation that will clarify the U.S. Department of Agriculture's authority to enforce pathogen reduction standards in meat and poultry products.  Our country has been blessed with one of the safest and most abundant food supplies in the world. However, we can do better. While food may never be completely free of risk, we must strive to make our food as safe as possible. Foodborne illnesses and hazards are still a significant problem that cannot be passively dismissed.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate as many as 76 million people suffer from foodborne illnesses each year. Of those individuals, approximately 325,000 will be hospitalized and more than 5,000 will die. With emerging pathogens, broader distribution patterns, an increasing volume of food imports, and changing consumption patterns, this situation is not likely to improve without decisive action.  Foodborne illnesses can have devastating effects on certain populations in our society. Children are especially vulnerable. Because their immune systems are not fully developed, they are at greater risk for developing life-threatening or fatal complications associated with foodborne illnesses. Quite simply, a child's lower weight means that it takes a smaller quantity of pathogens to make a child sick than it would a healthy adult. The elderly and those with compromised immune systems are also at high risk for developing life-threatening conditions associated with foodborne illnesses.  A key tool for addressing foodborne illness in this country has been the USDA's pathogen reduction/hazard analysis and critical control point, PR/HACCP, regulations that were phased in beginning in January 1998. Under these regulations, USDA developed a scientific approach aimed at protecting consumers from foodborne pathogens. Instead of a system based on sight, smell, and touch, USDA moved to a system that would successfully detect harmful pathogens whether visible or not.  A major part of this system includes testing for harmful pathogens, such as salmonella. USDA uses the data from this testing to determine if meat and poultry plants are producing products that are safe to consume.  USDA's pathogen testing regulations have provided consumers with increased confidence in the safety of meat and poultry products. However, in December of 2001, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an earlier district court decision that removes the USDA's authority to enforce its pathogen standards for salmonella. The result of this court case is that USDA can no longer ensure that meat and poultry plants comply with pathogen standards. This creates a significant risk that meat and poultry products contaminated with common but potentially deadly pathogens will be sold to unsuspecting consumers.  The legislation we are introducing today will clarify USDA's authority to enforce strong safety standards for contamination in meat and poultry products. Specifically, this legislation will provide the Secretary of Agriculture with the clear authority to control for pathogens and enforce pathogen performance standards for meat and poultry products. Only with this authority will the Secretary of Agriculture be able to ensure the safety of the meat and poultry products sold in this country.  We must work together to ensure that USDA has the necessary authorityto enforce pathogen performance standards that will protect public health. Let's not turn our back on food safety and consumer protection at such a critical time for food safety and security. I encourage my colleagues to join this effort to protect our food supply and public health.                                 ______                                       By
