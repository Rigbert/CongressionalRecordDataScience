 President, the amendment we are about to vote on is very narrowly drafted to add one additional factor to those Federal agencies that have subjective standards they apply prior to allowing the shooting of a movie on Federal property.  The subject of the amendment is the making of movies on Federal property and with federal assistance. There are at least three federal entities--the Defense Department, NASA, and the Coast Guard--that currently have quite subjective standards which they apply to the movie industry when asked for permission to make a movie on Federal property or with their cooperation and assistance.  All this amendment does is add one more factor--one, wanton and gratuitous violence--to those standards. Bear in mind this amendment has no first amendment implications at all. Any movie company that wants to make a movie and do anything and say anything and depict anything they want to can continue to do that. They just won't do it on Federal property.  This is a mild amendment that sends a message to Hollywood.  I hope my colleagues will support it.
