 President, I rise today to offer bipartisan legislation to provide Medicare beneficiaries with the necessary tools and protections they need to choose the right health plan under the Medicare program for their individual health care needs. The bill I am introducing today, with my Democratic colleague, Senator Conrad, whom I have had the pleasure to work with on many issues, is entitled the Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997. I am also joined by my Republican colleagues, Senator D'Amato and Senator Helms, and my Democratic colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House by Representatives Coburn and Brown. Representative Coburn's bill currently has 91 cosponsors and has strong bipartisan support.  The bill I am sponsoring accomplishes a number of important objectives for Medicare beneficiaries and for the success of the Medicare program. We often talk about providing more choices of health plans for Medicare recipients, but we rarely discuss what they need to make the right choice. As Congress examines ways to encourage more options for Medicare beneficiaries through the growth of managed care, it is critical that there is a trusting relationship between Medicare enrollees and their health plans. Medicare is a Federal program. Therefore, it is our job to ensure that health plans participating in the Medicare program provide quality care to our Nation's elderly. Medicare recipients look to Congress to hold health plans accountable. The legislation I am introducing will encourage plans to compete based on the quality of care they provide and will give beneficiaries the necessary information they need make an informed choice.  The bill includes the following provisions: Provides beneficiaries with standardized consumer-friendly charts to compare health plans in their area (information such as disenrollment rates and appeals denied and reversed by plans are included in these charts); ensures that beneficiaries will receive fair treatment when health plans deny care by establishing a uniform and timely appeals process for managed care plans participating in Medicare; creates an atmosphere of trust between beneficiaries and their providers by prohibiting the use of gag clauses which restrict communications between providers and their patients; provides beneficiaries with the assurance that their health care providerwill refer to specialists, when medically necessary, by expanding Medicare's restriction on the use of financial incentives in managed care to include not just physicians but all providers; given patients, especially those individuals who require specialized care, the assurance they will be able to see a specialist, as medically necessary, when they are enrolled in a managed care plan; and offers beneficiaries more choices by guaranteeing they will have the option, at the time of enrollment, to select a plan with coverage for out-of-network services (point-of-service plans are the fastest growing health plans in the private sector).  Many of the provisions in this bill are supported by research conducted by the General Accounting Office [GAO] and the Institute of Medicine [IOM]. In the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, we recently held a hearing on the importance of detailed health plan information in holding health plans accountable and improving the quality of care delivered. We heard from large health care purchasers such as the California Public Employees Retirement System [CalPERS] and Xerox Corp. on ways Congress could improve the Medicare program by providing comparative, standardized, information on participating health plans. We heard from the GAO and the IOM about ways the Health Care Financing Administration could be more cost-efficient by requiring that health plans standardize their information. These witnesses highlighted the costliness of high disenrollment rates among health plans and how rates are significantly reduced when beneficiaries are given accurate and detailed comparative information on available health plans.  Most importantly, we heard from a recent Medicare beneficiary and a representative of a Medicare Insurance Counseling Assistance program on the lack of reliable, comparative information under the current Medicare program. The consistent theme from all these witnesses was the importance of trust between Medicare beneficiaries and their health plans. This trust in the program does not exist today, particularly in areas experiencing a rapid growth in managed care. However, by enacting the bill I am offering today which includes several incremental changes to the Medicare program, Congress can help to establish trust and rebuild confidence among our Nation's seniors in the Medicare program.  Many of the provisions in this bill are strengthening current law or providing beneficiaries protection in statute in addition to regulation. I believe it is the responsibility of Congress and administration to ensure that our Nation's elderly are getting quality, cost-effective care under the Medicare program. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and Senator Conrad in cosponsoring this very important bipartisan legislation.  Mr. President, I ask that a summary and full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 701       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Patient Choice and      Access Act of 1997''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) There should be no unreasonable barriers or impediments      to the ability of individuals enrolled in health care plans      to obtain appropriate specialized medical services.       (2) The patient's first point of contact in a health care      plan must be encouraged to make all appropriate medical      referrals and should not be constrained financially from      making such referrals.       (3) Some health care plans may impede timely access to      specialty care.       (4) Some contracts between health care plans and providers      may contain provisions which impede the provider in informing      the patient of the full range of treatment options.       (5) Patients cannot make appropriate health care decisions      without access to all relevant information relating to those      decisions.       (6) Restrictions on the ability of health care providers to      provide full disclosure of all relevant information to      patients making health care decisions violate the principles      of informed consent and the ethical standards of the health      care professions. Contractual clauses and other policies that      interfere with communications between health care providers      and patients can impact the quality of care received by those      patients.       (7) Patients should have the opportunity to access out-of-     network items, treatment, and services at an additional cost      to the patient which is not so prohibitive that they are      deterred from seeing the health care provider of their own      choice.       (8) Specialty care must be available for the full duration      of the patient's medical needs when medically necessary and      not limited by time or number of visits.       (9) Direct access to specialty care is essential for      patients in emergency and nonemergency situations and for      patients with chronic and temporary conditions.     SEC. 3. PROTECTION FOR MEDICARE HMO ENROLLEES.       (a) In General.--Section 1876 of the Social Security Act      (42 U.S.C. 1395mm) is amended--       (1) in subsection (c)(1), by striking ``subsection (e)''      and inserting ``subsections (e) and (k)''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(k) Beneficiary Protection.--       ``(1) Assuring adequate in-network access.--       ``(A) Timely access.--An eligible organization that      restricts the providers from whom benefits may be obtained      must guarantee to enrollees under this section timely access      to primary and specialty health care providers who are      appropriate for the enrollee's condition.       ``(B) Access to specialized care.--Enrollees must have      access to specialized treatment when medically necessary.      This access may be satisfied through contractual arrangements      with specialized health care providers outside of the      network.       ``(C) Continuity of care.--An eligible organization's use      of case management may not create an undue burden for      enrollees under this section. An eligible organization must      ensure direct access to specialists for ongoing care as so      determined by the case manager in consultation with the      specialty health care provider. This continuity of care may      be satisfied for enrollees with chronic conditions through      the use of a specialist serving as case manager.       ``(2) Out-of-network access.--If an eligible organization      offers to members enrolled under this section a plan which      provides for coverage of items and services covered under      parts A and B only if such items and services are furnished      through health care providers and other persons who are      members of a network of health care providers and other      persons who have entered into a contract with the      organization to provide such services, the contract with the      organization under this section shall provide that the      organization shall also offer to members enrolled under this      section (at the time of enrollment) a plan which provides for      coverage of such items and services which are not furnished      through health care providers and other persons who are      members of such a network.       ``(3) Grievance process.--       ``(A) In general.--An eligible organization must provide a      meaningful and expedited procedure, which includes notice and      hearing requirements, for resolving grievances between the      organization (including any entity or individual through      which the organization provides health care services) and      members enrolled with the organization under this section.

SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF PROTECTIONS TO MEDICARE SELECT                    POLICIES.       (a) In General.--Section 1882(t) of the Social Security Act      (42 U.S.C. 1395ss(t)) is amended--       (1) in paragraph (1)--       (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (E);       (B) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (F)      and inserting a semicolon; and       (C) by adding at the end the following:       ``(G) notwithstanding any other provision of this section      to the contrary, the issuer of the policy meets the      requirements of section 1876(k) (except for subparagraphs (C)      and (D) of paragraph (4) of that section) with respect to      individuals enrolled under the policy, in the same manner      such requirements apply with respect to an eligible      organization under such section with respect to individuals      enrolled with the organization under such section; and       ``(H) the issuer of the policy discloses to the Secretary,      as requested by the Secretary, the information necessary to      complete the report described in paragraph (4).''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(4) The Secretary shall develop an understandable      standardized comparative report on the policies offered by      entities pursuant to this subsection. Such report shall      contain information similar to the information contained in      the report developed by the Secretary pursuant to section      1876(k)(4)(C).''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a)      shall apply to policies issued or renewed on or after the      expiration of the 1-year period that begins on the date of      enactment of this Act.

(a) Study.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in      this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall conduct a      thorough study regarding the implementation of the amendments      made by sections 3 and 4 of this Act.       (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of      enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Secretary      shall submit a report to Congress that shall contain a      detailed statement of the findings and conclusions of the      Secretary regarding the study conducted pursuant to      subsection (a), together with the Secretary's recommendations      for such legislation and administrative actions as the      Secretary considers appropriate.       (c) Funding.--The Secretary shall carry out the provisions      of this section out of funds otherwise appropriated to the      Secretary.     SEC. 6. NATIONAL INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE.       Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of      this Act, the Secretary shall establish and operate, out of      funds otherwise appropriated to the Secretary, a      clearinghouse and (if the Secretary determines it to be      appropriate) a 24-hour toll-free telephone hotline, to      provide for the dissemination of the comparative reports      created pursuant to section 1876(k)(4)(C) of the Social      Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395mm(k)(4)(C)) (as added by section      3 of this Act) and section 1882(t)(4) of the Social Security      Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ss(t)(4)) (as added by section 4 of this      Act). In order to assist in the dissemination of the      comparative reports, the Secretary may also utilize medicare      offices open to the general public, the beneficiary      assistance program established under section 4359 of the      Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-     3), and the health insurance information counseling and      assistance grants under section 4359 of that Act (42 U.S.C.      1395b-4).                                                                    ____        Summary--Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997       The Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997      establishes certain standards and beneficiary protections for      Medicare recipients enrolled in Medicare managed care plans.      The legislation builds upon and strengthens existing law,      which already provides some protections to Medicare      beneficiaries. There is growing concern, however, that as      more and more beneficiaries (currently 4.9 million Medicare      beneficiaries with enrollment growth averaging 30% annually)      enroll in managed care greater protections must be in place      to ensure quality and access to care for seniors.       The bill would require the following:       Comparative Health Plan Information: Expands the consumer      information that health plans must provide to beneficiaries      under current law. Provides beneficiaries with standardized      consumer-friendly charts to compare health plans. Requires      the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to include      disenrollment data, which will contribute to greater      competition among health plans. HCFA currently collects this      data, but does not distribute it to beneficiaries.       Expedited Appeals Process: Provides an expedited appeals      procedure, consistent with new regulations, and a 30 day      resolution for grievances and appeals of health plan      enrollees. Preserves current law allowing beneficiaries to      appeal to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human      Services.       Prohibition of Gag Clauses: Prohibits gag rules, using the      managed care industry's definition of ``medical      communication.'' This is an expansion of HCFA's current      regulation banning the use of gag clauses regarding treatment      options.       Expansion of Restrictions on Financial Incentives: Expands      the current Federal law which places certain restrictions on      the use of financial incentives to manage care from applying      to physicians only to covering all providers.       Point-of-Service Option: Expands choice of health plans by      guaranteeing enrollees the option of choosing a point-of-     service plan at the time they enroll in a Medicare managed      care plan.       Timely and Appropriate Access to Specialists: Gives      enrollees the assurance they will be able to see a specialist      in-network, as medically necessary. Current law requires that      managed care health plans provide access to the full range of      Medicare health care services. The bill expands and      strengthens this provision.
