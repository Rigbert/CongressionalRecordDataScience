Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the gentleman from Kentucky. He has discussed this matter with me. I understand his view. And while he and I disagree on this issue, I certainly respect his right and his appropriate action in bringing this matter to the attention of the House.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule, strong support of the previous question, and thank the gentleman for Texas for yielding me this time.
