President, sadly, I rise today to talk about the recent crash of a National Guard aircraft in flying over Georgia. Last Friday, 21 members of the National Guard lost their lives in a horrible plane crash. How does one understand the death of 21 soldiers and airmen who dedicated their time and energy to contribute to our nation's defense?  While there perhaps is no easy answer to this question, the patriotism and dedication of these men is without doubt. Nineteen served with the Virginia Air National Guard in the 203d Red Horse Unit. Three were of the 171st Aviation Battalion of the Florida Army National Guard. All come from a proud citizen-soldier tradition that dates back to the War of Independence.  This was a routine mission for the fated C-23 Sherpa. With the Florida Guardsmen at the controls, the plane took off on Friday morning, headed for Virginia. Its passengers had just completed their two-weeks of annual training in Georgia, where they had honed their already refined construction abilities. They were heading back to their families and the civilian jobs. Alas, those reunions were never to occur.  It is a great loss whenever a member of the armed services gives his or her life in the lien of duty. But perhaps because these men came straight out of local communities, because they were juggling the demands of work and family along with their national service, we feel the losses like these especially deeply. Their departure reminds us that our friends, colleagues, and neighbors in the National Guard make sacrifices every time they report for duty. They leave the comfort of their homes for the rigors of service. It is a sacrifice that is worthy of honor and recognition, but often goes unnoticed until they make the ultimate sacrifice.  With that in mind, I join with my colleague Senator Kit Bond in introducing a resolution that honors their service and expresses our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims.                          ____________________
