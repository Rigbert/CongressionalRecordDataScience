FEC. In this sweeping decision that ignored decades of precedent, the Supreme Court held that corporations and unions could spend as much money as they want to influence congressional elections.  At the time the Court issued this decision, I and others warned that Citizen United would have a negative impact on our democracy and open the floodgates to undisclosed private money in Federal elections.  The results of the first congressional elections after Citizens United have been analyzed. Those of us who sounded the alarm about this unfortunate decision were right.  In 2010, for the first time ever, spending on House and Senate races exceeded $1.6 billion.  Outside groups, now freed from spending limits by Citizens United, spent 335 percent more on congressional campaigns than they did just 4 years earlier.  The amount of money that big corporations and special interest lobbyists are willing to spend to shape policy is expected to increase even more in 2012.  This dramatic increase in spending tells us that big business is not going to be shy about using its new power to say to Members of Congress: ``If you vote against our business interests, we'll spend millions to make sure you never get the chance to vote against us again.''  That is a terrible reality for Members of Congress evaluating policy options and it is an even worse statement about our democracy.  As bad as Citizens United was, the Supreme Court may very well be at it again. Last week, the Court heard oral arguments in the McComish v. Bennett case.  An adverse decision in the McComish case would hamstring jurisdictions that have implemented campaign finance measures in response to corruption and scandal.  Citizens United and its corrosive impact remind us of the urgent need to fundamentally reform the way we finance congressional elections.  It is time we had a system that allows candidates to focus on constituents instead of fundraising.  That is why I introduced the Fair Elections Now Act. The Fair Elections Now Act will dramatically change the way campaigns are funded.  This bill lets candidates focus on the people they represent, regardless of whether those people have the wealth to attend a big money fundraiser or donate thousands of dollars.  Fair Elections candidates would be in the policy business, regardless of what policies are preferred by big business and wealthy special interests.  The Fair Elections Now Act will help restore public confidence in the congressional election process by providing qualified candidates for Congress with grants, matching funds, and vouchers from the Fair Elections Fund to replace campaign fundraising that largely relies on lobbyists and other special interests.  In return, participating candidates would agree to limit their campaign spending to amounts raised from small-dollar donors plus the amounts provided from the Fair Elections Fund.  Fair Elections would have three stages for Senate candidates.  To participate, candidates would first need to prove their viability by raising a minimum number and amount of small-dollar qualifying contributions from in-state donors. Once a candidate qualifies, that candidate must limitthe amount raised from each donor to $100 per election.  For the primary, participants would receive a base grant that would vary in amount based on the population of the state that the candidate seeks to represent. Participants would also receive a 5-to-1 match for small-dollar donations up to a defined matching cap. The candidate could raise an unlimited amount of $100 contributions if needed to compete against high-spending opponents.  For the general election, qualified candidates would receive an additional grant, further small-dollar matching, and vouchers for purchasing television advertising. The candidate could continue to raise an unlimited amount of $100 contributions if needed.  The Fair Elections approach frees candidates to spend more time with constituents and in policy debates and less time with wealthy donors and special interest lobbyists.  Our country faces major challenges.  Everyone knows that we need to reduce the deficit, modernize our energy policy, and reform the Tax Code--among other things.  What many people may not know is that, at every turn, there are high-powered, special interest lobbyists ready to fight every proposal.  It is mighty hard for Members of Congress not to pay attention to the concerns of big money lobbyists and donors when Members of Congress may need to raise money from these same people during their next campaign.  This bill would dramatically reduce the influence of these lobbyists and corporations, because Fair Elections candidates would not need their money to run campaigns.  Let me be clear: I honestly believe that the overwhelming majority of the people serving in American politics are good, honest people, and I believe that Senators and Congressmen are guided by the best of intentions.  But we are nonetheless stuck in a terrible, corrupting system.  The perception is that politicians are corrupted by the big money interests . . . and whether that is true or not, that perception and the loss of trust that goes with it makes it incredibly difficult for the Senate to take on tough challenges and have the American public believe that what we are doing is right.  This problem--the perception of pervasive corruption--is fundamental to our democracy, and we must address it.  Fair Elections is not some farfetched idea.  Fair Election systems are already at work in cities and states around the country.  Similar programs exist and are working well in more than 12 jurisdictions, including Maine, Arizona, North Carolina, and Vermont.  These programs are bringing new faces and new ideas into politics, making more races more competitive, and dramatically reducing the influence of special interests.  The vast majority of Americans agree that it is time to fundamentally change our system of financing campaigns.  Recent polling shows that 75 percent of Democrats, 66 percent of independents, and 55 percent of Republicans support Fair Elections-style reform.  The Fair Elections Now Act is supported by several good government groups, former Members of Congress from both parties, prominent business leaders, and even . . . lobbyists.  Special interests lobbyists and big corporations are entitled to a seat at the table, but they shouldn't be able to buy every seat.  The Fair Elections Now Act will reform our campaign finance system so that Members of Congress can focus on implementing policies that benefit the people that sent them to Washington.                          ____________________
