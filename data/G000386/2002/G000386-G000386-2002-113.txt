 President, today I am introducing legislation to address a problem in the way the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, determines a veteran's eligibility category for health care, which results in an unfair misclassification of many veterans who are farmers. Veterans who do not have a service-connected disability but who are unable to defray the cost of necessary health care are placed in priority group 5 and are able to receive health care services from the VA at no cost to the veteran. In order to determine whether a veteran falls below the means test threshold and is thus eligible to enroll in priority group 5, the VA looks at the net worth of a veteran's estate, including any real property owned by the veteran or the veteran's spouse. When you add in the value of farm land, the net worth of many farmer-veterans can appear high on paper even though they may in fact have little or no income.  The current means test threshold for net worth is set at $80,000. Given the current average value of farm land in Iowa of $1,857, a farm in Iowa worth $80,000 would average a barely viable 44 acres. A more viable 80 acre farm would be worth $148,560 on average. In other words, almost any Iowa farm large enough to be viable would exceed the current means test threshold.  Under the current law, when the value of a veteran's estate exceeds the means test threshold, the veteran becomes ineligible to enroll in priority group 5 if the VA determines that ``it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of such estates be consumed for the veteran's maintenance.'' I don't think it is ever ``reasonable'' that a veteran, who has little or no income or other assets, be asked to sell a portion of his family farm in order to pay his medical bills. Nevertheless, because of the way the law currently reads, these land-rich but cash-poor veterans are often placed in priority group 7, meaning they may only enroll in VA health care if they agree to pay co-payments to the VA and then only on a space-available and funds-available basis.  This problem was first brought to my attention by one of my constituents, Larry Sundall, who is a county veterans service officer in Emmet County, IA. In response, I convened a meeting in Des Moines in April of 2000, which was attended by county veterans service officers and State veterans affairs officers from Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota as well as VA staff. I heard many similar stories about low-income veterans who were in the same boat. In September of that year, I introduced legislation to fix this problem by excluding the value of real property from the calculation ofthe net worth of a veteran's estate in determining a veteran's eligibility category for health care.  Unfortunately, my bill was not acted on before the end of the 106th Congress. In the first session of the 107th Congress, an unsuccessful attempt was made to address this issue in the context of legislation to make improvements to various veterans' programs. I am now reintroducing my legislation in hopes of fixing this problem once and for all.  In addition, my bill makes some adjustments to the way the VA determines the attributable income of a veteran that will make the process easier for both the VA and the veteran. The VA currently has the authority to verify a veteran's income using a quick and efficient computer process that matches VA records with data from the IRS and other Federal agencies. However, the data for the prior year is often unavailable making it impossible for the VA to perform this income verification for the majority of veterans at the time when the data is needed. My bill would allow the VA to use the data available for the year preceding the previous year to determine the attributable income of a veteran. This would not only help the VA to more easily and more accurately determine a veteran's income, it would also allow a veteran to check a box to let the VA use this procedure to gather the veteran's income data without the veteran having to dig through his financial records and fill out the information on a form. It can be frustrating for a veteran to have to fill out the paperwork necessary to apply for benefits and this change would make the application process easier for both the veteran and the VA.  My bill would correct a fundamental unfairness that adversely affects veterans who are farmers while making the application process for health benefits simpler for veterans and more efficient for the VA. In fact, taken together, these important reforms would actually save taxpayer dollars. According to data provided to me by the VA, over $8.7 million would be saved in fiscal year 2003 alone. This legislation is a win-win proposition and I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the swift passage of this measure.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2741       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. IMPROVEMENT OF PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINATION OF                    INABILITY TO DEFRAY EXPENSES OF NECESSARY                    MEDICAL CARE.       (a) Exclusion of Certain Assets From Attributable Income      and Corpus of Estates.--Subsection (f) of section 1722 of      title 38, United States Code, is amended--       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting before the period at the      end the following: ``, except that such income shall not      include the value of any real property of the veteran or the      veteran's spouse or dependent children, if any, or any income      of the veteran's dependent children, if any''; and       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``the estates'' and all      that follows and inserting ``the estate of the veteran's      spouse, if any, but does not include any real property of the      veteran, the veteran's spouse, or any dependent children of      the veteran, nor any income of dependent children of the      veteran.''.       (b) Alternative Year for Determination of Attributable      Income.--That section is further amended by adding at the end      the following new subsection:       ``(h) For purposes of determining the attributable income      of a veteran under this section, the Secretary may determine      the attributable income of the veteran for the year preceding      the previous year, rather than for the previous year, if the      Secretary finds that available data do not permit a timely      determination of the attributable income of the veteran for      the previous year for such purposes.''.       (c) Use of Income Information From Certain Other Federal      Agencies.--Section 5317 of that title is amended--       (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections      (g) and (h), respectively; and       (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new      subsection (f):       ``(f) In addition to any other activities under this      section, the Secretary may utilize income information      obtained under this section from the Secretary of Health and      Human Services or the Secretary of the Treasury for the      purpose of determining the attributable income of a veteran      under section 1722 of this title, in lieu of obtaining income      information directly from the veteran for that purpose.''.
