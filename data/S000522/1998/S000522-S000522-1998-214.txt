Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I urge every member of this body to support House Resolution 364. This strongly bipartisan resolution urges the introduction and passage of a resolution on human rights in the People's Republic of China at the 54th session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission which began yesterday and runs to the 24th of next month.  If any government deserves to be the subject of a U.N. Human Rights Commission resolution, the Beijing regime does. In its testimony before my subcommittee last month, Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck made it very clear that ``. . .the government of China continues to commit widespread and well-documented abuses in all areas of human rights.'' He also testified that there have not been any major improvements in that situation during the last year.  As detailed in the State Department's country reports on human rights practices in China, those abuses included extrajudicial killings, the use of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and forced sterilization, the sale of organs from executed prisoners, and tight controls over religion, speech, and press. Persecution in some areas, such as the captive nations of Tibet and East Turkistan, even intensified during the past year.  House Resolution 364 merely urges the administration to reconsider and to do what it promised to do when it delinked MFN for China from human rights considerations in 1994: ``. . . to insist that the U.N. Human Rights Commission pass a resolution dealing with the serious human rights abuses in China.''  However, this past weekend, the administration signaled that it is backing away from that promise, just as it backed away from its previous promise to link China's MFN status to respect for human rights. In both cases, the retreat has not been justified by any improvement in the Chinese government's human rights record. As a matter of fact, it has gone backwards.  In explaining its decision not to seek a China resolution in Geneva, the administration has highlighted the PRC's recent announcement that it intended to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. However, that rationale does not justify the President's latest deference to the Beijing dictatorship for three basic reasons.  First, the Beijing regime regularly ignores its legal promises, especially where human rights are concerned. The Constitution of the PRC already guarantees freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of demonstration, as well as the freedom of religious belief and the freedom of ethnic minorities such as the Tibetans and Uyghurs from discrimination and oppression.  According to the administration's own reporting, the Beijing regime routinely and systematically violates those freedoms.  In a further example, China signed the U.N. Convention Against Torture over a decade ago; but according to the State Department, and other sources in human rights organizations, the Chinese government continues to use torture against prisoners each and every day. Thus, in return for its silence, the United States must demand real improvements, not paper promises.  Second, experience demonstrates that ratification of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights does not guarantee genuine respect for human rights. Many of the most abusive countries on the planet, including Iraq, North Korea, Nigeria, to name a few, are parties to that convention.  Third and most important, by using convention ratification as an excuse for the United States' inaction in Geneva, the administration has set up anexplicit double standard benefitting the Beijing regime.  Yet, last year alone, the administration supported seven U.N. Human Rights Commission resolutions concerning other countries that have signed the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights: Nigeria, Iran, Sudan, Iraq, Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Yugoslavia, and Equatorial Guinea.  The unprecedented favors shown to the Beijing dictatorship suggest that, in reality, the President's latest decision has little to do with the convention and everything to do with dollars and cents.  Wei Jingsheng, Mr. Speaker, the great Chinese democracy advocate and former prisoner of conscience, testified before my subcommittee just a few weeks ago. He said that a U.N. Human Rights Commission resolution at this time is a ``matter of life or death'' for the democratic reform in China.  Last week, in an open letter urging the U.S. to support a China resolution in Geneva, he explained that ``the success of the Chinese government to silence the world community has serious consequences. It is a massive blow to the Chinese people's determination to struggle for human rights and democracy. They are left with the feeling that they are being betrayed.''  Mr. Speaker, the President's decision this past weekend was, indeed, a betrayal, a betrayal of the countless Chinese, Tibetans, and others who suffer under the current regime, and a betrayal of our own democratic and humanitarian ideals.  The United States' support for a U.N. human rights resolution is the very least that we can do for the Chinese and the Tibetan peoples. If the U.S. will not raise human rights violations in a forum dedicated exclusively to human rights concerns, then where will we raise those issues and how can we expect tyrants to heed our admonitions in private when they know we will lack the will to speak about them in public?                              {time}  1515  Notwithstanding his announcement this weekend, Mr. Speaker, I urge the President, we urge collectively the President to honor his previous pledge to support a China resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to support passage of the resolution.                               I. Summary       China appears to be on the verge of ensuring that no      attempt is made ever again to censure its human rights      practices at the United Nations. It is an extraordinary feat      of diplomacy and an equally extraordinary capitulation on the      part of governments, particularly the United States and the      countries of the European Union, that claim to favor      multilateral initiatives as a way of exerting human rights      pressure. One of the few remaining international fora to      exert such pressure is the annual meeting of the U.N.      Commission on Human Rights in Geneva--in session this year      from March 10 to April 18--where countries with particularly      egregious human rights records can become the subject of      resolutions. Every year save one since 1990, the U.S. and the      E.U. have taken the lead, with support from Japan and other      governments, in sponsoring a resolution on China, and every      year save one, China has successfully blocked even debate on      the subject. The threat of a resolution, however, has itself      been an effective form of pressure, as illustrated by the      time and resources China has spent in trying to counter it.       This report is an analysis of China's diplomatic efforts      with respect to key members of the commission over the last      three years. It describes a pattern of aggressive lobbying by      Chinese officials, using economic and political      blandishments, that has worked to undermine the political      will in both developed and developing countries to hold      Beijing accountable in Geneva, coupled with procrastination      and passivity on the part of China's critics, the same      governments that have been such vocal proponents of      multilateralism.       The report suggests that countries concerned about human      rights in China should put more, not less effort into a      carefully constructed resolution at the U.N. Human Rights      Commission; that the process of fashioning a resolution and      lobbying for its passage is important, whether it ultimately      reaches the floor of the commission for debate or not; and      that ending all efforts on China at the U.N. Human Rights      Commission, as the U.S. and Europe seem to be considering,      will be seen in China as a triumph over the West's dominance      of international institutions and one that it may want to      follow up in fields other than human rights.       As this report went to press, the U.S. and the E.U. were      involved in diplomatic negotiations with China on a possible      package of limited steps or promises in exchange for dropping      a resolution this year and in subsequent years. The U.S. in      particular, seemed poised to accept any last-minute gestures      that China might make during Vice President Albert Gore's      trip to China in late March, midway through the commission's      deliberations. But the prospect of obtaining truly meaningful      improvements from Beijing on human rights would have been far      higher had there been a real threat of a coordinated, high-     level lobbying effort behind a resolution in Geneva, the work      on which would have had to have begun in September or October      1996. For the U.S. and E.U. to suggest at this late date that      a resolution cannot pass is a prophecy they have done their      utmost to make self-fulfilling.                               background       A resolution on China at the commission is a curiously      potent tool for raising human rights issues, given that it is      an unenforceable statement that carries no penalties or      obligations. But as the product of the U.N., it has major      implications for a country's international image, and even to      table a resolution for discussion is considered by many      countries, China among them, as a major loss of face. But      China considers the U.N. Human Rights Commission an important      forum for other reasons as well, including as a vehicle for      countering Western ``hegemonism,'' particularly through      alliances with governments in Asia, Africa and Latin America.      During the 1996 session of the commission, Chinese diplomats      made clear that they saw an attempt to seek a resolution on      China as an example of this hegemonism, arguing that the      North used the commission as a one-way forum through which to      confront, judge, and interfere in the internal affairs of      developing countries while ignoring abuses in the U.S. and      Europe, and that the commission paid too much attention to      political and civil rights while neglecting economic, social,      and cultural rights and the right to development.\1\ In      addition to its value to China as a forum to challenge the      West, the commission has also become a useful vehicle to      play the U.S. off against its erstwhile European allies.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Footnotes appear at end of report.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Interest in using the U.N. Human Rights Commission as a      forum for criticizing China only emerged after the crackdown      in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Beginning in 1990, the annual      Geneva meetings were marked by efforts to table mildly worded      resolutions urging China to improve its human rights      practices and criticizing ongoing violations of international      standards. These efforts were defeated before the resolutions      could come up for debate by ``no-action'' motions brought by      one of China's friends on the commission--Pakistan could be      counted on in this regard. A ``no-action'' motion, if passed,      meant that the resolution died a quick death before ever      coming to debate and vote.       In March 1995, however, the ``no-action'' motion failed for      the first time. China's human rights record was debated, and      a resolution sponsored by the U.S. and the European Union      lost by only one vote when Russia unexpectedly cast its vote      in opposition. It was the closest China had ever come to      defeat. In April 1996, by contrast, China again successfully      blocked a resolution through the ``no-action'' procedure, by      a vote of twenty-seven to twenty with six abstentions. In the      year that elapsed between the two meetings, China's human      rights record had worsened, but its lobbying had improved and      the political will of its critics had weakened.       Visits between China and commission members between April      1996 and March 1997 resulted in more aid packages, new and      expanded trade contracts including foreign investment and      joint ventures, and promises of improved bilateral      cooperation on projects ranging from agriculture to nuclear      technology. While it is impossible to definitively document      the direct relationship between each visit or aid package and      the votes of individual commission members, an overall      pattern emerged that may help to explain China's success at      muzzling the commission. Clearly, in many countries, much      more was at stake than a Geneva vote, as Beijing sought to      boost its long-term political and economic relationships and      to weaken Taiwan's ties with some capitals. But a major      objective during this period was also to defeat the annual      Geneva effort.       In 1995 and in 1996, the importance of the outcome in      Geneva was clearly reflected in official statements. At the      conclusion of the 1995 voting, a foreign ministry spokesman      speaking on state radio ``expressed its [the Chinese      government's] admiration and gratitude to those countries      that supported China,'' and China's ambassador to the U.N. in      Geneva said the resolution was ``entirely a product of      political confrontation practiced by the West with ulterior      motives.'' \2\ After the 1996 vote, an article by the      official Chinese news agency Xinhau, entitled ``Failure of      Human Rights Resolution Hailed,'' gloated that the commission      ``has again shot down a draft resolution against China,      marking another failure by the West to use human rights to      interfere in China's internal affairs. . . .'' \3\       From China's perspective, there were two relatively      balanced voting blocs on the commission, and a number of      crucial swing votes.\4\ One bloc consisted of Asian and      African states. The second was composed of western Europe and      North and Central America. The swing votes were to be found     among some of the new democracies of central Europe, the      former Soviet republics, large Latin American countries and a      handful of African and Asian nations. China courted them all      and pursued its efforts to divide Europe and the United      States.              II. The European Union and the United States       In 1995, the year the resolution lost by one vote, the U.S.      and E.U., which together with Japan were the resolution's co-     sponsors, began efforts to get other countries on board as      early as December 1994, when then U.S. National Security      Adviser Anthony Lake went to Zimbabwe, Gabon and Ethiopia.      The Geneva resolution was one of the issues on his agenda.      Geraldine Ferraro, then head of the U.S. delegation to the      commission, made calls to Latin American capitals.       After that close call, Chinese diplomats and government      officials seemed to intensify their efforts to underscore      that good economic relations with the world's largest country      would be fostered by decreasing pressure on human rights.      Overt Chinese pressure, of course, was not always needed:      European leaders were well aware that the competitive edge      with the Americans could be widened if human rights criticism      was left to the latter, especially when the U.S. was already      preoccupied with a struggle with China over intellectual      property rights and the annual debate over Most Favored      Nation status.       The first attempts to derail a resolution on China at the      1996 U.N. Human Rights Commission session took place in      Bangkok on March 1 and 2, 1996 when Chinese Premier Li Peng      met with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President      Jacques Chirac at the E.U.-Asia summit. With a US$2.1 billion      Airbus contract hanging in the balance and a visit to France      by Li Peng set for April, France took the lead in trying to      work out a deal whereby in exchange for a few concessions      from China, the E.U. and the U.S. would agree to drop the      resolution. The nature of the proposed concessions was never      made public but was rumored to include an agreement by China      to sign and ratify the two major international human rights      treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political      Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and      Cultural Rights: the release of some political prisoners; and      an invitation to U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose      Ayala Lasso, to visit China. Ratification without      reservations would indeed have been a useful step, but when      pressed to give a timetable for ratification, Beijing      reportedly backed off, and the deal fell through. Italy--then      in the presidency of the E.U.--was said to be leaning to the      French deal, as was Germany, which with bilateral trade of      $18 billion, was China's largest trading partner in Europe      and one of Europe's top investors in China. The Europeans did      not come on board until ten days after the commission session      opened, and then only reluctantly.       The resolution was doomed by a failure of will on the      American side as well. The United States was no more eager      than its European counterparts to earn China's opprobrium by      sponsoring a resolution, and, according to one source, a      deliberate decision was made within the Clinton      administration sometime in December 1995 to give the      resolution less attention that the year before, with the      result that lobbying was late, desultory and ultimately      unsuccessful.       Despite appeals on human rights in China and Tibet signed      by over 200 French legislators and scattered protests, Li      Peng's visit to Paris from April 9-13, just before the      commission vote, was hailed by Beijing as marking a      ``watershed'' in its ties with France. Li Peng took the      opportunity to finalize the Airbus sale in what appeared to      be a deliberate slight to the U.S. government and the      American company Boeing, hitherto the largest supplier of      aircraft to China. In one reporter's words. China preferred      to deal with countries that ``don't lecture China about human      rights, don't threaten sanctions for the piracy of music,      videos and software and don't send their warships patrolling      the Taiwan Straits.'' \5\       Li Peng's trip to Europe was followed in July 1996 by a      six-nation swing by President Jiang Zemin through Europe and      Asia, aimed at closing business deals and enhancing Jiang      Zemin's international standing. An important side-effect, if      not a deliberate objective of these visits, was to erode the      willingness of some European countries to confront Beijing in      Geneva. The trip came on the heels of a Chinese threat to      impose economic sanctions on Germany in retaliation for a      conference on Tibet. The conference was sponsored by the      Friedrich Naumann Foundation, closely linked to      Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's Free Democratic Party, and      was to be held in Germany in June in cooperation with the      Dalai Lama's government-in-exile. The row started over the      German government' proposal to provide a subsidy for the      conference. Under pressure, government funding was      withdrawn, but the conference went ahead with the support      of German politicians from all parties. The Chinese      government then forced the closure of the foundation's      Beijing office. In retaliation, German politicians      introduced a motion in the Bundestag criticizing China's      human rights record. China then withdrew an invitation to      German Foreign Minister Kinkel to visit Beijing.       When Beijing further warned that German business interests      in China could suffer, Bonn quickly scrambled to restore good      relations. In September the invitation was renewed, and      Kinkel went the following month. He did raise the cases of      political prisoners Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng, but the real      story was that commercial relations with Germany were back on      track, for in November in Beijing, President Jiang and German      President Roman Herzog signed four agreements on financial      and technological cooperation. The last quarter of 1996 saw      multimillion dollar deals signed between China and Germany      companies, including a joint venture by Mercedes Benz in      Jiangsu province to produce buses; a joint venture by Kogel      Trailer to produce specialized auto vehicles; a joint venture      by Bayer AC and Shanghai Coating Company to produce iron      oxide pigments; and a US$6 billion investment in a      petrochemical plant by German chemical company BASF.       China also wooed other European countries. In June, Chen      Jinhua, head of China's State Planning Commission, visited      Italy. In Milan, he held meeting with leading Italian      financial and business interests, discussing how China's      ninth five-year plan would lead to the continued open up of      the economy to the outside world. Stressing the growth of      bilateral trade, which stood at a record US$ 5.18 billion in      1995, he noted China's potential as a huge market with      possibilities for increased Sino-Italian cooperation. In      September, Li Peng went to the Hague, just as the Netherlands      was poised to take over leadership of the E.U.; in October      Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini led a group of Italian      businessmen to Beijing on a ``good will'' visit; and in      November, Li Peng was back in Europe on a visit to Rome,      where he and his Italian counterpart pledged to encourage      Sino-Italian economic and trade ties.       Britian also worked to bolster its trade with China. When      Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang met with Minister of      Foreign Trade and Economic Development Wu Yi in Beijing in      September 1996, they agreed to set up working groups in the      chemical industry, aeronautics, and energy. In October, Li      Lanqing, a vice-premier and vice-chair of the State Council      (the equivalent of China's cabinet), traveled to London to      meet with Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, and in      November, the two countries signed a Memorandum of      Understanding on forming a Sino-U.K. Aerospace Equipment      Working Group to promote commercial and technical cooperation      in civil aviation.                           III. Latin America       Latin America was clearly a priority region for China if it      was to defeat a resolution at the 1996 commission session.      Next to Europe and North America, it was most likely to vote      against China. In some cases, this was due to history of      susceptibility to U.S. influence, in others to a democratic      transition from an abusive authoritarian past that made the      new democracies important allies in efforts to censure grave      abuses wherever they occurred. Many Latin American countries,      including Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Argentina, Peru and      Venezuela, also had serious strains in their bilateral      relations with China because of textile and garment      ``dumping'' by the latter. Of all the countries in the      region, only Cuba and Peru consistently voted with China in      1995 and 1996, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela abstained in      both years.       Top Chinese government and Party officials increased the      exchange of visits with Latin America leaders after the near      success of the 1995 resolution. In October 1995, Premier Li      Peng went to Mexico and Peru, signing trade and cooperation      agreements with both governments. Peru had abstained from all      China votes at the commission until 1995 when it voted in      favor of the no-action motion. As if to reinforce the      relationship, Luo Gan, secretary-general of the State      Council, went to Peru in March 1996 with the commission      already in session and pledged US$350,000 in aid and a loan       of US$70 million to be used toward China-Peru trade. The      sums were small, but the symbolism of South-South aid was      important. Peru again voted with China at the commission      in 1996. That August, the speaker of the Peruvian      parliament, visiting Beijing, said pointedly in the      context of a discussion on human rights that his country      did not interfere with China's internal affairs. High-     level exchanges also took place in 1995 with Brazil,      Chile, and Cuba.\6\       In June 1996, following the April vote in the Human Rights      Commission, Wu Yi went on a month-long tour of seven Latin      American countries, Argentina, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay      and Chile, all but Peru to be members of the commission for      the coming year. In November 1996, Li Peng went back to Latin      America, visiting two members of the commission whose voting      records had been inconsistent, Brazil and Chile. Brazil was      key. Until 1996, it had abstained on all votes on China, in      April 1996, it voted against China's efforts to stop action      on a resolution. Li Peng's delegation specifically raised the      issue during the visit expressing unhappiness with the      Brazilian vote, and officials at the Brazilian Ministry of      Foreign Relations reportedly discussed the possibility of      abstaining on a no-action motion in 1997. The Chinese      premier's visit produced agreement on a consulate in Hong      Kong after July 1, 1997, on peaceful use of space technology      and on sustainable development initiatives. Trade issues were      also on the agenda.       Chile had voted with China in 1992, then abstained on all      votes until 1996 when it joined Brazil to vote against      China's efforts     to stop debate. During his November visit, Li Peng announced      tariff reductions of more than 10 percent on Chilean      agricultural goods and signed agreements on scientific and      technological cooperation in agricultural and aerospace. As      with Peru, the substance of the agreements between Chile and      China was less important than the political symbolism of Li      Peng's visit, and as with Brazil, the Geneva vote was almost      certainly on the agenda.       The presidents of Ecuador and Mexico and the foreign      minister of Uruguay all visited Beijing between May and      December 1996.\7\ Closer ties between China and Latin      America, as indicated by high-level exchanges, underscored      the fact that sponsors of a resolution critical of China      could not take the votes of Latin American members of the      commission for granted. They would have to undertake some      sustained lobbying, and apparently they did not.                               IV. Africa       If the U.S. and Europe and other sponsors of a resolution      were serious about a multilateral initiative to exert      pressure on China, it was essential that they bring some      African members of the commission on board. Admittedly, it      would not have been an easy task, given Chinese diplomatic      initiatives and interests in the region, but save for some      modest measures in 1994 like U.S. National Security Adviser      Anthony Lake's discussions (see above), the sponsors put      little energy into finding support from African governments.       China, on the other hand, was energetic. Since the end of      the Cold War, it has seen African countries as critically      important allies, particularly in the United Nations, in the      struggle against American ``hegemonism.''\8\ With its      history of colonialism and the fact that for the North, it      had become the ``forgotten continent,'' Africa has been      viewed as a desirable partner in China's efforts to      ``bypass'' the United States.\9\ In addition, China had a      strong interest in stepping up its diplomacy in the region      to counter Taiwan's aggressive campaign to expand ties      with some African states.       China embarked on a concerted diplomatic campaign in Africa      in mid-1995. Although the main objective may have been to      blunt Taiwan's influence, it may not be coincidental that the      campaign began after China lost a no-action motion and nearly      lost the resolution in Geneva in March 1995, or that the      countries singled out in this campaign were also for the most      part members of the commission.       In October-November 1995, well before the 1996 session of      the commission convened, Li Lanqing traveled to six central      and western African countries: Mali, Guinea, Senegal, Gabon,      Cameroon and Cote d'Ivoire. Of these, all but Senegal were      members of the commission. In November, Quao Shi, a leading      member of the Central Committee and chairman of Standing      Committee of China's National people's Congress (China's      parliament), went to Egypt, another key member of the      commission. All the countries included in these two visits      voted with China in the April 1996 ``no-action'' motion.       By contrast, from September 1995 to March 1996 there were      few high-level exchanges between the U.S. and African members      of the commission, and when they took place, China was not on      the agenda. Angolan president Dos Santos made a state visit      to Washington, D.C. on December 8, 1995, for example, but      amid the many issues on the U.S.-Angolan agenda, support for      a critical position in the U.N. toward China's human rights      practices was reportedly not one Madeleine Albright, then      U.S. ambassador to the U.N. visited Angola in January 1996,      but apparently made no effort to press for Angola's support      at the Human Rights Commission. Angola ranks fourth among      China's African trading partners and has consistently voted      with China at the Human Rights Commission. If the U.S. was      serious about generating international pressure on China      through the U.N., its officials would have seen the visits by      its officials as an opportunity to put multilateralism into      practice and raise the issue of a resolution in Geneva.       Ethiopia, a key member of the commission, exchanged visits      with European and American officials, with development      assistance and security the main issues at stake. German      President Herzog visited Ethiopia in January 1996, during      which he signed an aid agreement for the purchase and      transport of fertilizers, and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi      spent two days in Paris, meeting with the French prime      minister and with President Chirac. In neither case was there      any indication that the China vote was on the agenda, and a      source close to the U.S. delegation to Geneva told Human      Rights Watch that no attempt was made to lobby Ethiopia for      its vote.       China appeared to have stepped up its efforts to ensure a      similar victory in the 1997 session. Following the end of the      1996 commission meeting in April, all fifteen African members      of the commission sent or received high-ranking visitors from      China. In May 1996, according to Chinese reports, President      Jiang himself ``crossed a thousand mountains and rivers to      enhance friendship, deepen unity, and learn from the African      people.'' visiting a total of six countries as he covered the      continent ``from North to South, from east to West.'' Of the      six countries, four, Ethiopia, Egypt, Mali an Zimbabwe, were      members or about to become members of the commission. At a      meeting of the Organization of African States, Jiang stressed      that China would be an ally in Africa's drive to develop;      and, in fact, over twenty-three agreements and protocols on      Sino-African cooperation were signed in May alone. They      primarily provided for basic construction projects in      transport and energy.\10\       During meetings in Beijing in May 1996, two days before he      left for his African tour, President Jiang pledged economic      and military support for Mozambique, which rotated on to the      commission in time for the 1997 session, at the same time,      Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian discussed details of the      bilateral ties between the two nations' militaries and      provided Mozambique with quantities of new weapons. Sino-     Mozambiquan relations went into a tailspin in 1996 when China      abruptly pulled out of an agreement to build a new      parliament building. The visit in May was an effort to      repair relations but it could also help produce a pro-     China vote in the commission this March.       Jiang Zemin was present in Zimbabwe in May 1996 when      Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi      signed agreements for US$10 million in grants and an      additional US$10 million in loans, as well as other      agreements on trade, reciprocal protection of investment and      technological and economic cooperation. Earlier an      agricultural group from China studied the possibilities of      importing cotton and tobacco from Zimbabwe. In 1995, the      first time Zimbabwe voted on a China resolution in Geneva, it      voted for the no-action motion and against the China      resolution; in 1996 it again voted in favor of no action on      China.       Following Jiang Zemin's May 1996 visit to Mali, China      signed agreements on economic and technological cooperation      during meetings in Beijing between Premier Li Peng and Mali's      president, and the Chinese vice-minister of agriculture      signed an agreement to assist Mali in building a number of      factories. In 1996, when Mali voted on the China question for      the first time, it voted in favor of the no-action motion.       Jiang Zemin also traveled to Ethiopia in May on a good will      visit during which four cooperation agreements were signed.      China-Ethiopian economic relations have been minimal compared      with China's relationships with other African countries.      Before Jiang's visit, Chinese journalists made much of an      Ethiopian irrigation project completed with help from thirty-     eight Chinese experts. In 1990, Ethiopia voted for a no-     action motion and then went off the commission until 1995,      when it voted in favor of the no-action motion but abstained      when the resolution itself was voted on. In 1996 it again      voted in favor of no action.       Algeria was already considered in the China camp. Jiang      Zemin and the president of Algeria met in Beijing in October      to discuss bilateral relations and to sign six documents      including one protecting and encouraging reciprocal      investment. Algeria has had a strong and continuous      relationship with China which helped with a heavy water      research reactor, and has been involved in irrigation,      agricultural, and research projects including a three-star      hotel in Algiers. In January 1997, Foreign Minister Qian      Qichen paid a quick visit to Algeria, meeting with the      foreign minister to discuss strengthening bilateral      cooperation.       Uganda became a member of the commission in time to vote      with China on the 1996 no-action motion. While the commission      was still meeting in April 1996, Li Zhaoxin, China's vice-     minister of foreign affairs, agreed to provide US$3.6 million      to cover the costs of a national stadium. In January 1997, at      the request of the Ugandan government, China agreed to send      technical personnel for two years to provide guidance in      connection with the stadium project.       Li Peng and the president of Gabon, meeting in Beijing in      August 1996, stressed the importance of their relationship      and their support for the rights of developing nations. Gabon      abstained in 1992 on a no-action motion but has since voted      solidly in the Chinese camp.       When Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei met with      the Guinean Foreign Affairs Minister in Guinea in April while      the commission meeting was still in session, he thanked him      for Guinea's support on the human rights issue. Guinea, a new      member of the commission as of the 1996 session, voted for no      action on the China resolution.       During a visit to South Africa, China's largest trading      partner in Africa, in May 1996, Wu Yi negotiated promises of      expanded trade ties and reciprocal ``most favored nation      trading status.'' The importance of China to South Africa's      economy was underscored in December 1996 when President      Nelson Mandela abruptly abandoned diplomatic support for      Taiwan and recognized Beijing as the sole representative of      China.       Buhe, the vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the      National People's Congress paid a goodwill visit to Benin in      December 1996. Although Benin had voted with China in 1996,      it abstained on both the no-action motion and the resolution      itself in 1995.       Both the timing and the high-profile nature of most of      these exchanges highlight the likely difficulties of getting      African countries to abstain on a China resolution, let alone      vote in favor, in 1997. If the U.S. and Europe had been      committed to seeing a resolution pass, both would have had to      have engaged in intensive lobbying beginning in late 1996.                     V. Central and Eastern Europe       After March 1995, high-level Chinese officials logged      considerate mileage traveling to     the Russian Federation and to two former Soviet republics,      Belarus and the Ukraine. All three countries were to be 1996      commission members. Belarus for the first time, and the      Ukraine for the first time since 1990.       In 1995, after Russia helped to defeat a no-action motion,      its delegates switched their vote and the resolution itself      failed as a result. It seemed logical in 1996, that if China      were to avoid another near embarrassment, it would have to      guarantee Russia's vote on the no-action motion itself. Not      since 1990 had Russia voted to send a resolution to the      floor. Furthermore, it was generally agreed that the      Belarussian president, anxious for reunification with Russia,      would vote with Russia. Of course China had other political      and economic stakes in its relations with Central and Eastern      Europe that may have been the driving force behind much of      the activity outlined below; but with the Geneva vote so      important to Beijing, lining up commission members was a      likely factor.       In June 1995, Li Peng visited all three states. During his      visit to Belarus, there was agreement on bilateral      cooperation in trade, science, technology, manufacturing, and      agriculture. In the Ukraine, he signed a note worth 8.5      million renminbi (approximately US$1.7 million) in economic      assistance. In August, as a follow-up to the June visits, the      vice-minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic      Cooperation (MOFTEC) led a trade delegation to the region.       The direction of the visits reversed in September when the      vice-prime minister of Russia went to Beijing, followed in      November by a vice-minister from the Belarussian Ministry of      Foreign Economic Relations, and in December by the Ukrainian      president. During a meeting with Jiang Zemin, the two signed      a joint communique furthering bilateral economic and      political cooperation. In April 1996 while the Human Rights      Commission was in session, Qiao Shi, chairman of Standing      Committee on China's National People's Congress (parliament),      traveled to Moscow to meet with top Russian officials in      preparation for meetings later in the month with three      central Asian republics. That same month, China exchanged      ministerial visits with both Belarus and the Ukraine. At the      invitation of Qian Qichen, the Belarussian foreign minister      traveled to Beijing. During a meeting with Li Peng, he      thanked him for China's support of Belarus on international      issues and described as ``encouraging'' the 60 percent growth      in bilateral trade in 1995. Qiao Shi traveled to the Ukraine      for a four-day visit aimed at expanding cooperation between      the two countries. Shipbuilding, aircraft manufacturing and      instrument products were cited as industries for cooperation.       In the wake of all this activity, Russia abstained and      Belarus and Ukraine voted with China in favor of no action on      the resolution at the 1996 commission session. Two days after      the vote, President Boris Yeltsin was warmly welcomed in      Beijing by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi. The major      accomplishments of the meetings included an agreement signed      by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan      strengthening border confidence, a Sino-Russian joint      communique to serve as ``the principled basis for the two      countries' constructive partnership during the 21st century''      \11\ and a dozen cooperation agreements, including ones on      intellectual property rights, cooperation on the peaceful use      of nuclear energy, and development for mutual prosperity. In      addition, representatives from both countries      discussed cooperation on military technologies. By      December 1996, when Li Peng visited Moscow, plans were      being laid for an April 1997 summit on security. At the      same time, Russia agreed to lend China US$2.5 billion for      nuclear power plant construction and to sell arms to      Beijing. And Li and Viktor Chernomyrdin discussed raising      bilateral trade volume and cooperation on large-scale      projects.       In November, the Belarussian president told Li Lanqing      during his visit to Minsk that improving Belarus-Chinese      relations was of strategic importance to Belarus, adding that      he attached great importance to developing bilateral trade      and that he welcomed Chinese entrepreneurs willing to invest      in Belarus. The following month, the acting prime minister of      Belarus attended a signing ceremony in Beijing for agreements      on educational cooperation and on ensuring the quality of      exported and imported goods.       A well-documented effort by the Chinese government to gain      support in the commission from central European countries      began before the 1994 vote. Poland, to the surprise of      delegation members themselves, members of Parliament, and      local human rights groups, abstained from voting on the no-     action resolution instead of voting against it as it had the      year before. Instructions from the Polish Ministry of Foreign      Affairs had arrived just before the actual vote took place.      China had reportedly agreed to support Poland's effort to      gain a seat in the Security Council in exchange for the      abstention. A representative of the ministry later explained      to the Polish parliament that the vote had come about as a      result of a ``mistake'' by a junior official.       In 1995, Li Peng wrote to Polish Prime Minister Pawlak to      thank him for his support in Geneva in 1994 and asked for      ``even more substantial support in 1995.'' The offer to      promote a Security Council seat was reiterated. After the      main Warsaw newspaper publicized the ``vote trade'' and media      pressure mounted, Poland's vote against the no-action      resolution helped to defeat it.       Two other Central European countries on the 1997 commission      have received more attention from the U.S. and Europe than      from China, and the commission votes may reflect this. With      the exception of 1992 when it abstained, Bulgaria has voted      against China in the no-action motion, and the Czech      Republic, back on the commission after a hiatus of three      years, would be unlikely to succumb to Chinese pressure.                                VI. Asia       Most Asian countries were already voting solidly with      China. In 1995 and 1996, the only countries that did not were      the three Asian democracies, Japan, the Philippines and      Korea. Japan has consistently voted in favor of a resolution;      the Republic of Korea has consistently abstained; and the      Philippines, which voted with China in 1992 before going off      the commission for two years, voted against China in 1995      after a territorial dispute with China flared up in the South      China Sea. In 1996, Korea and the Philippines abstained; both      were considered swing votes for 1997.       Korea, which resumed diplomatic relations with China in      1992, has heavy economic stakes in China. The chaebol or      conglomerate Goldstar is expected to invest US$10 billion in      China by the year 2005, and Daewoo is planning to contribute      960 million renminbi (approximately US$120 million) to the      building of an expressway. Daewoo will participate in the      operation of the road for thirty years, after which it will      belong to Huangshan City, its Chinese partner. During Jiang      Zemin's visit to the Philippines in November 1996, China      promised to build two power plants and pledged bilateral      cooperation.       Other important efforts in Asia included Jiang Zemin's      November-December 1996 goodwill tour South Asia with stops in      India, Pakistan, and Nepal.       India has consistently voted with China, a reflection      perhaps of its own rejection of external human rights      pressure, especially on the sensitive issue of Kashmir. Sino-     Indian relations, however, have also steadily improved since      the collapse of the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Qian      Qichen accompanied President Jiang to India in November      1996 to promote bilateral relations in politics, trade,      economy, and culture. The primary issue among the two      regional powers was security, and an agreement was reached      on military zones on the Sino-Indian border.       While in Nepal in early December 1996 to mark the twenty-     fifth anniversary of King Birendra's ascension to the throne      of Nepal, Jiang Zemin witnessed the signing of a grant of      economic and technical assistance.       In his December swing through Pakistan, a traditional ally      and leader of the efforts in the commission to prevent a      resolution on China from coming up for debate, Jiang Zemin      oversaw the signing of agreements on construction of a      hydroelectric power plan, environmental protection, drug      trafficking, and establishment of consulates, including      maintenance of Pakistan's consulate in Hong Kong. Pakistani      President Farooq Leghari noted that there was no difference      between Pakistan and China on Tibet, and Pakistan      ``completely supports China.'' He also stated how happy he      was that China would resume sovereignty over Hong Kong ``and      hoped for a peaceful joining of Taiwan with China as soon as      possible.'' \12\                         VII. Waffling in 1997       It was clear by November 1996 that sponsorship of a      resolution on China at the 1997 U.N. Human Rights Commission      was in for a rough ride. On November 24, at a debriefing      following President Clinton's meeting with Jiang Zemin at the      Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Manila, a      senior administration official said that ``the president said      that we want to maintain dialogue and cooperate on [human      rights], but on the present record we could not forgo      presenting [. . .] a resolution.'' The implication was clear:      any nominal gesture or open-ended promise on China's part      that could be interpreted as progress on human rights might      be enough to derail a resolution.       The European Union played a similar game of delaying a      decision on the resolution by bouncing consideration of the      question from one E.U. body to another. When the E.U. Human      Rights Working Group (HRWG) could not reach a decision on      what to do about a resolution at its meeting on December 13,      1996, further consideration was delayed almost a month until      January 10 when the Political Affairs Working Group, with      representatives from all fifteen E.U. capitals, met in      Brussels. The meeting decided to refer the issue back to the      HRWG despite the fact that a straw poll of political      directors had found an overwhelming majority in favor of a      resolution and the HRWG had recommended that the E.U. move      quickly. Rather than taking a firm decision to exert pressure      through a resolution, the political affairs meeting discussed      a variety of ways of avoiding confrontation at the      commission, including pushing for consensus rather than      majority vote on resolutions and substitution of      investigations by the U.N. thematic mechanisms for commission      resolutions.\13\ Just as the HRWG was about to meet on      January 23, China suddenly proposed a human rights discussion      on February 14 around the edges of the Asia-Europe (ASEM)      foreign ministers' meeting in Singapore, providing some E.U.      countries with a pretext for delaying a decision once      more. (For months, the E.U. had been unsuccessful in      trying to schedule a formal E.U.-China human rights      dialogue, originally scheduled for October     1996). But China offered no human rights concessions or      gestures during the meeting, according to diplomatic      sources.       The U.S. also refused to commit itself to the one      multilateral initiative that might have exerted real pressure      on China, with officials reiterating that Sino-U.S. relations      could not be ``held hostage'' to human rights concerns and      that a decision about sponsorship would be made ``when the      time came.'' During the U.S. Senate hearing on January 8,      1997 to confirm Madeleine Albright as secretary of state,      Albright went so far as to imply that China's previous record      was of no import, what counted was ``in the remaining weeks''      how China ``approach[ed] that situation'' and whether any      changes took place. Different administration officials gave      the same message: the U.S. position would be determined based      on China's actions between ``now''--and ``now'' became later      and later--and the time of the commission vote. A week after      Albright's confirmation hearing, the Chinese government      warned of complications in the bilateral relationship if the      U.S. pressed on rights issues.\14\ No concrete promises or      assurances resulted from a visit to Beijing on January 30-31      by a low-level delegation from the National Security Council      and the State Department, aimed at exploring the      possibilities for a human rights breakthrough.       On January 21, the Clinton administration moved to ensure      consistency in the U.S.-E.U. position. A diplomatic demarche      circulated to E.U. members in Brussels stated that ``we are      continuing to talk with the Chinese about what meaningful      concrete steps they might take to avoid confrontation in      Geneva,'' and it suggested that to make compliance easier,      the E.U. ask China for the same minimal concessions: releases      of prisoners with medical problems, resumption of discussions      on prison visits, and signing and submitting to the National      People's Congress for ratification the International Covenant      on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant      on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The U.S. did state      its willingness to cosponsor a resolution if China's      performance did not improve but did not set a time frame or      deadline for making a formal decision. President Clinton      himself went further, stating at his January 24 press      conference that there was no need to press China on human      rights because the current government would, like the Berlin      Wall, eventually fall.\15\       Six days later, the Clinton administration was back to      justify no decision in terms of seeking improvements. On      January 30, Secretary Albright relayed that message when she      met in Washington with Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Micrlo      and Sir Leon Britian, vice-president of the European      Commission and a strong supporter of commercial      diplomacy.\16\ Given the deterioration of human rights in      China across the board over the past year, however, trying to      seek ``improvements'' in the few months before the commission      meetings began was disingenuous at best.       Secretary Albright's visit to Beijing on February 24--just      prior to Deng Xiaoping's funeral--provided another      opportunity to avoid a resolution, pending the outcome of her      high-level discussions with Jiang Zemin, Li Peng and other      senior officials. A report in the New York Times, published      the day she arrived in Beijing, outlined the possible      elements of a deal, although the administration vehemently      denied the story's suggestion that a bargain was imminent, it      did not dispute the other details.\17\ Albright left Beijing,      empty-handed but noting that breakthroughs before had not      come during high-level visits but often several weeks or      months afterwards, so as not to give the impression that      foreign pressure had been involved.       Three days after her visit, however, a Chinese Foreign      Ministry spokesman announced that China was giving ``positive      consideration'' to signing the two major international human      rights agreements, the International Covenant on Civil and      Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic,      Social and Cultural Rights. However, he went on to say, ``as      to when we would join, that is entirely our own affair.'' It      is worth noting that in November 1993, China had announced      that it was giving ``positive consideration'' to access to      its prisons by the International Committee of the Red Cross,      not long afterwards, negotiations with the ICRC came to a      standstill.       But two days after the February 27 statement on the      covenants, China announced that it had agreed to ``resume our      contact [with the ICRC] after a two-year hiatus.'' \18\ An      ICRC spokesman noted that these were ``talks about talks to      begin talks.'' The only element of a deal that had not been      announced by China by the end of February, then, was the      release of key dissidents.       It was left to Vice President Gore to try to close any deal      during his late March visit. Meanwhile the E.U. had met in      Brussels on February 24 and decided to put off any decision      on a resolution, waiting instead for the outcome of      Albright's trip. Immediately following Gore's visit,      Australian Prime Minister John Howard is due in Beijing, as      are Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy (in April), and      French President Jacque Chirac (in May).       While the E.U. and the U.S. were procrastinating, the U.N.      High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso announced      on February 10, before the sudden announcement of his      resignation, that he had received and accepted in principle      an invitation from China to visit. The timing of the      invitation was clearly an effort to try to undermine the      already dim prospects for a successful resolution by      demonstrating China's openness to cooperation on human rights      with the U.N.                            VIII. Conclusion       For the last two years, the diplomacy surrounding a China      resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission has been      marked by a sorry lack of will and outright hypocrisy on the      part of those countries that purport to defend human rights.      The U.S. and E.U. member governments in particular have      watched in near-silence as penalties for dissent in China      steadily increased. The one tool that even U.S. and European      critics of a vocal human rights policy were willing to      support was a resolution in Geneva because it was by      definition multilateral and less damaging, it was thought, to      bilateral relations.       But by 1997, American and European leaders appeared ready      to take any promise the Chinese government was willing to      make as evidence of progress on human rights and as a pretext      for backing out of a resolution. At the same time, it had      ensured that no such resolution could ever pass by holding      off so long on the lobbying needed to build support at the      commission even as China was engaged in steady and effective      lobbying of its own. The U.S. and Europe have sent a clear      message that powerful countries will be allowed to abuse      international standards with impunity. That signal is a      disservice to the United Nations and to the cause of human      rights.                               footnotes     \1\ See, for example, the statements of Chinese diplomats in      press releases issued by the U.N.

At China's invitation, the Special      Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance visited in November 1994.      Not only have none of his recommendations been implemented,      but religious repression in China has intensified in the two      years since the visit. Negotiations for a visit by the      Working Group on Arbitrary Detention are ongoing.     \14\ ``Mutual Respect Needed,'' China Daily (English language      version), January 15, 1997, p. 4.     \15\ ``I don't think there is any way that anyone who      disagrees with that in China can hold back that [liberty],      just as eventually the Berlin Wall fell.
