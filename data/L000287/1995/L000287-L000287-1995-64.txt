Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a program that gives security to our Nation's elderly and hard-working families. I rise in support of Medicare.  We beat you to death to keep someone else from killing you. The Republicans say that they are cutting Medicare to save Medicare. But it is time to be honest with the American people. These cuts will not help Medicare. These cuts pay for tax breaks for Americans earning over $200,000 a year.  And, at the same time, the average senior citizen will pay $1,000 more for health care.  We must help the Medicare Program, and I have supported efforts to do so. But we should not and must not take away the security of health care insurance for our elderly.  These cuts to Medicare are not reform. I know it, You know it, It's time the American people know it.  Don't support Medicare cuts to pay for tax breaks for the rich. That is not right. That is not fair.                          ____________________
