 It came out of the Intelligence Committee 13 to 2. This is the Rockefeller-Bond bipartisan, overwhelmingly supported bill coming out of the Senate.  The current law does not expire until Saturday. It is still my hope that the House, and particularly when you consider the fact that 21 House Democrats, so-called Blue Dog Democrats, have indicated to the Speaker in writing that they would like to see the Senate bill passed--the Rockefeller-Bond bill taken up and passed by the House--I think it is just premature for an extension, Madam President. I think there isstill at least a chance the House might conclude that we have done a terrific piece of work, and they could very well consider the option, as the Blue Dogs have suggested, of taking up the measure and sending it on down to the President for signature.  So for the moment, Madam President, I object.
