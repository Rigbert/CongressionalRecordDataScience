 I can yield back some time. I will comment briefly.  First of all, in order to get to the point where Senator Durbin needs to be to get consideration of his amendments, we have to get through this cloture vote and a cloture vote on the bill so we can get down to talking about these very serious matters.  Many of the things that Senator Durbin has stated that he is interested in changing I would not want to say right out that I agree with every one of those. Some of them, I think, maybe go a little bit too far, but I have not seen--maybe I shouldn't say I haven't seen any, but I have seen few issues that he brought up in the course of the last year as we constructed this bill, that it wasn't possible for us to work out a lot of differences, particularly for those things that are included in the bill.  As I said in my opening remarks, some things that he wanted removed, we didn't remove. I look forward to that opportunity, if we get it by getting through two cloture votes, to sitting down with Senator Durbin and some of his colleagues on his side of the aisle who now have an interest in this legislation to see what we can work out and even minimize the number of votes or the length of debate we ought to have on this bill.  I will make one comment about one of the things Senator Durbin made reference to about opposition from the National Foundation for Consumer Credit to some of the ideas of Senator Sessions. To Senator Sessions' credit, he did work out some compromises that needed to be done. We have a letter dated August 6 from the National Foundation for Consumer Credit that says that they support those provisions of the legislation as well, and there is a copy of that letter to Senator Durbin.  I think we have a process here that has worked so well. If you would stop and think--and Senator Durbin has worked in this spirit--for the years I have been on this subcommittee, either as chairman or as ranking member--and I served 16 years with the predecessor of Senator Durbin, and that wasSenator Heflin from Alabama--there has not been a single piece of bankruptcy legislation to get through this body in that 16-year period of time that didn't have the cooperative effort of the Democrat chairman or ranking member and the Republican chairman or ranking member, depending on who was controlling the committee at that time in history. That reputation has been continued through Senator Durbin at this point.  If we can just get everybody on Senator Durbin's side of the aisle to be in that same spirit that has promoted good bankruptcy legislation through this body for that period of time, we can be successful, not only with this piece of legislation, but also to emphasize that this is a needed piece of legislation. Even Senator Durbin, working with us, has helped us develop the first major change in legislation to be considered on the floor of this body since the passage of the 1978 bankruptcy law.  I hope that the spirit that former Senator Heflin of Alabama and I have worked in, and has been continued by Senator Durbin and me thus far, can be fully accepted by people from his side of the aisle. I know he has to satisfy a lot of interests. I even have, I say to Senator Durbin, some interests on my side that are not satisfied with the legislation we brought out of committee. So I have some problems with which I have to work.  The point is, if, since 1981, this effort can be successful, it can be successful this time. I just plead with everybody who might want to filibuster this for some extraneous issues that probably can be brought up in some other way on other bills that would satisfy the Senate majority leader, we can get there.  I urge, as Senator Durbin has, a very positive vote on this. I hope it will be followed, assuming we are successful this time, with a positive vote later this week on cloture on the entire bill.  I yield the floor, and I yield back what few seconds I have remaining.                             Cloture Motion
