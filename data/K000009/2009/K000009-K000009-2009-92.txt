 It is an awesome power, the power to create money. None of us have that power unless one considers fraud or forgery. But the gambling houses on Wall Street did exactly that, they created money recklessly, using mortgages way beyond what the underlying asset could return. They don't deserve any reward.  Vote ``no'' on the second Wall Street bailout. It's just more of the same. Treasury and Wall Street broke their promise the first time, why reward them again? Let's use the appropriate agencies--the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and HUD--to do the workouts that are necessary. Stop the suffering that I see every week when I return home to my district and places across this country where the American people have had the door slammed in their face.  What a difficult time is being experienced by millions and millions of our families. How can we possibly reward Wall Street again when they've turned their backs on the very people they're asking to pay the bill?  But what the gambling houses on Wall Street did was create money recklessly, leveraging mortgages way beyond what the underlying asset could return. Wall Streets bankers are so powerful--and arrogant--and breed such special relationships inside our federal government, that they are not only spared the disciplined rules of the market we must live by, they are spared prosecution, so far.  They are so powerful, they repeatedly abuse their power--and then run to our taxpayers about every ten years to bail them out. Wall Street banks have special pull up here in Washington through the Treasury and Federal Reserve, their campaign contributions, and the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street.  They consistently enrich themselves by indebting the American people for their excess. They've committed crimes much larger than the last excesses of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980's and 1990's. The cost of those massive excesses too was thrown onto the public and became the third largest component of America's long term debt. Then, Wall Street bankers make plenty of money selling those U.S. debt bonds too. It's a win-win for them.  Some would say they make money coming and going! So we have another fraudulent meltdown with another Congress and now another President. We run the risk of being cowed again by their power, rather than holding them accountable for their abusive behavior. They are rewarded again in this bill . . . transferring $350 billion more in taxpayer bailout today to paper over the losses.  Yet nothing has been done to turn a face to the taxpayers and mortgage holders who are bearing the personal cost of Wall Street's chicanery. Who will pay Wall Street's bills?  Without our imposing rigor, before more $ is showered on them, a culture of excess will flourish and become the norm. America cannot afford more excess and more greed. The latest group of victims--homeowners--got shunted aside in the first $350 billion Wall Street bailout. Nothing, nothing was done to help them, even though it was promised, promised, promised as the key reason for passage of the bailout last year.  The first objective should be expedited workouts as the mortgage foreclosure crisis is driving our economy into ruins. You fix that by doing those mortgage loan workouts, one by one, using the tried and true FDIC, its bank examiners along with the SEC accounting authorities. That isn't being done. I'm saying families being foreclosed not leave their houses--to squat--unless Wall St. bailout services can produce a full mortgage audit. Who holds your loan? Let them disclose they have followed truth in lending and RESPA laws.  Treasury--Wall Street's biggest advocate--has been charged with mortgage workouts. It has failed our people miserably. Why? It is not capable of being the mortgage workout instrumentality of our government. The appropriate agencies are the FDIC, SEC, and HUD.  Vote ``no'' on the second Wall St. bailout. It's just more of the same. Treasury and Wall Street broke their promise the first time. Why trust them again? Let the new President use the agencies that have the rigor to solve the home foreclosure crisis, not the one that is Wall St. biggest advocate to cover up Wall Street's abuses and greed.                              {time}  1200
