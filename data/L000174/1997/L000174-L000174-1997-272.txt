President, I ask unanimous consent a letter from the National Women's Law Center be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  National Women's Law Center,                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1997.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Senate Russell Office Building,      Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: We are writing to express our grave      concerns regarding the process being followed with respect to      the nomination of Margaret Morrow to the district court in      the Central District of California. Her original nomination      was made one year ago. Yet, her nomination has not been moved      through the process.       Ample information has been presented regarding her      qualifications. She is a magna cum laude graduate of Bryn      Mawr College and a cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School.      She has a 23-year career in private practice with an emphasis      in complicated commercial and corporate litigation with      extensive experience in federal courts. She has received a      long list of awards and recognition as a top lawyer in her      field, her community and her state. She is a leader and path      blazer among women lawyers, as the second woman President of      25,000 member Los Angeles Bar Association and the first woman      President of the largest mandatory bar association in the      country, the 150,000 member State Bar of California. She has      consistently been a voice within the legal community for      women and for the disadvantaged. She has received broad      support from attorneys, judges and community leaders.       You questioned four nominees on March 18, 1997. The other      three, all men, have moved forward toward a Senate vote.      Margaret Morrow has not.       No explanation has been provided which in any way justifies      this extraordinary and harmful delay. Superb women lawyers      should not be given the message that we fear is being sent by      the handling of Margaret Morrow's nomination--that no woman      need apply unless she is prepared to be singled out for      particularly harsh treatment.       We urge you to send her nomination to the Senate floor      immediately.           Sincerely,     Nancy Duff Campbell,       Co-President.     Marcia D. Greenberger,       Co-President.
