  As she outlined earlier this month, the Department of Defense took a rare step involving a major procurement contract. Defense Secretary Gates decided the competition to replace the next generation of aerial refueling tanker was so flawed that it should be rebid. He elevated that competition from the Air Force to his office, and he promised to address all of the findings raised last month in a Government Accountability Office ruling which determined that the contest was skewed in favor of the European company Airbus and against Boeing.  I was glad to hear the Defense Secretary had decided to take new bids and start over. But I come to the floor today to join with my colleague from Washington State because I too have very serious concerns about the Pentagon's plans for that new competition. Some Pentagon officials are already indicating to us they are considering using this opportunity to amend the request for proposals to give greater weight to a bigger plane.  As a result of those comments, defense experts and analysts are now beginning to predict that as a result of that, the contract will simply go back to Airbus. I brought this up in a meeting this week with Acting Air Force Secretary Donley, in which we discussed the history of this tanker contract, and we talked about the needs of the Air Force, the criticisms that have been lodged against the latest competition, and our concerns about the amendment to that RFP that would tip the scales to favor one bidder.  I am not saying the Pentagon cannot change the requests for proposals. However, I strongly believe that all those changes have to be rooted in the original requirements that were set out by the Air Force when it began the process of replacing the military's midsized tanker, the KC-135.  I recognize the Pentagon's procurement team is very serious about getting this competition right. They want to get the right tanker for our warfighters. They want to do it quickly. But I also want to make it clear that if the Pentagon moves forward with this effort, officials must take the GAO's findings seriously and ensure that this competition is as fair and transparent as it can be.  Last month the GAO upheld eight points of protest that were raised by Boeing, including that the Air Force changed directions midstream in the process about which criteria were more important. It did not give Boeing credit for providing a more capable plane, according to the Air Force's description of what it wanted. Yet it gave Airbus extra credit for offering amenities the Air Force did not even ask for. The GAO report said the Air Force deliberately and unreasonably increased Boeing's engineering costs. When that mistake was corrected, it was discovered that the Airbus tanker actually cost tens of millions of dollars more than Boeing.  The GAO found that the Air Force accepted Airbus's proposal even though Airbus could not meet two of their key contract requirements. They could not meet the contract requirement, Airbus could not, and refused to commit to providing long-term maintenance as was specified directly in the RFP, even after the Air Force repeatedly asked them for it.  Secondly, the Air Force could not prove that Airbus could refuel all of the military's aircraft according to procedure. This goes to show how there were major flaws that occurred throughout that process.  So as it continues with this competition now, the Department of Defense must make sure there is no reason to question its motives. If they truly plan to make this a fair contest, Secretary Gates has to ensure that before the selection team reopens this competition, it goes back and addresses each one of those GAO findings. It has to ensure that both companies are on the same footing and it has to prove the competition is as transparent as possible. Our refueling tankers are the backbone of our global military strength. They are stationed around the world today and they service planes from every branch of our Armed Forces. This is a contract that is ultimately worth more than $100 billion. We are going to have these planes for decades. We cannot afford to make mistakes.  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I recognize that Secretary Gates is very serious about getting this competition right. At the end of theday, this is about getting the right equipment for our airmen and airwomen who are put in harm's way for our security every day. Our servicemembers deserve a plane that will enable them to do their job and return home safely.  Our taxpayers deserve to have confidence that the errors are going to be fixed in this contract as the GAO outlined. So I come to the floor today to say, as the Pentagon moves forward with this effort over the next several weeks, I strongly urge our officials to take those GAO findings seriously and ensure this competition is as fair and transparent as it can be.                              Samuel Snow  While I am on the floor this afternoon, I want to take a moment to say a few words about a different topic; that is, about a gentleman who sacrificed very dearly for our country.  My colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, was on the floor earlier today talking about a veteran named Samuel Snow who traveled from Florida all the way to my home State of Washington, all the way across the country this past week, to finally receive the honorable discharge from the Army that he deserved to get more than 60 years ago.  This man traveled from Florida to Washington to finally get an honorable discharge 60 years later. Samuel Snow was one of 28 African-American soldiers who were wrongly prosecuted in a court martial for a crime that occurred in Seattle at Fort Lawton in 1944.  Last weekend, 64 years later, the Army finally publicly acknowledged that Mr. Snow and 27 others were unjustly convicted and issued a formal apology. As my colleague from Florida talked about this morning, Mr. Snow came all the way from Florida to Seattle and participated in the dinner there with sons and daughters of some of the men he served with in prison. But later that evening in Seattle, Mr. Snow checked himself into a hospital, and he missed the next day's ceremony. His son Ray Snow went to the ceremony and accepted the honorable discharge on his father's behalf, that honorable discharged he had waited decades to receive, and took it from that ceremony, went to his father's hospital bed and was able to hand it to him personally and see the smile in his dad's eyes for the first time.  Sadly, very sadly, his father, Mr. Snow, passed away shortly after he was handed that honorable discharge. Samuel Snow was a hero for our country who suffered unjustly. He deserves the thanks of our entire country for his service and his sacrifice. My thoughts now are with the Snow family during this difficult time. I am so glad he was able to finally receive that honorable discharge he waited for so many years and to receive it before he died.  I yield the floor.
