President, like so many Americans, I have been faced with a barrage of confusing and frightening information about the recent Firestone tire recall. I have a Ford Explorer, and it has Firestone tires on it. My wife and I drive it and take our children and our friends and others for rides in that vehicle. So I understand what a lot of my fellow Vermonters are going through regarding this deadly episode. It never should have happened.  But it is not just Explorer owners who are at risk--pedestrians, joggers, bicyclists, and other cars could be hit by out-of-control vehicles or by tire pieces.  The tires on my car are the same size and type as those covered by the recall. But they were manufactured at a different plant--a North Carolina plant. Even though employees of that plant have raised serious concerns about quality control in that factory, the tires on my Explorer are not eligible for the recall. But I have to tell you, I look long at them each time I get into the vehicle, and it is in the back of my mind every time I drive.  Even though they tell me that they are not yet the subject of a recall, I wonder what tomorrow's news may bring.  The first foreign recall occurred on August 1999, but the Secretary of Transportation apparently was not even informed of this by the manufacturer until May of 2000--nearly a year after the fact. That is outrageous. It is unacceptable. Worse yet, that kind of delay has proven deadly. I don't even want to think about the lives that could have been saved had there been quicker action, and had the manufacturers been honest enough to notify the public immediately.  Even after the recall was issued, the deadly risk continues as families have to wait to get replacement tires. I want to mention one sad case. A grandfather, Gary Meek of Farmersville, California, was a retired police officer. He, his wife and granddaughter, Amy, 13 years old, were driving on August 16, a couple weeks ago, when a Firestone tire on the Ford Explorer separated. His wife survived the crash, but Mr. Meek and his granddaughter were killed. His widow has to carry on with those awful memories.  I am going to introduce legislation today to mandate that the Secretary of Transportation be immediately notified of defects in motor vehicles or vehicle components--immediately after the foreign manufacturer becomes aware of the dangerous defect or when the manufacturer is notified about the defect by the foreign government. This notification would be earlier in time than the beginning of a foreign recall or any efforts to replace the defective product.  My bill also requires the manufacturer file a full report on the circumstances regarding each defective vehicle or vehicle component. The bill will impose stiff criminal penalties for false or misleading statements, or efforts to coverup the truth, regarding these reports. It also imposes criminal and civil penalties for other violations of the bill. In other words, if tires are defective, or are going to be recalled or replaced in some other country, they have to notify us--and notify us accurately and truthfully.  One would think some of these foreign tire companies would feel a moral duty to save lives. You would think that would be enough to motivate them. One would think even the idea of huge fines might motivate them. That doesn't seem to be enough. Maybe if they think they will get a jail sentence if they don't notify us truthfully, maybe, they will put the interests of the lives and safety of the public ahead of the short-term gains of their own companies.  My bill, the Transportation Information Recall Enhancement Act, requires notification of a foreign dangerous defect within 48 hours. It requires even more detailed information filings a few days later. My bill also requires notification of increases in deaths or serious injuries in foreign countries regarding vehicles and vehicle components that could prove deadly if they are on American soil.  Secretary Slater said in an interview that there should be a law requiring that the United States be immediately notified of foreign recalls. We are on the way to making that a reality. I will work with any Senator, Republican or Democrat, on this issue so we can pass this legislation or any other bill to get the job done in the next couple of weeks.  It is incomprehensible to me how any corporate executives can live with themselves when they withhold information that could have saved people's lives. If they are going to conceal the truth or make false statements, they should face criminal sanctions. Sometimes if a person thinks they are going to end up in the slammer, they will pay a lot more attention to the safety of people, rather than simply looking at the balance sheet.  For example, we just received reports about Mitsubishi over the past two decades. For 20 years, they routinely withheld information about dangerous products which ended up in America and other countries. These corporate officers should be forced to explain their inaction to the families of those who have been injured using their products. Maybe Americans should not buy any Mitsubishi products because they lied for 20 years. Criminal penalties are clearly needed. In the global economy there has to be some compassion for the suffering that is sometimes caused around the world. There seems to be almost a disconnect. The President of Ford Motors, for example, when he heard that Congress was going to question him, at first was unwilling to testify personally.  I think he heard an almost national outcry over that insolence and disregard of the people of this country, insolence and arrogance that kept him from realizing how concerned Americans were. Fortunately, he changed his mind and found the time. I suspect the appropriate congressional committees would have gotten a subpoena, and the result would have been the same. He would have testified.  Every corporation has a right to sell their products. Every corporation has a right to make a decent profit. Theyought to be able to do that. When they know they have a product that can bring about death or injury, and especially when only they know it and nobody else does, they ought to make those facts known. The law should be very clear that they have to make it known. If they manufacture a product in this country to sell both here and abroad, if there are problems in the other country and the product is defective, they should notify this country of that fact. They will lose some business in the short term. In the long term, they will do better. The American public will be secure, and the American public will not be endangered.  What Firestone did, what Ford did, and for that matter, what Mitsubishi did, was wrong. It was absolutely wrong. I want corporate leaders never to do this again. I want a law that says if you provide information to our government regarding defective products that is false, misleading or untruthful that you are going to go to jail.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a summary of the bill in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3012       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Information      Recall Enhancement Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) in an interview with ABC News on September 3, 2000,      Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater stated that he      thinks there should be a law requiring that the United States      be immediately notified of a foreign recall, ``especially in      the global economy when you've got U.S. goods really being      used by individuals around the world. We should know when      there's a problem someplace else.'';       (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, there is no      legal requirement for manufacturers of motor vehicles and      their components to notify United States agencies of a recall      issued in a foreign country;       (3) between August 1999 and spring 2000, Ford Motor Company      replaced Firestone tires on 46,912 vehicles in Saudi Arabia,      Thailand, Malaysia, and South America;       (4)(A) on May 2, 2000, the National Highway Traffic Safety      Administration opened a preliminary evaluation into Firestone      ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness AT tires after receiving 90      complaints, primarily from consumers in the Southeast and      Southwest, about tread separations or blowouts;       (B) as of September 2000, the National Highway Traffic      Safety Administration has received over 1,400 complaints,      including reports of more than 250 injuries and 88 deaths;      and       (C) some of the complaints date back to the early 1990s,      and 797 of the complaints report that a tire failure took      place between August 1, 1999, and August 9, 2000; and       (5)(A) on August 9, 2000, Bridgestone/Firestone announced a      United States recall of 6,500,000 ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness      AT tires; and       (B) that date was 3 months after the National Highway      Traffic Safety Administration commenced its investigation and      nearly 9 months after Ford Motor Company initiated the      replacement of the tires in foreign countries.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that      defects in motor vehicles or replacement equipment in foreign      countries are quickly, accurately and truthfully reported to      the United States Secretary of Transportation in cases in      which--       (1) the motor vehicles or replacement equipment is      manufactured for export to the United States; or       (2) the motor vehicles or replacement equipment is      manufactured in the United States using a manufacturing      process that is the same as, or similar to, the manufacturing      process used in the foreign country, with the result that the      motor vehicles or replacement equipment manufactured in the      United States may also be defective.

Section 30118 of title 49, United States Code, is amended      by adding at the end the following:       ``(f) Reporting of Defects in Foreign Motor Vehicle      Products.--       ``(1) Definition of foreign motor vehicle product.--The      term `foreign motor vehicle product' means a motor vehicle or      replacement equipment that--       ``(A) is manufactured in a foreign country for export to      the United States; or       ``(B) is manufactured in a foreign country using a      manufacturing process that is the same as, or similar to, a      manufacturing process used in the United States for a motor      vehicle or replacement equipment.       ``(2) Reporting of defects.--       ``(A) Initial report.--Not later than 48 hours after      determining, or learning that a government of a foreign      country has determined, that a foreign motor vehicle product      contains a defect that could be related to motor vehicle      safety, the manufacturer of the foreign motor vehicle product      shall report the determination to the Secretary.       ``(B) Written report.--       ``(i) In general.--Not later than 5 days after the end of      the 48-hour period described in subparagraph (A), the      manufacturer shall submit to the Secretary a written report      that meets the requirements of clause (ii).       ``(ii) Contents of written report.--A written report under      clause (i) shall contain--       ``(I) a description of the foreign motor vehicle product      that is the subject of the report;       ``(II) a description of--       ``(aa) the determination of the defect by the government of      the foreign country or by the manufacturer of a foreign motor      vehicle product; and       ``(bb) any measures that the government requires to be      taken, or the manufacturer determines should be taken, to      obtain a remedy of the defect;       ``(III) information concerning any serious injuries or      fatalities possibly resulting from the defect; and       ``(IV) such other information as the Secretary determines      to be appropriate.       ``(3) Reporting of possible defects.--Upon making a      determination that there have been a significant number of      serious injuries or fatalities in a foreign country that      could have resulted from a defect in a foreign motor vehicle      product that could be related to motor vehicle safety (as      determined in accordance with regulations promulgated by the      Secretary), the manufacturer of the foreign motor vehicle      product shall report the determination to the Secretary in      such manner as the Secretary establishes by regulation.''.     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act and the amendments made by this Act take effect on      the date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this      Act.                                  ____                                Summary  This Act will provide criminal penalties for making false or misleading statements in notifications or reports made to the U.S. Government regarding recalls or replacement actions regarding motor vehicles and component parts. This criminal liability and therequirements for providing notice is triggered when a foreign government makes the manufacturer aware of the defect in motor vehicles or replacement parts, even before it triggers recalls or replacement actions.  This Act will help ensure accurate, truthful information and timely notice regarding recalls or replacement actions concerning defective motor vehicles or replacement equipment such as tires in foreign countries are quickly reported to the United States Secretary of Transportation where such vehicles are manufactured for export to the United States or where the defective product or equipment is manufactured in the United States in a manner that is similar to its manufacture in the foreign country and thus may likewise be dangerous.  The notification must be provided to the Secretary within 48 hours of when the foreign manufacturer learns or is notified of the defect by the foreign government. Within 5 days of that 48-hour deadline, a more detailed, accurate and truthful report must be provided to the Secretary of Transportation describing the basis for actions taken and providing information about serious injuries or fatalities related to the defect.  In addition, even if a defect is not identified, the Secretary must be notified each time there is a significant increase in deaths or serious injuries in a foreign country related to vehicles or vehicle components manufactured in foreign countries for export to the United States or related to vehicles or components manufactured in the United States using similar manufacturing processes (as are used in the foreign country), as defined in regulations of the Secretary.  Failure to comply with these requirements, and any related requirements set by the Secretary under the bill, shall result in a civil money penalty of up to $500,000, per day. In addition, for manufacturers or employees of foreign motor vehicle products (manufacturing vehicles for export to the United States or using manufacturing processes similar to that used in the United States) who in reporting to the Secretary knowingly or willfully: falsifies, conceals, or covers up a material fact; makes a materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or makes a false writing or document, shall be imprisoned for up to 5 years and shall be subject to criminal fines of up to $500,000 for corporations, or $250,000 for individuals.  This Act shall be effective beginning six months after enactment.                                 ______                                       By
