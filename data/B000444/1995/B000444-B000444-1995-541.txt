 President, I say to the majority leader, I think we have about 20 amendments left. I expect that by midday tomorrow we will have fewer than that left.  I might point out to the majority leader that two of the four amendments accepted, when we met last, there was no possibility of them being accepted. They were two of the six major amendments that the Democratic side felt were essential to be included in the Republican core bill.  Although we did accept them and they turned out to be overwhelming votes--taggants--when I spoke this time before we adjourned, I said the taggant amendment and the amendment that the Senator from California had regarding the distribution of material on how to build explosive devices were two of the most contentious amendments, and they were so advertised at the time. They had been worked out through the cooperation of Senator Hatch and the Republican side. So I do not want the Senator, the leader, to think we have only been dealing with those things, with the easiest things on the list. The big items left on the list are some gun-related amendments and the habeas corpus amendments. We are ready to go at those starting first thing in the morning. I imagine we will be joined, for example, by the Senator from New Jersey, who has an amendment on doing away with the $25 million program the Defense Department makes available for ammunition for target practice. He is willing to agree to a half-hour on that amendment. I do not think we are going to take very much time on the remaining very controversial amendments.  I cannot say to the Senator what one or two people on either side may do based on what the final outcome of the habeas corpus vote is, or a gun vote is. I do not know. But I think disposing of the amendments will go relatively quickly and I think we will be able to get time agreements on almost all of them.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.
