 President, I rise today to speak on the subject of the Air Force's KC-135 Tanker Replacement Program. Like my colleagues, one of my top priorities is to keep our Nation safe, and I am working to ensure that our servicemembers have the best equipment possible. Our Air Force has a fleet of aging refueling tankers that are currently experiencing problems. I simply do not believe we can wait 35 years to replace them.
