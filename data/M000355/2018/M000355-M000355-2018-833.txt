 President, in the marble halls of the Kentucky State Capitol building in Frankfort, visitors will discover numerous portraits of those who have served our Commonwealth in our highest offices. Depictions of Kentucky's Governors, legislators, and supreme court justices line the halls as memorials to those public servants. On August 7, another portrait will be added, paying tribute to an individual who has served our State and our Nation with distinction.  William Thompson Scott, known by his friends as ``Will T.,'' is a native of Pike County in eastern Kentucky and served as an associate justice on the Kentucky Supreme Court from 2005 to 2015. Known for his humor and congenial nature, Justice Scott clearly earned his colleagues' respect when they elected him to serve a 4-year term as the deputy chief justice. With the esteem of his peers and those he served, Justice Scott's tenure on the supreme court can be remembered for his positive impact on the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Even before his first election to the high court, Justice Scott actively engaged in the service of our Commonwealth and our Nation for much of his life. Interrupting his undergraduate studies at Eastern Kentucky University in 1966 to voluntarily enlist in the U.S. Army, he proudly served our Nation in Vietnam as a first lieutenantand earned the Bronze Star Medal. When he was discharged, he returned to Kentucky and received his bachelor's degree from Pikeville College before studying law at the University of Miami in Florida.  After spending a few years as a trial attorney, Will T. found a way to employ his skills for the good of his neighbors and became an assistant Commonwealth's attorney for Pike County in 1981. A few years later, he was elected as a circuit court judge in Kentucky, beginning what would be his long and distinguished career serving on the bench.  When his portrait joins those of other jurists from Kentucky's past, Justice Scott's legacy will be enshrined for future generations to study, interpret, and appreciate. So as Justice Scott's friends, family, and colleagues gather to honor his career, I would like to ask my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking him for his service to our Nation and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                          ____________________
