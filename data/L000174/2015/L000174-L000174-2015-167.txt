President, the American intellectual property system is rightly held as the global standard for promoting innovation and driving economic growth. This is particularly true of our patent system. The fundamental truth that our Founders recognized more than 200 years ago, that limited exclusive rights for inventors incentivize research and development, continues to benefit consumers and the American economy at large.  A healthy patent system should do more than drive economic development; it should incentivize research and discoveries that advance humanitarian needs. I have worked to promote policies that encourage intellectual property holders to apply their work to address global humanitarian challenges. Today, I continue that effort by joining with Senator Grassley to introduce the bipartisan Patents for Humanity Program Improvement Act.  This bipartisan legislation strengthens a program created by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, in 2012. The PTO's Patents for Humanity Program provides rewards to selected patent holders who use their invention to address a humanitarian issue that significantly affects the public health or quality of life of an impoverished population. Those who receive the award are given a certificate to accelerate certain PTO processes, as described in the program rules.  The innovations that have been recognized by this program help underserved people throughout the world. Award winners have worked to improve the treatment and diagnosis of devastating diseases, improve nutrition and the environment, and combat the spread of dangerous counterfeit drugs. These are innovations that will make a real difference in the lives of people who are not always the beneficiaries of cutting-edge technology.  Following a Judiciary Committee hearing in 2012, I asked then-PTO Director Kappos whether the Patents for Humanity program would be more effective, and more attractive to innovators, if the acceleration certificates awarded were transferable to a third party. He responded that it would, and that it would be particularly beneficial to small businesses that win the award. Since that time, other small start-ups and global health groups have emphasized that making the certificates transferable would improve their usability and increase the incentives of the Patents for Humanity Award. The Patents for Humanity Program Improvement Act makes this enhancement to the program. It is a straightforward, cost-neutral bill that will strengthen this award and encourage innovations to be used for humanitarian goods.  When Congress can establish policies that provide business incentives for humanitarian endeavors, it should not hesitate to act. I urge the Senate to work swiftly to pass this legislation.                          ____________________
