 Speaker, I want to alert Members about a very disturbing proposal recently offered by the chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. This proposal would charge senior citizens in this country an $8 co-payment for Medicare home health care visits. At present, as you know, these visits are now without cost for the patient.  Mr. Speaker, in my judgment, if this very terrible proposal were ever passed into law, and let us make sure that it is not, it would cause enormous pain and hardship for some of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country, low income and sick elderly people. Why, in God's name, would we be making life more difficult for so many people who today are finding it difficult just to pay their bills?  Mr. Speaker, as you know, nearly half of all senior citizens in our country have incomes of less than $15,000 a year, and about 12 percent of them live in poverty.                              {time}  1530  Many of them today are finding it extremely difficult to pay their bills, toprovide for their prescription drugs and to take care of their other basic necessities of life. These are not the people that we should be going after and making life more difficult for. The thought of forcing sick, fragile, low-income seniors to pick up a new cost which for someone requiring home health care visits 7 days a week could run as high as $2,500 a year is literally beyond comprehension. Does anyone really think that a sick, needy senior citizen with an income of $10,000 a year should be asked to pay an additional 6 percent of his or her entire income on health care costs?  And what about some seniors whose incomes may be even lower than the national average. What an outrage to go after low-income senior citizens who are sick, who are fragile, who need home health care visits and tell those people that you have got to pay substantially more for your health care needs.  Mr. Speaker, what I find particularly obscene about this proposal is that it comes one year after the so-called balanced budget agreement which cut Medicare by $115 billion and most of those savings went for tax breaks for the very wealthy. Three-quarters of the tax breaks went to people making $100,000 a year or more. So what Congress did last year is cut Medicare, give huge tax breaks for the rich, and then this year the chairman of the relevant subcommittee is saying, ``Gee, we don't have enough money for Medicare. I guess we're going to have to ask low-income sick seniors to pay more for home health care visits.'' This is the Robin Hood proposal in reverse. We take from the poor and some of the most desperate people in this country and we give to some of the wealthiest. This is a proposal that I would hope would be dead on arrival.  Mr. Speaker, 22,000 Vermonters receive home health care in my State. But with last year's Medicare cuts, many are in danger of losing services through the reduction of payments to efficient home health care agencies that exist in Vermont and a number of other States. In other words, what Vermont was penalized for is having an efficient, cost-effective home health care visitation program. What we should be doing is correcting that absurd formula, making sure that more money goes throughout this country to help agencies like the Visiting Nurses Association provide the quality health care and home visits that they have been doing. We should not be making a bad situation even worse.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that if members of both parties alert the chairman that this horrendous proposal is unacceptable, it will never get off first base, and that is what we should be doing.                          ____________________
