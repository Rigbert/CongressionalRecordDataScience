President, McHenry, IL, lost one of its favorite sons on November 21. Donald Doherty was the mayor of McHenry from 1961 to 1973. He was a county board member for 20 years. He was a husband, a father, grandfather, a veteran of the U.S.Army, and someone who truly loved his community. He was 91 years old.  If you go down Green Street in McHenry, you will come to the intersection of Pearl Street and Green Street and a sign for Honorary Donald P. Doherty Drive. Donald loved living in McHenry. People could always find Donald along Green Street at St. Patrick's Church or at city hall or at his family's drug store, Bolger Drugs. McHenry and his family were his life.  Before Donald became mayor in 1961, he ran the Bolger Drug Store. He was famous for going out of his way to help customers. If his store didn't have it, he would make sure the customer got it. The community rewarded him by choosing him to be mayor for 12 years.  His love of the community continued well after his time as mayor. He went on to serve as a member of the county board, the Knights of Columbus, and the McHenry Area Chamber of Commerce where he received the chamber's highest honor, the Frank E. Low Award. Donald often would consult succeeding mayors if they needed help. During McHenry Fiesta Days, you could find him as the parade marshal.  Donald helped make McHenry a better place to live for people. He loved car rides, playing bingo with his friends at the McHenry Country Club, and he missed playing Scrabble with his late wife, Rosalie. He leaves behind 10 children and 21 grandchildren.                          ____________________
