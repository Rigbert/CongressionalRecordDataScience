 President, I would like to recognize and honor theincredible life of Elizabeth Taylor, a true Hollywood movie star, a dedicated social activist, and a legendary figure in American history.  Elizabeth Taylor was born on February 27, 1932, in Hampstead, London, England, to Americans Francis Lenn Taylor and Sara Viola Warmbrodt. In a career that spanned 70 years, Elizabeth Taylor remarkably appeared in over 50 films. However, it was her philanthropy and dedication to her fellow humankind that have earned my deepest gratitude.  Many will remember Elizabeth Taylor for her film career, with overwhelming hits such as ``National Velvet,'' which catapulted her to stardom and solidified her as Hollywood's newest star. I personally recall this film as one of my childhood treasures, and it remains a classic to this day. Ms. Taylor was a pioneer for women, in film and in society. When she signed a $1 million contract for the film ``Cleopatra,'' it boldly declared her status to Hollywood and the world. She also expanded her body of work to include Broadway, where she debuted in the revival of Lillian Hellman's 1939 play ``The Little Foxes'' and returned in the revival of Noel Coward's 1930 comedy ``Private Lives.''  Though Elizabeth Taylor earned her household name through her accomplishments in the film industry, it was her charitable work to combat AIDS that was truly outstanding. Never one to shy away from opposition or controversy, Ms. Taylor wholeheartedly fundraised, supported, and raised awareness for AIDS. Her ability to mobilize a new audience was remarkable. In addition to fundraising and contributing millions of dollars to addressing AIDS, Ms. Taylor was a principal founder in the American Foundation for AIDS Research, amfAR, and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.  Elizabeth Taylor received many accolades throughout her career, including her appointment as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her illustrious film career and humanitarian work. Ms. Taylor received two Academy Awards for best actress for her performances in ``Butterfield 8'' and ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.'' Later, she was inducted into the California Hall of Fame at the California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts, by former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. While these honors are notable, it was Ms. Taylor's intangible qualities of perseverance, altruism, and grace that were even more remarkable.  Beyond her film career and role as an activist, Elizabeth Taylor was an individual with an entrepreneurial spirit. She authored a self-help book, designed jewelry for The Elizabeth Collection by Piranesi, and created the popular perfumes ``Passion,'' ``White Diamonds,'' and ``Black Pearls.'' As a reflection of herself, Ms. Taylor's ventures always evoked a sense of class, eternal elegance, and beauty.  Please join me in expressing the sympathies of this body to Elizabeth Taylor's family, including her children, Michael Howard and Christopher Edward Wilding, Elizabeth ``Liza'' Todd, and Maria Burton, 10 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren. I have no doubt she will be so dearly missed by the many friends, family, and countless individuals whose lives she touched. On this day, we celebrate her, her life, her legacy, and her extraordinary contributions to our Nation and the world as a whole.  Elizabeth Taylor will be remembered as a dazzling actress, a friend, a noble philanthropist, and as Hollywood's ultimate leading lady.                          ____________________
