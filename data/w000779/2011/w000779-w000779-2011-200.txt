President, I am proud that my home State of Oregon has so many citizen soldiers and even prouder of the way we take care of them. In the world of veterans' services, one real shining light is Clackamas Community College. I am delighted today to take this opportunity to recognize Clackamas Community College for being selected to receive the Patriotic Employer Award from the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, ESGR. Clackamas Community College sets an extraordinary example in its care of our nation's veterans that I would hope every institution of higher learning could follow. Clackamas Community College doesn't just stop at educating its students. It serves every member of its community, especially its veterans.  When servicemembers come back from the war zone, it takes some adjusting to get back to the routine of life they left behind when they went to serve. As anyone who has gone to college knows, just signing up for classes or applying for student aid can be a confusing experience let alone when you have been out of the university atmosphere for a while, fighting in battle. Clackamas Community College knows that. That is why it created a Veterans Education and Training--VET--Center to serve as a one-stop shop for students who are veterans. The VET Center's staff knows the ins and outs of veterans' education benefits, financial aid and every other veterans' resource and program.  The VET Center is also there for student veterans who have a hard time adjusting to being back in school after they have been deployed. The center serves as a safe haven for the veterans to talk things out and get help with problems only another veteran can understand. A veterans' club regularly meets at the VET Center to provide support and camaraderie for the folks they see as family--other vets.  Clackamas Community College also pays the VET Center staff to train college staff and faculty about issues that confront student veterans so they are ready when called upon to help. This helps create a tremendously supportive environment campuswide.  Through the VET Center, Clackamas Community College works to eliminate obstacles in the admissions process while making every effort to help veterans earn education credit for their military service and experience.  Clackamas Community College also recently joined with the Army Reserves to open an Army Strong Community Center--ASCC--on campus. This center, which connects military members and their families with support resources in the community, is the first ASCC west of the Mississippi River.  But Clackamas Community College does even more. As a leader in its community, it continues its veterans' outreach outside the campus boundaries. When nearly 1,500 Oregon National Guard soldiers were deployed to Iraq, the college sponsored two Oregon National Guard family reunions to support the families of deployed 41st Brigade soldiers. The college also hosted two yellow-ribbon reintegration events that touched the lives of more than 3,800 soldiers and their families.  When the college hosted a veterans job fair last year, they went above and beyond the call of duty to host the largest single veterans' job fair in the State. The college found room for 104 employers that were eager to hire veterans, 106 veterans' services providers and more than 3,100 veterans. The logistics were incredible, and they handled them with ease, even providing lunch and entertainment for the veterans' families while the veterans job-hunted.  In recognition of their ongoing efforts, Clackamas Community College was one of 20 colleges and universities to receive a $100,000 grant to serve military veterans from the Wal-Mart Foundation and the American Council on Education. Clackamas Community College used the funds to further their efforts to help veterans transition from military service to college.  As an Oregonian and as their Senator, I could not be more proud of Clackamas Community College, its president, Joanne Truesdell, and the heroes they serve. Our citizen soldiers answer the call of our country every day, and Clackamas Community College returns the favor when they come home. It is my honor to thank them for their support of Oregon's veterans.                          ____________________
