 In 1915, 6 years after Daniel Burnham unveiled his visionary plan for the city of Chicago, Norman Harris and his son Albert recognized how much could be achieved by combining the philanthropy of business and community leaders who cared deeply about the future of Chicago. They founded The Chicago Community Trust. As brilliant as Burnham's plan was, Norman and Albert Harris understood that it takes more than steel, glass, and concrete to make a great city. A great city needs healthy, hopeful people, good schools, culture, and arts--all things that the trust has helped nurture for 100 years.  Whether its economic opportunity, education, housing, conservation, or health care--the list of important causes in which the Chicago Community Trust is involved is remarkable. Since its founding, the trust has granted more than $2 billion to nonprofit organizations working to improve the quality of life in the community. The trust has helped develop new audiences to sustain arts organizations, protected the human services safety net for those hardest hit by economic challenges, eased the devastating effects of foreclosures in Chicago neighborhoods, andelevated teaching to meet world-class standards.  In the wake of the worst recession since the Great Depression, the trust stepped up and distributed $11.4 million in Unity Challenge grants to meet the needs of Chicago's most vulnerable citizens. The grants supplied food to more than 800 soup kitchens and food pantries. The trust helped expand capacity at homeless shelters and bought winter coats for children. The trust put money in community health centers and helped seniors pay for their prescription medications. The recession was hard on Chicago, but the business and community leaders at the Chicago Community Trust made sure that the community took care of its own.  This month, the trust is launching its centennial campaign, starting with the return of ``On the Table,'' a forum that brings together thousands of Chicago residents to share a meal and talk about how they can work together to make the community stronger, safer, and more dynamic. Last year, nearly 12,000 people participated from every Chicago neighborhood and 11 neighboring counties. This year, the trust is expecting to at least double the number of people participating.  I congratulate the Chicago Community Trust on 100 years strengthening the community. Thank you for all you have done and continue to do to make Chicago a great and caring community.                          ____________________
