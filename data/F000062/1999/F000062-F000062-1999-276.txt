 President, if I may then discuss what is in the division of the question. When we passed the assault weapons legislation in 1994, there was a grandfather clause which permitted the continued importation of shipments of clips, drums and strips of large size, large size being defined here by more than 10 bullets.  In the legislation passed in 1994, the domestic manufacture of these same clips and the sale of these same clips and the possession of these same clips was made illegal. The loophole is permitting the importation of foreign clips while we close off the manufacture of them domestically, the sale of the domestic clip. These new clips, manufactured after the ban, the fact of the matter is, are coming in.  I submitted for the record BATF statistics that in 6 months 8.6 million clips are approved for entry from 20 different countries, many of them as big as 250 rounds, 90 rounds, 70 rounds, 50 rounds, by the hundreds of thousands. We are trying to cut off that loophole.
