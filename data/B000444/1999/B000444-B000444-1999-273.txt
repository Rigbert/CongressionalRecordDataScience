 President, I want to say a few words today about a man who is one of America's finest civil servants and a man who I am proud to call a friend, Jim Kallstrom.  Jim Kallstrom had an illustrious career with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (``FBI''), one in which he played a major role in building up the Bureau's counter-terrorism capabilities. Jim Kallstrom led the successful FBI investigations into the World Trade Center bombing and the intended bombing of the Lincoln Tunnel. Those investigations broke the back of one of the most violent terrorist groups everto operate in this country. Their speedy conclusion also did much to reassure the American public in the wake of the World Trade Center bombing, and they sent a message to terrorists around the world that no person or group can expect to get away with terrorist actions in the United States.  Assistant FBI Director for the New York Metropolitan Area, Jim Kallstrom led the Bureau's largest field office. He supervised agents handling many of the FBI's most sensitive criminal, counterintelligence and counterterrorist cases. He was, and is, a vigorous investigator--truly a cop's cop--and an effective administrator.  One of Jim Kallstrom's best known accomplishments--and his most controversial role--was his direction of the investigation of the TWA Flight 800 explosion of July 17, 1996. My colleagues will remember that 230 people died in that crash and that there was immediate and great suspicion that this was the result of a terrorist or criminal act. There was also a recurrent allegation that the U.S. armed forces had accidentally shot down the aircraft and were trying to cover up their role. That allegation was utterly false, but it acquired a life of its own despite the facts. It was, in fact, one of the first cases of a rumor spread and perpetuated by the Internet.  In the initial days of this case--as the desperate search for any survivors turned into a continuing and heroic mission to retrieve and identify the hundreds of bodies, and as a raft of local and federal agencies converged to handle a multitude of tasks--Jim Kallstrom stepped in and imposed order on the incipient chaos. Over the coming weeks and months, it was the determination and competence of Jim Kallstrom that reassured the American people and gave us all confidence that no stone would be left unturned in the search for any criminal evidence.  In recent weeks, one of my colleagues has raised the possibility that Jim Kallstrom, in the course of pursuing his counterterrorist investigation to the fullest, may have delayed or tried to delay the transmission to the National Transportation Safety Board of a report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (``BATF'') that concluded that the TWA Flight 800 explosion appeared to be caused by a mechanical flaw in the center fuel tank.  Mr. Kallstrom denies that allegation. He insists that he forwarded the BATF report to the National Transportation Safety Board within a few days of receiving it. He admits that he was angry that BATF would issue its conclusions while the counterterrorist and criminal investigation was still ongoing.  I do not know whether Mr. Kallstrom delayed transmission of the BATF report, although I note that two FBI officials testified that he did not. What I do know is that Mr. Kallstrom was performing most admirably in a situation fraught with challenges.  Let me emphasize those challenges. Millions of Americans drew the initial conclusion that this explosion was caused either by a bomb or by a missile. There was an urgent need not only to conduct a thorough investigation into that possibility, but also to demonstrate to the American people that the United States Government was doing everything humanly possible to bring any perpetrators to justice, while still doing anything humanely possible to meet the needs of hundreds of bereaved families and showing proper respect for the dead.  This was no easy task, and no small one, either. Jim Kallstrom assumed those duties and brought the TWA Flight 800 investigation to a successful conclusion. I say ``successful'' very purposely, for the investigation did not fail to uncover any terrorist or criminal act. Rather, it eliminated those possibilities and gave the American people confidence that the explosion was instead a tragic accident.  Some have expressed concern that the FBI might have unwittingly delayed necessary action to correct safety flaws in U.S. commercial aircraft. I understand this concern and I would agree that recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board have not been given sufficient attention by the Federal Aviation Administration. But safety board officials apparently reached the same conclusion as BATF weeks earlier, and they reportedly do not believe that any delay in receiving the BATF report hindered their ability to persuade the FAA to take corrective action.  Some people feel that the FBI was too determined to find evidence of a terrorist or criminal act. I don't doubt for a moment that some investigators found Jim Kallstrom rather intimidating in his determination to find any such evidence. The bad news is that Jim Kallstrom is sometimes intimidating. The good news is also that Jim Kallstrom is sometimes intimidating. He gets the job done. He also projects confidence and determination. That is what was needed of the head of the FBI's New York office, and that is what was needed by the head of the TWA Flight 800 investigation.  I am sorry if some investigators felt that Jim Kallstrom stepped on their toes. But I am happy as can be that he was the man to whom our nation turned when a conspicuously thorough investigation was needed--so as to catch and convict the murderers if there were any, and otherwise to give us complete confidence that the Flight 800 explosion was truly an accident. Jim Kallstrom accomplished that feat, and we are all in his debt for his tremendous service to his country.                          ____________________
