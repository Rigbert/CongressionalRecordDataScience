Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  We have heard some extraordinary things from the other side. The people who are one day for States' rights today want to preempt it. The people who are for individual decisions want to preempt them. The people who want to sanctify the physician-patient relationship want to put a Drug Enforcement Administration agent in the room with the physician and the patient while they are making these critical decisions. They have talked about the word execute, euthanasia.  Look at the Oregon law. It is something where a physician can only prescribe after there are two diagnoses, apsychological consultation, the person willingly asks, they have acceded in writing, they have informed their next of kin, there has been a waiting period and the person must self-administer. That is the key. It is not euthanasia. It is not physician-assisted suicide. They write a humane prescription for a person who is dying a horrible, horrible death and who might want relief.  What has happened in Oregon? Fewer people have taken their lives with guns and other things because they just knew it was there if they needed it. They want to turn back the clock to the bad old days when my father is dying and I said, can he not have more pain medication, the doctor said, no, it might depress his breathing. In one line in the bill, they give the doctor that authority. But they take it away five lines later where they say if the doctor intentionally depresses that person's breathing.                              {time}  1245  Who knows? How are we going to determine intent? Are the drug enforcement administration the best people to determine one's physician's intent and chill their desire to give relief from intractable pain? I would say no, and I do not think on any other day of the week the Republican party would advocate having the Drug Enforcement Administration involved in our personal legal lives.
