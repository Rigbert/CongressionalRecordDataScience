President, I know the two Senators from Michigan support both these nominees. They both returned positive blue slips, which is one of the reasons they are moving so quickly.  As to when the time arrives that the leader wishes to begin the votes, I ask unanimous consent that at that time the time on this side of the aisle be yielded back, whether I am on the floor or not.
