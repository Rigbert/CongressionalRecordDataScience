 I do have a question, and it stems from some of the comments I have received from the Chief of Police in the State of Rhode Island, Colonel Steven O'Donnell, a skilled professional. What Colonel O'Donnell said--and it goes to one of the issues that Senator Whitehouse discussed, the access to high-capacity magazines for these assault weapons. Colonel O'Donnell said:       I've yet to hear a viable argument for high capacity      magazines, what the purpose is. I have friends that are      hunters. They use high capacity weapons, but not magazines.      They use several rounds to hunt, but they don't need 15, 30,      and 45 round clips to hunt an animal.  Is that some of the responses you are getting from some of your law enforcement professionals who deal every day with firearms?
