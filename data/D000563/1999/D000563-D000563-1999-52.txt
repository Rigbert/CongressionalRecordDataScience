Frist, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Mack, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Thurmond) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 225       Whereas traditionally, Thanksgiving is a time for families      to take time out of their busy lives to come together and to      give thanks for the many blessings in their lives;       Whereas approximately 21,000 men, women, and children in      the United States are given the gift of life each year      through transplantation surgery, made possible by the      generosity of organ and tissue donations;       Whereas more than 66,000 Americans are awaiting their      chance to prolong their lives by finding a matching donor;       Whereas nearly 5,000 of these patients each year (or 13      patients each day) die while waiting for a donated heart,      liver, kidney, or other organ;       Whereas nationwide there are up to 15,000 potential donors      annually, but families' consent to donation is received for      less than 6,000;       Whereas the need for organ donations greatly exceeds the      supply available;       Whereas designation as an organ donor on a driver's license      or voter's registration is a valuable step, but does not      ensure donation when an occasion arises;       Whereas the demand for transplantation will likely increase      in the coming years due to the growing safety of      transplantation surgery due to improvements in technology and      drug developments, prolonged life expectancy, and increased      prevalence of diseases that may lead to organ damage and      failure, including hypertension, alcoholism, and hepatitis C      infection;       Whereas the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a      variety of racial and ethnic minorities, will continue to      grow in the coming years;       Whereas the final decision on whether a potential donor can      share the gift of life usually is made by surviving family      members regardless of the patient's initial intent;       Whereas many Americans have indicated a willingness to      donate their organs and tissues but have not discussed this      critical matter with the family members who are most likely      to make the decision, if the occasion arises, as to whether      that person will be an organ and tissue donor;       Whereas some family members may be reluctant to give      consent to donate their deceased loved one's organs and      tissues at a very difficult and emotional time if that person      has not clearly expressed a desire or willingness to do so;       Whereas the vast majority of Americans are likely to spend      part of Thanksgiving Day with some of those family members      who would be approached to make such a decision; and       Whereas it is fitting for families to spend a portion of      that day discussing how they might give life to others on a      day devoted to giving thanks for their own blessings: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate designates November 23, 2000,      Thanksgiving Day, as a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' and      to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family     members so that informed decisions can be made if the      occasion to donate arises.
