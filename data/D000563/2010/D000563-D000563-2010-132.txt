President, I see the minority leader, Senator McConnell, is on the floor. I will make a unanimous consent request, but I want to make certain he has his opportunity to speak.  So I would ask unanimous consent that after Senator McConnell has completed his remarks, I be given 10 minutes to speak, and an equal amount of time offered to the Republican side of the aisle, before the first rollcall vote.
