 President, I rise today to honor a number of American heroes. During World War Two, over 6,300 sailors and Marines were members of the crew of the Battleship U.S.S. Alabama. The ship and crew were instrumental in the defeat of both Germany and Japan. The crew was credited with the downing of 22 enemy aircraft and was awarded numerous citations and medals including the European-African-Middle Eastern Medal and the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with nine battle stars.  This week, the U.S.S. Alabama Crewman's Association is holding its annual reunion at Battleship Memorial Park in Mobile, Alabama. I ask the Senate to pass this Joint Resolution which commends and recognizes the gallant crewmen of the U.S.S. Alabama. To those men I say congratulations and thank you for a job well done.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 18       Whereas the members of the crew of the battleship U.S.S.      Alabama (BB-60) during World War II were a courageous group      who braved both Arctic chill and Pacific heat to help defend      our great country against enemy oppression;       Whereas the U.S.S. Alabama crewed by those men was awarded      nine battle stars and shot down 22 enemy aircraft; and       Whereas the U.S.S. Alabama Crewmen's Association is holding      its annual reunion on April 15 to 18, 1999: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. COMMENDATION AND RECOGNITION OF CREWMEN OF THE                    U.S.S. ALABAMA.       The United States honors the 6,300 persons who were members      of the U.S.S. Alabama's crew during World War II, commends      and thanks them for their sacrifice and service in the      defense of the United States, and recognizes those among them      who are assembling April 15 to 18, 1999, as the U.S.S.      Alabama Crewmen's Association on the occasion of the      association's 1999 annual reunion.                          ____________________
