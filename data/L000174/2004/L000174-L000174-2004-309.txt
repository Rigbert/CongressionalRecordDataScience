Low power stations serve their communities with broadcasting that reflects local needs and local preferences. In this way, low power FM offers a valuable counterpoint to nationwide media consolidation. For this reason, I have been a strong supporter of low power FM for many years now. In fact, I recently urged FCC Chairman Powell to expedite licensing for new low power stations.  Unfortunately, for many years now, the number of low power FM stations the FCC could license has been limited by unrealistic and unnecessary rules requiring these small stations to find available frequencies far from any full power broadcaster. Interference must be avoided if we are to make use of the airwaves. The current rules, however, go beyond what is necessary to protect full power stations from interference, and instead protect them from competition. The focus of today's legislation is the so-called ``third-adjacent rule,'' which requires that a low power station not broadcast within three frequency intervals of a full power station.  For example, if a full power station were broadcasting at 101.1, the first-adjacent frequencies would be 99.9 and 101.3 and those would be unavailable for broadcasting. The second-adjacent frequencies would be 99.7 and 101.5 and they too would be off-limits. Finally, the third-adjacent frequencies would be 99.5 and 101.7, and under the current rule, those frequencies would also be unavailable. Thus, the existence of just one full power station effectively keeps low power radio from broadcasting anywhere between 99.5 and 101.7. It is easy to see how a radio dial can quickly become off-limits for any low power broadcaster.  A recent study by the FCC concludes that this third-adjacent rule is not necessary to protect full power broadcasters from unreasonable interference. Our new bill simply implements those findings and conclusions. It eliminates the third-adjacent rule, and allows the FCC to license low power stations in accordance with its own studies and findings about potential interference from these stations.  Of course, the need for low power FM radio must be balanced against other important uses of nearby frequencies. I have worked hard to protect reading services for the blind, and this bill protects those services by retaining the third-adjacent rule where such services would be affected. In addition, this bill protects commercial broadcasters of all sizes from actual interference by leaving intact the FCC's expedited interference claim review procedures.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this important bill forward, to strengthen local broadcasting.                          ____________________
