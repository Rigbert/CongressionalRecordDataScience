Bernice Metzger, Michigan's Outstanding Older Worker for 2008.  Bernice is 74 years old, but has never let her age stop her from contributing to her community. Twenty years ago, at an age where most workers are eyeing retirement, Bernice embarked on a new career as a clerk at St. Joseph County Courthouse. As if that wasn't enough, she also works in the Treasurer's Office, the Register of Deeds, Probate Office, Circuit Court Judge's Office, Animal Control, Land Resource, and the Michigan State University Extension, and also serves as Deputy Clerk for Nottawa Township.  In addition to her professional duties, Bernice also finds time to volunteer with the Lions Club and the VFW of Sturgis, and has been recognized as a member of the Eastern Star. A mother of four, with four grandchildren and three great grandchildren, Bernice is a devoted mother, grandmother, and family woman. Her dedication to her family and her exemplary and outstanding service to St. Joseph County has made her an example of inspiration to her coworkers and friends.  I would like to extend my congratulations to Mrs. Bernice Metzger for all of her hard work and selflessness, which has made her Michigan's Outstanding Older Worker for 2008.                          ____________________
