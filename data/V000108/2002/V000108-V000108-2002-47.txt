Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to recognize and commend the members of the Gary, Indiana, branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). On Friday, May 3, 2002, the Gary NAACP will hold its 39th Annual Life Membership Banquet and Scholarship Dinner at the St. Timothy Community Church in Gary, Indiana.  This annual event is a major fundraiser for the Gary branch of the NAACP. The funds generated through this activity, and others like it, go directly to the organization's needed programs and advocacy efforts. In addition, the dinner serves to update and keep the community aware of the activities, accomplishments, and accolades of the local and national chapters of the NAACP on an annual basis.  The featured speaker at this gala event will be Ms. Janette Wilson, Director of Community Intervention and Human Relations for the Chicago Public School System. She has worked diligently to develop partnerships with local schools and public agencies. This network provides mentoring programs, community service programs and assistance with after-school homework centers.  This year, the Gary NAACP will honor seven outstanding community leaders for their lifelong efforts to further equality in society, as well as one sorority. Joining more than four hundred outstanding civil, community, and religious leaders of the region, the following distinguished individuals will be inducted as life members of the Gary NAACP: Larry Pruitt, Willie Watkins, Mary Dennis, Hollis Hite, George Tardy, Barbara Bolling, and Cheron Reed. Additionally, the Sigma Phi Omega Chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., will be inducted.  The Gary NAACP was organized in 1915 by a group of residents that felt there was a need for an organization that would monitor and defend the rights of African-Americans in Northwest Indiana. The organization focuses on providing better and more positive ways of addressing the important issues facing minorities in social and job-related settings. Along with its national organization, the Gary branch of the NAACP serves its community by combating injustice, discrimination, and unfair treatment in our society.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the new life members, as well as the other members of the Gary NAACP for the efforts, activities, and leadership that these outstanding men and women have championed to improve the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
