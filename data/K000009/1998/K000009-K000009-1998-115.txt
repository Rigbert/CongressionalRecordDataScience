Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge The Neighborhood Improvement Foundation of Toledo, Inc., commonly referred to NIFTI, on its recent selection as a Citationist for the 1998 President's Service Awards. Awarded from a pool of approximately 3,600 nominations, NIFTI was one of thirty chosen for this prestigious recognition.  Organized in 1957, NIFTI's mission over the past 41 years has been to improve the quality of life in the Toledo metropolitan area through cleanup, beautification efforts, and by encouraging environmental awareness. NIFTI's role as a community organizer and activist has provided Toledo residents with a voice along with a viable means to eliminate urban blight, making our city a cleaner and safer place to live and work.  NIFTI volunteers, numbering in the thousands, are a collaboration of concerned individuals, corporations, local government and other community organizations. NIFTI, through its various programs, encourages volunteerism in both the adult and youth populations. In addition, NIFTI has effectively promoted neighborhood responsibility in the central city.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to thank NIFTI for all of its positive contributions to the city of Toledo. NIFTI's efforts toward solving serious social ills are representative of the spirit of community service that has made our nation and my congressional district a better place to live. To the Neighborhood Improvement Foundation of Toledo, Inc., congratulations on being named a recipient of such a noble award.                          ____________________
