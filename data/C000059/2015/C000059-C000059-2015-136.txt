Chairman, Mr. Jenkins included the language in the full committee bill that, I think, came to a reasonable compromise. As the gentleman is aware, many communities cannot reach the old standard, the 2008 standard, that is now the law, and so this just gives the communities throughout the country that cannot get to attainment additional time to develop the technologies before we go to a new standard.  I would remind the gentleman that it was just last April that we came to a determination on the 2008 standard, and the administration already is talking about a new standard that most of the Nation cannot reach in the short term. So this gives a brief, little bit of time to allow these communities to improve their technologies and to be able to meet a new standard down the road.  So I would oppose the gentleman's amendment and support the underlying bill.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
