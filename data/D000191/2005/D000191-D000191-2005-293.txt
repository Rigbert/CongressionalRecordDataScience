Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I would just address a question to the gentleman. You say they are already covered. Well, if someone rents a car in a State that has 10/20 insurance, $10,000/$20,000, and they drive next door to a State that has $100,000/$300,000 and they have an accident, I guess you only get 10/20. So youare saying it only affects these States. It would affect all States, if you remove this liability as they cross State lines.  Mr. Chairman, I would yield on the gentleman's own time to answer that question, if he would.
