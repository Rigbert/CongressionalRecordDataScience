 President, I am very much aware of Senator Miller's interest in this provision. As you know, the Finance Committee has supported his provision by including it in two separate pieces of legislation that our committee considered this year. We had hoped to include it in this bill, even if the corporate shelter language was not included. Unfortunately, this measure has a negligible revenue effect and could possibly violate the Byrd rule. Accordingly, we were obliged to remove it from the bill. I give Senator Miller my commitment, however, that we will continue to work with him on opportunities to get this amendment enacted into law this year. I would also add that I discussed this provision with Mr. Thomas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and his staff, and they indicated a willingness to examine and explore the measure in conferences on future bills.
