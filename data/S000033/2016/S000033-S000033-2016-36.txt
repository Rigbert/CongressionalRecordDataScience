 Enzi and join him in commending Mr. Weiner for his many years of dedicated and outstanding service to CBO, the Congress, and the American people. Through his diligence and hard work, he has more than earned additional time for biking, training for the annual Washington Post hunt, and most importantly, for his family--his wife, Joan, and his sons, Kevin, Daniel, and Eric.  We hope our colleagues will join us in thanking Mr. Weiner for his service.                          ____________________
