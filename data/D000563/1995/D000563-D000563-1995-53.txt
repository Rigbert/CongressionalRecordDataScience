Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in voting against this rule. Let me say why I am urging Members to vote against this rule.  At issue in this bill is the policy of the United States of America toward the country of Azerbaijan. This is not a well-known country in the United States. It is well known to Armenian-Americans. Armenian-Americans are aware of the fact that the country of Azerbaijan has established a blockade on Armenia for 4 years. As a direct result of this blockade, Armenia has lost 20 percent of its population because of the severe hardships which have been caused.  The House of Representatives debated this issue several months ago and decided the United States should continue its policy of admonishing Azerbaijan for this blockade. By a voice vote we made it clear that we do not want to change this policy. The Senate did not raise this issue at all. Yet in the darkness of conference, along comes the effort to provide governmental assistance to Azerbaijan despite this blockade. This is wrong.  It is wrong for the United States to provide assistance to Azerbaijan so long as they blockade Armenia. At issue here is more than just whether this bill will pass. At issue are the human rights of the people of Armenia which have been trampled on so many times in this century. We have a chance by defeating this rule to send it back to the Committee on Rules and tell them we want a separate vote on this disgraceful amendment.  We have spoken on this once in the House of Representatives. We must speak on it again today, and the only chance we have is by defeating this rule. Join me in defeating this rule and making it clear that we object to the Azerbaijani blockade of Armenia.
