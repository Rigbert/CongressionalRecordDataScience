Chair, I thank the gentleman so much for coming to the floor tonight, and I want to thank all of our colleagues who have spoken out so eloquently on the importance of National Ocean Policy in supporting the Pingree, et al. amendment.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
