President, I have already indicated I want to make sure the compromise we voted on yesterday does not unravel. I will support the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico because I believe it will allow us to go forward and make sure the work that the bipartisan group did is not in vain.  The bottom line is very simple: To get the money to put the fires out, fire suppression, you have to go out and steal from every single Forest Service program around and then hope that at some point down the road you are going to get repaid. It makes a mockery out of any effort to responsibly budget in this area. In our part of the world, we see, in effect, funds robbed from nonprofit organizations such as Wallowa Resources, a small nonprofit in eastern Oregon.  My only concern about putting this off is that if we don't deal with this issue now, the question is, When will we deal with it? This is an extraordinarily important question. It will not, in my view, unravel the compromise which I will fight like crazy to protect, despite the fact that I think what the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Idaho have said has considerable validity as well.  I hope we will support this amendment and then figure out in the course of the afternoon some way in which we can find some common ground on this issue. Today the process of just stealing from every program around to fight fires really becomes almost farcical. The Bingaman amendment responds to that. I hope my colleagues will support it.
