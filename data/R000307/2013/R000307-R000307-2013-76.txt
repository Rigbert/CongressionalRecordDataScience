President, I rise today, in support of Senator Paul's filibuster on the nomination of John Owen Brennan, to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I have stated my opposition to Brennan's nomination from the beginning.  During my time on the Intelligence Committee and as chairman, I presided over hearings before which Mr. Brennan testified.  His inability to give a straight yes or no answer was greater than any other witness I experienced. But his approach is exactly what we see from the Obama administration today.  Senator Paul has asked a very simple question to which the President refuses to give a direct answer. The appropriate question is: Will the administration clarify any circumstance when it is acceptable to target and kill American citizens on American soil?  Senator Paul is only asking for a clear, unwavering statement that protects Americans' fifth Amendment rights as well as our national security. All Americans await the answer.  The Senate's duty is to conduct oversight and ensure our government is protecting its people and the Constitution. In that regard Senator Paul's filibuster has been true to our oversight, obligations and duties; and I congratulate him.
