 President, today I would like to honor SPC Travis Vaughn, who died on February 18, 2007, in a helicopter crash while fighting in Afghanistan. A Cedar Falls, IA, native, Travis served proudly and with distinction during Operation Enduring Freedom.  With bravery and valor, Travis accepted the call to defend America against those who seek to undermine our values, our democracy, and our way of life. In Afghanistan, he and others from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment out of Fort Campbell, KY, served their country in a dangerous part of the world, helping to make the rest of the world a safer place. Sadly, Travis's service to his country cost him his life, forever earning him the gratitude of the American people.  Travis is remembered fondly and will be greatly missed. A longtime friend of Travis recently said of him, ``He was always there to help anybody that he could and do whatever he could to make people happy.'' Still other friends recalled Travis's fondness for adventurous recreational activities. These qualities made Travis well-suited for military service, and certainly we were fortunate to have a man of such drive and ability serving in the U.S. Army.  On behalf of all Iowans and people throughout this country, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Travis Vaughn's friends and family. In particular, my thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Heather, his stepson Taylin, his father Brad, and mother Christine. They should know that the entire Nation stands behind them during this time of mourning. His loss isindeed tragic, but he will be remembered as a hero and a patriot.                          ____________________
