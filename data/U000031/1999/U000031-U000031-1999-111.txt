Speaker, I rise today to join my colleague Rep. Ed Towns in introducing the ``Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act.'' I am also pleasedto note that Rep. Bilirakis, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, which has jurisdiction, is an original cosponsor of this bipartisan bill.  Poison control centers provide vital, very cost-effective services to the American public. Each year, more than 2 million poisonings are reported to poison control centers throughout the United States. More than 90 percent of these poisonings occur in the home, and over 50 percent of poisoning victims are children under the age of 6. For every dollar spent on poison control center services, seven dollars in medical costs are saved.  In spite of their obvious value, poison control centers are in jeopardy. Historically, these centers were typically funded by the private and public sector hospitals where they were located. The transition to managed care, however, has resulted in a gradual erosion of this funding. As this funding source has been drying up, poison control centers have only partially been able to replace this support by cobbling together state, local, and private funding sources. The financial squeeze has forced many centers to curtail their poison prevention advisory services and their information and emergency activities, and to reduce the number of nurses, pharmacists, and physicians answering the emergency telephones. Currently, there are 73 centers. In 1978, there were 661.  The ``Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act'' will provide up to $28 million per year over the next five years to provide a stable source of funding for these centers, establish a national toll-free poison control hotline, and improve public education on poisoning prevention and poison center services. The legislation is designed to ensure that these funds supplement--not supplant--other funding that the centers may be receiving and provides the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the authority to impose a matching requirement. Further, to receive federal funding, a center will have to be certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or an organization expert in the field of poison control designated by the Secretary.  I encourage my colleagues to support this very cost-effective investment in the safety and health of the American public, especially our children. If you would like further information or would like to cosponsor this legislation, please let me know or call Jane Williams of my staff at 5-3761.                          ____________________
