The Clerk read as follows:       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the      following:       Sec. __.  None of the funds in this Act may be available      for the purchase by the Department of Defense (and its      departments and agencies) of welded shipboard anchor and      mooring chain 4 inches in diameter and under unless the      anchor and mooring chain are procured from a manufacturer      that is part of the national technology and industrial base.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 223, the gentlewoman from Washington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a simple and straightforward amendment to this year's Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.  Every year since 1991, Congress has included a provision in the Department of Defense Appropriations bill to require that military agencies purchase anchor and mooring chain from American manufacturers.                              {time}  0030  My amendment simply clarifies that this requirement also applies to anchor and mooring chain purchased by the Army Corps of Engineers. Everyone in this Chamber can agree that taxpayer dollars should be used to buy goods manufactured right here at home whenever possible.  While our economy continues to recover, it is imperative that we protect and support Americans' production capabilities. Doing so not only supports employment opportunities for Americans, but also reinforces our national security.  Both Congress and the Pentagon have long recognized the importance of maintaining a strong industrial baseright here in America. While I understand that we must balance our procurement needs with shrinking budgets, we should not be putting foreign workers ahead of Americans.  My amendment is a commonsense way to protect a critical production capability, support our manufacturing industry, and put American workers first. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene).  The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar
