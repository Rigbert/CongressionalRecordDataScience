Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Remember, Mr. Chairman, the Pentagon asked for $2.9 billion. They asked for full funding plus an increase of 1 percent over inflation for BMD. They got it. They have gotten an increase from $1.65 billion to $2.18 billion in theater missile defense and a 65-percent increase for other TMD programs. They have gotten all they ask for and more. Now the committee wants to add on top of that.  This is not needed, according to the Pentagon. We say it is needed to feed the troops and their families. We can prove that by the 15,000 families receiving food stamps. That is a scandal. That is a readiness problem. We should be dealing with that and get our priorities straight.
