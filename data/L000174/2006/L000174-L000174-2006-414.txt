President, I ask unanimous consent that before I am recognized--the Senator from Texas still has the floor--before I am recognized and the Senator from Texas is recognized and then the Senator from Illinois is recognized and then the Senator from Idaho is recognized, that 10 minutes be divided between the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Minnesota.  Will that give Senator Lott and Senator Dayton enough time?
