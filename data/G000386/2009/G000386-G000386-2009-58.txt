 President, I come to the floor at this point to give some breadth to a statement that was made on the floor earlier today. It was made by my friend, Senator Baucus. I don't take offense to what he said because I sensed a great deal of frustration in his statement. I will read what he said so you know what I am reacting to. The reason I don't take offense to what he said is because he and I have worked so closely together over 10 years, with one or the other of us being chairman of the Finance Committee, that we have such an understanding of each other.  Just prior to the remarks I am going to read, he had spoken positively about Senator Enzi and me. So I want my colleagues to know this statement is not made out of anger that I am going to give a rebuttal to.       Well, we kept working bipartisan--working together, for      days and days, hours and hours, and then, fortunately, Mr.      President, it got to the point where I'm just calling it as I      see it. I can't--I--one of my feelings is I'm too honest      about things. And it's--the Republicans started to walk away.      They pulled away from the table. They had to leave.       I ask you why? Why did that happen? And the answer is, to      be totally fair and above board, is--and above board, is      because their leadership asked them to. Their leadership      asked them to become disengaged from the process. I know that      to be a fact. Why did their leadership ask Republicans to      leave and become disengaged from the process? To be totally      candid, they wanted to score political points by just      attacking this bill. They were not here to help--help be      constructive, to find bipartisan solutions. They were for a      while, then when the rubber started to meet the road and it      came time to try to make some decisions, they left and began      to attack--and began to attack.  I wish to take a few minutes to respond to these remarks that I read. It was asserted, through these remarks on the floor, that some Republicans in the so-called Gang of 6 were directed by the Senate Republican leadership to cease participating in bipartisan talks. The Gang of 6 referred to the six bipartisan members of the Senate Finance Committee. On the Democratic side, the members were my friends, three chairmen, including Senator Baucus, Budget Committee chairman; Senator Conrad; and Energy Committee chairman, Senator Bingaman. All are senior members of the Democratic Caucus. On the Republican side, the three members included Senator Snowe, ranking member of the Small Business Committee; Senator Enzi, ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee; and this Senator. Senators Snowe and Enzi are senior Members of the Republican caucus.  Chairman Baucus convened this working group with a singular goal of a bipartisan health care reform bill. We met for several weeks up in the Montana Room of Chairman Baucus's office. I would agree with the way participating Members have described these discussions. They were well informed, thoughtful, provocative, challenging, and frustrating all at the same time. But I would say that in the months we negotiated, there was never once that anyone walked away from the table. There was never once that there were any harsh words.  While we were engaged in those discussions, there was constant pressure from folks outside the room for us to reach a quick deal. That pressure came from the White House, it came from the Democratic leadership, it came from advocacy groups outside, and it came from many media folks covering the day-by-day meetings. To be fair, the Senate Republican leadership was very concerned about some of the directions the policy discussions were taking in the Gang of 6. That concern grew, particularly after the very partisan HELP Committee markup occurred. Senator Hatch left the original Gang of 7 because of the character and result of the HELP Committee markup.  Most important, the Senate Republican leadership was concerned that a bipartisan Finance Committee bill would be co-opted into a partisan floor bill, when the Democratic leadership merged the bills. Senators Snowe, Enzi, and I anticipated that concern.  To be fair to Senator Baucus, as he was negotiating with us, he tried to convince us that we would be very much a part of those merging of the bills. He offered that in good faith. I believe him. I even believe him today saying that. But seeing how neither the HELP Committee nor the Finance Committee was as involved as they should have been in what Senator Reidput together in this 2,074-page bill, I wonder whether Senator Baucus could have, if we had a bipartisan agreement, actually carried out that guarantee.  From the get-go, we Republican members of the Gang of 6, to make sure we were a part of the process that I described, as Senator Baucus told us we would be, asked for assurances from the White House and from the Senate Democratic leadership on the next step in the legislative process, if we, in fact, did arrive at a bipartisan agreement.  I also found that many in the broader group of Republicans, who provided the bipartisan glue for the CHIP bill of 2008, had similar concerns. All Republicans had process concerns, such as where would it go once it left the Senate Finance Committee.  We wanted assurances, and here is what we wanted. The assurances requested boiled down to a good-faith promise that the bipartisan Finance Committee health care bill would not morph into a partisan health care reform bill when Majority Leader Reid merged the two committee bills. We wanted to make sure the bipartisan character of a bipartisan Finance Committee bill was going to be retained through these next steps. To do otherwise would be akin to getting on a bus and not knowing where the bus was going or how much the bus ticket would cost. Assurances were also requested with respect to a conference between the House and Senate. The assurances were similar to assurances requested by Senator Reid and made by the then-majority Republican leadership during the period of 2005 and 2006. The Democratic minority leader, at that time, made these assurances a condition to letting major regular order Finance Committee bills even go to conference.  As an example, take a look at the Congressional Record, and you will see the assurances made by then-Majority Leader Frist to then-Minority Leader Reid. These requests were made repeatedly to the Democratic leadership, publicly and privately, about how the postcommittee action of the bipartisan group would be handled in the merger with the HELP Committee bill. It was a focus of a July 8 lunchtime, face-to-face meeting at the majority leader's office, with Senators Reid, Baucus, Conrad, Bingaman, Snowe, Enzi, and myself. The bottom-line response from Senator Reid at that meeting was he needed 60 votes.  I guess, the implication was, despite the fact that the Democratic caucus contained 60 members then and now, Senator Reid didn't think it was possible to secure the votes of all members of his caucus. A restatement of the reality of the Senate rules was not the assurances the three Republican Senators--this one included--sought from Senator Reid.  Senator Reid, himself, recognized the validity of this request in an August 8 Washington Post article. I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 3, 2009] Democrats Find Rallying Points on Health Reform, but Splinters Remain                   (By Shailagh Murray and Paul Kane)       Democrats leave town for the August recess with frayed      nerves and fragile agreements on health-care reform, and a      new bogeyman to fire up their constituents: the insurance      industry.       With the House already gone and the Senate set to clear out      by Friday, the terms of the recess battle are becoming clear.      Republicans will assail the government coverage plan that      Democrats and President Obama are advocating as a recklessly      expensive federal takeover of health care. And Democrats will      counter that GOP opposition represents a de facto endorsement      of insurance industry abuses.       ``We know what we're up against,'' House Speaker Nancy      Pelosi (Calif.) told reporters on Friday. ``Carpet-bombing,      slash and burn, shock and awe--anything you want to say to      describe what the insurance companies will do to hold on to      their special advantage.''       Although Pelosi won a significant victory last week when      the Energy and Commerce Committee approved the House bill,      setting up a floor debate after Labor Day, conservative      Democrats were able to demand that negotiators weaken the      government-plan provision. The uprising, which lasted for      several days, suggested that the public option is growing      increasingly vulnerable even as a consensus forms around      other reform policies.       Republican leaders have pledged to use town halls, ads and      other forums to intensify their assault on the Democratic-led      reform effort. ``I think it's safe to say that, over the      August recess, as more Americans learn more about      [Democrats'] plan, they're likely to have a very, very hot      summer,'' House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio)      said.       In the Senate, a bipartisan coalition of Finance Committee      lawmakers is backing a member-run cooperative model as an      alternative to the public option. But Republicans are      beginning to push back against that cooperative approach,      too.       The latest critic is Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who on      Sunday compared insurance co-ops to Fannie Mae and Freddie      Mac, the government-backed mortgage giants that played      prominent roles in the housing crisis. ``I have not seen a      public option that, in my view, meets the test of what would      really not eventually lead to a government takeover,'' McCain      said on CNN's ``State of the Union.''       Pelosi and other Democrats have countered that Republicans      are seeking to protect a health insurance industry that is      their business ally, not so much from a government insurance      option, but from the broad industry reforms that enjoy public      support, including the elimination of coverage caps and the      practice of denying coverage to those with pre-existing      conditions. The White House also wants to steer the debate      toward insurance reform, as it is easier to digest than      long-term cost control, which is another chief objective.       ``How you regulate the insurance industry is as important      to health-care reform as controlling costs,'' said White      House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. The public plan, he said,      is one of an array of measures intended to change industry      behavior.       As the rhetoric against the industry heated up, the leading      insurance trade group issued a statement Thursday calling for      lawmakers to cool down their criticisms and redouble efforts      toward ``bipartisan health-care reform.'' Robert Zirkelbach,      spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, defended his      industry, saying it had already proposed many of the changes      that Congress is seeking, including those involving pre-     existing conditions and ratings based on health status and      gender.       Despite the sparring, House and Senate Democrats and three      GOP Senate negotiators have reached broad consensus on the      outlines of reform. Lawmakers generally agree that      individuals must be required to buy health insurance, that      Medicaid should be significantly expanded, and that tax      increases, in some form, will be required. The final bill      also could bring about some of the most significant changes      to Medicare since the program was created in 1965.       But the rebellion from fiscal conservatives on the Energy      and Commerce Committee last week served as a political wake-     up call for Democratic leaders. With enough votes on the      panel and on the floor to sink reform legislation, the Blue      Dog Coalition forced Pelosi and Emanuel into concessions that      made the government plan similar to private health insurance,      sparking a new fight with House liberals.       Sensing that the Blue Dogs had dug in for a prolonged      fight, Pelosi and Emanuel gave in to most demands in order to      get the legislation moving again. They essentially decided      that it was better to pick a fight with their liberal flank,      where Pelosi remains popular and where loyalty to Obama is      strongest, particularly in the Congressional Black Caucus.       Despite threats from almost 60 progressive House      Democrats--who outnumber the Blue Dogs--Pelosi defended the      compromise, saying it was similar to one backed by Sen.      Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). Pelosi predicted that the      liberal wing would fall in line because the legislation is so      important to them.       ``Are you asking me, `Are the progressives going to take      down universal, quality, affordable health care for all      Americans?' I don't think so,'' Pelosi told reporters Friday,      breaking into laughter at the question.       Just as troublesome as the internal House divisions is the      burgeoning distrust among House Democrats, their Senate      counterparts and the White House.       Pelosi acknowledged that ``there are concerns'' in her      caucus that the White House, namely their former colleague      Emanuel, takes House Democrats for granted. House lawmakers      are being encouraged to pass the most liberal bill possible,      she said, while the White House works on a bipartisan      compromise with a select group of senators.       ``It's no secret,'' Pelosi said, ``that members sometimes      think: `Why do I always read in the paper that they're      checking with the Finance Committee all the time? What does      that mean, that they just want to know what's happened with      the Finance Committee? What about the [Senate health]      committee? What about our committees over here?' ''       The six Senate Finance Committee negotiators have burrowed      in for another six weeks of talks, having set a Sept. 15      deadline for producing a bill. The group includes an array of      small-state senators with little national prominence who have      proven surprisingly resistant to pressure from their party      leaders and the White House.       Although the House bill and the Senate Health Committee      version have attracted no Republican support, the Senate      Finance Committee coalition includes Sens. Mike Enzi (Wyo.)      and Charles Grassley (Iowa), both Republicans, along with      moderate GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe (Maine). And the lead      Democratic negotiator, Finance Committee     Chairman Max Baucus (Mont.), is a moderate who has broken      with his party on numerous bills co-authored with Grassley.       The closer these negotiators move to striking a deal, the      more fraught the discussions become by issues of trust and      political will. Among Republicans, the pressure is especially      acute. All three GOP senators fear they will be sidelined      once the bill is approved at the committee level, with their      names invoked to demonstrate bipartisanship even as they're      left with no say over the final product as it is meshed with      the Senate health panel's version and then ultimately with      the House bill.       For Republicans, a prime concern is that Senate Majority      Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) will abandon the Finance Committee      bill and force legislation to the Senate floor using budget      rules that would protect against a Republican filibuster.      Even advocates concede that the option is highly risky and      that it would vastly limit the policy scope of the bill. For      instance, Senate budget experts say most insurance reforms      would have to be sidelined.       Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Sunday that the      administration would consider all options. ``Ideally, you      want to do this with as broad a base of consensus as      possible,'' he said in an interview on ABC's ``This Week.''      ``But people on the Hill are going to have to make that      choice: Do they want to help shape this and be part of it, or      do they want this country, the United States of America, to      go another several decades [without reform]?''       Reid said he already provided the Republicans with some      assurances, and added, ``I'll do more if necessary.'' He said      of GOP concerns, ``I don't blame them.'' And he added that,      considering the political realities of the Senate, with its      large number of moderate Democrats, health-care reform would      have to gain significant bipartisan support to cross the      finish line.       ``I sure hope we can get a bipartisan bill; it makes it      easier for me to go home,'' moderate Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-     La.) told the Democratic caucus last week, according to Reid.       ``We all feel that way,'' Reid added.
