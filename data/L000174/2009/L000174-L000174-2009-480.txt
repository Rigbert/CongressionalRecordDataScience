I disagree with himon this. I do not believe Mr. Perrelli is a right-to-die advocate or that the positions he represented on behalf of clients was extreme. In fact, all seven justices of the Florida Supreme Court, most appointed by Republican governors, agreed with Mr. Perrelli's argument. They struck down unanimously the law that gave Governor Jeb Bush authority over Ms. Schiavo's medical care.  It is wrong to caricature Mr. Perrelli as a ``right to die'' advocate. Mr. Perrelli did not become involved in the Schiavo litigation to further any personal or political agenda and did not become involved in the litigation when the issue was Ms. Schiavo's wishes. In fact, he did not become involved in the case until after the Florida State courts had fully and finally litigated the question of Ms. Schiavo's wishes and her medical condition. Mr. Perrelli's concern was for an unprecedented challenge to the judicial process. He argued that the Florida Legislature passed a law that imposed one set of rules on Ms. Schiavo and a different set of rules on everyone else in Florida. And he was proven right, when the Florida Supreme Court unanimously struck down the law taking the decisions out of the hands of the family and giving them to the Governor.  I ask unanimous consent that the long list of those who have written to the committee in support of Mr. Perrelli's nomination be printed in the Record.
