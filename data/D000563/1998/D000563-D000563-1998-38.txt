President, today I would like to take a few minutes to talk about a subject of great importance to my home state of Illinois--falling farm prices and the impending economic crisis in Rural America.  Illinois is one of our country's most important agricultural contributors. Illinois farm land, which accounts for about 27 million acres, is considered some of the most productive in the world. More than 76,000 farm families in the state produce corn, soybeans, wheat, beef, pork, dairy products, and specialty crops. Illinois exports more than $3.4 billion worth of agricultural products. The state's agribusiness activity is vibrant. From the Chicago area to Decatur and throughout Illinois, agricultural processing employs thousands of people. And, our researchers, at the University of Illinois as well as at other institutions, continue to help provide answers to some of the most common as well as the most complex agricultural questions we face.  With that said, the current downturn of agricultural prices is very troubling. Not just for Illinois' economy, but for the farm families who work to ensure that the state of Illinois, the country, and the world enjoy the safest and most abundant food supply.  Recently, I had visits in my Washington office from almost every agriculture group in the state. I heard, firsthand, how farm income will fall to $42.5 billion in 1998, 20% lower than 1996 and 43% below the five year average. Meanwhile, total farm debt in 1998 has been estimated at $172 billion, the highest level since 1985. This decline in farm income could lead to massive job loss in the agriculture sector and in agribusiness, not to mention what it will do to our family farms.  Last week, I hosted a roundtable discussion with 15 farmers in Springfield, Illinois to talk about the crisis in rural Illinois and America. It is clear that falling prices, the uncertainty with foreign markets--particularly in Asia and Russia, and poor weather conditions have contributed significantly to a severe economic crisis for our nation's farmers.  I heard stories about low prices. In central Illinois, the price of corn went from $2.22/bu to $1.66/bu between July 17 and August 31, a 21 percent decline over a six week period. During this same period, the price of soybeans went from $6.50/bu to $5.15/bu, also a 21% drop.  To further illustrate the seriousness of this crisis, it is important to look at this drop in commodity prices from a historical perspective. At the Shipman Elevator in Shipman, Illinois, the price of corn on September 18, 1998, was $1.64/bu. On this same date in 1993, the price was $2.17/bu. The price of soybeans at the Shipman Elevator on September 18, 1993 was $6.14/bu compared to the September 18, 1998 price of $5.00.  Livestock prices have also dropped dramatically. The price of hogs at Farmland in Monmouth, Illinois, went from $54/cwt in September 1997 to $39/cwt in March 1998 to $29/cwt on September 18, 1998.  At these prices, I worry that a number of our nation's farmers will not be able to survive. Whether this means leaving farming altogether or simply not being able to make their basic payments, I fear we are facing a serious economic crisis in rural America. And, farmers won't be the only ones impacted by this crisis. In the past several weeks, two of the world's largest agricultural equipment manufactures, Deere and Company, based in Moline, IL, and CASE Corporation, based in Racine, Wisconsin, have announced plans to reduce production and cut jobs. Both companies claim declining farm prices have reduced demand for their equipment. When American agriculture suffers, the effects are widespread, from equipment manufacturers to processors to commodity transporters.  Mr. President, Congress needs to demonstrate strong leadership in the face of this economic crisis. There are some short-term solutions which have already been considered by this chamber--removing the cap on marketing loans and extending their terms, authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to make emergency storage payments to farmers to encourage the use of marketing assistance loans, and replenishing the disaster reserve. Unfortunately, partisanship has gotten in the way of offering rural America a helping hand. This debate is not about the sanctity of the 1996 Farm Bill, it is about giving American agriculture some of the tools needed to improve economic conditions and regain stability.  The Administration, led by Secretary Glickman, has also offered some suggestions on how to address this crisis. They have put forward a $7.1 billion package to aid farmers including $2 billion in emergency disaster assistance. I welcome their proposal and leadership.  In my Springfield meeting I was also told that many farmers won't feel the effects of the current crisis until well after the harvest when the grain bins are full and prices are at all-time lows. And, many of the farm leaders who have appealed to Congress and the Administration for help are concerned that this crisis could stretch into years rather than months. In short, they don't see an end in sight.  Mr. President, Congress is scheduled to adjourn in less than two weeks. Wewon't be able to single-handedly solve this serious economic crisis in rural America before we go home for the year. But, we shouldn't wait to address this important issue and offer some assistance. We should act soon and in a bipartisan fashion. We should explore short-term fixes, like lifting the cap on marketing loans, as well as long-term solutions, like tax fairness and expanded trade opportunities. We should stand up for the men and women in rural America and let them know that Congress and the Administration will work with them to help alleviate some of the economic pain and uncertainty they face.  To do anything less would be a disservice to our farmers and American agriculture.                          ____________________
