Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of an accomplished businessman and civic activist. After 38 years of leadership at the Washington Trust Co. of Westerly, RI, Mr. Potter has chosen to retire. I would like to recognize him for his dedicated service and commend him as a model businessman: Dedicated to company, community, and family.  Joe joined the ``home-town bank'' of South County in 1958 and has presided over the bank's tremendous growth and profitability. While tending to the heavy demands of a successfully growing business, Joe also found the time to become active in both the business community and as a civic leader.  Joe has served as executive vice president and president of The Rhode Island Bankers Association, as well having served as a member of the board of directors of Washington Bancorp, Inc. The Westerly community also benefited greatly from his generous contributions.  In a town proud of its Italian heritage, Joe currently serves as the president of the Permanent Columbus Day Committee, working diligently to make the Columbus Day Parade Westerly's finest processional each year. Additionally, Joe serves as a member of the Board of Governors of Rhode Island Junior Achievement and the Board of Governors for Community Health of Westerly.  From 1968 to 1974 Joe served the community through the State legislature, serving in the Rhode Island House of Representatives. As a public servant, Joe was instrumental in drafting the State Civil Defense Preparedness Act of 1974. He also received the coveted Department of Defense Award, one of the highest awards bestowed upon civilians.  As the Congressman representing Rhode Island's Second District, I am proud to acknowledge an individual who exemplifies true humanitarianism, citizenship, a strong work ethic, and sense of commitment. Joe, your contributions to the State of Rhode Island and the town of Westerly are an inspiration to all residents of the Ocean State.  Congratualtions on the culmination of a wonderful career with the Washington Trust Co. Please accept my best wishes for all your future endeavors.                          ____________________
