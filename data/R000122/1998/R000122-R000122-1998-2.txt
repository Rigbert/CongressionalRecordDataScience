President, I respectfully point out that the letter was sent during the Conference Committee negotiations on the bill and illustratesthe fact that the Senate was unwilling to alter positions it established in Senate passage of S. 1260. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the debate surrounding this issue. I commend Chairman D'Amato and Senator Dodd for their work on this bill. They have furthered the goal of capital formation while ensuring proper protections for consumers.                          ____________________
