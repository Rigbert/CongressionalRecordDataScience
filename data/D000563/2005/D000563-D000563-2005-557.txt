Isn't it a fact that after the 9/11 disaster, within 2 weeks we expanded Medicaid coverage under a disaster relief Medicaid assistance program so that 340,000 New Yorkers were able to start receiving Medicaid for 4 months? We spent $670 million on that assistance. We did that within 2 weeks. And now 7 weeks have passed, and this administration has not come forward with any help for Hurricane Katrina victims when it comes to Medicaid.
