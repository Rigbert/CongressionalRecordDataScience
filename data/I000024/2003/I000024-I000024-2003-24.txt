President, I will yield in a minute to the Senator from Nebraska.  Last night we went into a lot of detail in this debate and I used three groups of scientists, numbering over 20,000, who refute the science on which global warming is based. Only two criticisms did I get from the other side. One was comments I made about supposedly misquoting Professor Schneider. After looking at this, I find I did not misquote him at all. He is one who adheres to the MIT study that says there is far less than 1 percent chance temperatures would rise to 5.18 degrees or higher, while there is a 17 percent chance that temperatures would rise lower than 1.4 degrees. These are the guys who are for this.  More significant--and this is setting the framework for this debate today. This is not about a pared-down bill McCain-Lieberman are coming up with now. They have both said this is just a start.  I will quote Professor Wigley, one I was criticized for misquoting. We find out I did not. He said:       Senator Inhofe quotes my 1998 publication . . . where I      pointed out that adhering to the emissions reductions      outlined in the Kyoto Protocol would have only a small effect      on the system. What he fails to point out is this analysis      assumed that Kyoto was followed to 2010, and there were no      subsequent system climate mitigation policies. The point of      the paper was to show that Kyoto was to be considered only      the first step of a long and complex process of reducing our      dependency on fossil fuels as a primary energy source.  The chart of Senator Sununu shows how little change would be possible under this.  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska for 8 minutes.
