 Our Coast Guard base in Kodiak is the largest in the nation and truly vital to protecting our shores and coastal waters. Home to Air Station Kodiak, the Kodiak Naval Operating Base, and three cutters, Kodiak is a lynchpin of coastal security in the North Pacific.  I am sure I do not need to teach anyone about the vital role the Coast Guard serves in Alaska. The area of responsibility assigned to Coast Guard units within Alaskan waters is the largest in the nation, spanning a massive 3,853,500 square miles and more than 33,000 miles of coastline. This enormous geographic responsibility includes the patrol of the North Pacific Ocean to protect those traversing the often-rough waters and to stop large-scale high seas drift netting as well as other illegal fishing practices that rob Alaskans of our livelihood and one of our most valuable natural resources.  From a national perspective, the Coast Guard is responsible for protecting our coastal borders and keeping those in our waterways safe through port, waterway and coastal security, drug and migrant interdiction, maintaining maritime aids to navigation, search and rescue missions, living marine resources and marine safety, ensuring defense readiness, marine environmental protection, ice operations, and other law enforcement operations. Through these important missions, the Service saves thousands of American lives every year.  I was glad to speak with Coast Guard leadership recently about the great work performed already this year, even during the political divide in Washington, D.C. Every man and woman in the service is a testament to the spirit and drive that makes America so great and I want to assure all of our Coast Guard men and women that I am working to support and represent their interests in Congress just as I have done my whole career. I would like to thank everyone in the Coast Guard for the outstanding work they do, day in and day out to protect Alaska and our country. America is truly better off thanks to the Coast Guard.                          ____________________
