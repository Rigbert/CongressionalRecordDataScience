Speaker, I rise today to remember and pay my respects to an individual whose contributions to his community were exceptional. San Juan Capistrano City Councilman John Gelff recently passed away and today I would like the House of Representatives to recognize his contributions to his community.  John's life is marked by his service to community and others. He served in many public capacities throughout Orange County duringhis life and six years ago moved to San Juan Capistrano. His immediate devotion and commitment to San Juan Capistrano was evident in his leadership as Mayor in 2003 and his service as Chairman of the City's Redevelopment Agency.  Community members remark on his love for the city and charitable organizations, such as the American Diabetes Association's South Orange County Walk and his service on the Orange County Library Commission. His accomplishments during his short time as a city councilmember include the prevention of a second railroad track in town, the prevention of a San Diego Gas & Electric electrical substation being located in the City, and working with the Orange County Transportation Authority to make traffic improvements along the San Diego Freeway corridor.  In 2000, my congressional district changed to include part of San Juan Capistrano and immediately I was impressed with John's passion and commitment to his community. San Juan Capistrano is undoubtedly a better place because of John Gelff's contributions. His leadership and energy will be truly missed.                          ____________________
