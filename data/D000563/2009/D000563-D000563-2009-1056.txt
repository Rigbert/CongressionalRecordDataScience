The vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture on the Dodd-Shelby substitute amendment to H.R. 627, the credit card bill. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will dispose of the pending amendments and vote on passage of the bill, as amended. As a result, Senators should expect at least two rollcall votes tomorrow morning.  At 2:15 p.m., there will be a vote on confirmation of the Gensler nomination. We also expect to begin consideration of the Iraq and Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill sometime later tomorrow afternoon.                          ____________________
