 FEINGOLD. When the Senator from Kentucky was putting items in the Record, I was letting him go. I will be available for questions in a moment.  All I can say, Mr. President, is this is not the only measure we put in the Record. What is striking is that even the Weekly Standard believes that this issue has gone very high on the list of issues. Every measure that is being taken now does indicate a tremendous growth in the concern about this issue.  I would be fascinated to hear more about exactly why the RNC changed its data on this. I will try to take a look at it later. I do not know why they indicated that it was incorrect. Somehow the Weekly Standard got the impression that this issue was on the move. On that point they are right.  Mr. President, I would also like to note with regard to the statement of the Senator from Kentucky about the American Civil Liberty Union's position on this bill, yes, the American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concerns about the bill.  I want to remind the Senator from Kentucky that the ACLU was wrong when they litigated the Buckley versus Valeo case. They did not win all the points that they litigated in that case. In fact, some of the individuals that the Senator from Kentucky has just cited were among those who litigated that case and lost. So, yes, they litigated it. They had their day in court. And they were wrong.  In fact, the ACLU, an organization which sometimes I am criticized for agreeing with, happens to be dead wrong with regard to a release that they just put out entitled ``Revised McCain-Feingold Legislation Would Trample on Americans' First Amendment Rights.''  Mr. President, I would like to just quote a sentence from that release to show how reckless some people are being about describing this bill. The quote says this:       McCain-Feingold imposes a 2-month, 60-day blackout before      any Federal election on any radio or television advertisement      that mentions any candidates for Federal office.  Mr. President, that is not true. The bill does ask that certain rules apply during that 60-day period that do not apply outside of that period, and the rules are that you must use hard money limits and disclosure in order to do it, but there is no blackout, there is no prohibition.  Mr. President, there isn't a single advertisement that you could possibly come up with that is barred by this bill. That is not what the bright line test is. In fact, it is very troubling to see an organization for which I have such high regard in terms of their professionalism, in terms of their ability to mount legal arguments, to see somebody actually say that the bill does something it clearly does not do.  You cannot prohibit advertisements. You cannot say that people cannot say things. What you can do, I believe, and I believe the Supreme Court will support this, is during the electioneering period, which the Supreme Court has talked about, you can require that certain kinds of messages be disclosed in terms of who is making them and also that the money that is used and raised for it be under certain kinds of limits. That is all it does. I think the ACLU is in error with regard to that provision.  Mr. President, I would also like to place in the Record at this time Senate bill 143 from the 102d Congress. The other day there was a spirited conversation between my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, and the Senator from Arizona which centered around the fact that the Senator from Kentucky has cosponsored legislation that did a couple of things that he has now said on the floor are unconstitutional.  In particular, Mr. President, the point was made by the Senator from Arizona that the Senator from Kentucky had cosponsored a bill that bans soft money. The Senator from Kentucky responded by saying: Well, you know, sometimes you sign on to a bill that you're not comfortable with, and you want to participate in a joint effort.  I understand that. Some of that experience has occurred for me with regardto this bill where I am not happy with every provision. But I do need to have printed in the Record, Mr. President, Senate bill 143. I ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 143                            [102d Congress]       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--       (1) in the 45 days preceding a primary election, and in the      60 days preceding a general election, candidates for      political office need to be able to buy, at the lowest unit      charge, nonpreemptible advertising spots from broadcast      stations and cable television stations to ensure that their      messages reach the intended audience and that the voting      public has an opportunity to make informed decisions;       (2) since the Communications Act of 1934 was amended in      1972 to guarantee the lowest unit charge for candidates      during these important preelection periods, the method by      which advertising spots are sold in the broadcast and cable      industries has changed significantly;       (3) changes in the method for selling advertising spots      have made the interpretation and enforcement of the lowest      unit charge provision difficult and complex;       (4) clarification and simplification of the lowest unit      charge provision in the Communications Act of 1934 is      necessary to ensure compliance with the original intent of      the provision; and       (5) in granting discounts and setting charges for      advertising time, broadcasters and cable operators should      treat candidates for political office at least as well as the      most favored commercial advertisers.       (b) Amendment of Communications Act.--Section 315 of the      Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 315) is amended--       (1) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``class and'';       (2) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections      (d) and (e), respectively; and       (3) by inserting immediately after subsection (b) the      following new subsection:       ``(c) A licensee shall not preempt the use, during any      period specified in subsection (b)(1), of a broadcasting      station by a legally qualified candidate for public office      who has purchased such use pursuant to subsection (b)(1).''.
