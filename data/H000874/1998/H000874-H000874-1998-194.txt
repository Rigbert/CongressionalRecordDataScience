. 3494, The Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of 1988, and the important work that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is doing to locate and recover missing children. In 1990, the Justice Department released a study reporting that there are as many as 4,600 abductions by non-family members reported to police, 114,600 attempted abductions of children by non-family members, and 354,000 children abducted by family members annually.  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children works in cooperation with the United States Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement, social service agencies, elected officials, judges, prosecutors, educators and the public and private sectors to prevent these heinous crimes against children. The Fiscal Year 1998 Treasury, Postal Service and General government Appropriations Conference Report contained $571,000 for the Exploited Child Unit of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. In my role as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations, I will, once again, this year be supporting funding for this most important organization.  Mr. Chairman, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is doing critical work throughout the country to ensure the safety of our Nation's children. I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill and to support the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
