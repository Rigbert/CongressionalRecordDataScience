 President, I congratulate Child Care Resources of King County for 20 years of service to the community. This organization is a leader in King County and occupies a critical role for children and families within the community. Through promoting equity for all children, establishing community stability, and helping children prepare for school, Child Care Resources of King County has impacted and helped shape the lives of many Washingtonians.  As a former preschool teacher, on the first day of class it was easy to identify which students had participated in high-quality child care before entering my classroom. We know that children who participate in high-quality care are better prepared for school and more likely to lead a successful life. Child Care Resources of King County has worked tirelessly for 20 years to ensure children in King County have access to high-quality care and enter school well prepared. Additionally, they work to incorporate culturally relevant care that reflects a child's culture and language which builds positive self identity and improves school readiness.  I believe strongly in the Child Care Resources of King County and their mission. Congratulations to them on a job well done and I wish them twenty more years of continued success.
