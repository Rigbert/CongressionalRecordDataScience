Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment.  The amendment directs the Government Accountability Office to study and report on Justice Department programs and research relative to substance abuse and substance use disorders among adolescents and young adults.  I share the gentlewoman's desire for additional information on the programs available to combat the opioid epidemic. This is an appropriate piece of the legislative package.  Having said that, I am concerned that, as drafted, the amendment requires the GAO to study things DOJ might not be doing and does not have the expertise to do so effectively.  Specifically, the amendment directs the GAO to study and report on DOJ programs relative to substance abuse and substance use disorders by adolescents with no nexus to the criminal justice system.  I do not oppose the amendment, but I would like to work with the gentlewoman going forward to ensure the provisions of the amendment are appropriately tailored to the responsibilities and programs within the Justice Department's jurisdiction.  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
