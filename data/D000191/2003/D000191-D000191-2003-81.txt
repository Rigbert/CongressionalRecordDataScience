 billion to engage in an extensive reconstruction of Iraq. There has already been discussion on the floor of the no-bid contracts and the favoritism and extortion prices to Halliburton and other companies, war profiteering, but now there is also, now that we have seen the list, questions about the priorities in a couple of ways.  There are questions about what they are going to spend the money on. On the list is Wifi. A lot of people do not even know what Wifi is. Iraq is a country where I do not think the average Iraqi or even the elite Iraqis own laptop computers. We are going to give emergency spending money, which the American people are going to borrow, to give them Wifi capability in Iraq, when the people in the rural parts of my district do not even have broadband. They have hardly decent telephone service, but we are going to do Wifi in Iraq.  We are going to give them Zip codes in Iraq, an American invention. We are going to give them a national 911. Is that not nice? The American people are going to borrow money to install 911 in Iraq. Why would we do that? Why is that necessary? They did not have 911 before the war. We did not destroy it with bombing. Why they are going to have it now?  Then there is the executive training. We are going to provide $10,000 for a 4-week course for Iraqi executives that exceeds the cost of sending them to Harvard University for the same period of time, let alone a community college in my district that could do a fine job for a quarter the price, but no, it is not just that. It is the fact that this is gold-plated and out of control.  Here are a couple of examples. Major General David Petraeus, in charge of North Iraq, told a congressional delegation, his engineers said and we priced rebuilding a cement plant for $15 million. Well, the Iraqis were in kind of a hurry. So they decided to do it on their own and not wait for the $15 million and the U.S. contract. They did it for $80,000, a tiny fraction of the price. So at least the American taxpayers did not get gouged for that and did not have to borrow $15 million to do an $80,000 job on a cement plant. Maybe that was isolated. Well, unfortunately, no.  We also have another instance, $25 million to refurbish 20 police stations in Basra and a member of Iraq's governing council kind of laughed at that and said, we could do it for five and still make a bunch of money.  So the American people are going to be asked to borrow $25 million for a gold-plated contract to do something that would cost something less than five. The American people are being asked to borrow money to build houses in Iraq at a price that is 10 times the value of the average Iraqi house. Maybe it would be better if we give them a little of the wherewithal, some materials and nails and cement, and let them go at it themselves. They have 60 percent unemployment. I think they would be happy to build their own houses.  But that is not the way the Bush administration wants to do this. They want to gold-plate it. They want to make the American people borrow $20 billion and pay for it the next 30 years, the gold-plate and war profiteer, for the reconstruction of Iraq.  Then, finally, there is Ahmed al-Barak, a member of the Ruling Council, very prominent, who became unpopular with this administration, although previously had been very favored by them, when he said the savings could be a factor of 10 if the Iraqis did their own work. Basically, where they spend $1 billion, we would spend a hundred million.  So I offer the 10 percent solution to this administration. Two point three billion dollars is still a lot of money where I come from, but it is a lot better than $20.3 billion, and the Iraqis could do it for that price. We could do the reconstruction, whatever we are really obligated to because of the destruction of the war, but we do not need to give them exotic things they never had before.  I have heard we have to rebuild the electrical infrastructure. We have kind of got a failing one here, and the reason was they have got boilers from the 1950s and 1960s. Guess what? Our war did not install boilers from the 1950s and 1960s, so why is it the American people have to borrow the money to give them brand new boilers or new high-efficiency turbines to generate electricity when we could use that money here at home to put Americans to work? If we spent $20.3 billion on real infrastructure projects that are underfunded by this administration in the United States of America, we could put one million Americans to work.  So, no, to the gold-plating, maybe a 10 percent solution if that is justified, but we should not be borrowing in the name of the American people $20.3 billion and indebting generations of Americans to pay for the gold-plated war profiteering in Iraq.                          ____________________
