Speaker, here it is in Washington, nearly 10 o'clock at night and the Republican leadership of this institution does not even have a prescription drug bill ready for us to read as homework tonight. They tell us that we are going to debate this tomorrow, maybe 2 hours at the most, one of the most important changes in our country's history in terms of health care for our seniors. They tell us maybe after midnight tonight we might be able to go up to the Rules Committee to offer our amendments and to have them considered. They will deny most of those amendments, but the interesting thing about going to the Rules Committee after midnight, no press is there. Nobody will know, in one of the most significant pieces of legislation that will be considered in this 21st century. So the American people will not know. The press will not know.  I am here tonight to say I intend to offer an amendment before the Rules Committee that is likely to be rejected, but it is a very important amendment. This amendment says that whatever prescription drug plan is considered here tomorrow, under their very restrictive rules, should do exactly what we do in the Department of Veterans Affairs and exactly what we do at the Department of Defense and that is have negotiated pricing for the drugs that our seniors will buy. Why? You get the best price. Everybody knows when you buy in quantity, you get a cheaper price. It is a very simple concept. But what has the Republican majority in this House, the radical right, done? They have actually put a provision in the bill and here it is. This is the bill that was before the committee and we know this provision will be retained in whatever the Rules Committee considers tonight, but it basically says that it prohibits our government, our Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating with the biggest drug companies in the world to get the best price for prescription drugs for our seniors. So what they are going to do, imagine they have got a provision that prohibits what we do at the Department of Veterans Affairs already and it prohibits what we do at the Department of Defense already in our financial purchasing system which gets our people the best prices. That is in the base bill. My amendment would get rid of that and it would say, hey, if you are going to do it and we have success across our government, just like Canada has success in their country by negotiating with the most powerful pharmaceutical companies in the world, why should we treat seniors any differently? Why should we make them pay higher prices? Indeed, in the Republican bill they make seniors pay any cost of drugs over $2,000 a year up to a level of perhaps $3,500 and it might be more because they are drafting the bill somewhere here in the Capitol. I do not know where they are. I went up to the Rules Committee to find the bill and the doors were all locked to the chairman's office.  But in any case here is what is currently being paid, for example, in the United States. Let us just take one of these drugs here, Norvasc, which is for high blood pressure. Normally it sells in one of our pharmacies for about $182.99, the Canadian price is $152.82, and the price at the Department of Veterans Affairs is $102. It is a definite savings. That is true with a whole series of pharmaceutical products that could be available to our seniors. So what the Republicans are basically saying in their bill to our seniors is, you have to pay the higher price because we won't permit you to negotiate price, we won't negotiate it for you, because our bill fundamentally denies it. This provision was written by the pharmaceutical companies themselves. Gee, does that surprise anybody?  I am only one Member of Congress representing 660,000 beautiful people in the northern part of Ohio. I am only one. Do you know there are six lobbyists for the pharmaceutical companies in this town for every one of me that there is? So basically many times I go home at night and I say to myself, folks back home, I am all you got and I am sticking with you. And I say to the pharmaceutical companies, I don't take your money, I don't want your money, but I'll show the public where your money goes. Is it any wonder why they put the provision in the base bill that went through the Committee on Energy and Commerce like lightning the other day?  Let us take a look at PhRMA. This group is so powerful that just in the last election cycle, just in one year, 2002, they contributed over $3 million. Ninety-five percent of it went to, guess, which party? The Republican Party. I happen to be a Democrat. Too bad for the Democrats. They only get 5 percent of the $3,100,000 that was donated just in the fiscal year 2002. Why do you think they gave all that money to the leadership of this institution? Take a look at Pfizer. They gave 80 percent of the $1.8 million they just contributed in 2002 to one party, the Republican Party. You can go down the list. Almost all the money goes to one party. So is it any surprise to us why the bill that we cannot find here in the Capitol and we will not even be allowed to talk about until after midnight and we are all staying up late to do that for our constituents, do you really wonder whether this government is on the level?  I urge my colleagues tomorrow to vote ``no'' on this bill and to vote ``no'' on these pharmaceutical companies until we can get negotiated pricing in this bill.
