 President, I am pleased to join with Senator Carper to introduce the Electric Utility Cap and Trade Act.  Today, we are introducing the first of five bills to address the number one environmental issue facing this planet--global warming.  This bill establishes a national cap and trade system over the electricity sector. It will reduce emissions from this sector by 25 percent by 2020.  What distinguishes this bill is that it has the support of 6 major energy companies.  Together, these companies operate in 42 States and produce approximately 150,000 megawatts of energy. This is greater than 15 percent of the U.S. electricity market.  These companies include, first, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) Corporation, which is the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. PG is California's largest utility and serves approximately 1 in every 20 Americans. PG Corporation currently owns approximately 6,500 megawatts of generation.  Second, Calpine, which operates in 20 States and Canada, generating 26,000 megawatts of energy.  Third, Florida Power & Light, which operates in 26 States, generating more than 30,000 megawatts.  Fourth, Entergy, which operates in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, generating approximately 30,000 megawatts.  Fifth, Exelon, which operates in Illinois and Pennsylvania, generating 38,000 megawatts of energy.  Sixth, Public Service Enterprise Group, which is the largest provider of energy in New Jersey, generating approximately 15,000 megawatts.  These companies' support is greatly appreciated, and I think it signals a new willingness in the energy industry to seriously tackle global warming.  This bill is just the beginning of a major program. Over the next weeks and months, we will also be introducing a cap and trade bill for the industrial sector; a bill that increases fuel economy standards by ten miles per gallon over the next ten years; a bill to promote bio-diesel and E-85; and other low carbon fuels and an energy efficiency bill modeled after California's program.  This is an ambitious agenda, but I believe it is the right way to go if we are to slow global warming.  A great debate has raged in the halls of Congress, in academia, and in the field over the past two decades.  At issue were three fundamental questions: First, is the earth warming? Second, if so, is the warming caused by human activity? And third, can it be stopped?  Over the past few years, a consensus has been forged. An overwhelming body of evidence has been gathered. And, an inescapable conclusion has been reached: The earth is warming. The warming is caused by human activity, namely the combustion of fossil fuels.  It cannot be stopped, because carbon dioxide does not dissipate. It stays in the atmosphere for 30, 40, or 50 years or more.  When we pick up the newspaper each day we see the results. We read about ice sheets the size of small nations breaking off the ice shelves in the Arctic and Antarctic. We read about polar bears committing acts of cannibalism, something unknown in recent memory. We read about species disappearing, seas rising, coral reefs dying, and glaciers melting.  But, all this dire news does not mean we should throw up our hands and do nothing. If we act now, and if we act with purpose, the most serious consequences can be averted. Global warming can be contained to 1-2 degrees Fahrenheit.  But if we do not act, and temperatures spike by 5 degrees or more, the world around us will change forever. There's no going back.  The question becomes what can we do? I've spent the last year trying to answer this question. And the conclusion I've reached is that there is no single answer, no silver bullet, no one thing to turn the tide. But rather, we need many answers in many different areas.  And more importantly, we need people of common purpose, working together, to find innovative solutions. And that's why we're here today.  As I was searching for answers, I picked up the phone and called PG Corporation's CEO, Peter Darbee. I said, ``Peter, would you help me out on Global Warming legislation?''  To his immense credit, Peter went back, studied the issue, and said ``You're right. Something must be done.'' And he's been terrific. He's helped at every step of the way.  It means so much to me that PG, Calpine, Florida Power and Light, and all the companies that comprise the Clean Energy Group's Clean Air Policy Initiative have endorsed the legislation we are introducing today.  This is the most aggressive global warming bill that industry has supported to date. And I want to thank the CEOs of these companies today for their courage and leadership in taking this step.  Here's what the bill would do. The bill would establish a cap and trade program for the electricity sector, which is the single largest piece of the global warming puzzle, accounting for 33 percent of all U.S. emissions.  First, the bill would a cap at 2006 levels in 2011--a 6 percent reduction from anticipated levels of greenhouse gases from the electric sector.  In 2015, it would ratchet the cap down to 2001 levels--a 16 percent reduction from anticipated levels.  In 2016, the bill would reduce the cap further to 1 percent below 2001 levels. And, from 2017 to 2019 it would require additional annual 1 percent reductions.  By 2020, emissions would be reduced 25 percent below anticipated levels.  And after that, emissions will be reduced even further--by an additional 1.5 percent a year and potentially more, if the EPA, based on scientific evidence, believes that more needs to be done to avert the most dire consequences of global warming.  That's the cap.  The trade part of the bill gives companies flexibility to embrace new technologies, encourage innovation, and promote green practices--not just in this area, but across the economy.  As I said, this bill is only one part of the answer. One piece of the puzzle.  Congress has a window of opportunity to act. If we act boldly and quickly, then perhaps we can make a difference.  But if we resort to the feuding which has characterized past Congresses, our world will be the poorer for it. I think there is but one choice.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 317       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
