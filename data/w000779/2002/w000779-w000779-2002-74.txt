President, today I introduce legislation transferring from Federal to county jurisdiction the West Butte Road, located in the counties of Crook and Deschutes, Oregon. In exchange for the new right-of-way for the West Butte Road, Crook and Deschutes counties will transfer their right-of-way on the George Millican Road to the U.S. Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management, BLM.  The right-of-way exchange authorized by this legislation would clear the way for a paved road, pursued for more than 30 years by Prineville, in Crook County, OR, to connect their community with U.S. Highway 20. Such a road would substantially enhance the economic development potential for Prineville, a community suffering from 15 percent unemployment, by providing an alternative route for passenger and commercial traffic traveling between Portland and Boise, ID. It would also encourage commerce in Prineville by efficiently directing traffic to the Prineville/Crook County Industrial Parks, areas set aside for the sole purpose of promoting industrial diversification within Crook County. By increasing the traffic to these areas, the opportunity to promote and increase their occupancy would be greatly improved.  In addition to economic advantages, the paved road would provide important environmental benefits. It would reduce traffic congestion on the overloaded highway 97 passing through Bend and Redmond, OR. It would eliminate the prospect of major improvements to the Crooked River Highway. The Crooked River Highway follows the meander of the Crooked River, a tributary of the salmon-bearing Deschutes River. Improvement of that road would entail substantial impacts to riparian areas, expensive bridge maintenance, and likely adverse effects to the river. In contrast, the proposed new road would reclaim a straight section of the old Prineville-Lakeview highway, surveyed in 1915, which crosses flat desert lands and no riparian zones. In addition, the legislation directs the BLM to propose affirmative measures to protect wildlife and game habitat in the area traversed by the new road.  Some suggest that this legislation is not necessary because the BLM already has the authority to issue a right-of-way. That may be true, but it is also true that the BLM decided it can make a decision on the county right-of-way application only thought an extended process, which close observers tell me could take anywhere from four to six years, with no guarantee of success. I am not willing to stake Prineville's economic or environmental future on such an uncertainty.  Improvement of the Millican/West Butte road is supported by the City of Prineville, Crook County, Deschutes County, the City of Bend, the City of Redmond, the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Central Oregon Transportation Commission. They have identified the new right-of-way as a means of reducing environmental impacts associated with the existing road, reducing traffic congestion, improving the northwest-southeast connections between the state's wealthiest and poorest regions, and offering the community the chance to retain its largest employers so as to address some of the economic woes of the region.                                 ______                                       By
