President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his eloquent and, to me, very persuasive remarks about the need for supporting this amendment. This is something we know is going to happen. Everyone understands energy prices are soaring out of sight. Last year, we did not have sufficient resources for LIHEAP with prices that were much cheaper. This year we know we are not going to have sufficient resources.  So we have come together on a bipartisan basis. Senator Collins, Senator Snowe, Senator Smith, Senator Coleman--many of my Democratic colleagues have come together to do what should be obvious to all of us: raise the level of LIHEAP funding to accommodate these huge increases in prices. It is very simple, I think--I hope.  I hope we are in a process of beginning to understand all of the demands that are being placed on low-income Americans, and particularly seniors.
