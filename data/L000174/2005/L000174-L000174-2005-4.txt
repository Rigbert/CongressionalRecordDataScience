1558, which passed the Senate on November 10. This bill was introduced by Senators Collins and Lieberman. I worked with them to amend it to extend for 4 years the ``sunset'' of a provision first enacted in the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 that grants the Judicial Conference of the United States the authority to redact information from a judge's mandatory financial disclosure in circumstances in which it is determined that the release of the information could endanger the filer or the filer's family. The bill, as amended, also extends the protections of this provision to the family members of filers.  Like the more comprehensive court security measure Senator Specter and I have introduced, S, 1968, the Court Security Improvement Act of 2005, CSIA, from which it is drawn, S. 1558 provides judges and their families with needed security by extending the judges' redaction authority without interruption and expanding it to their families. It also strikes the right balance with the need for continuing congressional oversight to prevent the misuse of this redaction authority, which has been a matter of some concern to me. I appreciate that the Judicial Conference is seeking to improve its practices and the Senate passed S. 1558 because none of us wants to see judges or their families endangered. Now, because of the failure of the House to pass S. 1558 and enact the reauthorization of redaction authority for another 4-year period, these protections will lapse at the end of the year.                          ____________________[Page S14300]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]          FAILURE OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO PASS S. 1558
