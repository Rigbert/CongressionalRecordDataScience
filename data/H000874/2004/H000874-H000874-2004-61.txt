Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information.  I have not talked to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Harman) or the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), and I see the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) is on the floor, about the substance of the proposal; but I will certainly discuss it with them. I hope they have been included in these deliberations of a bill that may be introduced because if they have, I think it would make it easier for us to get it passed in a bipartisan fashion in a very efficient and speedy way.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further inquiries as to the schedule, and I appreciate the leader's engaging in somewhat the colloquy about the transportation bill, which we feel very keenly about. I hope that we can speed that bill as quickly as possible. I thank the leader for his comments.                          ____________________
