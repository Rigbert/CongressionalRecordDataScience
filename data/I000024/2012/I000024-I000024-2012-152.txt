The ratings are very high on his second opinion, and I am very glad of that.  I am also very pleased we had the Senator from Tennessee talking about the big issue of today. There is no one--having been the Secretary of Education in a previous administration--who is more qualified to talk about student loans than the Senator from Tennessee. So I am very appreciative.  Ironically, we have talked about two subjects, and I am here to talk about one totally unrelated that I think is equally critical--and I have to be critical--of this administration. I am going to state something that hasn't been stated before. I am going to release something that hasn't been released before, and I think it is very significant that people really listen.  You know, this President has had a war on fossil fuels--and when we talk about fossil fuels, we are talking about oil, gas, and coal--ever since before he was in office. He is very clever because what he has attempted to do is to kill oil, gas, and coal when we had the huge supply of it here and yet do it in a way that the American people won't be aware over it. How many people in America, I ask the Chair, know what hydraulic fracturing is? I daresay more people know about it today than knew about it a short while ago.  So today I wish to address for the first time ever the questionable actions recently taken by the Obama administration's Environmental Protection Agency to stop domestic energy production, particularly doing so by using hydraulic fracturing.  Today I wish to draw attention to a little-known video from 2010 which shows a top EPA official, region 6 Administrator Al Armendairiz, using the vivid metaphor of crucifixion to explain EPA's enforcement tactics over oil and gas producers.  This is a long quote, and I am going to ask everyone to bear with me because it is all a quote by Armendairiz. He is, as I said, the Administrator of region 6, and he is instructing at this time people who are working for them in what their behavior should be. So this is an actual quote I am going to use. It is a long quote. Bear with me.       I was in a meeting once and I gave an analogy to my staff      about my philosophy of enforcement, and I think it was      probably a little crude and maybe not appropriate for the      meeting but I'll go ahead and tell you what I said. It was      kind of like how the Romans used to conquer little villages      in the Mediterranean. They would go into a little Turkish      town somewhere, they'd find the first five guys they saw and      they would crucify them. And then you know that town was      really easy to manage for the next few years. And so you make      examples out of people who are in this case not compliant      with the law. Find people who are not compliant with the law,      and you hit them as hard as you can and you make examples out      of them, and there is a great deterrent effect there. And,      companies that are smart see that, they don't want to play      that game, and they decide at that point that it's time to      clean up. And, that won't happen unless you have somebody out      there making examples of people. So you go out, you look at      the industry, you find the people violating the law, you go      aggressively after them. And we do have some pretty effective      enforcement tools. Compliance can get very high, very, very      quickly. That's what these companies respond to, is both      their public image but also financial pressure. So you put      some financial pressure on a company, you get other people in      that industry to clean up very quickly. So, that's our      general philosophy.  Again, that is a quote from the EPA Administrator of region 6. He actually said: You know, it is kind of like the Romans, when they used to conquer little villages in the Mediterranean. They would go into a little Turkish town and find the first five guys they saw and crucify them. That is how you get their attention.  I remember a few years ago a lumber company in my State of Oklahoma called me up and said: I am not sure what to do. The EPA is putting us out of business.  I said: What do you mean, putting you out of business?  This was a lumber company in Tulsa, OK--Mill Creek Lumber. The man who was calling me was the president.  He said: We have been disposing of our used crankcase oil in the same legal, licensed depository for 10 years now, and they have traced some of this oil to a Superfund site, and they say they are now going to fine me $5,000 a day for that violation. Now, that is what the letter said.  I said: Send the letter to me. That is a typical threat by the EPA to try to make you voluntarily go out of business.  So he sent it to me, and sure enough that is what it said. Any concerned reader would look at that and say: They are going to put us out of business. He said they could stay in business maybe another 30 days and that would be the end.  Well, that was a threat. That is what they do to intimidate people. It is notquite to the level of a crucifixion, but nonetheless times have changed and things have gotten worse over the past few years. So, yes, they have the enforcement tools, and they are able to scare people, intimidate people. And these are the very people who are working and hiring people and doing what is necessary to run this machine we call America.  So according to Administrator Armendairiz, EPA's general philosophy is to crucify and make examples of domestic energy producers so that other companies will fall in line with EPA's regulatory whims. His comments give us a rare glimpse into the Obama administration's true agenda. No matter how much President Obama may pretend to be a friend of oil, gas, and coal, his green team constantly betrays the truth that the Obama administration is fully engaged in an all-out war on hydraulic fracturing, thinking people won't know that if you kill hydraulic fracturing, you kill oil and gas production in America.  Not long after Armendairiz made his stunning admission, the EPA, apparently, began to zero in on the first crucifixion victims. The Agency targeted U.S. natural gas producers in Pennsylvania, in Texas, and in Wyoming, and in all three of these cases, before these investigations were complete, EPA made headline-grabbing statements either insinuating or proclaiming that hydraulic fracturing was the cause of water contamination. But in each of these three cases, the EPA's comments were contrived, and despite their best efforts they have been unable to find any science to back up their accusations.  Of course, this administration has a propensity for making embarrassing announcements on days when they hope no one will notice. During the past 2-week recess, while Congress was out of town, the EPA released several late-Friday-night statements reversing their earlier assertions in these cases. Still, the problem is people are walking around believing these things are true.  The Agency hopes they can admit they were wrong quietly, but we are not going to let that happen. We are not going to let them get away with it. The American people deserve to know exactly why the EPA is pushing ahead with such intensity to capture alarmist headlines, and then, when no one is looking and when their investigation shows they were wrong, quietly backing away from it.  The EPA, in Texas, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania, not only reversed their assertions but did so with a stunning lack of transparency, strategically attempting to make these announcements as quietly as possible, at times they know Congress won't be looking. Let me quickly highlight a few of these examples. In Parker County, TX, the Agency's major announcement--the withdrawal of their administrative order--was announced at a time they knew Congress was adjourning for Easter recess. In Dimock, PA, the EPA made two announcements, and the same thing happened there. In Pavillion, WY, the EPA announced their reversal as Congress was wrapping up that week.  So the same thing was happening. The EPA's general philosophy is to crucify domestic energy producers. Let's look at the three of their crucifixions.  Parker County, TX. I think this could be the most outrageous of all the examples we will be talking about today. I will not have time to hit them all, but I will go back and make the complete statement I was going to make. Unfortunately, there isn't time to finish it now.  But what happened in Parker County, TX, took place in region 6, where my State of Oklahoma is located. Despite Texas State regulators actively investigating the issue, EPA region 6 issued a December 7, 2010, Emergency Administration Order, which determined--I use the word ``determined'' because that is the word they used--determined that State and local authorities had not taken sufficient action and ordered a company called Range Resources to provide clean drinking water to affected residents and begin taking steps to resolve the problem.  Along with this order, the EPA went on a publicity barrage in an attempt to publicize its premature and unjustified conclusions. The day of the order, EPA issued a press release in which it mentioned hydraulic fracturing--not once, not twice but four times--in trying to tie that to problems with groundwater contamination.  The Agency claimed they also had ``determined''--again, they used that word--that natural gas drilling near the homes by Range Resources in Parker County, TX, had caused the contamination of at least two residential drinking water wells.  Regional administrator Al Armendariz was quoted in a press story posted online, prior to him even notifying the State of Texas, that EPA was making their order--and the e-mails have been obtained from the day the order was released--showing him gleefully sharing information with rabid antifracking advocates--and this is a quote by this EPA regional administrator: ``We're about to make a lot of news . . . time to Tivo channel 8.'' He was rejoicing.  In subsequent interviews, Armendariz made comments specifically intending to incite fear and sway public opinion against hydraulic fracturing, citing multiple times a danger of fire or explosion. When State regulators were made aware of EPA's action, they made it clear they felt the Agency was proceeding prematurely, to which Armendariz forwarded their reply calling it ``stunning.''  What was ``stunning,'' to quote Armendariz, were revelations about the way in which the EPA acted in this particular case, which led me to send a letter, at that time, to the EPA inspector general requesting him to preserve all records of communication in connection with the emergency order issued by the EPA region 6 administrator.  Subsequent to the EPA's December 7, 2010, administrative order, on January 18, 2011, EPA followed through on Regional Administrator Armendariz's promise to ``make examples of people'' and filed a complaint in Federal district court, requesting penalties against Range Resources of $16,500 a day for each violation they alleged took place--for each violation. I don't know how many violations there are. I think there are three or four.  Again, this goes back to the same thing that happened in my State of Oklahoma with the EPA trying to put a lumber company out of business by EPA, except this is a larger company so there are larger fines.  So $16,500 a day in order to align with Armendariz's pursuit of fines which ``can get very high very, very quickly.''  If these actions alone didn't create an appearance of impropriety and call into serious question the ability of Regional Administrator Armendariz to conduct unbiased investigations and fairly enforce the law, just 7 months prior to the region's actions in Parker County, Regional Administrator Armendariz laid the groundwork of how he planned to reign over his region.  In a townhall meeting in Dish, TX, he ``gave an analogy'' of his ``philosophy of enforcement.'' Again, we have already talked about that analogy.  This is a quote I highlighted at the beginning of my speech:       It was kind of like the Romans used to conquer little      villages in the Mediterranean. They'd go into a little      Turkish town somewhere, they'd find the first five guys they      saw and they would crucify them. And then you know that town      was really easy to manage.  Let me go back and be clear about this. This is President Obama's appointed regional administrator for the States of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma comparing his philosophy of enforcement over the oil and gas industries to Roman crucifixions, where they would ``just grab the first five guys they saw'' in order to set the policy and to scare everybody else and crucify them.  Fast forward to late Friday afternoon, March 30 of this year, just a few hours after Congress left town for the Easter recess. The Wall Street Journal reported that:       EPA told a federal judge it withdrew an administrative      order that alleged Range Resources had polluted water wells      in a rural Texas county west of Fort Worth. Under an      agreement filed by U.S. district court in Dallas, the EPA      will also drop the lawsuit it filed in January 2011 against      Range, and Range will end its appeal of the administrative      order.  Listen to this. A few weeks prior to EPA's withdrawal, a judge also concluded that one of the residents involved in the investigation workedwith environmental activists to create a ``deceptive video'' that was ``calculated to alarm the public into believing the water was burning''--water that was the result of the hydraulic fracturing--when it appears the resident attached a hose to the water well's gas vent, not the water, and of course lit it on fire.  I was on a TV show the other night by someone whom I will not mention their name--she happens to be one of my three favorite liberals--and she mentioned: ``This water is so bad it is burning.'' That judge showed what it was and of course made them cease from doing that.  Remember, this is only one of the three recent high-profile instances of backtracking on behalf of the Agency, after they have already scared everybody into thinking it is a serious problem.  Next we go into Wyoming--Pavillion, WY. Last December, EPA publicized and released nonpeer-reviewed draft findings which pointed to hydraulic fracturing as the cause of groundwater contamination. Again, the culprit is always hydraulic fracturing because we all know we can't get any large oil and gas out of tight formations without hydraulic fracturing.  Here again, the EPA stepped in over the actions of the State and made a press announcement designed to capture headlines where definitive evidence linking the act of hydraulic fracturing to water contamination simply didn't exist.  The announcement came in December, despite as late as November of 2011 EPA regional administrator James Martin saying the results of the last round of testing in Pavillion were not significantly different from the first two rounds of testing which showed no link between the hydraulic fracturing and contamination. That is three rounds of testing which showed no contamination from hydraulic fracturing. Yet only a few weeks later EPA announced the opposite.  In another reversal by the EPA in the past few weeks, the EPA stepped back and quietly agreed to take more water samples and postpone a peer review of the findings, something the State of Wyoming had been requesting for quite some time.  Again, the damage was done. They didn't do anything wrong. There was no water groundwater contamination at all. This is hydraulic fracturing.  As I have mentioned so many times before, I know a little bit about this because the first hydraulic fracturing took place in my State of Oklahoma in 1949. There has never been a documented case of groundwater contamination as a result of it. Yet this administration is doing everything they can to destroy hydraulic fracturing.  Dimock, PA, is the third site of the EPA's recent backtracking of its publicized attempts to link hydraulic fracturing to groundwater contamination. In this instance, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection had taken substantial action to and including working out an agreement with an oil and gas company ensuring residents clean drinking water.  In line with the State's Department of Environmental Protection, on December 2, 2011, the EPA declared that water in Dimock was safe to drink. Just over a month later, EPA reversed that position.  So they go back and forth. What do people remember? They remember this process of hydraulic fracturing is the culprit and is creating serious environmental problems.  What is maybe more egregious was--to quote Pennsylvania DEP secretary Michael Krancer--EPA's ``rudimentary'' understanding of the facts and history of the region's water: Independent geologists and water consultants such as Brian Oram have been puzzled by the Agency's rationale for their involvement in Dimock because the substances of greatest concern by EPA are naturally occurring and commonly found in this area of Pennsylvania. Yet EPA has chosen this area to attack because of the presence of hydraulic fracturing.  In other words, this has been going on for years, long before hydraulic fracturing.  By the way, I have to say they used to attack oil and gas, but it was always out West in the Western States. The chair knows something about that. This is different now because we have these huge reserves that are in places such as New York and Pennsylvania. All that time there has not been hydraulic fracturing, but as soon as hydraulic fracturing came in, they said this is the result of hydraulic fracturing when it has been there all the time.  Of course, this is part of the strategy to try to convince Americans we don't have the vast supply of natural resources we clearly have.  I was redeemed by this. I have seen saying all along that of all the untruths this President has been saying, the one he says more than any other is that we only have 2 percent of the reserves of gas and oil and we use 25 percent. It is not true. I don't want to use the ``L'' word. I don't want to get everybody mad, but it is just not true.  The U.S. Geological Survey revealed just a few days ago that President Obama's favorite talking point, that we only have 2 percent of the world's proven oil, is less than honest. The 2 percent the President quotes is proven reserves, but he ignores our recoverable reserves. This is coming from the USGS. Our recoverable reserves are some of the largest in the world.  According to information gleaned from the USGS report, America has 26 percent of the world's recoverable conventional oil reserves. That doesn't begin to include our enormous oil shale, tight oil and heavy oil deposits. That is just a fraction of it. But that is 26 percent of the world's recoverable oil.  Our problem is our politicians will not allow us--and particularly the Obama administration--to drill on public lands and to be able to capture that.  We also hold almost 30 percent of the world's technically recoverable conventional natural gas.  In other words, to put it in a way that I think is more understandable: Just from our own resources and at our own consumption level, we could run this country for 90 years on natural gas at our current level of consumption and for 60 years on oil. That is what we have. That is the answer to the problem. It is called supply and demand. There is not a person listening now who would not remember back in the elementary school days that the supply and demand is real.  But we all know he remains fully committed to his cap-and-trade, global warming, green energy agenda--a plan that is to severely restrict domestic development of natural gas, oil, and coal, to drive up the price of fossil fuels so their favorite forms of green energy can compete. It is, quite simply, a war on affordable energy--and, at that time, they weren't afraid to admit it.  Now they are backtracking a little bit--such as using hydraulic fracturing and not saying they are opposed to oil and gas.  Do you remember Steven Chu, the Secretary of Energy, President Obama's man? He told the Wall Street Journal that ``[s]omehow we have to figure out a way to boost the price of gasoline to levels in Europe.''  We all know the infamous quote from President Obama. He said that, under his cap-and-trade plan, ``electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket.''  The President himself has been on record supporting an increase in gas prices. Although, according to him, he would ``have preferred a gradual adjustment'' increasing the average family's pain at the pump. But this isn't a plan that gets you reelected. So the gas prices have skyrocketed, and with the utter failure of Solyndra, President Obama's dream of green energy economy is in shambles. We can be sure we won't be talking about this plan to raise energy costs until after the election.  I would have to say the President's own Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Poneman last month made a statement, and I appreciate it, because he said we have a very strong belief that the laws of supply and demand are real.  They have been saying that the laws of supply and demand are not real. Gary Becker--I quoted this the other day. He is a Nobel Prize-winning economist, professor at the University of Chicago. He has said ``supply and demand are the cause of the vast majority of large fluctuations in oil prices, and it is hard to believe that speculation has played a major role in causing a large swing in oil prices.''  The President tried to say it is not supply and demand. We do not need todevelop our own resources to bring down the price of gas at the pumps. It is speculation. Here is a Nobel Prize winner saying that just flat is not true.  The President's budget proposal this year alone--I want to get back to how he has made this attempt to tax oil and gas out of business. The President's budget proposal this year alone amounts to a $38.6 billion tax increase on oil and gas companies, which would hit my own State of Oklahoma where 70,000 people are employed in oil and gas development especially hard. His proposal specifically would either modify or outright cancel section 199--that is the manufacturers' tax deduction that is something all other manufacturers would be able to enjoy--for the intangible drilling costs, IDCs: percentage depreciation, tertiary injections. All of these were in his budget--not just this year, not just last year, but every year since his budget 4 years ago--to try to tax the oil and gas companies out of business.  His actions have not slowed his rhetoric. In fact, President Obama has become so desperate to run from his antifossil fuel record that he ran all the way to Cushing, OK. That is my State. We have a major intersection of the pipeline down there. This President, in his attack on fossil fuels, stopped the XL Pipeline that goes from Canada down through my State of Oklahoma. He came all the way to Oklahoma to say: I am in support of the pipeline that goes south out of Oklahoma into Texas.  Wait a minute, that is because he cannot stop it. He could only stop the other one because it crossed the line from Canada to the United States. So he came all the way to Oklahoma to say he was not going to stop something that he could not stop anyway.  President Obama is trying to take credit for the increase in oil and gas. I have to get this out because I think so many people do not understand this. The increase that is taking place in production is all on private lands. It is not increasing on public lands. It is decreasing on public lands, but on private lands he has no control. In the report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, since 2007, quoting now from the CRS:       About 96 percent of the [oil production] increase took      place on non-federal lands.  According to the Obama Energy Information Administration, total fossil fuel sales of production from Federal lands are down since 2008--they are down, not up--and during a time of a natural gas boom throughout the country. In other words we have gone through the biggest boom on private land, but he will not allow us to do it on public land, and that is where these tremendous reserves are. Gas sales from production on Federal lands are down 17 percent since 2008.  Finally, according to PFC Energy, which is a global consulting firm specializing in the oil and gas industry, 93 percent of shale oil and gas wells in the United States are located on private and State lands, hardly the Federal Government triumph that the President falsely attempts to take credit for when you put all the pieces together.  President Obama's election strategy is clear: Say great things about oil and gas, say great things about coal and the virtues of domestic energy production, but under the surface try hard to manufacture something wrong with hydraulic fracturing. Remember, not 1 cubic foot of natural gas can be retrieved in tight shale formations without using hydraulic fracturing.  As I said before, that was started in my State of Oklahoma. We are going to make sure we are the truth squad that tells the truth about how we can bring down the price of gas at the pump. It gets right back to supply and demand.  I am going to come back at a later date and give the long version of what I have just given in the last 45 minutes, but I see my friend from Tennessee is here. So I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.                            Deficit Spending
