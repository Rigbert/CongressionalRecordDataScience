Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to make the observation to my dear friend and colleague from Texas that the New York Times editorial board did not sit in our offices when we constructed the Freedom To Farm Act, and we would not want them to sit there, but at least in terms of their opinion, it would be helpful if they would not perjure agriculture as he has indicated.  Let me also say that the gentleman from Texas is affectionately called the chairman emeritus of the House Agriculture Committee for good reason. He has been a champion of agriculture, he has furnished us outstanding leadership, he is regarded all over the world as a Secretary of State of Agriculture.                              {time}  1345  Mr. Chairman, I checked with his seven grandchildren, who have mentioned they are going to have an appreciation night for Kika, pardon me, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. de la Garza], as of tomorrow in his home State of Texas. Of the seven grandchildren, four have endorsed the freedom-to-farm concept.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Lewis].
