 Speaker, I would like to ask the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey], my friend, a question. I agree with everything that he said. The cuts here are devastating. LIHEAP means a great deal to people in the State of Vermont. Education cuts, Public Broadcasting cuts, and so forth and so on.  Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman from Wisconsin note that given the fact that this government and Congress provide $100 billion a year in corporate welfare, that is tax breaks and subsidies for the largest corporations and the wealthiest people, does the gentleman happen to note any cuts in corporate welfare as part of this rescission package?
