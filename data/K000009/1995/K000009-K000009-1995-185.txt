Speaker, I would ask today whether you would like to fly with an experienced pilot or an inexperienced pilot? Or would you like to go to an experienced dentist or an inexperienced dentist?  Today, I rise in opposition to all the proposals that will be debated here for term limits on Members of this body as a direct undermining of our Constitution. There are many days here when I know I am the only voice the people in my district have here in the Congress of the United States, and I know that I am better, I am smarter, I am more experienced than I was when first elected.  I think it is important to say for the record that the problem of politics in Washington isn't the number of years that people are elected. It is the amount of money that is being put into campaigns, trying to influence people's views when they get elected here.  Campaign financing reform is not in the contract. It is one of the important missing elements in the contract. It does not matter if you serve here for 6 years or 60 years. If we do not limit and control the money that is controling this political process, term limits won't matter.  For you say in whose interest is it to have term limits? In whose interest is to have juvenile representation here, to have constant upheaval where Members do not even know one another on the floor?  There has been a two-thirds change in this Chamber just in the last 6 years. In whose interest is it to have this place in constant upheaval?  We have had turnover. People have been thrown out of office. But, for one, I do not want to give up John Glenn in the Senate. Who knows more about the defense of this Nation? Or Ralph Regula of Ohio on trade or Sam Nunn and Jack Murtha on defense?  Or even though I do not agree with these gentleman, John Chafee in the Senate and Bill Archer in this House on tax and budget policy? Or Pat Leahy on agriculture or Nicky Rahall on mining or Alan Simpson with that acrid sense of humor that sometimes keeps us in balance here or Olympia Snowe in the Senate or Lee Hamilton or Dale Bumpers or Ron Dellums or [[Page H3812]] Richard Lugar on foreign policy or Jerry Solomon on veterans?  I, for one, do not want to undermine the Constitution. I, for one, want a blend of experience and people who cannot be bought in this Chamber.  I do not support term limits. It undermines the Constitution, and we ought to stand up for what is right for the American people and once and for all put a limit on campaign spending.                          ____________________
