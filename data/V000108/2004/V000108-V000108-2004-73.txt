Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the many accomplishments of the Hammond Council Parent Teacher Association (PTA) as it celebrates the PTA's 2004 Founders' Day. This very important occasion will be celebrated on Friday, February 13, 2004 at the Dynasty Banquet Hall in Hammond, Indiana.  The National PTA was founded in 1897 by Ms. Alice McLellan Birney and Ms. Phoebe Apperson Hearst. In 1970, the National Congress of Colored Parents, which was founded by Ms. Selena Sloan Butler, joined the National PTA. Due to the vision and determination of these women, the organization has taken the lead in promoting the welfare of children throughout the country.  The Hammond Council PTA was chartered on April 30, 1945 as a member of the Indiana PTA and the National PTA. Being a member of the state as well as national PTA, the Hammond Council has provided continuous support and resources to local families which focus on the health and education of children. The Hammond Council has continued the legacy of the PTA's founders through many projects such as Hammond's Survive Alive Program which has developed and saved the lives of many students and their families.  Each year, the Hammond Council also recognizes the top ten students from the four Hammond high schools through a special scholarship program. The recipients are honored in partnership with the School City of Hammond and the Hammond Rotary Club. Along with their leadership in their local community, members from the Hammond Council have also gone on to serve as officers for the Indiana PTA. Some of the local leaders include, past President Ms. Beverly Zawadski, the current President Ms. Marilyn Jones, the President Elect Ms. Dee Jones, and the Secretary Ms. Pat Taylor.  Each year in February, the PTA celebrates Founders' Day to recognize the accomplishments and dedication of teachers, volunteers, administrators, and community leaders who have made a positive impact on their community. During the celebration on Friday, February 13, the Hammond Council PTA will announce its 2004 winners of the 15th Volunteer of the Year Award, the Outstanding Local Unit Award, and the Membership and National PTA Lifetime Achievement Awards.  Mr. Speaker, as this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Hammond Council PTA and all its members as they celebrate the 2004 Founders' Day. Their many great accomplishments and service to the children of the Hammond community, as well as throughout the state, is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
