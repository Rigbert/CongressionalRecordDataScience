President, my dear friend of over 30 years, Michael Berman, has just written his memoir, ``Living Large: A Big Man's Ideas on Weight, Success and Acceptance.'' Mike possesses one of the most astute political minds along with a generous heart and kind soul. I am proud of his courage in writing about his struggle with weight control and hope his book will encourage others to honestly confront and overcome their weight challenges.  This week, both The Washington Post and Roll Call reviewed Mike's book. I ask unanimous consent that those articles be printed at this point in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Roll Call, Mar. 14, 2006]                         Weighing in on Weight               (By Elizabeth Brotherton, Roll Call Staff)       Michael Berman is kind of a big deal.       Now president of the lobbying firm the Duberstein Group      Inc., Berman has worked on every Democratic presidential      campaign since 1964. He was even deputy chief of staff to      former Vice President Walter Mondale.       That's on top of all the nonprofit boards he sits on.       But to Berman, there has been one lingering thing that has      followed him all those years: his weight.       See, Michael Berman is kind of a big deal.       ``Food,'' Berman said. ``It's like a drug.''       Berman's lifelong struggle with food is chronicled in his      new book, ``Living Large: A Big Man's Ideas on Weight,      Success, and Acceptance,'' set to hit bookstores Wednesday.       Berman said he wrote the book primarily because in all his      years of reading weight loss books, he rarely found one about      overweight men. Even more rare was trying to find a book      written by an overweight man.       So he decided to provide that voice.       ``I'm hoping that some people will come to understand more      of what fat people go through,'' Berman said.       Berman said the book, which he co-authored with writer      Laurence Shames, took seven years to complete.       ``It really became kind of a vehicle to help me,'' Berman      said of the book. ``It kind of helped me stay on path with my      weight management.''       Berman, who has struggled with food since he was a child,      has always been conscious of his weight. He has tried every      diet imaginable, he said, from South Beach and Atkins to even      undergoing two hospitalized starvation diets. He once      hallucinated cheeseburgers.       But whenever he managed to get his weight under control, it      would shoot back up again.       The 66-year-old tipped the scales at 317 pounds in January      1999. (He now weights 240 pounds, he said.)       ``I really have the view, for really fat people like myself      there's a significant psychological component as to why we      are fat,'' Berman said. ``There's some issues, some of which      kind of get revealed in the book.''       ``Living Large'' reads a lot like a biography. Berman talks      about his childhood, meeting his wife and his career in      politics.       He also includes first-hand views from his wife, Carol, on      how his heavy stature has affected their marriage.       ``One day, I said to her, `Why don't you write a chapter      called: `Living with a fat man: A Spouse's Perspective '' he      said. ``I just came to realize that I had an enormous effect      on her.''       Only parts of his wife's chapter made it into the book (the      entire section is available on Berman's Web site,      www.mikelivinglarge.com). But Berman also manages to touch on      some serious issues.       For example: Why did he gain weight at certain times? How      has his weight affected his life and the lives of those -     around him?       Plus, he deals with the issues behind his significant      weight, issues he has kept secret for quite some time.       ``I feel like, OK. I've shared this stuff with the      psychologist I had all these years, and I'm really      comfortable with myself,'' Berman said. ``I just became more      and more comfortable.''       The book's release comes at a time when the United States      appears to be losing the war against obesity.       About 119 million adults in the United States--64.5 percent      of the adult population--are either overweight or obese,      according to the nonprofit group Trust for America's Health.       Obesity has been linked to a slew of serious health      problems, from diabetes and heart disease to strokes and some      cancers, according to the Centers for Disease Control.       That means the issue will be relevant--and political--for      quite some time, Berman said.       ``It's going to kind of be an issue of, `Are we going to      apply resources to beginning education campaigns to show      young people that we are going to do something about it?' ''      he said. ``I think it's increasingly going to be a political      issue. But it is going to be a resource issue.''       Berman said that he now has created a manageable situation      for controlling his weight. He monitors his daily calorie      intake in a meticulous journal, and he regularly gets on the      scale.       ``I'm never going to be a thin person,'' Berman said.      ``But, by golly, maybe I can keep (my weight) in a somewhat      healthy range.''                                       ____               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 13, 2006]The Measure of a Man: Lobbyist Michael Berman Comes to Terms With Size                       and Self in ``Living Large''                       (By Laura Sessions Stepp)       For more than six decades, Michael Berman has lived as a      fat person. At 5 feet 9 inches, he has weighed as much as 332      pounds. He has been known to eat three racks of ribs at one      sitting, or a 40-ounce steak, or a whole box of saltines. In      1986, after dropping a few pounds, he spent $2,100 on three      custom-made, pinstriped suits in gray, blue and brown. By the      time the suits were ready, 10 weeks later, they no longer      fit. Eleven years after that he gave them away, having never      been able to wear them.       A highly successful political campaigner and Washington      lobbyist, Berman, 66, doesn't deny the dangers of fatness or      the urgency of encouraging people to exercise and eat      healthier. He acknowledges that with 60 percent of the U.S.      population overweight or obese, and the rate of obesity      increasing particularly dramatically in children, being fat      has serious consequences for the health of individuals and      the economy. He'd like to see government and private      resources used for a public education campaign similar to      that for smoking and seat-belt use.       But forget the notion that fat people can become slim, he      says in a part memoir, part self-help book scheduled for      release this week. They can--and should--manage their weight.      They can--and should--find an exercise program they can stick      with. But fat adults will always be fat. They are in the      grips of a disease over which, in the end, they do not have      complete control.       This is not likely to be a popular message among those who      manage their daily lives with BlackBerrys, filter out porn on      their kids' computers, block negative information coming from      government sources. Is he trying to say that the fatties who      sprawl over airplane seats could not shrink to a reasonable      size if they just stopped wolfing down those Big Macs?       Yes, that's what he's saying. ``The idea that you can slim      down by willpower is a bunch of horse manure,'' he said. If      ``nonfat'' Americans could be convinced of this, perhaps      they'd start relating better to fat Americans. And if fat      Americans understood why they're fat and accepted that they      will always have to shop at Rochester Big and Tall or Lane      Bryant, they could begin ``Living Large,'' as Berman called      his book.       A Minnesota native, Berman has lived large for a long time      among Washington's elite. He served as counsel and deputy      chief of staff to former vice president Walter Mondale, acted      as scheduler for six Democratic conventions and, in 1989,      formed a bipartisan lobbying firm that today counts General      Motors and British Petroleum among its clients. During the      Clinton years, he was on a ``special access list'' that gave      him virtually unrestricted entree to the White House. He and      Carol, his wife of 40 years, live in the gracious Colonnade      condominiums in Northwest Washington and entertain      powerful friends they've accumulated over the years.       Being a BMOC means you're treated differently than the      masses. The Palm restaurant, noted for its creamed      vegetables, serves Berman steamed spinach and broccoli. The      chef at I Ricchi created a dish of roasted vegetables for      him. The maitre d' at Georgetown's Four Seasons restaurant      knows that for breakfast meetings he prefers the table one      row from the windows near the center of the dining room; the      servers never place a basket of toast on his table.       But politics is dangerous for anyone hoping to maintain a      reasonable weight, Berman says over breakfast at the Four      Seasons.       ``The cocktail parties are not difficult,'' he says, his      shirt sleeves pushed up to reveal a large yellow Corum      wristwatch. He attacks a dish of large blueberries, then an      egg-white omelet and four wide slices of turkey bacon. ``I      can get a glass of Diet Coke, mingle, and only occasionally      grab an hors d'oeuvre as it goes by. What is hard are the      large sitdown dinners where you can't control the menu. Or      where you're with 3,000 other people, you order a vegetarian      meal, it takes forever to arrive and meanwhile there's a      basket in front of you full of bread.''       He is comfortable with being different, now. But he has      suffered through countless eight swings, 20 diet programs, a      kidney infection and knee surgery. And it has taken him eight      years of counseling, the careful attention of a personal      trainer/nutritionist and the sustained support of his wife to      get to that place.       Berman first realized he was not just husky, but really      fat, when he was 13, weighed about 170 pounds and was      standing in the shower of the boys' locker room one day after      gym class in his home town of Duluth, Minn.       ``I hated gym,'' he recalls in ``Living Large: A Big Man's      Ideas on Weight, Success and Acceptance,'' written with      Laurence Shames. ``I couldn't climb ropes, couldn't do      pushups. . . . I dreaded being naked in the shower with the      other boys. . . . I hid as much as possible, showered as      quickly as I could, and pulled a shirt on even before my skin      was fully dry.''       On the morning in question, as he stood in the open      showers, a boy next to him grabbed his chest, saying he      wanted to know what it felt like to touch a girl's breast.      That was just one of thousands of indignities he would      encounter or bring upon himself.       In his sophomore year at the University of Minnesota at      Duluth, his fraternity brothers determined that he should      lose his virginity at a party in a cabin by a lake and      enlisted the help of an attractive woman a couple of years      older than he. She took his hand and led him into a bedroom.      She lay down and motioned for him to join her. As he did, he      realized she had passed out, having drunk herself silly      before having sex with a 250-pound 19-year-old.       One afternoon in law school, reading in a wooden armchair,      he started to get up only to realize that he was stuck in the      chair.       ``My body had essentially flowed out to fill the space      between the arms and seat,'' he writes. ``My hips were      captured; my bottom stayed glued to the chair and the whole      thing lifted up with me as I tried to stand. . . . I felt all      eyes on me, understood that people didn't want to look but,      as at a train wreck, couldn't turn away.''       He decided to play the clown. ``Still crouched over, taking      small, constricted steps, I carried [the chair] across the      room, somewhat like a turtle with its shell, and sat down      once again.'' Today he winces at all the times he played the      jolly fat man: leading college cheerleaders onto the football      field by pedaling a miniature girl's bike; assuming the role      of Santa Claus at White House Christmas parties, the Easter      Bunny at the vice president's residence. Perhaps his      experience in acting the fool is why he was able to ignore      the advice of a friend who tried to steer him away from      writing a book about his fatness, saying it would be      ``undignified.''       Undignified? His pal, like so many thinner people, didn't      know from undignified.       Berman realized pretty quickly as a teen that in order to      be taken seriously and make something of his life, he would      have to develop talents other than vaudeville. In the family      rec room, his parents taught him ballroom dancing--the first      thing, he writes, that his rotund body was good at. He took      up musical theater in high school and continued it in      college. He managed his first political campaign in junior      high for a girl running for president of the student council.      She lost, but the campaign taught him he could succeed in      politics behind the scenes. He didn't need to be cute, just      hardworking, shrewd and resourceful.       He would have preferred to be a football star. ``Over time,      though--and largely without my noticing from day to day--I      realized that something sort of wonderful had been      happening,'' he writes. ``My various `compensations' had been      adding up to a pretty good approximation of the sort of life      I feared I'd never have. I was busy; I had friends; I was      appreciated and respected for things I was good at.''       One of the things he was, and is, good at, says wife Carol,      is listening to and valuing women.       In the book, Berman calls Carol ``the strongest and most      stable component'' of his life. But their first date almost      didn't happen. It was Aug. 1, 1964, and Berman, 26, had been      hired to lead a voter registration drive in a Duluth suburb      for President Lyndon Johnson's reelection campaign. After      swearing off blind dates at least half a dozen times, he      arrived at the door of the apartment for yet one more try,      this time with Carol Podhoretz, a 24-year-old speech      pathologist.       She greeted him in a nice dress, stockings and high heels.      Taking one look at his 288-pound frame, she announced that      she had a headache and wouldn't be able to go out. Here we go      again, he thought. But then she invited him in for a drink.       ``He was big, and I reacted like a lot of young women would      have reacted,'' Carol Berman recalls in a phone conversation.      ``He asked me why I worked as a speech pathologist and I      really liked the reaction I got when I said I liked to help      people. He said, `I love that.' ''       About an hour into their conversation, Carol announced that      her headache had disappeared and she'd like to go out as      planned. They dined at his favorite restaurant, then headed      to a club to dance. That was all it took. Carol, a former      Arthur Murray instructor, was as graceful on her feet as he      was. ``Somewhere between the cha-cha and the Lindy,'' he      writes, ``we began to have the feeling that it would be nice      to see more of each other.''       They went out on 29 of the next 30 nights. Carol said she      found him ``adorable,'' and a man with ``great lips.'' In      early December, while they were dancing together and a little      bit tipsy, she whispered, ``You know, we should just get      married.''       ``Fine,'' he said.       Life together since has been good, although Carol had to      make a couple of what she calls ``accommodations.'' The      hardest for her was not being able to have children. Six      years after they married, she began trying to conceive. For      several years after that, she endured various painful      interventions, none of which worked. A fertility specialist      told Michael and her that his sperm count might be a factor;      fat men tend to have a lower number. For Michael, not having      children wasn't that big a deal. For Carol, who eventually      had a hysterectomy because of fibroid tumors, it was. ``It is      still what I consider a loss,'' she said.       Michael gradually realized during these years how hard      politics was on a man trying to shed pounds. He had developed      sharp political skills that were in demand at the highest      levels of political and corporate Washington: making someone      feel as if he or she were the only person in the room, paying      attention to detail, distilling and delivering big ideas in a      few seconds. What he couldn't     do was turn down the doughnuts, chips, big steaks and      potatoes that are the staple of political life. By the time      his first Democratic convention was over, the famous Chicago      convention in 1968, his weight exceeded 300 pounds for the      first time.       Convention years were tough on the marriage. Michael and      Carol first realized this in 1989, on their 25th wedding      anniversary. On a visit to the beach, Michael brought Carol a      handful of shells, put them on a board and suggested she use      them to show how happy she was in their marriage for each of      their 25 years. The year 1965 got a big shell; 1968 a little      shell; 1984 a shard.       That was the year Walter Mondale lost the election to      Ronald Reagan, and Berman weighed 330 pounds. He was wearing      a size 58 suite, consuming up to five pounds of red meat a      week along with up to 18 eggs. He couldn't walk a city block      without panting. He developed sleep apnea, where his body      would forget to breathe. Carol told him he looked green.      Scared for his health for the first time in his life, he      enrolled in a Pritiken Longevity Center in Pennsylvania. He      lost 112 pounds--and that's when he ordered the custom suits.       Berman never again weighed as much as he did in 1984. In      1989, he joined Republican Ken Duberstein--who had served as      Reagan's chief of staff--in forming the Duberstein Group. He      started psychotheraphy in 1990 and, several years after,      employed a private nutritionist and trainer.       Still, his weight seesawed. By 1997--a year after he was      diagnosed with a kidney problem--he was up to 309 pounds.       In 1998, on the advice of a friend, he started jotting down      thoughts and memories about being fat with the idea of      writing a book someday. The exercise became, not      surprisingly, an obsession. He read scientific reports and      researched cultures of the past in which fatness was      considered a symbol of wisdom, serenity and wealth. One day      he walked into a pharmacy and bought 22 different diet aids,      one of everything on the shelf, to investigate how effective      they are. His conclusion: They aren't.       He read that for some people, fatness is genetic. But he      had researched his family tree; that wasn't true for him. So      he began to develop his own theory on why people are fat.       The easy answer, of course, is that they take in more      calories than they burn. But then it gets more complicated,      he writes. Each person's metabolism is different. He, his      sister and his parents all ate a lot of his mother's      delicious briskets and lamb chops and none of them      exercised much. But he was the only one who got fat.       Emotions, buried for many years, play a role, too. From the      age of 4, he sneaked cookies, crackers and anything else he      could into his bedroom.       ``I could not control my appetite because something was      driving me,'' he writes, ``something that was beyond the      reach of willpower, outside the realm of reason.''       He and his psychologist came to believe that his compulsion      started partly as a reaction to his mother. Early in his      life, she showed her affection by cooking rich meals and he      showed his affection by eating lots of it. As he got older      and heftier in early adolescence, she started withholding      food and he ate as a way of asserting his emerging will.       Later in life, dropping out of weight-loss programs even      though he was losing weight, he had to confront another      factor: He was fat-dependent.       Fat was something he could hide behind, an excuse for not      doing things that he was afraid of doing. For example, in      high school, he felt anxious around girls. By making himself      fat and unattractive, he could approach them as potential      friends, not girlfriends.       Eventually he had to admit that he was an addict. But      unlike alcoholics or drug users, he couldn't go cold turkey.       ``The most difficult thing about a food addiction is that      you can't give up food,'' he said at breakfast.       He pulled out a tiny spiral notebook in which he records      everything he eats each day and the total calorie count, as      well as how much he exercises.       ``March 1--1,610 calories. March 2--2,295. March 3--2,500.      March 4--4,465.''       What happened on March 4? He and Carol attended a dinner      party at pollster Peter Hart's. He couldn't resist the      chocolate cake. ``I ate probably eight ounces of chocolate,''      he admitted. ``But I don't beat myself up anymore. I knew I'd      be heavier the next morning so the next couple of days I'd be      careful.''       A couple of years ago, he wouldn't have been so sanguine.      But if there was one thing he had learned in writing his      book, it was this: ``Losing weight is only one aspect of      dealing with the reality of being a fat person--and not      necessarily even the most important one. Managing fatness      means accepting ourselves as who we are. . . . in short,      learning to live a full and satisfying life at whatever      weight and size we happen to be.''       Two days after Hart's party, he was back down to 1,830      calories.                          ____________________
