Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Miller, my good friend, for yielding time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1388, the GIVE Act. People are hurting. Americans are having to choose between paying their mortgages and putting food on the table. In these tough times, it's more important than ever that we, as American citizens, yield back to those in need.  National service becomes ever more important when people are hurting, when people are in need. We need to do more to show our appreciation to people who get out there, they get in the way, they stand up, they speak up, they speak out. They work hard to get their hands dirty helping their neighbor.  The GIVE Act is a great step forward for national service. However, we also need to make the AmeriCorps Education Award, in my estimation, tax exempt. We need to do more to encourage and reward Americans who answer the call of national service. It is a call that we responded to in 1961 when President Kennedy issued a call for the Peace Corps. And it is a call now in 2009 when President Barack Obama is urging national service.  I urge all of my colleagues to support national service and vote ``yes'' on this important piece of legislation.
