 Mr. Chairman, the position taken by the Republicans in opposition to the Conyers amendment is going to give free trade a bad name. If foreign corporations want to sell their products to Americans in America, they should be subject to our laws.  Consider this possibility: There is a collision in my hometown of Springfield between a car made in Detroit and one made in Tokyo. People are severely injured. There is a suspicion that one of these cars had some type of defect in its brakes, for example, but we are not sure which one. So the person who is injured goes to court and sues both the American car company and the Japanese car company. Guess what? You can discover all the documents in the world from the American car company to find out whether you have a claim. But as soon as you try to get the Japanese car makers to supply this information, they say, as the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] said, ``No, no, no, it is a matter of international treaty. You can't find this out. You have to go to Tokyo.''  We bought the car in Springfield, but you have to go to Tokyo for discovery. Let me tell you what we are talking about here is concealment and evasion. If my colleagues want to get up here, wave their American flags, and vote ``Buy American'' day in and day out, for goodness sakes, take a look at what this amendment says. If foreign corporations want to sell products to American consumers, why in the world should they not comply with American law?
