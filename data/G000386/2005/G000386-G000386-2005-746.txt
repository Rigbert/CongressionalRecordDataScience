 President, I wish to recognize today the passing of a fellow Iowan who has fallen in service to this country. Sergeant John W. Miller, of the Iowa Army National Guard Company, A, 224th Engineer Battalion, was killed by a sniper on April 12 in Ar Ramadi, Iraq, while providing security for a road-clearing operation. He was 21 years old and is survived by a father, Dennis, two brothers, James and Nathan, and a sister, Jessica, who live in the Burlington, IA area.  John Miller attended West Burlington High School and received his high school diploma from Des Moines Area Community College. He joined the Iowa Army National Guard in March of 2002 and was mobilized to go to Iraq in October of 2004. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with ``M'' device for Mobilization. He was also promoted to sergeant posthumously.  I offer my condolences to John's family and friends. Sergeant Miller's battalion leader wrote that John ``willnever be forgotten.'' I ask all of my colleagues and fellow Americans to join me in fulfilling that promise of remembrance. We must remember John and his comrades who have fallen, their lives, and their sacrifices; for a Nation that forgets her heroes will lose her direction, her strength, and her spirit.                          ____________________[Pages S4390-S4391]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES                        Sergeant John W.
