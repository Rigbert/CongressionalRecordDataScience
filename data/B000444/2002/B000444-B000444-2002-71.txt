 President, prior to the August recess, the Committee on Foreign Relations reported several bills without written report. At the time, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates on the bills were not available. I ask unanimous consent that the CBO estimates on these bills, S. 1777, H.R. 4558, and H.R. 2121, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2002.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1777, the      International Disability and Victims of Landmines, Civil      Strife, and Warfare Assistance Act of 2002.       The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Joseph C.      Whitehill, who can be reached at 226-2840, and Jeanne M. De      Sa, who can be reached at 226-9010.           Sincerely,                                                Barry B. Anderson,                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.     S. 1777--International Disability and Victims of Landmines,          Civil Strife, and Warfare Assistance Act of 2002       Summary: S. 1777 would authorize the President to furnish      assistance to individuals with disabilities in foreign      countries, including victims of landmines and other war      injuries. The bill also would authorize the Centers for      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide such      assistance, and would authorize the Department of Veterans      Affairs (VA) to provide advice and expertise to U.S. agencies      and private voluntary agencies undertaking such programs.      Currently, the U.S. Agency for International Development      (USAID), the CDC, and VA provide some assistance in this area      under more general authority. CBO estimates that implementing      S. 1777 would cost about $4 million over the 2003-2005      period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts.      Because S. 1777 would not affect direct spending or receipts,      pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.       S. 1777 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: For this      estimate, CBO assumes that the legislation will be enacted      near the beginning of fiscal year 2003, that the estimated      amounts will be appropriated each year, and that outlays will      follow historical spending patterns. The budgetary impact of      S. 1777 is shown in the following table. The costs of this      legislation fall within budget     functions 550 (Health) and 700 (veterans benefits and      services).------------------------------------------------------------------------                                         By fiscal year, in millions of                                                   dollars--                                      ----------------------------------                                        2003   2004   2005   2006   2007------------------------------------------------------------------------              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION Estimated authorization level........      2      2      0      0      0Estimated outlays....................      1      2      1      0      0------------------------------------------------------------------------       Basis of estimate: S. 1777 would authorize the President to      furnish assistance to individuals with disabilities in      foreign countries, including victims of landmines and other      war injuries. Under more general authorities in current law,      USAID, the CDC, and VA provide roughly $15 million a year in      assistance in this area. The bill would expand current      programs.       U.S. Agency for International Development.--Section 3 would      authorize assistance to individuals with disabilities,      including victims of landmines and other victims of warfare      and civil strife. USAID currently provides such assistance,      primarily through the Patrick Leahy War Victims Fund, with a      funding level of $10 million each year. CBO estimates that      under S. 1777, funding for individuals with disabilities      would continue at that rate.       Centers for Disease Control.--Section 4 would authorize the      appropriation of such sums as may be necessary in fiscal      years 2003 and 2004 for the CDC to conduct programs in      foreign countries for individuals with disabilities,      including persons injured by landmines and civil strife.      Those programs could include research on trauma and      rehabilitation, evaluating treatment interventions,      developing medical instruction tools for responding to      traumatic injuries, and facilitating and training peer-     support networks. The bill would authorize the CDC to provide      grants to nongovernmental organizations to carry out      research, prevention activities, and public awareness      campaigns, as well as other activities to share information      about research on limb loss and best practices in treatment      programs.       Under current law, the CDC provides $5 million a year for      some of the activities authorized by the bill, most of which      are directed toward a network for victims of landmines. S.      1777 would authorize the CDC to carry out additional      activities such as trauma research and evaluation of medical      treatments. According to the CDC, those additional activities      would require $2 million a year in additional funding. Thus,      CBO estimates that the bill would increase agency spending by      $4 million over the 2003-2005 period, subject to      appropriation of the necessary amounts.       Department of Veterans Affairs.--Section 5 would authorize      VA to provide advice and expertise to federal agencies and      technical assistance to private voluntary organizations      (PVOs) with respect to planning, development, operation, and      evaluation of landmine assistance, research, and prevention      programs. The VA currently provides advice to other federal      agencies on a nonreimbursable basis. The bill would authorize      VA to provide technical assistance to PVOs on a reimbursable      basis. Based on information from VA, CBO estimates the cost      and collections from providing this technical assistance      would be less than $500,000 a year.       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1777      contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as      defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets of state,      local, or tribal governments.       Previous CBO estimate: On November 8, 2001, CBO prepared an      estimate for H.R. 3169, the International Disability and      Victims of Landmines, Civil Strife, and Warfare Assistance      Act of 2001, as ordered reported by the House Committee on      International Relations on November 1, 2001. That bill would      authorize the appropriation of $15 million in 2002 and 2003      for programs to assist individuals with disabilities,      including victims of landmines and other victims of warfare      and civil strife administered by USAID and such sums as may      be necessary in 2002-2004 for the CDC. H.R. 3169 also would      authorize VA to provide advice and expertise to federal      agencies and technical assistance to PVOs with respect to      planning, development, operation, and evaluation of landmine      programs. CBO's estimate of the costs associated with the CDC      and VA programs are the same in both bills.       Estimate prepared by: Federal spending: USAID--Joseph C.      Whitehill (226-2840), CDC--Jeanne M. De Sa (226-9010), VA--     Sam Papenfuss (226-2840); impact on state, local, and tribal      governments: Greg Waring (226-3220); impact on the private      sector: Paige Piper/Bach (226-2940).       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.                                  ____                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                  Washington, DC, August 14, 2002.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 2121, the Russia      Democracy Act of 2002.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Joseph C.      Whitehall, who can be reached at 226-2840.           Sincerely,                                                Robert A. Sunshine                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.     H.R. 2121--Russia Democracy Act of 2002       Summary: H.R. 2121 would expand the U.S. government's      authority to provide assistance to democratic institutions      and media in Russia and would authorize the appropriation of      $50 million in 2003 for programs to strengthen the rule of      law and an independent media in that country. (In 2002,      appropriations for various types of assistance to the      independent states of the former Soviet Union totaled $784      million.) Assuming the appropriation of the authorized      amount, CBO estimates that implementing the act would cost      about $50 million over the 2003-2007 period. Enacting H.R.      2121 would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore,      pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.       H.R. 2121 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impact of H.R. 2121 is shown in the following      table. The estimate assumes that the authorized amount would      be appropriated and that outlays would follow historical      spending patterns for similar activities. The costs of this      legislation fall within budget function 150 (international      affairs).------------------------------------------------------------------------                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                               -----------------------------------------                                 2002   2003   2004   2005   2006   2007------------------------------------------------------------------------              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION Authorization level...........      0     50      0      0      0      0Estimated outlays.............      0      9     21     11      5      2------------------------------------------------------------------------       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: H.R. 2121      contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as      defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets of state,      local, or tribal governments.       Previous CBO estimate: On November 6, 2001, CBO prepared an      estimate for H.R. 2121 as ordered reported by the House      Committee on International Relations on November 1, 2001.      That earlier version of the legislation would have authorized      the appropriation of $50 million in 2002.       Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Joseph C. Whitehill      (226-2840); impact on state, local, and tribal governments:      Greg Waring (225-3220); impact on the private sector: Paige      Piper/Bach (226-2940).

Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4558, an act to      extend the Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training Program.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mark      Grabowicz, who can be reached at 226-2860.           Sincerely,                                                 Barry B. Anderson                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.     H.R. 4558--An act to extend the Irish Peace Process Cultural          and Training Program       Summary: The Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training      Program Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-319) provides      nonimmigrant visas for young adults from certain areas of      Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Those      individuals work or study in the United States for up to      three years. This program is currently scheduled to terminate      on October 1, 2005. H.R. 4558 would extend it until October      1, 2006.       CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4558 would cost about      $4 million in fiscal year 2006 for the Department of State to      administer this program, subject to the availability of      appropriations. Enacting the legislation also would affect      direct spending and receipts, but CBO estimates that any such      effects would not be significant. Because the act would      effect direct spending and receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures      would apply.       H.R. 4558 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal      governments.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impact of H.R. 4558 is shown in the following      table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget      functions 150 (international affairs) and 750 (administration      of justice).------------------------------------------------------------------------                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                               -----------------------------------------                                 2002   2003   2004   2005   2006   2007------------------------------------------------------------------------Spending under current law:    Estimated authorization         4      4      4      4      0      0     level \1\................

The estimated  authorization levels for 2003 through 2005 are CBO baseline estimates.       Since the program's inception, there have been about 250      participants each year. Thus, CBO estimates that any effects      on fees collected by the Immigration and Naturalization      Service (INS) or the State Department as a result of      extending the program would be insignificant. INS fees are      classified as offsetting receipts (a credit against direct      spending), and the State Department fees are classified as      governmental receipts (i.e., revenues).       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and      Emergency Deficit Control Act specifies pay-as-you-go      procedures for legislation affecting direct spending and      receipts. Those procedures would apply to H.R. 4558 because      it would affect both direct spending and receipts, but CBO      estimates that the annual amount of such changes would not be      significant.       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: H.R. 4558      contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as      defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or      tribal governments.       Previous CBO estimate: On July 22, 2002, CBO transmitted a      cost estimate for H.R. 4558 as ordered reported by the House      Committee on the Judiciary on July 17, 2002. The two versions      of the legislation are identical, as are our cost estimates.       Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Mark Grabowicz (226-     2860); impact on state, local, and tribal governments: Angela      Seitz (225-3220); impact on the private sector: Paige Piper/     Bach (226-2960).       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.                          ____________________
