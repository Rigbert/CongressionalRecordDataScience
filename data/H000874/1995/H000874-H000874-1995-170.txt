Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleague from California in support of the four joint resolutions before us today. They were all passed out of committee unanimously and will serve to continue the excellent stewardship that has been the tradition of the Smithsonian Institution.  The four resolutions before us are complementary and will bring a diverse group of skills and experience to the board. Together, the nominees bring backgrounds in the sciences, arts, business, and the Federal Government.  The Smithsonian Institution is the crown jewel among our Nation's fine museums and research facilities. Every day, hundreds of Americans, and indeed, visitors from around the world, visit the Smithsonian museums and marvel at their wonders. Whether it is school children seeing the remarkable pictures from the Hubble telescope at the Air and Space Museum and starting on their journey into the marvels of science or a grandmother seeing Dorothy's red shoes that she first saw years ago on the magical silver screen, the Smithsonian is like no other place.  The first resolution, House Joint Resolution 69, reappoints Homer A. Neal, vice president for research at the University of Michigan. House Joint Resolution 110 appoints Howard Baker, former Senator and Chief of Staff to President Reagan. House Joint Resolution 111 appoints Anne Harnoncourt, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and House Joint Resolution 112 appoints Louis Gerstner, chairman of the board and CEO of IBM Corp.  The Smithsonian is governed by a 17-member board and all of these nominations are noncontroversial and worthy of this House's full support. I urge my colleagues to support each of these measures and am pleased to join my friend from California in recommending these distinguished nominees to the House.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
