President, today I would like to express my disappointment about a provision that the Majority chose to include in the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, S.976. In Section 305 of the Act, the ``Charitable Choice'' provision permits all religious institutions, including pervasively religious organizations, such as churches and other houses of worship, to use taxpayer dollars to advance their religious mission. Given the Supreme Court precedent, I believe this provision is Constitutionally suspect and be subject to greater review when this bill goes to Conference with its House counterpart.  Although charitable choice has already become law as a part of welfare reform and the Community Services Block Grant, CSBG, portion of the Human Services Reauthorization Act, efforts are being made to expand this change to every program that receives federal financial assistance. The inclusion of charitable choice in this legislation is particularly disturbing since, unlike its application to the intermittent services provided under Welfare Reform and CSBG, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) funds are used to provide substance abuse treatment which is ongoing, involves direct counseling of beneficiaries and is often clinical in nature. In the context of these programs it would be difficult if not impossible to segregate religious indoctrination from the social service.  I agree with the Majority that faith-based organizations have an important and necessary role to play in combating many of our nation's social ills, including youth violence, homelessness, and substance abuse. In fact, I have seen first-hand the impact that faith-based organizations such as Catholic Charities have on delivering certain services to people in need in my own state. By enabling faith-based organizations to join in the battle against substance abuse, we add another powerful tool in our ongoing efforts to help people move from dependence to independence.  However, although there are great benefits that come with allowing religious organizations to provide social services with federal funds, the Vice President recently reminded us that ``clear and strict safeguards'' must exist to ensure that the dividing linebetween church and state is not erased. Even the front runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, Governor George W. Bush, acknowledged to the New York Times that these safeguards are necessary: ``Bush said . . . that federal money would pay for services delivered by faith-based groups, not for the religious teachings espoused by the groups.''  In my home state of Rhode Island there is a tradition of religious tolerance and respect for the boundaries of religion and government. Indeed, Roger Williams, who was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his religious beliefs, founded Providence in 1636. The colony served as a refuge where all could come to worship as their conscience dictated without interference from the state. Understandably, Rhode Islanders remain mindful of mixing religion with its political system.  Mr. President, I am particularly concerned that without proper safeguards, well-intentioned proposals to help religious organizations aid needy populations, might actually harm the First Amendment's principle of separation of church and state. For example, the charitable choice provision creates a disturbing new avenue for employment discrimination and proselytization in programs funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Under current law, many religiously-affiliated nonprofit organizations already provide government-funded social services without employment discrimination and without proselytization. However, the legislation before us extends title VII's religious exemption to cover the hiring practices of organizations participating in SAMHSA funded programs. As the Majority's report language points out, even if the organization is solely funded by SAMHSA, it may ``make employment decisions based upon religious reasons.''  For example, a federally funded substance abuse treatment program run by a church could fire or refuse to hire an individual who has remarried without properly validating his or her second marriage in the eyes of that church--even if he or she is a well-trained and successful substance abuse counselor.  This is not an entirely hypothetical example. In Little v. Wuerl, 929 F.2d 944 (3d Circ. 1991) the Court held that ``Congress intended the explicit exemptions to title VII to enable religious organizations to create and maintain communities composed solely of individuals faithful to their doctrinal practices, whether or not every individual plays a direct role in the organization's religious activities.'' The Court concluded that ``the permission to employ persons `of a particular religion' includes permission to employ only persons whose beliefs and conduct are consistent with the employer's religious precepts.'' This may be acceptable when the religious organization is using its own money, but when it is using federal funds, with explicit prohibitions against proselytization, this kind of discrimination is a cause of considerable concern.  During markup, Senator Kennedy and I introduced an amendment that would have addressed this issue by including important safeguards and protections for beneficiaries and employees of SAMHSA funded programs.  The Reed-Kennedy amendment would have removed the bill's provision that allows religious organizations to require that employees hired for SAMHSA funded programs must subscribe to the organization's religious tenets and teachings. Since section 305 prohibits religious organizations from proselytizing in conjunction with the dissemination of social services under SAMHSA programs, it is contradictory to permit religious organizations to require that their employees subscribe to the organization's tenets and teachings. Second, the amendment would have eliminated the bill's provision that extends title VII's religious exemption to cover the hiring practices of organizations participating in SAMHSA funded programs.  Ultimately, the modest proposal would not have reduced the ability of religious groups to hire co-religionists or more actively participate in SAMHSA funded programs. It merely would have eliminated the explicit ability to discriminate in taxpayer funded employment and left to the courts the decision of whether employees who work on, or are paid through, government grants or contracts are exempt from the prohibition on religious employment discrimination. Unfortunately, the Majority chose to vote against including the important safeguards proposed in the Reed-Kennedy amendment.  For the last 30 years, federal civil rights laws have expanded employment opportunities and sought to counter discrimination in the workplace. I recognize that we need the assistance of religious organizations in the battle against substance abuse, but without a far more robust and informed debate must be far more circumspect of efforts to expand current exemptions to title VII.  Mr. President, I believe we should enlist the assistance of religious organizations without undermining constitutional principles and civil rights law. Accordingly, I am concerned that the charitable choice provision, though laudable in concept, would have disturbing practical and constitutional consequences. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters expressing the view of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations and the American Jewish Committee be printed in the Record so my colleagues may become more aware of these organizations' views on this matter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Office of Government and                                        International Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 1999.     Hon. Jack Reed,     U.S. Senate, 320 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: I write on behalf of the American Jewish      Committee, the nation's oldest human relations organization      with more than 100,000 members and supporters, to urge you to      place a hold on S. 976, the Substance Abuse Mental Health      Reauthorization Act, which includes ``charitable choice''      provisions that are both constitutionally flawed and bad      public policy.       The ``charitable choice'' provisions in S. 976 constitute      an unacceptable breach in the separation of church and state      that has played so crucial a role in ensuring the strength of      religion in America, and places a risk the quality of      healthcare services provided to individuals with chemical      abuse and dependency behavioral disorders.       To be sure, the history of social services in this country      began with religious institutions, and the partnership      between religiously affiliated institutions and government in      the provision of those services is a venerable one. Catholic      Charities, not to mention many Jewish agencies across this      land, have engaged in such partnerships for many years. Far      from objecting to that partnership, the American Jewish      Committee, in its 1990 Report on Sectarian Social Services      and Public Funding, termed the involvement of the religious      sector in publicly-funded social service provision as      ``desirable to the extent it is consistent with the      Establishment Clause. It creates options for those who wish      to receive the services, involves agencies and individuals      motivated to provide the services, and helps to avoid making      the government the sole provider of social benefits.''       What is new in the ``charitable choice'' arena is not the      notion of a partnership of faith-based organizations and      government. Rather the innovation of a ``charitable choice''      as a structure that seeks to ignore binding constitutional      law, not to mention sound public policy, by permitting      pervasively religious institutions, such as churches and      other houses of worship, to receive taxpayer dollars for      programs that have not been made discrete and institutionally      separate. In so doing, and in failing to include other      appropriate church-state safeguards, ``charitable choice''      opens the door to publicly funded programs in which      recipients of social services may be proselytized.      ``Charitable choice'' also creates a real possibility of      creating rifts among the various faith groups as they compete      for public funding and allows religious providers to engage      in religious discrimination against employers who are paid      with taxpayers dollars. (Although religious institutions are      permitted to hire co-religionists in the contest of private      religious activity, it is simply improper for taxpayer      dollars to be used to fund religious discrimination.)       There is yet another aspect of the ``charitable choice''      initiative that is cause for concern. With government dollars      comes government oversight. But this kind of intrusion into      the affairs of religious organizations, at least in the case      of pervasively sectarian organizations, is exactly the type      of entangelememt of religious and state against which the      Constitution guards. Such intrusion can have no effect but to      undermine the distinctiveness, indeed the very mission, of      religious institutions.       In addition to the foregoing, we are greatly concerned by      the portion of S. 976's ``charitable choice'' provisions that      allow sectarian providers of treatment for chronic substance      abuse conditions, such as alcoholism, and     drug addiction, to avoid clinically based certification and      licensure standards. This legislation should not be allowed      to go forward without necessary improvements to the bill to      provide essential church-state protections, and without      closer examination of the consequences of allowing sectarian      care providers to avoid compliance with applicable state      education, training and credentialing standards.       Thank you for your consideration of our views on this very      important matter.           Sincerely,                                                Richard T. Foltin,     Legislative Director and Counsel.                                  ____                                            Unitarian Universalist                                 Association of Congregations,                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 1999. Statement of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations       opposition to the ``Charitable Choice'' provisions of S. 976       The Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations has      a long, proud record of support for both religious freedom      and the separation of church and state. Our General Assembly      has issued 10 resolutions since 1961 to this effect. It is      thus with little hesitation that we voice our strong      opposition to the ``Charitable Choice'' provisions of S. 976,      SAMHSA, the Youth, Drug, and Mental Health Services Act.       These and other similar Charitable Choice provisions      undermine the separation of church and state by (1) promoting      excessive entanglement between church and state; and (2)      privileging certain religions and religious institutions      above others.       It does this in the fellowing ways:       By channeling government money into ``pervasively      sectarian'' institutions. The Supreme Court has already      clearly ruled that the government cannot fund ``pervasively      sectarian'' institutions.       By fostering inappropriate competition among religious      groups for government money. With limited funding available      for any one service, governments will be required to decide      which religious institutions will receive funding and which      will not. This necessarily puts those governments in the      wholly un-Constitutional position of discriminating among      religious groups.       By allowing government-funded institutions to discriminate      in their employment on the basis of religion. This amounts to      federally-funded employment discrimination, thus violating      myriad employment and civil rights laws.       By subjecting service-recipients to government-sanctioned      proselytization and religious oppression. Individuals      receiving government services should not have ``religious      strings'' attached to those services.       By encouraging religious institutions to ``follow the      dollars'' when deciding what type of social services to      provide. As a result, it may encourage these organizations to      move away from their historic commitment to providing social      services designed to meet basic human needs. We believe that      religious groups are better suited to address these urgent      human needs than they are to deal with the more complex      mental and other health services that require trained      professionals. These services are best left to government      agencies or institutions closely regulated by governments.       We in the faith community speak often of ``right      relationship.'' We strive for ``right relationship'' in the      world on many levels, both personal (such as between      worshipper and God) and political (such as between church and      state). To the Unitarian Universalist Association of      Congregations, Charitable Choice legislation violates the      right relationship between church and state.       In our vision of ``right'' church-state relations,      ``pervasively sectarian'' institutions have the freedom to      provide whatever services they chose with their own financial      resources. ``Religiously affiliated'' institutions can accept      government funding to provide basic human needs services, so      long as they do so with no ``religious strings'' attached.       If mental and other health-related human needs are not      being met by government agencies, than those agencies should      adopt new strategies and approaches. Rather than throwing      money at religious groups--who are not situated to handle      such needs--adequate freedom and resources should be given to      the relevant government agencies so that they may innovate      and expand in the necessary ways.       Many Americans struggle with disease, drug addiction,      hunger, and poverty. Both religious groups and the government      have a responsibility to help those in need. Each is best      suited to provide a particular kind of service. Rather than      blurring the lines of responsibility, each should re-examine      how it can do better what it is better suited to do.       The information available now indicates that very few      religious institutions are pursuing funding under the      ``Charitable Choice'' provisions of the 1996 Welfare Reform      Law. Wisely, they are wary of the problems associated with      government funding of religious institutions. Congress should      take this as a clear sign that ``Charitable Choice'' is not      an appropriate answer to the problems of adequate service      provision.       Like others in the religious world, the Unitarian      Universalist Association of Congregations is fully committed      to helping those in need. We are concerned, however, that the      public policies relating to these issues are good ones--     appropriate and responsible--that fully respect both the      needs and rights of those people receiving services. For the      reasons stated above, we do not believe that ``Charitable      Choice'' provisions are appropriate or responsible policy.       The Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations      opposes ``Charitable Choice'' and urges Congress to do the      same.           Sincerely,                                                    Rob Cavenaugh,                                             Legislative Director.
