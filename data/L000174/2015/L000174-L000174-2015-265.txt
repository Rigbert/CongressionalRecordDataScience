President, I appreciate the courtesy from the distinguished Republican leader, Senator Cornyn, in letting me go forward for a few moments.  I would like to note that the executive director of the Vermont Coalition of Runaway & Homeless Youth Programs--a group I know well for the important work they have done--wrote to me yesterday to express the concern of the coalition and to express their support for the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act and encourage us to put aside our differences and work together to support those in need.  He wrote:       Difference of opinion and the deliberative role of the      Senate is part of what makes our democracy strong, but      sometimes unity of purpose should prevail, particularly in      efforts involving protections for the most vulnerable among      us. There should be no doubt that legislation involving the      well-being of individuals who have been victimized by the      most base of human behavior should be free of partisan      wrangling. I . . . encourage your efforts to remove partisan      language from the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act in      an effort to ensure that the Act and the Runaway and Homeless      Youth amendment that Senator Collins and you introduced      [will] move forward unimpeded.  I believe that reflects the views of Vermonters of all political stripes.  I know the distinguished Senator from Texas and I and others want to help these greatly abused and abandoned children, and I hope we can continue to work to find a way forward.  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator for his courtesy.
