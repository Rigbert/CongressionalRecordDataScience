Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003, legislation that I am introducing today with Reps. DeGette, Greenwood, Towns, Bilirakis, and John.   Closely modeled after the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the Animal Drug User Fee Act is designed to give the FDA the resources and incentives necessary to significantly improve the animal drug review process. This legislation is sorely needed. Despite a statutory review time of 180 days and the enhanced flexibility granted the agency in the Animal Drug Availability Act of 1996, the average review currently takes about 1.5 years and may drag on for several years. This slowdown in review times is jeopardizing the supply of the new, safe and effective animal drugs needed to keep our pets, flocks, and herds healthy.  The Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003 is endorsed by a coalition of organizations, including the American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Farm Bureau, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Milk Producers Federation, the American Association of Equine Practitioners, the American Sheep Industry Association, the National Pork Producers Council, and the National Turkey Federation. My cosponsors and I anticipate that additional organizations will join in this endorsement as we move forward with the legislation.  I urge my colleagues to join with me and the original bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation in supporting and cosponsoring the Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003.                          ____________________
