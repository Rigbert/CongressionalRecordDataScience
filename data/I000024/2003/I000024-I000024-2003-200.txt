Back in the fifties, we had a program to replace some of the money that was taken away when land was taken off the tax rolls. It is called impact aid.  Over the years, people started taking money out of this program. It is an easy place to grab money. It has gotten down to 40 percent funding. We are now up to 70 percent. The current legislation would leave it at 70 percent. This amendment will increase it by $112 billion, bringing it up to $1.3 billion, 76 percent. That keeps us on track to have it fully funded 5 more years.
