 President, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, S. 372, will strengthen and modernize protections for Federal whistleblowers. May I ask the Senator from Hawaii to clarify the intent of the provision providing relief for the consequences of retaliatory investigations? Am I correct that this provision does not in any way reduce or eliminate current protections against retaliatory investigations?
