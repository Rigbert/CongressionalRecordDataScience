Speaker, throughout towns and cities across our nation there are individuals who are willing to step forward to dedicate their talents and energies to making life better for their friends and neighbors. The citizens of Corona, California, are fortunate to have such an individual in outgoing Mayor Jan Rudman.  Mayor Rudman's involvement with Corona city government, and community, began in 1994 when she was first elected to the Corona City Council. As a councilwoman she represented the community's concerns, set priorities for projects and plans of action, allocated funds, and made decisions essential to the future of Corona. Her energy seems endless, with the long list of her business and community involvements including: Circle City Rotary, 1993 Mayor's Task Force, Navy League, Corona Chamber of Commerce and First Congregational Church.  In 1998, the Corona, recognized her leadership and commitment and elected her mayor. Since then, she has accomplished many goals which have improved the community. One of her greatest accomplishments as mayor was the implementation of the ``Partners in Community Service'' program, implemented to recognize the many volunteer groups and organizations who have given back to the Corona community so graciously.  Mayor Rudman has made a lasting and positive impact in the Corona community. Her involvement and leadership has established a path for those individuals following in her footsteps. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mayor Rudman for her dedication, influence and involvement in our community. She has served as an outstanding representative of municipal government. It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate Mayor Rudman for the outstanding job she has done as Mayor of Corona.                          ____________________
