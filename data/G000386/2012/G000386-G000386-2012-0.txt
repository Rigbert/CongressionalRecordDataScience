 President, today, the Senate turns to the nomination of William Joseph Baer, of Maryland, to be an Assistant Attorney General. If confirmed he will head the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. In considering the confirmation of the President's nominees, I give the President great deference. I believe he should have great latitude in selecting his advisors and officers. But that does not mean that I will not make an independent determination of the nominee's qualifications and fitness for the job. I am not here to merely rubberstamp the President's desires. Factors that I consider relevant include respect for the Constitution, fidelity to the law, intellectual ability, personal integrity, and professional competence. In reviewing Mr. Baer's entire record, I was disappointed to find he does not meet this test. Therefore I will vote no on his confirmation.
