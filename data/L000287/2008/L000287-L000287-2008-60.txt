Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  This is a good bill. This is a necessary bill. In the face of record budgetary shortfalls and high construction costs, State and local governments are struggling to pay for critical highway projects. I fully support H.R. 6532. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for this bill.
