 Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, as the first Member of the Congress to take constituents across the Canadian border in order to purchase safe and affordable medicine, I have been involved in the issue of reimportation for many years; and the reason for that is, I will never forget the look on the faces of Vermont women who went with me across the border, who were struggling with breast cancer, and they were able to purchase in Canada Tamoxifen, the widely prescribed breast cancer drug, for one-tenth the price that they were paying in the United States, womenfighting for their lives, same product, same company, one-tenth the price.  Mr. Speaker, let us be clear about what this debate is all about. Those of us who are sick and tired of seeing Americans being forced to pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs are taking on the most powerful lobby in the country. In the last several years, they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to keep their profits the highest of any industry and to make Americans pay the highest prices in the world. If people are on Capitol Hill today, they will see a swarm of hundreds of paid lobbyists trying to defeat this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, let us be clear that the pharmaceutical industry lies and lies and lies again. Whether it is telling Americans that this issue has something to do with abortion, it is a lie. Whether it is telling advocates for low-income people that a two-tier prescription drug system will be set up, it is a lie, and the safety issue is a lie. They are going to bring out their charts of rat-infested laboratories where medicine is made. It is a lie.  Today, Mr. Speaker, we eat food, pork bellies and beef that come from Canada, vegetables that come from Latin America, food products that come from China. We can safely import FDA-safety-approved products, and that is what we have got to do.
