Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I just want to begin by thanking my very good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), for his work on this legislation. We have served together on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for longer than 20 years; and he as been a true advocate for veterans, and on this legislation, like on the others, has been a great friend and ally as we work in tandem to try to bring good, solid pieces of legislation to the floor. So I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) for that good work.  I want to thank Michael Durishin and Susan Edgerton, who are two of his top staffers, who again worked very, very tirelessly with our own staff here on the majority side; and again, these bills, the details of which are very much worked over and vetted, would not happen without that kind of cooperation. So I do want to thank them as well.  The gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran), who just spoke, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner), the chairman and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) also, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, worked on this legislation as well; and I want to thank them.  I want to thank our own staff, Pat Ryan, Kingston Smith, Jeannie McNally, Peter Dickinson, Kathleen Greve and John Bradley, who all had input into this legislation, and, we have held hearings on it. One of them was one of those day-long hearings. We had four panels. We heard from experts, and again, I think we all were astonished at the lack of response when it came to these capabilities.  As I alluded to earlier in my comments, I thought when I sat in those meetings in Trenton and Hamilton and Mercer County, where there was this befuddled look on the part of very well-meaning experts in the field about what do we do about anthrax, has it been spread through cross-contamination, what are the risks, how often and how long and to whom should Cipro or Doxycycline be administered.  There were a million and one questions and very few answers because those questions had not been considered in advance; and that is what this legislation is all about, to establish centers of excellence that seek to find out, if this kind of event happens, what is prescribed, what is the consequence. Just today in The Washington Times, there was an excellent op-ed piece by a doctor who heads up the emergency room physicians, pointing out that the first responders, as they rush in to help in a situation, smallpox, anthrax, sarin, just name it, will not have a clue what it is they need to do to prepare themselves, to protect themselves and preclude contamination.                              {time}  1515  So it is very important that these details be worked out in advance, coordinating with other agencies of the government. The VA has shown in the past it has a unique perspective and an expertise to bring to bear on this.  Madam Speaker, I also thank our Senate colleagues. Senator Rockefeller worked on this and got legislation passed. It was a very cooperative effort. They added some very meaningful language to the bill, so we ended up with a very good hybrid that will go to the President for signature. I also thank Senator Specter, the ranking member. In addition, I appreciate the efforts of the Senate staff, Bill Tuerk and Kim Lipsky, David Goetz and Bill Cahill, and I especially thank Julie Fischer, who has been Senator Rockefeller's top aide, who worked with the other side of the aisle to craft a good bill. This bill has been endorsed by the administration. Now we will work on getting this bill signed, implemented, and then we will do oversight on its implementation.
