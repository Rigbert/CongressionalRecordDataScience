Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and urge that we bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban on children, like a 5-year-old that came to Dulles Airport with another family. Her mother was waiting for her, and for 4 hours she was not allowed to see her mother. That is not good policy. It is not good for the safety of our troops. It is not good for the safety of America. Let's pass H.R. 724.
