Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I wanted to clarify a couple of matters here for the Record in terms of this amendment.  First of all, the amendment of the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn) is to page 13, line 11, which reads: $62,916,000 for special grants for agricultural research. The gentleman's amendment proposes to eliminate $1 million from that account. Am I correct in reading the gentleman's amendment? That is exactly what the gentleman's amendment states, page 13 line 11.
