Speaker, I do not know, but I do know that our conferees again who have not been included in the discussions are very concerned about an issue that is rumored to be included in the conference report that has not been debated at all by either the conferees or by the House. So I raise that concern and would hope that the gentleman would raise that concern with the Chair of the conference committee.  I know today is the day the congressional Republican leaders have articulated as the day that they would complete the conference on the Medicare prescription drug bill. Could the majority leader bring us up to date on the status of that and when, if the gentleman expects between now and November 7, for that conference report to be brought back to the House. I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. On the Medicare conference, a lot of meetings have been held. Progress is being made. But as the gentleman knows, this is a very, very complicated issue with a whole lot of different, moving parts; and it is a very difficult issue to bring together. But even with the time frame that we have and have laid out, as far as timing as to when we might be able to finish that, I really cannot tell the gentleman with any degree of, any level of certainty. Work is going on. Those that want a bill are working very hard to get one, and we just hope that they can get it done before the end of this session.
