 President, my colleague, Senator Enzi, and I filed our amendment dealing with the defined benefit plan reform proposals in this budget. The amendment provides the necessary flexibility with respect to revenues and outlay savings between our two committees.  Unfortunately, a last-minute objection from staff on the other side sidetracked our amendment. We will pursue this amendment in the conference on the resolution.                            vote explanation
