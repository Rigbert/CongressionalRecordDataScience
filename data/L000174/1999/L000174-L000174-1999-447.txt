I heard one Senator on the floor speak of having more wholesome movies. I am all for that. There are a lot of movies that I consider absolutely classic. I like the ``Quiet Man'' with John Wayne. It was filmed near the part of Ireland from where my father's family came. But there is violence, fighting, drunkenness a little bit here and there. What do you determine it is? Does the market carry that? There are a lot of wholesome films that make it.  I see some things that might be considered wholesome. One very popular with children are Teletubbies, but yet we heard one leading conservative religious leader say that it should be taken off the air because he objected to one of the Teletubbies.  Maybe we have Teletubbies on one side and televangelists on the other. Somebody suggested in one cartoon: Teletubby Tinky Winky; Televangelist Dopey Wopey. But that is what I read in the paper.  Do we take that off or tax it? Maybe after the $1 million this amendment refers to we might have a better idea. I am not too sure I want even my own communities to determine what tax they will impose and the Federal Government determine what tax they will impose and then have censor boards all over the place determining this one we will tax a little itty-bitty, and this one we will tax biggie bitty-bit.  I point out, we do already have in the juvenile justice bill a package of amendments regarding the study of the motion picture industry, so that is going to be done anyway.
