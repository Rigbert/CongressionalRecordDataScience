This is getting perilously close to a debate, which hardly ever happens on the floor of the Senate. I will gladly ask for time and yield to his questions so we can have an honest-to-goodness Senate debate. It will be a historic day.  My question is this: Is it not true that, although the Medicare agency does not provide the services but works through intermediaries, the Medicare agency attempts to control the costs by establishing what providers can be reimbursed, what hospitals and doctors can be reimbursed, as much as we are suggesting here that the drug companies would be told that they have to reduce costs for Medicare beneficiaries? Isn't that an analogy?
