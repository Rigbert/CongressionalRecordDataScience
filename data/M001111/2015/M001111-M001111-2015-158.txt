 President, as a former preschool teacher, I have seen firsthand the kind of transformation that early learning can inspire in a child. I believe we should be investing more in our children, not less. So today I am offering an amendment to expand access to early childhood education so more kids can start kindergarten ready to learn. This amendment would expand high-quality early learning opportunities for low- and moderate-income 3- and 4-year-olds and build on the investments that Governors and legislators across the country, regardless of party affiliation, are already making to improve early learning opportunities through public-private partnerships. It is fully paid for by closing wasteful tax loopholes. I hope our colleagues can support this critical amendment.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
