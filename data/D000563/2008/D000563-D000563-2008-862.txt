I am sure he will yield to the Senator from Arizona.  So that I understand this--I want to make it clear--in order to spare, at a maximum, 7,000 of the wealthiest people in America who may die in the outgoing years, in order to spare them estate tax liability, even though America has been very kind to them and they have lived very comfortable lives because of this great Nation, to spare them the possibility of paying back to this country for having lived and enjoyed this great Nation, we are going to add some $400 billion plus in debt to Americans. And over half of that will end up being debt we owe to foreign countries, as I understand the Senator from North Dakota. Is that correct?
