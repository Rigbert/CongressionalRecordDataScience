 President, I say to my friend from Virginia, he is entirely correct. This is the wrong place for this amendment. But for those Senators who are not persuaded that the fact that this is the wrong place for this amendment is enough to vote against it, I think it is important to understand that this is a rather limited disclosure amendment. Among the groups that are not covered in the 527 amendment the Senator from Virginia and others have been discussing are groups such as the Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO.
