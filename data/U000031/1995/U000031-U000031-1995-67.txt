Speaker, I would like to recognize the fine efforts of the Sturgis Neighborhood Program and Sturgis Federal Savings Bank who were recently recognized by The Social Compact with its 1995 Outstanding Community Investment Awards. They received this honor for their partnership achievement: stabilizing lower income neighborhoods and families through the rehabilitation of affordable rental housing which is rebuilding community hope and pride.  Sturgis Neighborhood Program [SNP] was founded in 1991 in response to the Sturgis Area Chamber of Commerce's call for greater responsiveness to the housing needs of the city's lower income residents. The downtown business district of Sturgis, a small rural city, has a high concentration of deteriorating and substandard housing. These units, built before 1940 and converted from single-family, owner-occupied residences to multifamily properties, are rented to very-low-income families and require high maintenance. Many of the residents receive public assistance and lack necessary skills to balance their household budgets and maintain their property.  SNP combines housing rehabilitation with support services to address the needs of Sturgis citizens. Since its inception, SNP has rehabilitated five single-family homes, with numbers six and seven on the way. Tenant families are employed, receive family development guidance, and participate in maintenance education programs. A Family Services Coordinator meets with each family on a regular basis to develop a goal-setting plan, a program that is helping families become self-sufficient, productive members of the community. I must say that SNP's Director, Judy Som-merfield, has done a wonderful job with all of the various activities of the organization.  Sturgis Federal Savings Bank, the first of four financial institutions to support SNP's mission, played a vital role in SNP's initial success. The thrift's president, Leonard Eishen, provided key financial direction and guidance in the area of administration and the development of community support, a major issue for SNP.  In order to gain community support, the nonprofit organization undertook an extensive, year-long campaign to meet with community leaders. Sturgis Federal also helped SNP with a line of credit, a $1,000 annual grant toward operating support, low interest rates, and flexible terms. With the assistance of Sturgis Federal, SNP received $124,000 in grants and subsidies which allowed the organization to successfully renovate five units of affordable rental housing. The Michigan State Housing Development Authority also awarded grants for the rehabilitation of the second house and subsequent projects.  By the end of SNP's 1996-97 fiscal year, it hopes to have completed 24 housing units in the targeted downtown area. These efforts improve the neighborhoods and support the local economy. Besides its partnership with Sturgis Federal, SNP has actively sought partnerships with local government, industry, business, financial institutions, youth groups, and service organizations. A network of volunteers from these groups helps to complete small projects on SNP houses.  Working together increases community pride for those who volunteer and for the individuals and families who don't want a handout but only an opportunity for a hand up. With its initial success, SNP has earned the trust of the community it serves and has become an integral part of the community's vision for improving the lives of its lower income residents.                          ____________________
