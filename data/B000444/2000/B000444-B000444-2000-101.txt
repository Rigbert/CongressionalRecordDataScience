 President, I rise today to honor one of Delaware's most brilliant legal minds and genuinely altruistic public servants--the Honorable William T. Quillen.  I have known Judge Quillen for 33 years, since I was an attorney fresh out of law school and looking for a job. As a 32-year old Delaware Superior Court judge he met with me and on blind faith recommended me for my first legal job. He has been a dear friend and confidant ever since. Over the past three decades, I have watched Judge Quillen with pride and admiration attain the greatest judicial heights any lawyer could ever strive for in Delaware, which is universally recognized--nationally and internationally--as having one of the most reputable, intellectual benches bar none.  He is known in my state affectionately and respectfully as ``Judge,'' ``Chancellor,'' ``Justice,'' and ``Mr. Secretary of State.'' He nearly became Governor and was my recommendation to President Clinton in June, 1999 to serve on the United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals. It was during a medical examination required for this position that his physician detected prostate cancer. For health reasons, we withdrew his name from consideration. I am happy to report that following treatment for prostate cancer, he is as healthy as ever, running 5K races like a man half his age.  Now, in classic Bill Quillen altruism--he says it's time to retire from the bench and make way for younger lawyers to serve as judges.  Early in his career, Bill Quillen served in the United States Air Force as a judge advocate, then as a top aide for Delaware's Governor. His judicial career began in 1966 on the Superior Court, which is Delaware's primary trial court. In 1973, he was elevated and confirmed as Chancellor of Delaware's renowned Court of Chancery.  Following a two-year experience as a private attorney with the Wilmington Trust Company, he again heeded the call for public service. In 1978, the General Assembly had expanded Delaware's Supreme Court from three to five members, and the Governor called on Bill Quillen. He was confirmed unanimously as a Delaware Supreme Court Justice. He served on the State's Highest Court for five years, before stepping down to run for Governor on the Democratic ticket. In one of the rare instances when he did not achieve his goal, Bill Quillen was not bitter or discouraged. In 1993, he accepted Governor Tom Carper's call for continued public service to become Secretary of State. In a state that more than half of the Fortune 500 companies call home, Secretary Quillen made his mark on this prestigious office.  But his heart remained in the law. In November, 1994, Governor Carper nominated and the General Assembly unanimously confirmed him to the Court where his storied career began--theDelaware Superior Court. As I said earlier, I believe our federal bench would have been enlightened by his experience and brilliance, but for health reasons, this was not meant to be.  What's even more striking than his distinguished legal career is Judge Quillen's love for history. He is a true Delaware historian, with long-time family roots in historic New Castle. His love and respect for the law, democracy and justice for all are unparalleled.  Judge Quillen is recognized nationally for his extensive writings on Delaware's Court of Chancery, the history of Equity Jurisdiction in Delaware and the Federal-State Corporate Law Relationship. His colleagues nationwide also have awarded him numerous prestigious awards, including the First Place Award for the 1980 Judge Edward R. Finch Law Day U.S.A. Speech, sponsored by the American Bar Association, on the topic of ``Seven Perceptions of Freedom.'' In June, 1998, he also received the ``American Judicature Society's Herbert Harley Award.''  Judge Quillen will continue to serve as a professor at the Widener University School of Law and plans to spend more time with his wife of 41 years, two daughters and three grandchildren. I have no doubt his legal legacy, knowledge of Delaware, writing and speaking ability will continue to serve our State for many years to come.  Judge Quillen is a proud graduate of Harvard Law School, and it was the Dean Emeritus of Harvard Law School--Roscoe Pound--who said:  ``Law is experience developed by reason and applied continually to further experience.''  Judge Quillen's vast experience and reasoned principles applied as a member of Delaware's top three courts will forever leave its marks on our body of law in Delaware. Our State and our citizens are so much better for his service. So, Your Honor, May It Please The Court, respectfully accept this statement of profound gratitude and admiration.                          ____________________
