 President, I announce that tomorrow morning the Senate will begin consideration of the nuclear waste bill and overriding the President's veto. Under the previous order, there will be 90 minutes under the control of Senator Murkowski and 90 minutes under the control of the Senators from Nevada.  At 2:15 p.m., following the weekly party conferences, the Senate will resume consideration of the veto override for 1 hour, with a vote scheduled to occur at 3:15 p.m. Following the vote, the Senate is expected to resume consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization Act. Further votes could occur throughout tomorrow's session of the Senate.                          ____________________
