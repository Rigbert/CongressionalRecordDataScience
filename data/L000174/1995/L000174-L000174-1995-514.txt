McCain], and provisions contained in the amendment I had filed to this bill.  In 1984 when we established the crime victims fund to provide Federal assistance to State and local victims compensation and assistance efforts, we funded it with fines, penalties, and assessments from those convicted of Federal crime. The level of required contribution was set low; 10 years have past and it is high time to adjust the assessments.  The amendment serves to double the assessments under the Victims of Crime Act against those convicted of Federal felonies. This should provide critical additional resources to assist all victims of crime, including those who are victims of terrorism or mass violence.  I do not think that $100 is too much for those individuals convicted of a Federal felony to contribute to help crime victims.  I do not think that $500 is too much to insist that corporations convicted of a Federal felony contribute to crime victims. The amendment would raise these to be the minimum level of assessment against those convicted of such crimes and provides judges with the discretion to assess higher levels when appropriate.  In connection with these provisions, I acknowledge the work of our colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain]. I know that he has been actively seeking to raise these special assessments for some time and I am glad that we are able to join together in this effort. He deserves much credit for his ongoing efforts on behalf of crime victims.  I look forward to our continuing to cooperate in additional efforts on behalf of victims of crime, terrorism, and mass destruction. We have much to do if we are to improve collections for the crime victims fund and if we are to augment the critical resources needed by our victims compensation and assistance programs. This is an amendment that will help provide additional resources for meeting critical needs.
