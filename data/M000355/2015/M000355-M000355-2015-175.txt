 President, for years the American people have been calling on Washington to build a bridge away from ObamaCare. For years Democrats prevented the Senate from passing legislation to do just that, but in just a moment that will change.  It will be a victory for the middle-class families who have endured this law's pain far too long on their medical choices, on the affordability of their care, on the availability of their doctors and hospitals, and on the insurance they liked and wanted to keep. A new Senate that is back on the side of the American people will vote to move beyond all the broken promises, all the higher costs, and all the failures. We will vote to build a bridge away from ObamaCare and toward better care. We will vote for a new beginning.  We hope the House will again do the same, and then President Obama will have a choice. He can defend the status quo that has failed the middle class by vetoing the bill or he can work toward a new beginning and better care by signing it.
