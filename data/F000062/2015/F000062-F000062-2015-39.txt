  As it might become very clear, Senator Burr and I, on a bill that came out of committee 14 to 1, have tried to keep a balance and have tried to prevent this kind of information sharing from being a threat to business so they won't participate. Therefore, the words that are used are all important as to whether they have a legal derivation. Senator Leahy's amendment would essentially decrease the amount of sharing by opening up the chance of public disclosure through the Freedom of Information Act of cyber threats shared under this bill.  Now, we seek to share information about the nature of cyber effects and suggestions on how to defend networks. This information clearly should not be made available to hackers and cyber criminals who could use it for their own purposes. So Senator Burr and I worked closely with Senator Leahy and Senator Cornyn in putting together the managers' package to remove a FOIA exemption that they viewed as unnecessary and harmful. That has been removed in the managers' package.
