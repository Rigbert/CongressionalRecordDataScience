Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 176th anniversary of Greek Independence Day, which is on March 24. I use this occasion not only to mark Greek independence, but also to celebrate the unique relationship that exists between the Greek and American peoples.  As almost every school child knows, modern democracy has its roots in the ancient Athenian system of government that was developed over 2,500 years ago. While the democratic ideals developed during this time did not always rule in Greece, the writings of its leaders and philosophers have influenced generations of people in almost every country around the world.  Among those who were influenced by ancient Greek philosophers was American Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, who taught himself how to read Greek at an early age. In his adulthood, Jefferson called upon his knowledge of the Greek tradition of democracy when writing the Declaration of Independence and other important works, which were a catalyst to American independence from the British. Years later, Jefferson's writings helped inspire the Greek people to rise up and successfully win their independence from the Ottoman Empire--the very event that we celebrate today.  This close and symbiotic relationship continues to this day. Greece is one of the only countries to have supported the United States during every major international conflict this century, and it plays a vital role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The United States, in turn, has worked to bring a peaceful solution to the situation on the island of Cyprus, which was brutally invaded by Turkey in 1974.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in celebrating Greek Independence Day. I salute the Greek people for having the courage to break the bonds of oppression 176 years ago and I look forward to continued cooperation between our two nations. Finally, I would like to salute my distinguished colleague from Florida, Mr. Bilirakis, for arranging this special order today.
