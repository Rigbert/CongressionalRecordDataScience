 President, I know the Senator from West Virginia had the floor, and I would be guided by whatever he wishes. I can come back to this later or we could continue, whatever the Senator suggests. I have no preference in the normal order of things. I know there were other Senators here to speak on this and other issues, before me.  Maybe what I should do with the Senator's permission is gather up, since I just walked on the floor and did not anticipate being involved in this debate, some of the case law to which I refer and come back and maybe continue this debate if the Senator from West Virginia thinks that is appropriate.
