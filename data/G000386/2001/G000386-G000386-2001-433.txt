 President, as chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I rise to commend the counterdrug efforts of the National Guard. The National Guard performs vital work to assist law enforcement with interdiction/eradication operations, including the manufacture, sale, use and importation, and demand reduction for drugs throughout our country.  Every day the National Guard has approximately 3,600 personnel on duty performing counterdrug work. The National Guard supports the President's counterdrug priorities, with special emphasis along the Southwest Border and designated High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs). In addition, the Governor of each State can assign the National Guard to unique local issues. Skills the National Guard brings include personnel, specialized vehicles and military equipment, logistical support, thermal imaging, intelligence analysis, translation, searching cargo containers at ports of entry, and listening/observation posts. Federal agencies typically supported include the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Customs Service, and the Border Patrol, while State and local agencies include highway patrols, country sheriffs, and local police departments.  The Department of Defense is prohibited by U.S. Code Title 10, under the Posse Comitatus Act, from military personnel enforcing State and local laws. The National Guard, under its United States Code Title 32 status, does not have this prohibition, although National Guard regulations do not allow direct involvement in law enforcement, such as arrest, apprehension, search and seizure. Since 1988, the Governor of each State submits a plan each year to the Department of Defense outlining the proposed use of the National Guard in support of counterdrug efforts. Currently, about 50 percent of the requests are able to be funded.  The National Guard also has an active demand reduction mission geared to helping youth avoid starting to use illegal drugs. These programs include involvement in schools and working with parent and community based anti-drug organizations. National Guard personnel serve as excellent citizen-soldier role models and also assist with mentoring, speakers bureaus, Adopt-A-School, Red Ribbon, and PRIDE events. Last year the National Guard had contact with tens of thousands of youth.  I am proud of the role the National Guard and its citizen-soldiers performs in our vital counterdrug programs.                          ____________________
