 President, the British statesman Edmund Burke once wrote: ``When bad men combine, the good must associate.'' Such vivid moral clarity is nowhere better reflected than in the recent events involving Burma.  In Burma, we have indeed witnessed the combination of bad men--a combination of corrupt military junta leaders and compliant thugs in the Burmese security forces.  This combination recently carried out the brutal suppression of peaceful protests in Burma, killing and imprisoning untold numbers of nonviolent demonstrators, including scores of Buddhist monks.  What is now needed is for the good to associate.
