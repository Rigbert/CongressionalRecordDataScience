 President, in 1941, Monroe, North Carolina, lost Bud Nance, a favorite home grown boy, who traveled north to the U.S. Naval Academy. Last week, we all suffered the loss of Admiral Nance to a different journey. He passed away after a life time of dedicated and successful service to his country. But, what most of us will recall beyond his distinguished record and credentials is the support and friendship Bud offered many of us, especially to Senator Helms.  Bud brought the quiet confidence and certain purpose he had gained from growing up in a close knit community to each challenge and task he faced. When he arrived to serve Senator Helms as chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee there were no shortages to the variety and complexity of those challenges. But, Bud had a gift for dissecting and analyzing complicated issues--whether personnel or policy--cutting with certainty to the heart of any matter, giving guidance then moving on to the next challenge. He saw each problem as an opportunity to support his friends and serve his country.  The many conversations I enjoyed with Bud flowed from our common reverence for the history and stories so familiar in the South. He represented the best of North Carolina traditions--he had that strong streak of country sense, yet was ever sentimental; his wisdom twinkled with humor. He brought these strengths to every discussion we had on a wide range of issues from arms control to foreign aid--he made a difference with Southern distinction.  Bud's loss will be felt most deeply by his life long and good friend, ``Jesse''. I thank him for sharing Bud with us for the past 8 years. The Senate and its Members are the richer for his contribution and service.
