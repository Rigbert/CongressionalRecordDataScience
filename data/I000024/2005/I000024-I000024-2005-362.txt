President, section 403 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act requires that a statement of the cost of the reported bill, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, be included in the report. At the time of filing of the report, the statement was unavailable. The statement has since been received by the committee. I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     S. 858, Nuclear Fees Reauthorization Act of 2005, As ordered          reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and          Public Works on June 8, 2005     Summary       CBO estimates that the net cost of implementing S. 858      would be $2 million in fiscal year 2006 and about $10 million      over the 2006-2010 period, assuming appropriation of the      necessary amounts. Enacting the bill would not affect direct      spending or revenues.       Under current law, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)      is authorized to collect annual fees to offset about 90      percent of its general fund appropriation. If that authority      is allowed to expire at the end of fiscal year 2005, the NRC      would be authorized to collect only 33 percent of its budget      through user fees. S. 858 would extend the NRC's current      authority to charge annual fees to offset 90 percent of most      of its general fund appropriation through 2011 and also would      prohibit amounts appropriated to the NRC for certain      specified homeland security activities to be offset with user      fees. The fees that NRC collects are classified as offsetting      collections (a credit against discretionary spending) because      they are explicitly tied to the level of annual discretionary      appropriations for the agency.       S. 858 also would authorize the NRC to establish several      new initiatives with higher education institutions to enhance      employee recruitment. The programs would provide support,      such as grants, loans, and equipment to higher education      institutions for NRC-related curricula, and for scholarships      and fellowships to students potentially seeking careers at      NRC. S. 858 also would authorize funding for promotional      items used in recruitment, reimbursement of travel expenses      for students working with the NRC, medical costs of overseas      NRC employees, and mentoring, training, and research programs      at Hispanic-serving, historically black, and tribally      controlled colleges or universities.       S. 858 contains both an intergovernmental and private-     sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA). CBO estimates that the costs of the intergovernmental      mandate would not exceed the threshold ($62 million in 2005,      adjusted annually for inflation) established in that act. CBO      cannot determine whether the costs of the private-sector      mandate would exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA      ($123 million in 2005, adjusted annually for inflation)      because UMRA does not specify how CBO should measure the      costs of extending an existing mandate. Depending on how they      are measured, the costs to the private sector could exceed      the threshold.     Estimated Cost to the Federal Government       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 858 is shown in the      following table. The costs of this legislation fall within      budget function 270 (energy).

S. 858 would authorize a 90 percent collection for 2006  to 2011. To estimate the net change in NRC costs under S. 858, 90  percent was applied to the estimated cost of higher education and  recruitment programs as authorized by S. 858.     Basis of Estimate       For this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill will be      enacted near the start of fiscal year 2006, that the      necessary amounts will be appropriated for each year, and      that outlays will occur at historical rates.       S. 858 would establish new initiatives with higher      education institutions and recruitment efforts at the NRC.      The bill would make changes to the NRC's authority to collect      fees to offset its appropriations. Based on information from      the NRC, CBO estimates that the net cost of implementing S.      858 would be $2 million in 2006 and about $10 million over      the 2006-2010 period. All budget effects of the bill would be      subject to appropriation action.               Higher Education and Recruitment Programs       S. 858 would establish new NRC programs with colleges and      universities to enhance employee recruitment. The programs      would provide grants, loans, and equipment to higher      education institutions for NRC-related curriculum and      scholarships and fellowships to students with prospects of      future employment at NRC. S. 858 also would authorize funding      for promotional items used in recruitment, travel expenses      reimbursement for students working with the NRC, medical cost      coverage of overseas NRC employees, and various mentoring,      training, and research programs at Hispanic-serving,      historically black, and tribally controlled colleges or      universities. Based on information from the NRC, CBO      estimates that implementing higher education and recruitment      programs would have a gross cost of $1 million in 2006 and      $22 million over the 2006-2010 period. Under S. 858, the      NRC would recover 90 percent of these costs through fees      that are credited against its annual appropriations.                                NRC Fees       Under current law, the NRC is authorized to offset 90      percent of most of its budget authority in 2005 and 33      percent for each year after 2005. In 2005, the NRC received a      gross appropriation from the general fund of $601 million to      be offset by an estimated $541 million from the collection of      fees. Such fees are classified as offsetting collections a      form of discretionary spending. As is the case under current      law for 2005, S. 858 would set fee collection at 90 percent      of most of the agency's budget authority provided from the      general fund (a portion of funds are provided from the      Nuclear Waste Fund) for each year from 2006 through 2011.      Under S. 858, the NRC also would be prohibited from      recovering costs for certain homeland security activities.      For example, for 2006, the NRC requested $31 million for      homeland security activities that would no longer be offset      by user fees under this bill.       By continuing to authorize fee collections at 90 percent of      NRC's annual general fund appropriation, S. 858 would lead to      the collection of approximately $550 million in fees in 2006.      In contrast, if that 90 percent fee-collection authority were      not extended, the portion of spending recoverable through      fees would drop to 33 percent, and the amount of fees      collected would fall to about $200 million in 2006. Those      estimates assume that NRC funding in 2006 is equal to the      amounts provided in 2005 with an adjustment for inflation.                           NRC Cost Recovery       Under current law, the NRC collects fees from its private      licensees that offset its annual appropriation. Such fee      collection includes the cost of issuing licenses to some      government agencies. S. 858 would require that government      agencies pay their licensing and regulatory activity fees,      rather than the private sector.       Currently, the NRC charges private licensees about $2      million per year for licenses issued to government agencies.      Under S. 858, those license fees would come from appropriated      funds rather than the private sector; thus, the government      would incur a net cost relative to current law to pay them.      We estimate that such additional costs would be $2 million in      2006 and $10 million over the 2006-2010 period.     Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact       Under current law, the NRC is authorized to collect annual      fees from its licensees (public and private) to offset 90      percent of a major portion of its general fund appropriation.      CBO estimates that those collections will amount to an      estimated $541 million in fiscal year 2005. Those fee      collections include the cost of issuing licenses to some      Federal agencies. The NRC's authority to collect that level      of fees expires at the end of fiscal year 2005. When that      authority expires, the NRC will be authorized to collect      annual fees up to only 33 percent of its budget. S. 858 would      extend the NRC's current authority to charge annual fees to      offset 90 percent of its net appropriation through 2011. The      duty to pay such fees would be a mandate as defined in UMRA.       The total amount of fees collected under this provision      would depend on the level of future appropriations. Assuming      appropriations in the amount authorized for 2005, CBO      estimates that extending the fees would result in additional      collections of more than $300 million in 2006 from industries      regulated by the NRC (primarily electric utilities) and      similar amounts for fiscal years 2007 through 2010. CBO      estimates that most of the annual fees would be paid by      private, investor-owned nuclear utilities (less than 5      percent would be paid by nonFederal, publicly owned      utilities).       In the case of a mandate that has not yet expired, UMRA      does not specify whether CBO should measure the cost of the      extension relative to the mandate's current costs or assume      that the mandate will expire and that it must measure the      costs of the mandate's extension as if the requirement were      new. Measured against the costs that would     be incurred if current law remains in place and the annual      fee declines, the total cost to the private sector of      extending this mandate would be close to $300 million      annually, beginning in fiscal year 2006. Measured that way,      the cost of the mandate would exceed the annual threshold for      the private sector as defined in UMRA. By contrast, measured      against the fees paid for fiscal year 2005, the mandate would      impose no additional costs on the private sector because the      fees under the bill would not differ much from those      currently in effect. In any case, CBO estimates that the      total costs to State, local, and tribal governments would be      small relative to the threshold for intergovernmental      mandates.
