Chairman, I move to strike the last word, for just one moment.  I would assure the gentleman from Illinois that we all do share his concern. It is my view we have a policy of the United States Government, but that we need a repository.  As the chairman pointed out, we had an extended conference last year with the other body to make sure that Yucca was fully funded. We had a page of permutations as to how to work through the situation OMB placed us in this year. This is not a matter of our doing, and I do assure my colleague that I and the members of the subcommittee want to work through this with the Chair to make sure we proceed in an expeditious manner, and we have to solve this problem.
