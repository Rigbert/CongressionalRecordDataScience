President, I understand that under the prior unanimous consent agreement the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch; the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl; and I each have 1 hour for the Teilborg nomination, and the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, has up to 3 hours, unless time is yielded back, is that correct?
