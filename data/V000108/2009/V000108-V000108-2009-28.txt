On Friday, July 31, 2009, the Lake County Electricians Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (JATC) will honor the class of 2009 at their annual Apprentice Completion Banquet, which will be held at the Avalon Manor Banquet Hall in Merrillville, Indiana.

This year's graduates are: Jake Archambault, Jennifer Batka, Bryan Bogacz, Brett Bormann, Steve Brumley, Kelly Carlson, Jonathan Chariton, Noble Dennie, Jake Duttlinger, Andrew Filipowski, Theresa Gibbs, Josh Hardebeck, Nick Hardesty, Matt Marckese, Justin Marcotte, Joe Michaels, Jonathan Moran, Jon Moyado, Mike Nelleman, Ben O'Neall, Jon Orzachowicz, Chris Roark, Kyle Spicer, Jason Tampauskas, Joe Thomas, Nick Trinidad, Andy Vlachos, Arnell Washington, and John Yaksic.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These outstanding graduates all exemplify these traits. They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their commitment, hard work, and selfless sacrifice.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these committed, hardworking individuals. Along with the other extraordinary men and women of Northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have contributed in many ways to the growth and development of the economy in Indiana's First Congressional District, and I am very proud to represent them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
