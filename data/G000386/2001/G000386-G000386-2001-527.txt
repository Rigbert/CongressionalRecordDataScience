 Let me tell you why we don't hear that from the other side. They talk about tax cuts, but they don't have a passion for tax cuts. They talk about reducing the national debt, but they don't have a passion for reducing the national debt. What they have a passion for is muddying the waters, maintaining the status quo, keeping the high level of taxation we have today, so that when we have 20.6 percent of the gross national product coming into the Federal Treasury in taxes today, at the highest level in the history of the country--if we maintain the status quo, in 10 years it will be at 22.7 percent. They are going to be able to spend that. They have a passion for spending. That is why they do not like this program that gives every working man and woman in America, every taxpayer in America who pays income taxes, a tax cut, and it has a larger share of tax cuts for lower and middle-income people than for higher income people.
