Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, as much as I respect my good friend, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings), this bill does what he asks to do.  Last year, the ratio was 3 to 1, $3 for every $1, $3 for every $1 spent for purchase. If we are not doing this job as we should be, it is the appropriators' fault. If they appropriated the money as they should have from the monies that were derived from offshore, we would not have this problem. But it has not been done. It has not been done.  Under this bill, we put $200 million additional maintenance into the program for the maintenance. So really, this amendment is not necessary. It is really not necessary, unless one wants the appropriators to do all of the work. If they want the appropriators to make the decision, then support the amendment. If one wants appropriators writing legislation, then support the amendment. If we want the appropriators running this House, then support the amendment.  The appropriators have been making legislative action every end of the session without any through-put through this Congress, without anybody having anything to say about it, without going to the authorizing committee. Those who voted for last year's final bill voted for $600 million, and the year before that, $420 million, and the year before that, without any through-put from the authorizing committees.  In this bill, though, we say okay, if they want maintenance, we will give them an additional $200 million for maintenance. That is not appropriated. It should have been appropriated, but it was not appropriated. Three to one, though, for maintenance. If we have a backlog, it is because the appropriators did not use the money for the maintenance part.  I am going to suggest that although the amendment sounds good, we recognize the maintenance problem in this bill. We recognize the need to take care of our parks and refuges. We added $200 million. If Members adopt this amendment, they are back where they started from, $450 million, just about where we were last year. We are letting the appropriators run the program. I do not think that is what this Congress wants.  I do not have any particular fight with the appropriators, other than the fact that they missed the idea that the authorizers also have a role in this body. Does anybody know what the money was spent on last year? No. Did they come to us and ask us? No. It was given to the President.  I say, maintain them, yes. We are going to do that. But let us use this bill, with the additional $200 million. If we do not defeat this amendment, we are going to end up right back where we were last year with no maintenance, other than about $450 million. If that is what Members want, then fine. If they want their parks to fall apart, fine, or refuges not to be maintained, fine. I do not think Members want that.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  (
