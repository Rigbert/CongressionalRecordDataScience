 President, today I am introducing the AIDS Memorial Grove Act of 1966.  This bill is identical to H.R. 3193 sponsored by Congresswoman Pelosi in the House.  The legislation recognizes the significance of the 15-acre AIDS Memorial Grove in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and directs the Secretary of Interior to designate the AIDS Memorial Grove as a national memorial.  The AIDS Memorial Grove is a place where people come together to grieve, find solace, support and hope. Since 1991, volunteers have been planting trees and maintaining this woodland area. Visitors come not only from San Francisco, but also from all across the United States.  In giving national recognition to the area, the legislation makes the AIDS Memorial Grove the Nation's first living memorial dedicated to the thousands of Americans who have died of AIDS and in support of individuals who are living with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and their families and friends.  No Federal funds would be required.  The AIDS Memorial Grove is, and will continue to be, a public/private partnership totally supported by private donations. The AIDS Memorial Grove board of directors already has signed a 99-year agreement with the City of San Francisco and the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department to maintain the grove in perpetuity.  The legislation is consistent with other bills creating areas affiliated with the National Park System. I urge my colleagues to join me in working for its enactment.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1992     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``AIDS Memorial Grove Act of      1996''.     SEC. 2. RECOGNITION AND DESIGNATION OF THE AIDS MEMORIAL                    GROVE AS NATIONAL MEMORIAL.       (a) Recognition of Significance of the AIDS Memorial      Grove.--The Congress hereby recognizes the significance of      the AIDS Memorial Grove, located in Golden Gate Park in San      Francisco, California, as a memorial--       (1) dedicated to individuals who have died as a result of      acquired immune deficiency syndrome; and       (2) in support of individuals who are living with acquired      immune deficiency syndrome and their loved ones and      caregivers.       (b) Designation as National Memorial.--Not later than 90      days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary      of the Interior shall designate the AIDS Memorial Grove as a      national memorial.                          ____________________
