Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend seven dedicated teachers from Northwest Indiana have been voted outstanding educators by their peers for the 2001-2002 school year. These individuals, Joyce Abbott, Laura Marzotto, Danny Chapman, Carole Selund, Patricia Premetz, Ben Geesa and Kay Harness will be presented with the Crystal Apple Award at a reception sponsored by the Indiana State Teachers Association. This event will take place at the Andorra Restaurant and Banquets in Schererville, Indiana, on Wednesday, May 15, 2002.  Joyce Abbott, from the Crown Point Community School Corporation, has taught music for 17 years at Solon Robinson Elementary School. The love and passion that Joyce has for music, both personally and professionally, is demonstrated through the creativity and enthusiasm that she projects, in order to inspire not only the students, but also the teachers at Solon Robinson Elementary School.  Laura Marzotto has only been with the Hanover Community School Corporation for three years, but she is a great addition to Hanover Central High School. When Laura first came to Hanover Central as a teacher in the Business Department, a marketing program was nonexistent. Yet as a result of her tireless efforts, a marketing track has been initiated, a program through which students can take a variety of marketing courses. Additionally, students are able to receive college credit through Ivy Tech State College after successfully completing required proficiencies.  A dedicated science teacher in the School Town of Highland for more than 30 years, Danny Chapman is a role model, an inspiration to his students, and an outstanding professional. Dan is a wonderful caring teacher who frequently offers a wide variety of activities and learning experiences to supplement the curriculum. The most notable, and perhaps most challenging experience, includes a three day/two night field trip to the Indiana Dunes Environmental Learning Center in Porter, Indiana. Here, students were involved in science-based activities for three days. Since 1994, Dan has served as co-sponsor for the Science Olympiad Team at Highland High School. Additionally, he is the Science Teacher for the Adult Education program for GED classes at Highland, a position he has held since 1996.  A professional educator for thirty-six years in the Lake Central School Corporation, Carole Selund is a valuable asset. Carole has taught both Spanish and English to freshmen and sophomores at Lake Central High School. Since Carole is conscientious about having her students meet the standards expected of them, she returned to college to earn a Master's degree in Reading and created the first curriculum in the Lake Central School Corporation to address individual reading problems in the student population. In addition, Carole is very active in the School Corporation. She has co-chaired a number of committees for the Performance Based Accreditation Committee and served on the North Central Accreditation Committee.  Twenty-three years ago, Patricia Premetz was hired to teach honors Geometry at Munster High School. She is described by her peers as an outstanding professional and dedicated teacher. For the past three and one-half years, Patricia has been the Department Chairperson and is now teaching honors PreCalculus. Her enthusiasm for the subject matter, as well as her teaching style, has withstood the test of time. Patricia makes learning an enjoyable experience, for she blends hercreative spirit and her willingness to experiment with new ideas and techniques to better foment mathematics concepts in the minds of her students. Patricia's compassion for others is exhibited by her thoughtfulness towards both students and teachers.  Ben Geesa came to the Newton School Corporation 27 years ago, after serving his country in the United States Air Force. Since technology plays a vital role in the world and the economy, Ben was instrumental in starting the first computer education classes at North Newton High School. Ben is known as the computer ``guru'' throughout the corporation, as he helps to troubleshoot computer problems. His peers know him as a dedicated teacher and he is a continuous source of enthusiasm for his students as well as his coworkers.  Kay Harness is a fine example of the tenets embodied by those who have dedicated their lives to educating America's youth. Kay hails from the Tri-Creek School Corporation, where she has greeted her students and colleagues with a genuine smile for over 33 years. She has been active in all aspects of the school environment and has given continued support to the Parent Teacher Organization. Kay strives to be approachable and communicates well with administrators, fellow teachers, students, and parents.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding educators on their receipt of the 2001-2002 Crystal Apple Award. The years of hard work they have put forth in shaping the minds and futures of Northwest Indiana's young people is a true inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
