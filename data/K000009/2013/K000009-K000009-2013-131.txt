Chairman, first of all, I want to thank Congressman Hastings for working with us and obviously participating in these debates for the entire day today. He is such an able and well-intentioned Member. His brilliance continues to inspire all of us on many issues, including this one.  I wanted to just say that I agree with the gentleman's intent in offering this amendment. And as I've said many times today, the allocation we were given as a subcommittee is simply insufficient to meet all of the needs that the Nation has certainly in this area of science.  The gentleman is correct that there is a $223 million--which is not insignificant--reduction from 2013 levels. So as we look to the future, there is less emphasis on science. I agree with the gentleman's intent. I wish we could restore all those dollars this evening.  I would also say that there's a constraint on us because we know that the President very much wants to engage in nuclear weapons reduction talks with other nations around the world, and I think it is important that he be able to negotiate from a position of strength. That is one of the reasons that the chairman and I are working so very hard to allow him to achieve the ultimate objective of nuclear arms reduction. So to take dollars from those accounts at this level really does create a bit of a pressure for us that would cause me to oppose the gentleman's amendment at this time. But I do so very reluctantly and with full understanding of what he is trying to achieve, and I want to thank him very much for waiting the entire day to offer this very, very important amendment that I hope some day to be able to support.  I urge my colleagues to consider however they may wish to vote on this.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
