Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) the chairman of the full committee, for yielding this time to me, and I also want to thank him for being one of the principal cosponsors, as well as my good friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos). We have had literally dozens of hearings in the subcommittee over the last several years when he was chair, and now that I chair the committee and we have heard from a myriad of victims of torture, from Indonesia, from Cuba, from countries in Africa, Central America, and the Eastern Bloc countries, including the former Soviet Union and Russia itself. The issue over and over again is horrific mistreatment designed to destroy the will and the body and the spirit of the individuals involved and to destroy whole communities when it is done systematically to achieve an end.  This legislation, H.R. 4309, the Torture Victims Relief Act has 30 cosponsors. Again, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) and I link arm in arm to fight to help those who have been hurt by despotic governments.  In 1996, Madam Speaker, our subcommittee held a hearing on an earlier version of this legislation and we heard testimony on the continued and widespread persistence of torture in the world today, and on what steps the United States and other free countries should take to do something about it. Three of our witnesses at that hearing--and, as has been said, we heard from people from all over the world, and the issue is always the same, the terrible mistreatment--but three of those people who were there that day: a native of Uganda who suffered at the hands of Idi Amin, a Tibetan physician who was tortured by the Chinese Communists, and an American who became a torture victim in Saudi Arabia, our ally, after he had a falling out with his employer, the Saudi government. They told us stories that brought tears to our eyes about how they were mistreated and how they bear the scars long after their ordeal.  Those who suffer horrific cruelty at the hands of despotic governments, military and/or police, do bear those scars; they are physical, they are emotional, they are spiritual, they are psychological, and they carry them for the rest of their lives. For many, if not most, the ordeal of torture certainly does not end when they are released from the gulag or the prison.  These victims, and there are millions of them around the world--there are an estimated 400,000 survivors of torture living right here in the United States--need our help. To date we have done far too little to assist these walking wounded. The Torture Victims Relief Act contains a number of important provisions designed to assist torture victims.  First, it authorizes grants for rehabilitation services for victims of torture and for related purposes in both foreign and domestic centers. The bill authorizes such sums as may be needed, subject to the Department of Health and Human Services, for contributions to centers for treatment of torture victims here in the U.S., and there are currently approximately 15 such centers. The precise amount of any contribution to these centers will be decided each year in the appropriation process. The ``such sums'' authorization language is contained in an amendment which is part of this bill today. It was suggested by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley) of the Committee on Commerce which has jurisdiction over HHS, and I do want to thank Chairman Bliley for his help on this legislation.  The legislation also authorizes $5 million in fiscal year 1999 and $7.5 million in fiscal year 2000 for international torture victim centers, and there are currently approximately 175 of those around the world. Regrettably, all of these centers, domestic and international, are seriously underfunded. As a matter of fact, the Denmark-based International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT), estimates the worldwide need for assisting victims to be $28 million, a significant portion of which is totally unmet.                              {time}  1435  H.R. 4309 also authorizes a voluntary contribution for the United States to the U.N. Voluntary Fund for victims of torture in the amount of $3 million in fiscal year 1999 and $3 million in fiscal year 2000. I am proud to say that our efforts--and it has been bipartisan with the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos)--have already had an effect on the U.S. contributions to the Voluntary Fund. The U.S. contribution to this fund in 1995 was $1.5 million. At the time when we introduced the bill in the 104th Congress, the administration had proposed to cut the fiscal year 1996 contribution to $500,000. Eventually, in response to our efforts by the supporters of this bill, the administration restored the full $1.5 million. The bill would bring it up to $3 million.  The bill also provides specialized training for foreign service officers in the identification of evidence of torture, techniques for interviewing torture victims, and related subjects.  Finally, the bill contains an expression of the sense of Congress that the U.S. shall use its voice and vote in the United Nations to support the investigation and elimination of these heinous practices which are prohibited by the Convention Against Torture. It is a good bill, it is a bipartisan bill, and I hope it gets unanimous support.
