President, I believe there are at least four or five Members here who would like to speak about Senator Jeffords' retirement. I ask unanimous consent those Members currently on the floor, Senators Rockefeller, Boxer, Harkin, Dodd and Kennedy, be recognized for such time as they consume, and I would like to add myself to that list, and then extend whatever time we use on the minority side, if they would like to use it as well.
