Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, no matter how many times the gentleman from Louisiana, the Republican whip, says that these are unfair hearings, or that they are secret hearings, or that Republicans can't participate, no matter how many times he says that, it will not be true.                              {time}  1845  He talks about secret hearings. I will show you the front page of The Washington Post about the hearing yesterday. It is on the front page.  Now, I know your Members can read. There are over 105 Members, 40 or so of your Members, who are authorized to sit in the committee.  The President, Mr. Speaker, called the Republicans, and he has tweeted about how they need to be tougher.  What I want to ask, Mr. Speaker, is: When are they going to focus on defending the Constitution of the United States?  I ask the gentleman: Does he believe that the President is above the law?
