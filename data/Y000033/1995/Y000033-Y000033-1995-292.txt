Mr. Speaker, as the author of H.R. 1141, I am pleased that we are considering this legislation to reauthorize and improve the effectiveness of the Sikes Act.  Since coming to Congress in 1973, I have led the fight to enhance and conserve the vital fish and wildlife resources that exist on our military lands. The Department of Defense [DOD] manages nearly 25 million acres at approximately 900 military bases nationwide. These lands contain a wealth of plant and animal life, they provide vital habitat for thousands of migratory waterfowl, and they are home for nearly 100 federally listed species.  The Department does a superb job of training our young men and women for combat. Regrettably, they often fail to do even an adequate job of comprehensive natural resource management planning. At far too many installations, management plans have never been written, are outdated, or are largely ignored. Furthermore, when these plans do exist, all too often they are not coordinated or integrated with other military activities.  While H.R. 1141 will make a number of improvements in the Sikes Act, the bill does not undermine in any way the fundamental training mission of a military base.  What the bill does is expand the scope of existing conservation plans to encompass all natural resource management activities, require management plans for all appropriate installations, mandate an annual report summarizing the status of these plans, require that trained personnel be available, and ensure that DOD shall manage each installation to provide for the conservation of fish and wildlife, and to allow the multipurpose uses of those resources. In addition, the bill extends the act's authorization for the next 3 years at half of the current funding level.  Mr. Speaker, this is a noncontroversial bill that has been thoroughly considered in both the Resources and National Security Committees. I want to thank Floyd Spence, Jim Saxton, Joel Hefley, and Gerry Studds for their leadership and for joining with me in this important conservation effort. I am confident that our bill will greatly assist DOD in the management of those natural resources under their jurisdiction.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on H.R. 1141.                              {time}  1600  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
