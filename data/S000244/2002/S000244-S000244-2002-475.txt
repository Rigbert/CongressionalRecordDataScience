Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment. The amendment is not germane. It fails the fundamental purpose test.  The fundamental purpose of the legislation is to provide mandatory minimum sentences for those convicted of sex offenses against children. The amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) exceeds the scope of this legislation by directing a component of the Department of Justice to study a subject not contemplated by the bill, namely, the effectiveness of treatment for incarcerated and nonincarcerated sex offenders.  Therefore, the amendment is not germane, and the point of order should be ruled well taken by the Chair.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order?  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.  The gentleman from Wisconsin raises a point of order that the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas is not germane.  To be germane, an amendment not only must have the same end as the matter sought to be amended, but also must contemplate a method of achieving that end that is closely allied to the method contemplated by the bill. For example, as recorded in section 933 of the House Rules and Manual, the Chair has held that, to a bill addressing substance abuse through prevention and treatment, an amendment imposing civil penalties on drug dealers was not germane.  The pending bill narrowly amends the Federal Criminal Code to establish a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for twice-convicted sex offenders against children. The amendment requires the National Institute of Justice to report to Congress on the availability and effectiveness of treatment for perpetrators of sex offenses against children and on the effectiveness of probation and parole supervision in reducing rates of recidivism of such sex offenses.  The bill is narrowly drafted to address only sentencing of certain sex offenders of children. The amendment, by addressing treatment and rehabilitation, proposes an unrelated method and is, therefore, not germane to the bill.  The point of order is sustained. The amendment is not in order.                         parliamentary inquiry
