Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will continue to yield, the other concern I have is the Homeland Security Act itself that we passed out of our committee had this provision in it, 7 years; and what I do not want is to preclude someone from being employed in a port, that, if there has been a felony created that is not terrorist related, sabotage related, or secession related, he be precluded from being able to be hired.  Some people say if he is a felon, he should not be hired. I can tell the Members that the business I am in, a lot of people in their earlier years probably got into some sort of trouble sometime, but they are not terrorists. These people are trying to make a good living, trying to provide for society and trying to be helpful to this Nation and are not a threat. I do not want someone unable to obtain employment because of beyond 7 years, 15 years, 20 years, and have that person not be eligible to be employed.  The gentleman has heard this argument before. I believe he was on the Committee on Homeland Security meeting when I presented that, and it was adopted, and it passed on this floor. In fact, it is in the bill. It has not become law because, as the gentleman knows, we have not gone to conference with the Senate.  So I understand what the gentleman is trying to do, but I ask two things from him: if he would consider not offering the amendment, withdrawing it, or not asking for a vote on it, and we will not have a vote on it, or we will, in turn, take care of this in conference, because he and I are going to be on the conference. I know what he is trying to do, but I do not want someone to be punished because they are really good citizens today.
