Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney), who has fought so very hard on this issue.  Mr. McNERNEY. I thank the gentlewoman.  Mr. Chair, I am basically appealing to my colleagues. There are solutions out there. We can find a whole State solution to which all stakeholders have input. Right now that is not what this is. This is pitting one region against the other, and it is going to perpetuate what has been called the California water war. We didn't need to go there. There are solutions.
