President, we are on the verge of passing major port security legislation that will provide the structures and resources needed to better protect the American people from attack through seaports that are both vulnerable points of entry and vital centers of economic activity.  I wish to thank all those who have been involved in this effort: the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman; the Commerce Committee chairman and ranking member; Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus on the Finance Committee. Most of all, I thank Senator Patty Murray, who has been my partner in the port security legislation from conception to this day. It has been a great honor and pleasure to work with her.  I have a list of the hard-working staff, my staff on the Homeland Security Committee, who have worked on this issue. I ask unanimous consent that a list of their names be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           Port Security Team       Rob Strayer, Mark Winter, Jon Nass, Allison Boyd, Amy Hall,      Melvin Albritton, Mark LeDuc, Jane Alonso, Ann Fisher, John      Grant, Asha Mathews, Kurt Schmautz, Jay Maroney, Amanda Wood,      Jennifer Hemingway, Sarah Taylor, Brooke Hayes, Kate Alford,      Amanda Hill, Priscilla Hanley, Monica Wickey, and Tom Bishop.       Detailees: Steve Midas, Coast Guard; Jennifer Boone, FBI;      and Mike Moncibaiz, CBP.
