That is low-yield or low-population States. They have to be looked after. As he points out, people are driving through, yet they don't have the population base to be supporting large amounts of revenue to pay for the roads.  On the other hand, we see Senators such as the Presiding Officer now, from the State of Texas, one of the fastest growing, largest States. He certainly has problems. So being very careful to try to take care of all these diverse needs in establishing a formula to put together something that would take care of the large States, we put in a ceiling and we put in a floor. We put something in there for donee and donor States. It is a very difficult formula.  I remind my colleagues who might not feel this is a fair approach to it, to remember, to recall when we tried to do this before under TEA-21, we had a purely political system. Everybody got a percentage of the amount of money that was there and it was all driven by politics. Once they received 60 votes, they didn't care what happened. We are not doing that. We have a formula that takes care of all these needs.  I saw the senior Senator from Pennsylvania coming through just a moment ago and there have been some complaints from that State. I compare that to my State. My State is 20 percent larger than the State of Pennsylvania, yet we have roughly the same number of miles of roads. Yet under this formula, he is receiving some $3 for every $1 we receive. That doesn't look like I do a very good job for my State of Oklahoma. Nevertheless, it is a reality that we have to consider all these things.  If you look at some of the compromises we have made, we had four principals who spent more time than anyone else drafting this bill. They were, of course, myself as chairman, Senator Jeffords as the ranking member, Senator Reid as the ranking member on the subcommittee, and Senator Bond on the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, subcommittee chairman.
