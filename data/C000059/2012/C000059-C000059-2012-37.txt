Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Jurupa Valley are exceptional. Our area has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Elliott Duchon is one of these individuals. On Saturday, May 19, 2012, Duchon was recognized as the Citizen of the Year by the Jurupa Valley Chamber of Commerce for his work as the Jurupa Unified School District Superintendent.  In 1974, Duchon graduated from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) with a Master's Degree in Education and Psychology. After graduation, he was an elementary teacher for the Jurupa Unified School District where he also served on school planning committees, including the school site council. After three years of teaching, Duchon was self employed and served as a consultant to the Riverside County Superintendent of Schools where he performed land use studies and demographic research and analysis to form aLong Range Facility Plan for the 22 school districts in Riverside County. In 1981, Duchon became a Systems Planning Analyst for the Riverside County Office of Education (RCOE) where he performed planning and administrative duties related to the management of a fourteen building, $20 million facility construction program.  After two years as the Systems Planning Analyst, Duchon became the Instructional Computing Project Manager for the Inland Empire Teacher Education and Computer Center within RCOE. In this role, he was responsible for an array of services related to the instructional uses of education technology. The services were provided to the 58 school districts in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. In 1985, Duchon was promoted to Director of the Region 13 Teacher Education and Computer Center where he was responsible for the two-county staff development program in all areas of the curriculum. In 1991, he was promoted again to Director of Administrative Services for RCOE where he was responsible for administration and management for the Department of Administrative Services, which included the Geographic Information Center, internal and external support for school facilities development, school district elections, staff support to the County Committee on School District Organization and other management services. After ten years as the Director, Duchon was promoted to the Riverside County Assistant Superintendent of Schools, Administrative Support Services, Division of Information Technology/Governmental Relations. In 2001, Duchon became the Deputy Superintendent for the Jurupa Unified School District and after three years became the Superintendent of Schools for the District.  As Superintendent, Duchon was responsible for all aspects of operating a 20,000 student school district with over 2,000 employees and a $160 million budget. His major accomplishments include a District Academic Performance Index (API) that has risen 100 points during his tenure; the District has four Distinguished Schools and two Title I Achieving Schools; a 100% rating of Highly Qualified Teachers; the completion and opening of a new high school; the establishment of an Early College High School Academy with Riverside Community College; the District has received three Golden Bell awards; and the student achievement gap has narrowed. During his time, Duchon has been recognized by the Region XIX Association of California School Administrators as the 2007 Superintendent of the Year; recognized as the West Riverside School Administrators 2006 Superintendent of the Year; and recognized by the Riverside County, California School Bilingual Educators chapter as the 2006 Superintendent of the Year.  In light of all Elliott Duchon has done for the students, parents and community of Jurupa Valley it is only fitting that he be honored as the Superintendent of the Year. Elliott Duchon's tireless passion for education and public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
