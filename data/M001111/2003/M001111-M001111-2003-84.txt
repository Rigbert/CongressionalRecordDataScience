 I heard the President on Labor Day. I was delighted to hear that he was facing up to the fact that our economy is struggling, with thousands of people out of work. I am very perplexed that he is not willing to add additional money to train our workers.  As the Senator from Massachusetts knows, when a young man or woman is laid off, they don't have the money to provide for their family. It impacts not just themselves but their entire family and their entire community as theystruggle. They are not going to find the same jobs. Our economy is changing. The only way they are going to get back into the workforce is if we give them the skills and training to get into the economic sectors that have job openings. These programs are critical in getting our economy back on track. They are fundamental to getting our economy back on track.  It is very perplexing to me that the President has not asked for nor supports the amendment before us that will help those workers.
