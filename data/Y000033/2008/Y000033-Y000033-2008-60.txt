Madam Speaker, I think it would be instructive for Members to see this letter from the national organizations representing the oil producers, oil and gas supply industries and the off shore oil and gas infrastructure supply industry; the organizations that supply domestic energy for the American consumer.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. John Boehner,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Pelosi: We write today in opposition of HR      6251, the so-called ``use it or lose it'' legislation under      consideration in the House today. As Americans cope with $4 a      gallon gasoline, it is regrettable that some in Congress      choose to propose diversionary legislation, not based on      facts, instead of focusing on the real issue--the need for      additional energy supplies to meet growing world energy      demand.       Over the past few weeks, rhetoric surrounding our nation's      lack of a coherent energy policy has reached an apex.      Unfortunately, policy proposals like the ``use it or lose      it'' legislation ignore fundamental facts about the oil and      gas industry and jeopardize the long-term energy security of      our nation.       Every energy forecast has predicted that oil and natural      gas will be a critical component of America's growing energy      demands. The federal Energy Information Administration (EIA)      estimates 88% of our nation's energy needs will be met by      oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power in the year 2030.      This fact is being lost in the proposals of some members of      Congress. While political candidates talk of energy      independence, some in Congress are offering proposals that      will lead our nation in the opposite direction. These members      ignore the challenges of domestic production, and make      unfounded accusations such as the latest charge that non-     producing leases are the same as inactive leases. This      couldn't be further from the truth.       The U.S. oil and natural gas industry is in the business of      supplying energy, not sitting on it. The industry has      reliably supplied our nation with the necessary energy to      move our cars and fuel our homes and will continue to do so      for decades to come. The industry buys leases with the intent      to produce all commercially viable reserves of oil and      natural gas. Unfortunately, not every acre of land under      lease contains oil or natural gas. In fact, many leases do      not contain any commercially recoverable oil or natural gas      resources.       But these non-commercial leases continue to provide rental      payments for the federal government, on top of bonus bids      paid for the right to explore this land. In fact, the federal      government received more than $9 billion in bonus bids from      the last four offshore lease sales alone.       For the acreage that does include promising reserve      prospects, it can take years and millions, or even billions,      of dollars to develop this resource. The exploration process,      which precedes production, necessarily takes time. Seismic      surveys must be undertaken, delineation wells must be      drilled, government permits must be obtained, environmental      regulations must be adhered to, and complex production      facilities must be engineered and installed.       Oil and gas development is an extensive, expensive and      time-consuming process, even with advances in technology. As      an example, in the U.S. ultra deepwater (greater than 5000      ft) in the Gulf of Mexico--where some of our nation's most      promising new discoveries have been made--only 21% of wells      drilled have resulted in a discovery of oil or natural gas.      However, as a result of this industry's willingness to invest      billions of dollars despite these odds--and because of what      has historically been a stable domestic oil and natural gas      regulatory regime--the U.S. oil and gas industry has      continued to explore the Gulf of Mexico. This exploration has      resulted in an 820% increase in deepwater oil production and      a roughly 1,155% increase in deepwater natural gas production      from 1992 to 2006, while adding billions of dollars in      revenue to the federal treasury.       In fact, royalty payments provide the second-largest      revenue stream to the federal government, behind only federal      taxes administered by the IRS.       The ability to explore in Gulf Coast waters has resulted in      not only a steady stream of major discoveries since the mid      1990s, but also a tripling of estimated undiscovered      potential from 1995 to 2003. Similarly, Prudhoe Bay, Alaska      was initially thought to contain 9 billion barrels of oil,      but the industry has already produced about 12 billion      barrels and it still is estimated to contain reserves of      another 6 billion barrels. Imagine what American industrial      ingenuity could find through environmentally responsible      exploration and development of 85% of Lower 48 Outer      Continental Shelf and 83% of onshore federal lands that are      currently off-limits or facing significant restrictions to      development.       The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Mineral Leasing      Act, and the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands already      establish a regulatory system that sets time limits on lease      terms, establishes annual rental payments for leases that are      not yet in production, and requires diligent development of      all available resources. The current debate does not      acknowledge these facts. The American public deserves a      policy discussion grounded in market fundamentals.
