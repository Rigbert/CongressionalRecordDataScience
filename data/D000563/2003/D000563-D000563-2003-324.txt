The understanding was we would provide resources to the school districts to help them meet this challenge. This bill fails by $6 billion to provide the resources for the school districts.  My amendment says this: We will suspend the mandates. We require the testing to continue so we know the progress being made by the students. But unless and until we are ready to fund this bill as we promised, we are suspending the mandates on the school districts to move children within the school districts, and the other mandated requirements.  I say to my friends, when you go home and speak to the leaders in school districts, they will tell you, as good an idea as this was, Senator, you are not providing the funds. It is an unfunded Federal mandate.  I hope if you have heard the same story from your local school districts that are ready to work with us, ready to comply with No Child Left Behind, you will join me in suspending these mandates until we reach the funding level we promised under No Child Left Behind.
