President, reserving the right to object, what I am about to say is no reflection on the Senator from Oklahoma nor the merits of his amendment. We have almost 100 amendments filed and 17 pending, and the majority leader has asked that we at least reflect on those filed and set our schedule accordingly. I am not saying this will not be considered, but at the moment we are going to object to the offering of additional amendments. So I do object.
