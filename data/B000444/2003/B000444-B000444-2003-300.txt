 I do not want to hold people up on Friday afternoon. But if we don't have something we are going to go to right away--in other words, I don't want to get in the chairman's way. But, otherwise, I would like to speak. But I know it is Friday afternoon. I see people with topcoats on their laps, and they have places to go. I can make this the last order of business today. But I don't want to yield to others who are not going to speak on an amendment. But I will yield if you really think we are going to move to something and we are going to act on it. That is my point.  I ask the Senator from Alaska if he can tell me what the plans are.
