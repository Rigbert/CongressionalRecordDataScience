Mr. Speaker, we have before us two pieces of legislation regarding the ongoing humanitarian and political crisis that is occurring in the country of Venezuela, which has been reduced to poverty and near starvation due to the repressive regime of Nicolas Maduro and that of his dictatorial predecessor Hugo Chavez.  I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. DeSantis, for introducing H. Res. 259, of which I am an original cosponsor, and to applaud Mr. Engel for highlighting the public corruption and threat to democracy in Venezuela via his H.R. 2658, the Venezuela Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance Act.  I also would like to single out the lead Republican cosponsor of that legislation, the gentlewoman from Florida and my friend and colleague, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her work over the years in calling attention to the deplorable human rights situation not only in Venezuela, but also in Cuba, Nicaragua, China and so many countries the world over.  As Ileana understands so well, it is the ideology of the Left--be it hard core Communism, or the Socialism of Hugo Chavez andnow that of his understudy in oppression, Nicolas Maduro--which has brought suffering to so many people.  The people of Venezuela deserve far better.
