President, John Duricka was not only one of the finest photographers I ever knew, but also one of the best reporters of the Capitol. His photos will illustrate our history books for decades and generations to come. He was a man who suffered greatly in the last few months of his life with cancer, but few of us knew how badly it was.  I had a conversation with him at the beginning of the summer in which he talked of going to the Republican and Democratic Conventions. I told him I was looking forward to seeing him at ours and would probably be asking him for tips on exposures and angles for my own photography at that convention. It became too much, and he did not make it there, and more is the pity.  Last week, there was a memorial service for him there. Many spoke in eulogies of him. They spoke of a man who always had to get the photo but never forgot there were other photographers he worked with. Over and over,I saw him in a committee room where he would come in--you always get a nice smile from him--and I would see him go over, find a great angle, take a couple shots, and often, if there was a new photographer there, he would point that angle out to him.  The article that is printed at the end of this from the Associated Press speaks far better about him, as I think Mr. Abrams is far more eloquent than I, and that is why I want it included.  I was pleased to see the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, also spoke about him last week. He well deserves that.                               Exhibit 1              [From the Associated Press, Sept. 24, 1996]                        AP Photographer Praised                            (By Jim Abrams)       The Senate and House opened their sessions Tuesday with      tributes to AP photographer John A. Duricka, a veteran of      Capitol Hill photo coverage who died Monday.       ``The Senate and all Americans lost a true professional      yesterday,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``The      measure of John's professionalism and dedication is he was on      the job almost up to the time of his death doing what he      loved and doing it wonderfully well.''       Lott spoke of Duricka's ``combination of mature demeanor      and tough determination'' and added: ``All who treasure our      freedoms of the press and free expression will miss his      outstanding contributions to that end.''       In the House, Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., said Duricka was      ``a great friend to me.'' Dreier recalled that he delivered      the eulogy at the funeral of Duricka's brother, a      photographer at the San Gabriel Valley Tribune who was killed      in a plane crash several years ago.       ``John Duricka was a great man and he took wonderful,      photographs and he's one of those institutions in this      Capitol who will be sorely missed,'' Dreier said.       Jonathan Wolman, AP's Washington bureau chief, said: ``From      Bobby Byrd to Newt Gingrich, John captured all the great      figures of Congress. He illustrated the legislative process      with pictures of leaders, lobbyists and hundreds of ordinary      citizens who appeared in committee hearings.''       Duricka was ``a professional's professional,'' Sen. Patrick      Leahy, D-Vt., recalled Monday. ``His work was seen by      millions who never knew his name. He was a familiar presence      on Capitol Hill and I always looked for him among the      photographers. He was a friend to many, and he will be      missed.''       Duricka, 58, had a 30-year career as an AP photographer. He      was chairman of the congressional Standing Committee of Press      Photographers, which represents the interests of still      photographers.
