 I also want to thank them for seeking my support. Early on in the discussions, because of concerns, I took the time to discuss this with virtually all of the parties involved. In a meeting in my office in September of last year, one of those parties was British Petroleum. British Petroleum would be a major supplier or purveyor of Alaskan crude.  One of the concerns that I had was that we not create jobs somewhere else and take jobs from our people, specifically the merchant marine. The two authors have been good enough to see to it that the legislation reflects that the oil must be transported on American-flag and American-crewed vessels and has secured that as a part of the legislation. There is another part to this, and that is American-built vessels. But because of a GATT problem, it is not possible to put this in the legislation.  In September, I received a letter and I would like to quickly read this letter and ask the Senator directly the question. The letter is addressed to me and it says:       Further to discussions with you held September 30, 1994, if      the ban on Alaska exports is lifted, BP will commit now and      in the future to use only U.S.-built, U.S.-flag, U.S.-crewed      ships for such exports. We will supplement or replace ships      required to transport Alaskan crude oil with the U.S.-built      ships as existing ships are phased out under the provisions      in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.       I hope that this commitment satisfies your request that      Alaska oil exports be carried on U.S.-built, U.S.-flag ships,      manned by U.S. crews.           Yours, sincerely,                                                  Steven Benz,                                                        President,                                     BP Oil Shipping Company, USA.  My question to the Senator from Alaska is: Is this agreement still in effect?
