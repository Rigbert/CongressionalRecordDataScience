President, I rise today to introduce the Slamming Protection Act of 1997. This measure enables long-distance telephone consumers and the States to strike back against ``slamming,'' the practice of changing a telephone customer's long-distance carrier without the customer's knowledge or consent.  Slamming is the Federal Communications Commission's largest source of consumer complaints. In 1995, more than a third of the consumer complaints filed with the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau involved slamming. Last year 16,000 long-distance telephone consumers filed slamming complaints with the FCC. Since 1994, the number of slamming complaints has tripled. Yet, this is only the tip of the iceberg. Moreover, the Los Angeles Times reports that more than 1 millionAmerican telephone consumers have been slammed in the last 2 years.  Slamming is not merely an inconvenience or a nuisance. It is an act of fraud that costs long-distance telephone consumers millions of dollars a year.  Let me give you an example. This January, Ms. Geryl Kramer, a small business owner in Chicago, was surprised to open her phone bill and find it noticeably more expensive than usual. After numerous phone calls she discovered that without her knowledge or consent, her long-distance carrier had been changed--she had been slammed. Her long-distance telephone service became a ping-pong ball bounced among various long-distance carriers for their profit and at her expense.  Ms. Kramer spent countless hours attempting to resolve the situation, going back and forth between four different long-distance carriers who were involved in the slamming which had quadrupled her small business' long-distance bills. Although she was slammed in November last year, she still has not been able to track down how she was slammed or who was responsible.  Ms. Kramer was understandably upset and frustrated. Beyond being exasperated by the audacity of the slammer, Ms. Kramer was left feeling powerless by her inability to hold the slammer accountable for its fraudulent actions. Having explored every other avenue, Ms. Kramer came to me seeking a solution to the problem of slamming. I believe the Slamming Protection Act is that solution.  The current protections against slamming are simply inadequate. Although long-distance telephone consumers can currently bring an action in Federal court or file a complaint with the FCC, these measures have been largely ineffective in reducing slamming. The economic damages suffered by consumers are often relatively insignificant--it would cost more to sue for recovery than the consumer would ever recover in court.  Moreover, if a long-distance telephone consumer files an FCC slamming complaint, the only redress is to be excused from paying the additional cost of the long-distance bill, if the bill is more expensive than it would have been under the original long-distance carrier. Thus, the consumer who is slammed must take the time and effort to file the complaint and participate in the investigation. Yet, when all is said and done, all the consumer can get after being defrauded is to be excused from paying the additional costs. Not surprisingly, slammers are undeterred by this system. And, it turns out, they have little to fear from broader FCC investigations.  The FCC does have administrative enforcement procedures against slamming. Although the FCC's efforts are a step in the right direction, they are too slow moving and seldom result in more than a slap on the wrist. Last year the FCC processed roughly 13,000 slamming complaints. This is only a fraction of the number of slamming incidents. And only rarely do the FCC's efforts result in changes in industry practice.  Since the FCC began investigating slamming in 1994, it has only moved against seven long-distance carriers and has only entered into consent decrees with eight long-distance carriers accused of slamming. Moreover, any fine or settlement agreement achieved by the FCC is paid to the U.S. Treasury, not the long-distance telephone consumer who was slammed--not to the party who was harmed.  Mr. President, we need tougher laws on the books. Long-distance telephone consumers should be able to stand up for themselves and fight back against slammers to let them know that their actions will not pay.  The Slamming Protection Act will help stamp out slamming by providing individual long-distance telephone consumers with the right and the power to strike back against individual slammers and by establishing penalties that will make slamming too risky and too expensive for the practice to remain profitable.  This measure will help end slamming in three ways:  First, it creates a right of action for long-distance telephone consumers to sue the slammer in State or Federal court. The Slamming Protection Act establishes minimum statutory damages of $2,000--or $6,000 if the slamming was done willfully and knowingly. These substantial penalties are designed to have a significant deterrent effect and to be large enough to encourage consumers to bring such actions;  Second, the Slamming Protection Act provides State attorneys general with the right to bring suit against slammers on behalf of the citizens of their States. Currently, in some jurisdictions the States are virtually helpless in their fight against interstate slammers. There is no existing Federal right of action to allow the States to hold slammers accountable. And a number of courts have held that similar State laws are preempted by Federal law. Some States, therefore, are left without recourse to prevent their citizens from being injured by slammers; and  Finally, the Slamming Protection Act creates criminal fines and jail time for repeat and willful slammers. Slamming takes choices away from consumers without their knowledge and distorts the long distance competitive market by rewarding companies that engage in misleading marketing practices. The Slamming Protection Act's criminal penalties will guarantee that slammers can no longer act with impunity.  Thank you Mr. President for the opportunity to introduce this important initiative. I hope my colleagues will join with me and support The Slamming Protection Act in order to help long-distance telephone consumers and the States to fight back against deceptive and fraudulent slammers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1137       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1984 (47 U.S.C.      258) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(c) Criminal Penalties.--       ``(1) Persons.--Any person who executes a change in a      provider of telephone exchange service or telephone toll      service in willful violation of the procedures prescribed      under subsection (a)--       ``(A) shall be fined not more than $1,000, imprisoned not      more than 30 days, or both, for the first offense; and       ``(B) shall be fined not more than $10,000, imprisoned not      more than 9 months, or both, for any subsequent offense.       ``(2) Telecommunications carriers.--Any telecommunications      carrier who executes a change in a provider of telephone      exchange service or telephone toll service in willful      violation of the procedures prescribed under subsection (a)      shall be fined not more than $50,000 for the first offense      and shall be fined not more than $100,000 for any subsequent      offense.       ``(d) Private Right of Action.--       ``(1) In general.--A subscriber whose provider of telephone      exchange service or telephone toll service is changed in      violation of the procedures prescribed under subsection (a)      may, within one year after discovery of the change, bring in      an appropriate court an action--       ``(A) for an order to revoke the change;       ``(B) for an award of damages in an amount equal to the      greater of--       ``(i) the actual monetary loss resulting from the change;      or       ``(ii) an amount not to exceed $2,000; or       ``(C) for relief under both subparagraphs (A) and (B).       ``(2) Increased award.--If the court finds that the      defendant executed the change in willful and knowing      violation of the procedures prescribed under subsection (a),      the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the      award under paragraph (1) to an amount equal to not more than      three times the maximum amount awardable under subparagraph      (B) of that paragraph.       ``(e) Actions by States.--       ``(1) Authority of states.--Whenever the attorney general      of a State, or an official or agency designated by a State,      has reason to believe that any person has engaged or is      engaging in a pattern or practice of unauthorized changes in      providers of telephone exchange service or telephone toll      service of residents in such State in violation of the      procedures prescribed under subsection (a), the State may      bring a civil action on behalf of its residents to enjoin      such practices, to recover damages equal to the actual      monetary loss suffered by such residents, or both.
