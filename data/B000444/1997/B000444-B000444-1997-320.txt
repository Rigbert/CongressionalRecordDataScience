 My distinguished colleague from Delaware is Senator Roth, who is my close friend. Every single Federal judge in the last 24 years who has been appointed in the district of Delaware or the third circuit has been appointed by Senator Roth. I did not expect, did not ask, and not once was ever consulted about who he would appoint, and I supported every one that he sent up. Not one single time was I made aware of anything other than after the fact, which is OK. I am not complaining about that.
