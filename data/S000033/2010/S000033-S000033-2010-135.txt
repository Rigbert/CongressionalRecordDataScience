 President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3548 be designated as a Pryor amendment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, earlier today the senior Senator from Oklahoma incorrectly claimed that an article entitled, ``McCain Breaks Own Pork Rule'' that ran in Roll Call on November 6, 2003, proved that I had broken my pledge against requesting earmarks. However, the Senator failed to mention that Roll Call subsequently ran a correction to this article on November 17, 2003, stating that, ``the article inaccurately stated that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) violated his own rules against so-called ``pork barrel'' spending.'' I ask unanimous consent that the entirety of the original story and, more importantly, the correction published in Roll Call be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Roll Call, Nov. 6, 2003]                          Correction Appended                           (By Emily Pierce)       After years of crusading against ``pork-barrel'' spending      projects in Congressional appropriations bills, Sen. John      McCain (R-Ariz.) may be breaking his own rules.       McCain pushed for, and got, $14.3 million for Arizona's      Luke Air Force Base inserted into the just-completed fiscal      2004 military construction appropriations conference report.       The only problem is the project to acquire more land near      the base was not requested by President Bush or fully      authorized by the Senate Armed Services Committee--two of      McCain's criteria for identifying so-called ``pork.''       ``Even though this project is in clear violation of the      McCain rule because it was not authorized nor requested, we      are happy to provide the funds at his request and the request      of other members of the Arizona delegation,'' said House      Appropriations Committee spokesman John Scofield.       Scofield also noted that the provision may violate other      tenets of McCain's ``pork'' rules because the purpose of the      funds--to acquire land to prevent the encroachment of      residential development near the base's live-fire range--is      not included in Defense's long-term strategic plans and may      not be achievable within a five-year time frame.       Senate Appropriations Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who      has bitterly fought McCain's repeated attempts to strike even      the smallest of pork projects during Senate floor debate on      appropriations, was blithe about the news that McCain had      secured an earmark for his own state.       ``One man's pork is another man's alternate white meat,''      said Stevens. ``We don't discriminate. . . . If he asked for      it, we put it in.''       McCain defended his actions, saying he first sought      authorization for the measure in the fiscal 2004 Defense      Department authorization bill.       ``The fact that the appropriations bill may [be sent to the      president] before the authorization bill is not relevant to      my point of view, because we did the authorization before we      did the appropriations bill,'' McCain said of the order the      bills came to the Senate floor.       McCain, who sits on the Armed Services Committee in charge      of devising the Defense Department authorization, said he has      little control over the process once it passes the Senate      floor.       ``It was my job to get it authorized,'' he said. ``So I had      no involvement after that.''       Part of the problem is that the Defense authorization bill,      which gives the Appropriations committees the official      authority to dole out money to the Pentagon, has been stalled      in conference negotiations for months over various issues,      most notably McCain's insistence that an Air Force-Boeing      lease deal be scrapped.       McCain has charged that the Boeing deal to lease 100 tanker      planes over several years would cost much more than simply      buying the planes outright. Meanwhile, the Defense Department      has argued that the plan will expend less money in the short-     term and that they don't currently have enough money to buy      the planes.       While Armed Services negotiators in both chambers say they      have made some progress toward resolving their differences on      the Boeing lease deal and other issues, it is unclear whether      the bill will actually become law this year.                       Correction: Nov. 17, 2003       The article inaccurately stated that Sen. John McCain (R-     Ariz.) violated his own rules against so-called ``pork      barrel'' spending. The Senate Parliamentarian's office      maintains that the provision was properly authorized in the      Senate-passed version of the fiscal 2004 Defense      authorization bill and did not need to be signed by the      president to be considered ``authorized,'' as the article      suggested. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), chairwoman of      the Appropriations subcommittee on military construction,      told Roll Call that McCain never specifically asked her to      put the $14.3 million project for Arizona's Luke Air Force      Base into the fiscal 2004 military construction bill.                          ____________________
