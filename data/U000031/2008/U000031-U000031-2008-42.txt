William Johnson of St. Joseph, Michigan. An accomplished businessman and community leader, Bill Johnson is retiring from the board of directors of Lakeland Health Care after more than 33 years of service.  During that time he has led Lakeland through a period of phenomenal growth, with the construction of new facilities, the addition of state-of-the-art equipment, and many awards for quality health care. Beginning back in 1975, Bill Johnson has used his leadership and team building skills to implement hospital mergers, build model care programs, and develop world-class community health initiatives. Since 1993, Bill Johnson has served as the chairman of the Lakeland Health Care Board, and he leaves a legacy that will shape health care in southwest Michigan for years to come.  Bill Johnson was born in Lincoln, Illinois, and graduated from the University of Illinois. He served his country as a first lieutenant and company commander in the United States Army.  Following that service to his country, he became an innovative and respected business leader. He was president of Heath Company, vice president of strategic alliances for Zenith Data Systems, and even after his retirement, he came back as chief operating officer for Gast Manufacturing Corporation.  He brought his business experience and entrepreneurial flair to Lakeland Health Care and to a number of other community organizations. And while Bill Johnson formally steps down as the chairman of the board, we all know he will continue to be involved in the community he loves. He and his wife Patt and family are true cornerstones of our corner of Michigan.                          ____________________
