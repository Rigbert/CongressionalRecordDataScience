President, today I rise to introduce the Affordable Housing Preservation and Revitalization Act. I am delighted and honored to be joined in this effort by my good friend and colleague, Senator Jeff Merkley. It has been my privilege to work with Senator Merkley and his staff on an issue that is so important to our State of Oregon and to folks around the country.  There has been a lot of talk about housing in the media over the past year. The topic of most of these conversations has been the foreclosure crisis and the continued fallout from the mortgage meltdown.  But there is another housing story here, even though it may not get the same attention or airtime: It is the story of homelessness and the struggle to find affordable housing, and for thousands of Oregonians it's a daily reality.  Like many States, Oregon is experiencing a sharp rise in homelessness.  The most recent count available from Oregon, found 19,208 people homeless on a particular night. That number represented a 12 percent increase in homelessness over 2009.  This same count also indicates that 31 percent of those experiencing homelessness were children and the number of homeless families with children rose 33 percent from 2009.  In times like these, the Federal Government can hardly stand to lose its stock of affordable housing. Sadly, that is exactly what's happening.  As long-term contracts are coming due, many landlords are leaving the business of affordable housing for the private market. As these owners convert to market rents, which is in their economic interest, the low-income tenants will be unable to afford their homes. With fewer and fewer places to turn, many of these folks will end up on the street.  Some of these properties have what are known as residual receipts--funds left over once the operating expenses and owner's distribution have been paid. Currently, this money can only be used in the most extreme of situations. As a result, many of these residual receipts have accumulated for nearly 3 decades. In Oregon alone, estimates suggest there are more than $10 million in untapped residual receipts.  Senator Merkley and I believe these funds represent a substantial asset that could be used to help preserve affordable housing projects with expiring contracts. That is why we are introducing the Affordable Housing Preservation and Revitalization Act.  Our legislation would permit residual receipts to be transferred with affordable housing properties that are sold to non-profits, provided the non-profits commit to preserving and maintaining the housing stock as affordable.  Our legislation isn't a magic bullet and it certainly will not ensure that every American can put a roof over their head. But we think it's the kind of commonsense approach that Americans can get behind. I hope that our colleagues will join us in supporting this bill.                                 ______                                       By
