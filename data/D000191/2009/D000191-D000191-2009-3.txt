Speaker, just over 2 years ago, Fish and Wildlife Service arrested a dozen individuals for repeatedly and deliberately killing protected raptors under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. In many cases, the individuals used cruel and shocking methods of torture, mutilation, poisoning, suffocation, and clubbing to kill and wound these birds. They then bragged about their egregious behavior on the internet and to members of their organizations.  Despite the horrific nature of the crimes, the defendants who pleaded guilty to the Class B Misdemeanor--the same penalty ascribed to unauthorized uses of the Woodsy Owl and Smokey Bear characters--escaped with fines far smaller than the maximum allowances and were granted probation or given community service.  I and thousands of Oregonians were outraged by the nature of these wanton and senseless crimes. Yet, the individuals responsible only received a stiff slap on the wrist, demonstrating that courts often do not take wildlife crimes seriously enough. Regrettably, horrific violence against protected migratory birds continues across the country.  I introduced H.R. 2062 to provide Fish and Wildlife Service with a law enforcement tool that would allow the agency to prosecute the most egregious violations of the MBTA with serious penalties. This bill would also send a clear message to courts that Congress does take wildlife crimes seriously and expects courts to apply penalties that measure up to the shocking nature of some of these crimes.  The bill before the House today is the consensus product of over 6 months of discussion with conservation groups, hunting associations, Fish and Wildlife Service, the States, and the Republican minority. The bill was passed unanimously by the House Committee on Natural Resources on November 18th. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
