President, I strongly support this Resolution, which seeks to hasten the return of Zachary Baumel, a United States citizen, and other Israeli soldiers missing in action.  My staff met with Mr. Baumel's mother, and she described a heart-wrenching account of over 17 years of trying to obtain information about her son, Zachary, who in 1982, while serving in the Israeli military, was captured after a tank battle with Syrian forces in Lebanon. He has not been heard from since, and the only evidence she has recovered is half of Mr. Baumel's dog tag which was delivered by Yasser Arafat to the Israeli Government.  According to the Department of State, the Palestinian Authority has provided information which could lead to locating and securing the return of Mr. Baumel. This contrasts with the total lack of cooperation from either Syrian or Lebanese authorities. The fact remains that Mr. Baumel's whereabouts remains a mystery.  I hope this Resolution gives some solace to the families of Mr. Baumel and the two other Israeli soldiers who are missing. Their disappearance is unquestionably a matter of deep concern to the Congress. It is unconscionable that these families have yet to be told of the fate of their loved ones.  The amendment I have offered, which modifies one provision in HR 1175 that is of particular interest to the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of which I am Ranking Member, has been approved by both the House and Senate sponsors of the bill and the family of Mr. Baumel, and is supported by the State Department. It was drafted in a sincere effort to make it more likely that this Resolution leads to the result that the families intend, and to preserve the role of the United States Government as an honest broker in the Middle East peace process.
