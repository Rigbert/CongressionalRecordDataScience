We submit this resolution to keep alive in the memory of all Americans the sacrifice and commitment of those law enforcement officers who lost their lives serving their communities.  I commend Senator Campbell  for his leadership in this issue. This marks the eighth year running, I believe, that he and I have joined forces to introduce the resolution to commemorate National Peace Officers Memorial Day. As a former deputy sheriff, Senator Campbell has experienced first-hand the risks faced by law enforcement officers every day while they protect our communities. His knowledge in this area is a true asset to the U.S. people.  I also want to thank each of our Nation's brave law enforcement officers for their unwavering commitment to the safety and protection of their fellow citizens. They are real-life heroes, too many of whom too often give the ultimate sacrifice, and they remind us of how important it is to support and respect our State and local police.  Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who guard our communities do so at great risk. Each year, 1 in 15 officers is assaulted, 1 in 46 officers is injured,and 1 in 5,255 officers is killed in the line of duty in the United States every other day. After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 peace officers died while trying to ensure that their fellow citizens in those buildings got to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of this country.  In 2003, 146 enforcement officers died while serving in the line of duty, well below the decade-long average of 165 deaths annually, and a major drop from 2001 when a total of 237 officers were killed. A number of factors contributed to this reduction including better equipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved training, longer prison terms for violent offenders, and advanced emergency medical care. And, in total, more than 17,100 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.  During the 108th Congress, we have improved the Department of Justice's Public Safety Officers Benefits (PSOB) program by making law the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act (Public Law 108-182), which allows survivors of public safety officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or strokes while participating in nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activities to qualify for Federal survivor benefits. The Senate also passed the Campbell-Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act (S. 764), which will extend through FY 2007 the authorization of appropriations for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program that helps State, tribal and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law enforcement officers. The House has yet to act on this important measure that will continue our efforts to ensure that every police officer who needs a bulletproof vest gets one. This week, the Senate added to the gun liability bill by a vote of 91-8 the Campbell-Leahy Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (S. 253). This measure would establish national measures of uniformity and consistency to permit trained and certified on-duty, off-duty or retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms in most situations so that they may respond immediately to crimes across State and other jurisdictional lines, as well as to protect themselves and their families from vindictive criminals. The support for such bills that will keep our law enforcement officers is there, but we need to do more.  We Vermonters this National Peace Officers Memorial Day will remember our brave State Police Officer, SGT Michael Johnson, who was killed last Father's Day while trying to stop a suspect leading two other State troopers on a high-speed chase. Sergeant Johnson was not even on duty, but he went out nonetheless to help his fellow troopers that Sunday afternoon after hearing their trouble on his radio. He had just deployed a set of tire spikes across the interstate when the suspect swerved to avoid the spikes and struck him. Johnson left behind a beloved wife and three children, as well as hundreds of police officers who called him ``brother.'' Words seem insufficient to acclaim the brave sacrifice of the manwho was so admired by his family, community and the Vermont State Police force.  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the United States with the opportunity to honor the extraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by our police forces. More than 15,000 peace officers are expected to gather in Washington to join with the families of their fallen comrades who, by their last full measure of devotion to their responsibilities and the right and security of their fellow citizens, have rendered a dedicated service to our Nation. I look forward to passage of this important resolution, a fitting tribute for this special and solemn occasion.                                 ______                                    SENATE RESOLUTION 311--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOCIALIST  REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM TO IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASE FATHER              THADEUS NGUYEN VAN LY, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES
