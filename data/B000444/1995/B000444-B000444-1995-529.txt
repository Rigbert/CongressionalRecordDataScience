 President, the majority staff tells me that they are checking with Senator Hatch, who is just off the floor, occupied in another matter at the moment. Also, there is a need in order to get unanimous consent to amend the Senator's amendment. There are two other individuals I am told on the Republican side who are being asked to check off. If we are not able to get them prior to 6 o'clock, I will ask unanimous consent the vote be postponed for 5 minutes. I will not do that now. Hopefully we will find that out--to give us an opportunity to determine whether or not there will be agreement. I hope there will be no disagreement on the Senator's amendment because it makes crystal clear we are not intending to deal with small arms, we are not intending to deal with those folks who are the stated reason for concern on the part of those who are opposing this amendment.
