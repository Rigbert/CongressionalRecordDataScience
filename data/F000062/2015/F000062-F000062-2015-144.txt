 President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator Blunt, to introduce bipartisan legislation that would expand approved uses for the Elementary and Secondary Education Acts professional development funding to include training for teachers and school personnel on how to recognize signs of sexual abuse in students.  According to the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, 865,643 children were victims of maltreatment in 2013. Approximately 7 percent, or 60,956 children, were victims of sexual abuse.  The vast majority of States require that teachers report suspicions of child abuse, but most teachers do not receive any training on how to see the signs.  According to the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, 61 percent of all reports of child abuse and neglect are made by professionals, yet only 17.5 percent of abuse and neglect is reported by education personnel.  Given the amount of time teachers and school personnel spend with children, it is critical that the warning signs of child sexual abuse are identified and reported and that action is taken. Students must also be provided appropriate resources and support if they have been abused.  The Helping Schools Protect Our Children Act of 2015 expands the list of allowable uses for Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, Title II funding to permit States to use this funding to provide training for teachers, principals, Specialized Instructional Support Personnel and paraprofessionals on how to recognize the signs of sexual abuse and handle the situation if sexual abuse is identified. Under current law, Title II provides grants to states for a variety of purposes related to recruitment, retention, and professional development of K-12 teachers and principals. Our bill would simply allow professional development funds to be used to provide school personnel with this important training.  I am proud that Senator Roy Blunt has joined me as original cosponsor on this bill.  It is essential that as mandated reporters, school personnel have access to the proper training to recognize abuse. When no one steps in to stop abuse, children can be scarred for their entire lives. If we learn to recognize the signs of abuse or neglect, we will be better able to foster a safe environment for young people to learn and grow.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1369       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
