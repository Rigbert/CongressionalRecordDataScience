Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 253) expressing the sense of the Congress strongly objecting to any effort to expel the Holy See from the United Nations as a state participant by removing its status as a Permanent Observer.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 253       Whereas the Holy See is the governing authority of the      sovereign state of Vatican City;       Whereas the Holy See has an internationally recognized      legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as      the juridical equal of a state and to send and receive      diplomatic representatives;       Whereas the diplomatic history of the Holy See began over      1,600 years ago, during the 4th century A.D., and the Holy      See currently has formal diplomatic relations with 169      nations, including the United States, and maintains 179      permanent diplomatic missions abroad;       Whereas, although the Holy See was an active participant in      a wide range of United Nations activities since 1946 and was      eligible to become a member state of the United Nations, it      chose instead to become a nonmember state with Permanent      Observer status over 35 years ago, in 1964;       Whereas, unlike the governments of other geographically      small countries such as Monaco, Nauru, San Marino, and      Liechtenstein, the Holy See does not possess a vote in the      General Assembly of the United Nations;       Whereas, according to a July 1998 assessment by the United      States Department of State, ``[t]he United States values the      Holy See's significant contributions to international peace      and human rights'';       Whereas during the past year certain organizations that      oppose the views of the Holy See regarding the sanctity of      human life and the value of the family as the basic unit of      society have initiated an organized effort to pressure the      United Nations to remove the Permanent Observer status of the      Holy See; and       Whereas the removal of the Holy See's Permanent Observer      status would constitute an expulsion of the Holy See from the      United Nations as a state participant: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That the Congress--       (1) commends the Holy See for its strong commitment to      fundamental human rights,     including the protection of innocent human life both before      and after birth, during its 36 years as a Permanent Observer      at the United Nations;       (2) strongly objects to any effort to expel the Holy See      from the United Nations as a state participant by removing      its status as a nonmember state Permanent Observer;       (3) believes that any degradation of the status accorded to      the Holy See at the United Nations would seriously damage the      credibility of the United Nations by demonstrating that its      rules of participation are manipulable for ideological      reasons rather than being rooted in neutral principles and      objective facts of sovereignty; and       (4) expresses the concern that any such degradation of the      status accorded to the Holy See would seriously damage      relations between the United Nations and member states that      find in the Holy See a moral and ethical presence with which      they can work effectively in pursuing humanitarian approaches      to international problems.
