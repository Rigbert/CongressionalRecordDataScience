President, I am pleased today to join with Senator Portman to introduce the bipartisan Second Reauthorization Act. This bill builds on recent successes and takes important new steps to ensure that people coming out of prison have the opportunity to turn their lives around, rather than returning to a life of crime. That saves taxpayer money and makes us all safer.  This important legislation improves Federal reentry policy and authorizes assistance to collaborations between state and local corrections agencies, nonprofits, educational institutions, service providers, and families to ensure that offenders released into society have the resources and support they need to become contributing members of the community. The reauthorization bill builds on the success of the Second Chance Act by continuing, improving, and consolidating its programs.  Four years ago, I joined with then-Senators Biden, Specter, and Brownback as an original cosponsor of the Second Chance Act, and I was pleased to help move that legislation through the Senate. The Senate recognized the value of the Second Chance Act when, after a great deal of work and compromise, the bill passed unanimously. I hope this reauthorization bill receives the same bipartisan support.  In the past few decades, Congress and the states have passed new criminal laws creating more and longer sentences for more crimes. As a result, this country sends even more people to prison every year, costing millions and millions of dollars. There are currently over 2 million people in jail or prison, and more than 13 million people spend some time in jail or prison each year. Most of these people will at some point return to our communities.  Last July, I chaired a hearing on the Second Chance Act, and the Committee heard about the great strides many states are making with innovative prisoner reentry programs. Commissioner Andrew Pallito from the Vermont Department of Corrections testified and shared with us his experience with reentry programs in Vermont. The Vermont Department of Corrections and many others in Vermont have strongly supported the Second Chance Act, which gives me confidence that it represents an important step in making our country safer.  The Second Chance Act authorized grants for key reentry programs and required that these programs demonstrate measurable positive results, including a reduction in recidivism. Preliminary studies show that these programs are already working well.  The reauthorization bill that we propose today improves, consolidates and reauthorizes the state and local government grant programs created by the Second Chance Act. It is intended to ensure that funding is available for planning and implementation of key reentry projects so that evidence-based methodology is employed to ensure meaningful reductions in recidivism rates. It is designed to ensure that all states have the opportunity to develop and benefit from these important programs.  The bill also consolidates several programs that were underutilized into one grant program with multiple purposes. This will ensure that Federal dollars are effectively spent on programs that link probation with swift and certain enforcement, like the very successful HOPE program in Hawaii.  The Second Chance Act authorized research into educational methods used in prisons and jails. This reauthorization bill asks the Attorney General to review that research and establish best practices for prison education. It then reallocates the authorized funds previously used for research into a grant program to implement these best practices in prisons and jails. The bill also adds nonprofit organizations as eligible grant recipients for programs promoting family-based substance abuse treatment.  This legislation makes modest improvements to Federal reentry policy that have the added benefit of reducing Bureau of Prison costs. It continues the successful Elderly and Family Reunification for Certain Non Violent Offenders Pilot Program and modestly expands the pool of inmates eligible to apply for the program. More than 60 inmates have now participated in this program, and not a single one has reoffended.  The bill also creates an incentive for inmates to participate in rigorous recidivism reduction programming by awarding a credit of up 60 days per year toward completion of their sentence for participation in such programs. The incentive is modeled on that currently awarded for successful participation in residential drug abuse treatment programs.  Finally, the Second Chance Reauthorization Act promotes accountability by requiring periodic audits of grantees to ensure that Federal dollars are responsibly spent. Grantees with problematic audits will not be eligible for funding in future years.  As a former prosecutor, I believe strongly in securing tough and appropriate prison sentences for people who break our laws. But it is also important that we do everything we can to ensure that when these people get out of prison, they enter our communities as productive members of society, so we can start to reverse the dangerous cycle of recidivism and violence. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act will help break this cycle.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1231       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
