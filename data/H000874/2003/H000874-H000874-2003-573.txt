Speaker, last month, our region was subjected to nature's unbridled wrath. And, despite the advances in technology that gave us fair warning that a storm of this magnitude was approaching, there was little anyone could do to escape the destruction Isabel left in her wake. The five counties I represent all suffered enormous damage, families were displaced and without power for days, homes and businesses were demolished, and our natural resources were destroyed by the strength of the winds and rain that accompanied this vicious hurricane.  Our region responded quickly and directed the full force of its resources to assist residents and business owners with their recovery efforts. I am extremely grateful to our first responders, local and state officials, and disaster assistance teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), the Army Corps of Engineers, law enforcement officials and community volunteers who I saw throughout our communities when I visited parts of St. Mary's, Anne Arundel, and Calvert counties in the week following the storm.  On Thursday, September 25 I joined Senators Sarbanes and Mikulski, as well as my colleagues in the Maryland Congressional Delegation, to hear from representatives from several federal and State of Maryland agencies on relief efforts underway to help the citizens of Maryland and small businesses throughout the State. We were informed that the counties were completing their Preliminary Damage Assessments which would be submitted to MEMA and FEMA so that funds could be designated to assist with the clean-up and recovery.  Thus far, Maryland has qualified for federal assistance with debris removal and emergency protective services. If the damage in other areas meets the threshold for disasters, Maryland could become eligible for more categories of federal assistance, including repair of roads and bridges, water control facilities, buildings and equipment, utilities and parks.  Recovering from this storm will be a long process, and we all will face challenges along the way. I will continue to work with elected officials and residents throughout the 5th District of Maryland to provide any resources I can to help in this recovery process.                          ____________________
