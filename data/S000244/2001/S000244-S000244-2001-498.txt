Lunsford Richardson Preyer, who died of cancer on April 3 at the age of 82.  Born in Greensboro, North Carolina, Rich attended college at Princeton University and law school at Harvard. He served honorably in World War II, earning a Bronze Star from the Navy for his courage at Okinawa. It was this courage and his absolute respect for the law and for people that caught the eye of President John F. Kennedy, who named him to a U.S. District Court judgeship in 1961.  In 1968, Rich successfully ran for Congress, where he served until 1980. Although my time with him in the House was brief, I know that Rich served the people of North Carolina's 6th District with distinction. He lived during a tumultuous time in our nation's history when racial discrimination was widespread. African Americans were frequently subjected to legal, social and economic oppression. However, Rich emerged through all that by displaying a remarkable moral integrity, tolerance, and support for racial diversity and human rights.  As a member of Congress, Rich won the respect of both Republicans and Democrats for his dignity, intelligence, and integrity. He chaired the House Select Committee on Ethics, crafting the Congressional code of ethics. He also served on the House Select Committee on Assassinations, helping to investigate the deaths of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.  Two years after my election to Congress, Rich left the House. He and his wife Emily--who passed away in 1999--returned to Greensboro where they both continued to touch the lives of their many friends and neighbors in the community.  Our nation lost a caring and visionary legislator with the death of Rich, and it is fitting that we pay tribute to his life and legacy today. My wide Cheryl and I would like to express our condolences to Rich's surviving family in this time of sorrow and sadness, and they will be in our prayers.                          ____________________
