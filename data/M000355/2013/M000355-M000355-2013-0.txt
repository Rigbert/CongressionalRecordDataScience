  If these nomination were deferred, we could consider this timely and important legislation today.  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the pending cloture motions on executive nominations be withdrawn; that following disposition of the Defense bill, the Senate proceed to immediate consideration of H.R. 2668, a House-passed revenue measure; that the text of S. 1859 be the first amendment in order; and that the majority and minority sides then be recognized to offer amendments in an alternating fashion so these important issues could be considered this week.
