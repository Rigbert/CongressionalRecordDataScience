Madam Speaker, the time is always right to do what is right, and that time is now. The spirit of history is upon us. We must pass health care.  There are those who have told us to wait. They have told us to be patient. We cannot wait. We cannot be patient. The American people need health care, and they need it now.  Will we stand with the American people or will we stand with the big insurance companies? We have a moral obligation to make health care a right and not a privilege.  We cannot wait a moment longer. We must pass health care, and we must pass it now.                          ____________________
