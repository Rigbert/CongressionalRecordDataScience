Speaker, it is difficult being a ranking member on a committee where the bill that confronts us is a good bill. I said that in the Committee on Rules, I said that to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), I said it to others, and I will say it when we consider the bill. It is a good bill because as the Committee on Appropriations is required to do, if it is responsible, it gives the necessary resources to agencies to accomplish the objectives that the American people expect of them; and indeed, that this Congress expects of them.  In particular, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), the chairman of our subcommittee, for his tenaciousness in ensuring that agencies can effectively carry out their responsibilities. That is particularly the case as it relates to law enforcement and the fighting of the drug scourge on our borders and within our communities.  Mr. Speaker, this bill almost, I believe, is the best bill that this committee has reported out in the last 3 years. In part that was because we had sufficient resources to fund agencies. Not all they wanted, but sufficient.                              {time}  2030  Mr. Speaker, therefore, it is with a great deal of regret that I rise, because we have included in this bill a number of extraneous provisions. All of them, without fail, were argued in a bipartisan fashion. That is to say that there were some Republicans for them and some Democrats for them, some Republicans against them and some Democrats against them.  One provision, however, is, I believe, without exception opposed on our side of the aisle because it is, I believe correctly, perceived as a totally partisan, inappropriate attack on the FEC.  I have heard my good friend, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. McInnis) say that this was just like any other employee. He and I disagree on that proposition. In point of fact we have an individual, Lawrence Noble, a staff member, not a commissioner, who can take no action without having four votes, which means that he needs at least one Republican to authorize action of the Commission, because there are only three Democrats, and four votes are required.  Mr. Noble has taken some actions which have annoyed just about everybody on both sides of the aisle. In fact, more complaints have been made against Democrats, 38 percent, than Republicans, 32 percent. In fact, 80 percent of the Democrats have paid their fines, 51 percent of the Republicans have paid their fines. So in point of fact, it ought to be Democrats from that perspective who ought to be more annoyed at Mr. Noble, because he apparently has been tougher on us.  But in the performance of his duties, he concluded that actions were appropriate to be initiated against GOPAC and against the Christian Coalition for campaign actions which they had undertaken, just as he would take it against the Clinton campaign or the Bush campaign or other Republican and Democratic campaigns.  It is our belief, notwithstanding the fact we have been told we are in error on this, but it is our belief that this bill and the provision regarding Mr.Noble, which terminates Mr. Noble's tenure, because by this bill his tenure is terminated as of January 1, 1999, 90 days from today, I do not recall a bill firing a Federal employee before. Perhaps there has been, but I do not recall it. I do not recall it.  We would have hoped that during the consideration of this bill, that some compromise could have been reached. I brought to the attention of the conference that one of the Senators in the other body has indicated that he is going to filibuster this bill if this provision is in there, so the conference report probably cannot pass the other body.  Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote against this rule. I regret that, but I see no other way to indicate my opposition to this provision. I do not know what I am going to do on final passage, because the chairman has worked very hard, and I repeat again, this is a good bill. I would hope that my colleagues would join me, and that this provision would be taken out of this bill before, again, it is offered to us for passage.  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) is an exceptionally bright, very capable gentleman, but I would point out that he says that he cannot think of another Federal employee who has ended their tenure like that. There are 435 sitting on this floor. In 30 days, every Member in this House has to, by affirmative vote, prove to the constituents that he or she has done the kind of job performance that would allow them to continue. We do the same thing. We go out to our judges.  What we are saying here, the gentleman can pull out of the air the Christian association or some of these other examples. That is not this. We are saying here, hey, one party, by the way, with three votes could get this guy a job for the rest of his life, or some gal a job for the rest of their lives. We are saying, job performance. If they perform, they keep the job. That is what we have to say. Right now, there is no accountability, in my opinion, from the Federal Election Commission. We are asking for accountability.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe).
