Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) for his fine work on this resolution and for helping us when we got to the full committee, and also the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), as was mentioned, and the gentleman from New York (Mr. King), one of the cosponsors. We have worked as a team, and I think this is a very important resolution for House consideration today.  Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today condemns the brutal murder of Northern Ireland defense attorney Rosemary Nelson and calls for the British Government to launch an independent inquiry into Rosemary's killing.  The resolution also calls for judicial inquiry into the allegations of official collusion in the 1989 murder of defense attorney Patrick Finucane and an independent investigation into broader allegations of harassment of defense attorneys by Northern Ireland's police force, known as the Royal Ulster Constabulary or the RUC.  Rosemary Nelson was a champion of due process rights and a conscientious and courageous attorney in Northern Ireland. She was the wife of Paul Nelson and the mother of three young children: Sara, Gavin, and Christopher.  Her murder, Mr. Speaker, on March 15, 1999, was a cowardly act by those who are the enemies of peace and enemies of justice in Northern Ireland. Her death is a loss felt not just by her family and friends but by all who advocate fundamental human rights.  Consideration of this resolution today is particularly timely, as officials in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and the U.K. continue to question the ability of the RUC to properly conduct this murder investigation.  In fact, last week the European Parliament passed its own resolution, offered by Dublin's representative Bernie Malone, which calls for ``a fully independent team of investigators to conduct the inquiry as a means of securing confidence and objectivity.''  Anyone who knows anything about human rights in Northern Ireland would have little confidence that the RUC could produce a credible or a transparent or thorough investigation of the murder of a Catholic defense attorney. The history of intimidation of defense attorneys by the RUC has been documented by my subcommittee as well as by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.                              {time}  1600  Thus, Mr. Speaker, there is little reason to believe that Rosemary Nelson, who was mistreated by members of the RUC throughout her professional life as an attorney, would now be treated respectfully and justly in death.  I first met Rosemary Nelson in Belfast a few years ago when she shared with me her genuine concern for the administration of justice in the Northern Ireland. She explained how, as anattorney, she had been physically and verbally assaulted by RUC members and how they sent death threats to her through her clients. Many of her clients were harassed as well.  Notwithstanding these threats, Rosemary still carried an exhaustive docket which included several high-profile political cases, such as representing the family of Robert Hamill, who was beaten to death by a sectarian mob and representing the residents of Garvaghy Road in their bid to stop controversial marches through the neighborhood. Through her work, she became an international advocate for the rule of law and the right of the accused to a comprehensive defense and an impartial hearing of their case.  For this, however, Rosemary was often the subject of harassment and intimidation. For her service to her clients, Rosemary Nelson paid the ultimate price with her life, the victim of a car bomb.  Mr. Speaker, in September of last year, just 7 months ago, Rosemary testified before my subcommittee. She told us how she feared, she feared the RUC. She reported that she had been, quote, and I quote from her testimony, ``physically assaulted by a number of RUC officers'' and that the harassment included ``threats against my personal safety, including death threats.'' She said she had no confidence in receiving help from her government, because in the end her complaints about the RUC would be investigated by the RUC.  Testifying along with Rosemary Nelson was a man by the name of Mr. Cumaraswamy, a U.N. Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, who led an extensive human rights investigative team to the UK and published a report in 1998. Mr. Cumaraswamy stated that he found evidence, and I quote him, of ``consistent and systematic,'' close quote, RUC harassment and intimidation of defense lawyers in Northern Ireland. His report was quite critical of the excessive authority granted to the RUC by the so-called ``emergency laws,'' and he expressed dismay that the government had not moved decisively to protect lawyers that were under threat.  Mr. Cumaraswamy recommended a judicial inquiry into the threats and the intimidation of Rosemary Nelson and other defense attorneys. Last week at the UN Commission on Human Rights at their annual summit in Geneva, Mr. Cumaraswamy reported that in the years since the release of his report about the great dangers facing Northern Ireland's defense attorneys that the RUC had shown, and these are his words, ``complete indifference.'' He accused the RUC chief, Constable Ronnie Flanagan, and I quote him again, of ``allowing the situation to deteriorate,'' and like the rest of us, the Special Rapporteur says he has, and these are his words again, ``a nagging feeling that the RUC involvement in what is now a murder investigation could affect and taint the impartiality and the credibility of that investigation.''  And yet, our friends in the Blair government seem unmoved.  Despite Rosemary Nelson's testimony, her concerns and the concerns now raised by human rights experts around the world, the British Government has forfeited the investigation of Rosemary Nelson's murder to the very agency she feared and mistrusted the most. It does not seem to phase them that a report just released by Northern Ireland's police watchdog, the government's Independent Commission for Police Complaints, the ICPC, said that RUC investigators investigating the death threats against Rosemary Nelson were themselves evasive and disinterested. It also found an ill-disguised hostility to Mrs. Nelson on the part of some police officers.  Astonishingly, even the police from the bereaved family, even the pleas from the father himself, the husband and father of the three children, Paul Nelson; he went to Geneva just the other day, and his quote:  ``If the ICPC had no confidence in the ability of the RUC to investigate the death threats against Rosemary, how can my family,'' he says, ``be expected to have confidence in their ability, indeed their willingness, to effectively investigate her murder?''  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, the resolution before us today, truly captures Mr. Nelson's sense of despair and reflects the growing international consensus that the British Government needs to act decisively and remove any and all doubts about the investigation into Rosemary Nelson's murder. RUC Ronnie Flanagan has rejected the call for an RUC-free investigation and has instead been spinning his wheels trying to create the image of impartiality and external influence on his investigation.  It does not cut, nobody is buying it, and we need now an RUC-free investigation.  Let me just conclude, Mr. Speaker, by noting that the major international human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, British/Irish Human Rights Watch, the Committee for the Administration of Justice, Human Rights Watch and the Geneva-based Commission of Jurists all support the call for an independent inquiry. That is what we tried to do in this resolution. The time is long past for this to happen, and I hope we get the full support of this body in support of this resolution.  The resolution before us today condemns the brutal murder of Northern Ireland defense attorney Rosemary Nelson and calls on the British Government to launch an independent inquiry into Rosemary's killing.  The resolution also calls for a judicial inquiry into allegations of official collusion in the 1989 murder of defense attorney Patrick Finucane and an independent investigation into broader allegations of harassment of defense attorneys by Northern Ireland's police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).  Rosemary Nelson was a champion of due process rights and a conscientious and courageous attorney in Northern Ireland. She was the wife of Paul Nelson and the mother of three young children: Sarah (8), Gavin (11), and Christopher (13). Her murder on March 15, 1999, was a cowardly act by those who are the enemies of peace and justice in Northern Ireland. Her death is a loss felt not just by her family and friends, but by all who advocate fundamental human rights.  Consideration of this resolution today is particularly timely as officials in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom continue to question the ability of the RUC to properly conduct this murder investigation. In fact, last week, the European Parliament passed its own resolution--offered by Dublin's representative, Bernie Malone (MEP)--which calls for ``a fully independent team of investigators'' to conduct the inquiry as a means of securing confidence and objectivity.  Anyone who knows anything about human rights in Northern Ireland would have little confidence that the RUC could produce a credible, transparent, thorough investigation of the murder of a Catholic defense attorney.

Testifying along with Rosemary Nelson was Mr. Param Cumaraswamy, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, who led an extensive human rights investigative mission to the United Kingdom and published a report in 1998. Mr.Cumaraswamy stated that he found evidence of ``consistent and systematic'' RUC harassment and intimidation of defense lawyers in Northern Ireland. His report was quite critical of the excessive authority granted to the RUC through the so-called ``emergency laws'' and he expressed dismay that the government had not moved decisively to protect lawyers under threat.  Mr. Cumaraswamy recommended a judicial inquiry into the threats and intimidation Rosemary Nelson and other defense attorneys had received. He endorsed the establishment of a police ombudsman and he called on the British government to provide protection for defense attorneys who had been harassed. Today, it is hard not to wonder: if only the British Government had taken the Special Rapporteur's recommendations more seriously, Rosemary Nelson might have been better protected and still with us today.  But last week, at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights annual summit in Geneva, Mr. Cumaraswamy reported that in the year since the release of the UN report about the grave dangers facing Northern Ireland's defense attorneys, the RUC has shown ``complete indifference.'' He accused RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan of ``allowing the situation to deteriorate.'' And like the rest of us, The Special Rapporteur says he has a ``nagging feeling'' that RUC involvement in what is now a murder investigation ``could affect and taint the impartiality and credibility of the investigation.''  And yet, the our friends in the Blair government seem unmoved.  Despite Rosemary Nelson's testimony, her concerns, and the concerns now raised by human rights experts the world over, the British government has forfeited the investigation of Rosemary Nelson' murder to the very agency she feared and mistrusted most, the RUC. It doesn't seem to faze them that a report just released by Northern Ireland's police watchdog, the government's Independent Commission for Police Complaints (ICPC), said that RUC officers investigating the death threats against Rosemary Nelson were themselves ``evasive and disinterested.'' It also found an ``ill-disguised hostility to Mrs. Nelson on the part of some police officers.''  Astonishingly, even the pleas of the bereaved family have fallen on deaf ears at Stormont Castle. As a result, Rosemary Nelson's husband, Paul, went to Geneva last week to gain outside help in his push for an independent investigation into the murder of his wife. He has said very simply, ``if the ICPC had no confidence in the ability of the RUC to investigate the death threats against Rosemary, how can my family be expected to have confidence in their ability--indeed their willingness to effectively investigate her murder?''  The bill before us today captures Mr. Nelson's sense of despair and reflects the growing international consensus that the British Government needs to act decisively to remove any and all doubts about the investigation into Rosemary Nelson's murder. RUC Chief Ronnie Flanagan has rejected the call for an RUC-free investigation and has instead been spinning his wheels trying to create an image of impartiality and external influence in his investigation.  But, it's all an illusion.  While the Chief Constable's diversionary tactics have flattered some--even one or two in our own FBI--the people in the affected community have not been fooled. This week, both the Irish News and the Irish Times reported that despite Mr. Flanagan's posturing about external influences on the investigation, community witnesses ``have been reluctant to talk to the police.''  And who can blame them?  Local residents remain skeptical of the RUC's window dressing and have no confidence in an investigation that has already swapped one non-RUC lead investigator for another.  They don't buy an investigation that advertises itself as a 50-member ``outside'' investigate force even though 40 members of the team are RUC and only 10 are not.  They have low expectations and little trust in an ``investigative team'' that tells people its working hard on the crime but can't get the date of the murder right and issues a telephone hotline number that's already been disconnected or never put in service.  The camouflage on Mr. Flanagan's so-called independent, outside inquiry has already worn thin. Because of the documented, open hostility that RUC officers displayed towards Rosemary Nelson, the RUC simply does not have the credibility to answer the burdensome questions: Who killed Rosemary Nelson? Who ordered her murder? And did the RUC officers who threatened her life in the past either instigate, condone, or cover-up her killing?  In order for this investigation to be beyond reproach, and to have the confidence and cooperation of the Catholic community that Rosemary Nelson adeptly represented, it must be organized, managed, directed and run by someone other than the RUC. Anything short of that may have surface appeal, but it still leaves too much of the grueling investigation under the charge of an organization of which the murder victim herself was extremely suspect, and to whom the local people are afraid to talk.  The major international human rights groups, including Amnesty International, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, British/Irish Human Rights Watch, the Committee for the Administration of Justice, Human Rights Watch and the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurist support the call for an independent inquiry.  Mr. Speaker, one of the major tenets of the 1998 ``Good Friday Agreement'' is its promise of an acceptable police force that will secure due process rights--rather than thwart them--for members of both communities in Northern Ireland. The success of the peace process is predicated on the government's ability to deliver on a police force that will protect fundamental human rights and to demonstrate to the people of Northern Ireland that injustices such as harassment of defense attorneys and the murders of Patrick Finucane and Rosemary Nelson will be investigated by top-notch, dedicated and impartial personnel.  For these reasons, I urge final passage of this bill.
