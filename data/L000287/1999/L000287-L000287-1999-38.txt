Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding me this time.  Three weeks ago, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia agreed to comply with NATO's demands to withdraw its forces from Kosovo, ending more than 80 days of hostility.  In bringing this conflict to a close, the United States and NATO brought an end to a Yugoslavian campaign of ethnic cleansing, rape and murder. It ended the flood of refugees fleeing Kosovo and gave hope to hundreds of thousands of men, women and children that they would soon be able to return to their homes.  More than 2 weeks ago, the Senate passed a resolution commending all those involved in our Nation's successful efforts in Kosovo. We had hoped that the leadership in the House would bring forth a similar bipartisan resolution commending our troops and congratulating President Clinton and other administration officials for their leadership.  To date, they have refused to bring up such a resolution. For goodness sake, is the dislike so intense, the hatred so great of President Clinton that the Republican majority cannot bring themselves to commend our troops and congratulate the President for his leadership? Listening to some of my colleagues on the floor this afternoon, I can only conclude that this is the case. These troops under the leadership of the President of the United States and the NATO officials stopped a modern day Holocaust from taking place in eastern Europe.  Mr. Speaker, we should overlook partisanship today and vote for the motion to instruct.
