President, as a President pro tempore emeritus, I would like to recognize the retirement of the Senate's current President pro tempore, Senator Orrin Hatch. Senator Hatch and I have both had the privilege of representing our constituents for more than four decades. He has fought for the interests of Utah and his constituents throughout his career.  Senator Hatch has shown a commitment to his beliefs. As both a chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee during my tenures in both posts, we have had more than one occasion to partner, to spar, and to share a laugh. Once we even exchanged ties. I gave him a Jerry Garcia one, and he gave me a Rush Limbaugh tie.  He will be remembered here in the Senate as a respected colleague.  I wish Senator Hatch, his wife, Elaine, their six children, and all his family the best.                          ____________________
