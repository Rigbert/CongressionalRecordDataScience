 President, I have no problems with this amendment. It ensures that tribal communities are represented.  The bill's task force is a new and independent entity designed to provide recommendations about immigration and border security. Mr. Tester is adding four additional members to the task force to ensure that the tribes are represented; however, this amendment does not fundamentally change the bill.  There is no opposition to making sure that the tribes have a voice in policy. Of course, this task force doesn't have any real power, it only makes recommendations. The Secretary isn't required to address their concerns or enact their recommendations. Too often, the Secretary does not take into consideration our recommendations. Even now she has a hard time implementing laws.  So, again, while the amendment is noncontroversial, Members should know this task force is a figleaf for actual border security.
