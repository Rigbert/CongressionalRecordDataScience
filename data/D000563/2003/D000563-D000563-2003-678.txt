President, I agree with everything the Senator from Wyoming said. This amendment agrees with everything the Senator from Wyoming said. There is no doubt about the fact that the United States should not carry this burden alone. The House was right to establish a standard that the United States would be contributing as long as other nations contributed as well. That is exactly what this amendment says.  I think we have passed the point of questioning whether the global fund is an important investment in fighting global AIDS. In fact, we were instrumental as a nation in setting up the global fund. Now I think we have to work with other countries around the world to ensure its success.  The global fund is operating now in 92 countries in the first two rounds. The grants are intended to respond to locally defined needs, and it has really shown successful pilot programs. But the fund is in a dire situation at this moment.  Those who have joined our global AIDS caucus know that when we met last week with Dr. Feecham, who heads up the fund, they are running out of money to deal with the global AIDS epidemic.  I am saying let's put $500 million into the global fund from the United States but no more money unless it is matched 2 to 1 from other sources than the United States. I am completely in agreement with the Senator from Wyoming. This should not be the United States alone. I ask you to merely stand by the position of the Senate which we voted for on a bipartisan basis last year.  I yield to the minority leader, Senator Daschle.
