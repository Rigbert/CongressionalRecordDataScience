President, I ask that the Chair now lay before the Senate the House message to accompany H.R. 1047, the miscellaneous tariffs bill.  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate a message from the House of Representatives disagreeing to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1047) entitled ``An Act to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to modify temporarily certain rates of duty, to make other technical amendments to the trade laws, and for other purposes'', and ask a conference with the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.
