 President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend Lowell Guthrie for his commitment to higher education, and his generosity to the students at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  I have had the privilege of knowing Lowell for many years and have witnessed his compassion for others on numerous occasions. Lowell has a kind heart and a giving spirit, and he constantly thinks of ways to improve the quality of life for others. Lowell hasbuilt a successful business in Bowling Green and is an active member of the Bowling Green community. He is a leader in education, providing opportunities for his employees and for others whom he does not know by funding scholarships to Western Kentucky University. He has consistently been a contributor to WKU and has now stepped up as a leader in Western's Investing in the Spirit capital campaign with a $1.8 million gift to provide student scholarships and to construct a clock and bell tower on the WKU campus.  The clock and bell tower will stand in ``The Guthrie Plaza'' in memory of Lowell's brother, Sgt. 1st Class Robert Guthrie, an American soldier who died in the Korean War, and it will honor all those associated with WKU who have lost their lives in service to their country. The courtyard area of The Guthrie Plaza will be constructed in honor of Lowell's wife, Judith Carolyn Guthrie.  The tower and courtyard will enhance the appearance of WKU's campus but more importantly it will serve as a reminder to thousands of students and alumni of those who sacrificed their lives so that we may have freedom. Lowell's generosity and his commitment to education will ensure that hundreds of students from all backgrounds will receive a quality education and the opportunity to succeed in whatever field of study they choose.  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I offer heartfelt thanks to Lowell and to the entire Guthrie family for their continuing commitment to Western Kentucky University, their community and to the education of America's youth.                          ____________________
