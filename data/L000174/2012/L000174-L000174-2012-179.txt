That is nonsense. We all know the Speaker of the House could waive the technicality, called a blue slip and allow the House to have an up-or-down vote on the bipartisan Senate bill at any time. He could do it this afternoon.  I have been consistently calling for House action on this legislation since we passed it overwhelmingly 3 months ago. In fact, last month Senator Murkowski and I wrote a bipartisan letter to Speaker Boehner. We asked him to allow an up-or-down vote. Last Thursday five House Republicans followed suit. They called on Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Cantor to take up the Senate-passed bill and resolve the blue slip problem.  The Speaker's hands are not tied in this matter. He has to stop choosing to hold up the bill and instead choose to let these efforts to pass the bill go forward. A New York Times editorial earlier this week entitled ``Delay on Domestic Violence'' put it well:       Mr. Boehner's leadership could break the logjam--but that,      of course, would also require his Republican colleagues to      drop their . . . opposition to stronger protections for all      victims of abuse.  I ask unanimous consent that both letters and the editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, July 23, 2012]                       Delay on Domestic Violence       With Congress just days away from its August break, House      Republicans have to decide which is more important:      protecting victims of domestic violence or advancing the      harsh antigay and anti-immigrant sentiments of some on their      party's far right. At the moment, harshness is winning.       At issue is reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act,      the landmark 1994 law central to the nation's efforts against      domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.       In May, 15 Senate Republicans joined with the chamber's      Democratic majority to approve a strong reauthorization bill.      Instead of embracing the Senate's good work, House      Republicans passed their own regressive version, ignoring      President Obama's veto threat. The bill did not include new      protections for gay, immigrant, American Indian and student      victims contained in the Senate measure. It also rolled back      protections for immigrant women, including for undocumented      immigrants who report abuse and cooperate with law      enforcement.       Negotiations on a final bill are in limbo. Complicating      matters, there is a procedural glitch. The Senate bill      imposes a fee to pay for special visas that go to immigrant      victims of domestic abuse. This runs afoul of the rule that      revenue-raising measures must begin in the House. Mr.      Boehner's leadership could break the logjam--but that, of      course, would also require his Republican colleagues to drop      their narrow-minded opposition to stronger protections for      all victims of abuse.       Unless something changes, Republicans will bear      responsibility for blocking renewal of a popular, lifesaving      initiative. This seems an odd way to cultivate moderate      voters, especially women, going into the fall campaign.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2012.     Hon. John Boehner,     Speaker of the House of Representatives,     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Speaker: Saving the lives of victims of domestic      violence should be above politics. Yet politics seem to have      gotten in the way of House passage of the bipartisan Senate      Violence Against Women (VAWA) Reauthorization Act, a bill to      strengthen law enforcement's response to domestic violence      that cleared the Senate on April 26th with a strong      bipartisan vote. In the time since the Senate passed its      bill, over 1.5 million Americans have become victims of rape,      physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner. We      cannot afford to let another day go by. We urge you to      swiftly allow for an up-or-down vote in the House on the      Senate's bipartisan VAWA Reauthorization Act.       Since being enacted in 1994, VAWA has developed a long      track record of protecting women and reducing the incidence      of domestic violence by providing critical support to law      enforcement and services for victims. Each previous      reauthorization substantially improved the way VAWA addressed      the changing needs of domestic violence victims by addressing      challenges facing older victims, victims with disabilities,      and other underserved groups. The Senate's bipartisan VAWA      Reauthorization Act continues this tradition by placing      greater emphasis on training for law enforcement and forensic      response to sexual assault, and by strengthening protections      for all victims regardless of where they live, their race,      religion, gender, or sexual orientation. These changes were      included at the recommendation of professionals from all over      the country who work with victims every day.       We should not let politics pick and choose which victims of      abuse to help and which to ignore. However, this fundamental      principle is not reflected in the House version of VAWA      reauthorization legislation, which disregarded the input from      professionals and would eliminate Senate language that      ensures universal protection for LGBT victims who currently      face obstacles to accessing VAWA's life-saving services, make      it more difficult for local law enforcement to help immigrant      victims of domestic violence, and fails to match the Senate's      effort to address the epidemic of domestic violence on tribal      lands.       Although significant progress has been made, domestic      violence and sexual assault remain serious challenges. Every      day, abusive partners kill three women, and for every victim      killed there are nine more who narrowly escape. It would be      unacceptable to step away from our commitment to stopping      violence and abuse, and from seeking justice for victims, by      undermining VAWA's protections.       The delay of the VAWA Reauthorization Act has real      consequences for these and future victims, and should not be      allowed to continue. VAWA was enacted and reauthorized with      broad bipartisan support, and this year's reauthorization is      endorsed by over 500 state and local organizations, and 47      attorneys general. We are concerned that unnecessary      political and procedural posturing is breaking the bipartisan      consensus on an issue that should rise above such      considerations, and is creating an unconscionable delay that      further threatens victims of violence. We urge you to honor      VAWA's bipartisan history and affirm the House's commitment      to combating domestic violence by having an up or down vote      on the Senate's VAWA Reauthorization Act.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,                                                     U.S. Senator.                                                   Lisa Murkowski,     U.S. Senator.                                  ____                                                U.S. Congress,                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 2012.     Hon. John Boehner,     Office of the Speaker, The Capitol,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Eric Cantor,     Office of the Majority Leader, The Capitol,     Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Cantor: As strong      supporters of a bipartisan approach to the Violence Against      Women Act (VAWA) reauthorization, we thank you for your      efforts to secure timely House consideration of this issue.      We strongly urge you to work diligently with the Senate to      solve the blue slip problem as effectively as you did with      the Transportation Bill and quickly craft a bicameral      compromise on VAWA reauthorization that includes the      following provisions:       1. Concurrent jurisdiction for tribal crimes--Because of      the significant backlog of crimes occurring on tribal lands,      federal courts have limited resources to pursue all but the      most serious violations. As a result, most sexual assaults      and domestic incidents that occur on native lands go      unpunished. Allowing our tribal court systems to prosecute      these crimes would help to ensure that justice is served and      prevent the spread of domestic violence in native      communities.       2. Protections for LGBT populations--Under current law, all      victims of domestic violence are entitled to VAWA services.      However, in some communities, services remain unavailable to      LGBT individuals simply because of their sexual orientation      or gender identity. LGBT-inclusive language would simply      clarify the law to ensure that all domestic violence victims      have access to the support offered by VAWA.       3. Eliminate disincentives for reporting crime among      immigrants--The House proposal provides temporary shelter for      victims who report domestic crimes, but it maintains the      long-term threat of deportation for immigrant victims who      come forward. No one should be discouraged from bringing an      abuser to the attention of law enforcement. While the      Department of Justice confirms that the U-Visa program is not      subject to significant fraud, we stand ready to work with      concerned Members on improving accountability within the      system to ensure that Congress can monitor its effectiveness.       4. Improve safety on college campuses--The Senate requires      more transparency of information, more prevention programs,      and improved assistance for victims of domestic violence,      dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking on college      campuses. The House proposal supports a Campus Safety      Resource Center that would be able to support colleges and      universities with best practices and guidance to address      violence on campus better. Both of these provisions are      critical improvements to protect students on campus.       We urge you to make VAWA reauthorization a significant      priority during the rest of     the 112th Congress and ensure that the aforementioned      provisions are included in the final reauthorization bill.           Sincerely,     Judy Biggert,     Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,     Robert J. Dold,     Todd R. Platts,     David Rivera.
