President, I rise today to introduce the Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000, which would enable law enforcement agencies nationwide to more easily trace handguns used in crime, and provide background checks and registration by law enforcement of all primary and secondary transfers of handguns, including retail sales, Internet sales, gun shows, and all other private transfers. This legislation is supported by Handgun Control, Inc., the Violence Policy Center, the NAACP, and Physicians for Social Responsibility.  Many Americans are unaware that there is a successful federal weapons registration system already in place under the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA). The NFA requires registration of all machine guns, short-barrel shotguns and short-barrel rifles, silencers, bombs, grenades, and other specialized weapons. The NFA is successfully and efficiently administered by the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).  The Handgun Safety and Registration Act would require the registration of all handguns under the NFA within one year of enactment. I know some of my colleagues may question why this bill is needed. First, the bill would help law enforcement more effectively trace handguns used in crime by making registration data available on-line to state and local law enforcement agencies. Tracing methods used today are extremely cumbersome and favor the criminal over the police. When a gun used to commit a crime is recovered, a state or local law enforcement agency contacts ATF with the name of the manufacturer and the serial number of the handgun--if it has not been removed by the criminal. ATF in turncontacts the manufacturer, which provides the name of the wholesale or retail dealer to whom the handgun was sold. ATF then contacts the dealer to obtain the name of the individual or another retail dealer who purchased the handgun.  All too often, this is where the trail goes cold, and another gun crime may go unsolved. If the individual handgun owner has sold the gun to another person in a private sale, there is no way for law enforcement to follow the path of the handgun without time-consuming detective work and a good deal of luck. Subsequent private transfers or gun show sales are similarly unrecorded, making law enforcement's job even more difficult. Even before the first retail sale, law enforcement is completely dependent upon the record keeping of gun manufacturers and gun dealers to follow the trail of a handgun from manufacture to criminal use. There is no law enforcement database of handgun production or sales in the United States. The Handgun Safety and Registration Act would give the advantage back to the police by making handgun registration data available to law enforcement in an easily accessible format.  Mr. President, in addition to improving law enforcement's tracing capabilities, the Handgun Safety and Registration Act would help prevent handguns from ending up in the possession of people who are likely to commit gun crimes. The bill would require registration of all handguns, including those currently in private possession, and would make it a felony for any person to transfer a handgun to another individual without prior law enforcement approval. As it currently does for all NFA weapons, ATF would conduct a background check on the transferee through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), the Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS), and the National Law Enforcement Tracking System (NLETS). This would provide a clear incentive for all handgun owners and dealers to exercise great caution when they choose to sell or otherwise transfer a handgun to another person.  It is my hope that by requiring registration of all handguns under the National Firearms Act, we can give law enforcement officials the tools to conduct faster and more reliable tracing of handguns used in crime, and prevent handguns from falling into criminal hands in the first place. The Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000 would accomplish these goals without restricting in any way the possession or sale of hunting rifles or shotguns used by law-abiding sportsmen across the country.  I encourage my Senate colleagues to support this important legislation as we seek effective ways to help law enforcement reduce gun violence in America.                                 ______                                       By
