President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will convene at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow and will immediately have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1, the education reform bill. Following that vote, it is expected that the 30 hours of postcloture debate will begin. However, it is hoped that time will be yielded so the Senate can begin full consideration of the bill as early as tomorrow afternoon. Numerous amendments are expected to be offered to this important legislation, and therefore Senators may expect votes throughout the week.                          ____________________
