 President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his kind remarks.  We are only 9 months into fiscal year 2009, and for the first time in American history the Federal deficit has reached and exceeded $1 trillion. This is not one of those firsts for our great Nation that calls for celebration, and there will not be any celebration.  Unfortunately, the bad fiscal news is not yet over for the year. We are still on track for a year-end deficit of over $1.8 trillion for fiscal year 2009. That is not according to this Senator, that is according to our official scorer, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan organization.  This 2009 deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product will be a staggering 13 percent, the highest rate since the end of World War II. I have a chart that shows this, a chart that puts the deficit in context.  Here is also a chart that puts the debt into context. I want to remind the Senate that I agree with President Obama that he did, in fact, inherit part of these deficits and debt. What is not often pointed out is this: The deficits and debt were bequeathed back then on a bipartisan basis because the Democrats controlled the last Congress. Starting in the year 2007 that Congress wrote the budget, it wrote the spending bills; that democratically controlled Congress wrote the financial bailout bill. A Republican President, George W. Bush, signed those spending bills. President Bush signed the financial bailout bill. The chart shows the bipartisan deficit President Obama inherited--and that would be the gray part of the deficit chart--and the chart shows the bipartisan debt President Obama inherited. That would be on the chart as well.  Today we have seen more revisionist fiscal history from many of my friends on the other side. It boils down to two very basic propositions. The first proposition is, all good economic policy and beneficial fiscal effects are due to the partisan tax hike of 1993. The second proposition is that all bad economic policy and detrimental fiscal effects of this decade are due to the bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003.  How convenient for my friends on the other side of the aisle. If we take this fiscal revisionism to its logical extreme, the answer of some on the other side might be to tax every dollar of income earned by the American taxpayer. There seems to be an attitude that any policy that allows Americans to keep more of their own money is just automatically bad, while any policy which takes more of their money and spends it is automatically good.  I think it is fairly clear the fiscal revisionists on the other side do not have a problem with huge deficits; rather, they are threatened by the prospects of Americans deciding what they want to do with their very own money.  In fact, the deficit effects of the stimulus bill passed within a short time after Democrats assumed full control of the Federal Government exceeded the deficit impact of the 8 years of the bipartisan tax relief. Again, this is comparing the tax relief with the stimulus as you see in the chart.  Since the stimulus package spilled a lot of red ink, let's take a look at how the economy has done. Unemployment currently stands at 9.5 percent, the highest rate in the last 26 years. The economy has shed 6.4 million jobs since this recession began, and that also includes, though, 2.6 million jobs lost since President Obama took office.  Even with the passage of the massive $787 billion stimulus bill in February, the promise of jobs, jobs, jobs that went with that $787 billion stimulus bill, there is still no end in sight to the rise of unemployment and job losses.  The President himself recently said:       My expectation is that we will probably continue to see      unemployment kick up for several months.  While the short-term news is bad, I have bad news for you. The long-term news is much worse. If the Obama budget is adopted, by 2019 we will have added over $9 trillion to the national debt held by the public, and our debt as a percentage of the economy will grow in excess of 80 percent, in excess of 80 percent, a level also that has not been seen since this country was in World War II.  Let me say, the 50-year average of that national debt, according to the economy, has been about 40 percent. So we are talking about more than doubling what it has been over the last 50 years.  The huge spike in spending that we have seen over the course of the past 9 months has been advertised as temporary. But even so, the deficit as a percentage of GDP in 2019 is projected to be 5.5 percent, a level that everybody, including the President, agrees is unsustainable. You can see that on our charts as well.  Looking beyond the 10-year window paints an even bleaker picture. I have a chart from the Congressional Budget Office that projects a terrifying rise in debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP over the next 40 years. As we can see from the dotted line, the highest level of debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, 107 percent, occurred in 1945 as a result and at the end of World War II. In either of the two scenarios outlined in the Congressional Budget Office's long-term budget outlook, shown by the red and green lines on the chart respectively, we are on a course to break this record sometime in the next 15 to 35 years and reach ratios of debt to GDP of up to 128 percent or, at the extreme, 321 percent by 2050.  The Congressional Budget Office's own words are these:       The systemic widening of budget shortfalls projected under      CBO's long-term scenarios has never been observed in U.S.      history.  Some may ask: Why is this a big deal? What does debt held by the public have to do with my everyday life? The Congressional Budget Office makes three points answering this question. This is the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group of experts whose sole job is to project, at least 10 years ahead of time, what the situation is with every spending bill and the impact of the deficit. This is what they say: If the ratio of debt to GDP continues to rise, lenders may become concerned about the financial solvency of the government and demand higher interest rates to pay for the increasing riskiness of holding government debt. No. 2, if the debt-to-GDP ratio keeps increasing and the budget outlook is not improved, both foreign and domestic lenders may not provide enough funds for the government to meet its obligations. And No. 3, if the first two points happen, no matter whether the government resolves the fiscal crisis by printing money, raising taxes, cutting spending or going into default, it is certain that economic growth will be seriously disrupted.  Whenever economic growth is seriously disrupted, job growth is seriously disrupted as well. Clearly, a debt-to-GDP ratio approaching 100 percent would have a disastrous impact on everybody's everyday life.  So where do we go from here? Clearly, we are well on our way to fiscal catastrophe unless we change course. What is the best way to break out ofthis recession, to start creating jobs, to reverse the mountainous growth of deficit and debt and get the economy moving again? That is a very important and long question. Let me see if I can answer. In general, Democrats and Republicans seem to have opposing viewpoints when it comes to the solution to this problem, with Republicans favoring lower taxes and lower spending, while Democrats favor higher taxes and higher spending. However, both Republicans and Democrats agree that health care reform is a crucial ingredient to solving the long-term budget crisis.  Both Republicans and Democrats agree health care reform needs to be paid for as well. The Congressional Budget Office is also on the same page, asserting that, in their words:       In the absence of significant changes in policy, rising      costs for health care will cause federal spending to grow      much faster than the economy, putting the federal budget on a      nonsustainable path.  Over the past few months, the rising cost of health care has been characterized by a few creative illustrations. First, we have heard the chairman of the Budget Committee refer to the rising cost of health care as ``an 800-pound gorilla.'' Second, we have heard the President describe the rising cost of health care as ``a ticking timebomb.''  Today I wish to add a third illustration. The rising cost of health care is a massive, fire-breathing debt and deficit dragon. In the King Arthur legend, the greatest knight among the Knights of the Round Table was Sir Lancelot. Sir Lancelot was also a dragon slayer. In order for Sir Lancelot to strike down the dragon, he had to be equipped with suitable weapons. The same is true today with the rising cost of health care. As Congress contemplates ways to cut down on the massive, fire-breathing debt and deficit dragon, it must wield the proper weapons.  As you can see here, we have the debt and deficit dragon.  A few weeks ago, House Democrats proposed a graduated surtax of up to 5.4 percent on taxpayers making over $280,000 to partially offset their health care reform bill. This small business surtax would push the top marginal tax rates up to between 43 percent and 46.4 percent, a rate that would jump to over 50 percent in 39 States with Medicare and State and local taxes added in. This is according to the Tax Foundation. So is this small business surtax the proper weapon to strike down the debt and deficit dragon? I have a chart that shows not Sir Lancelot but Sur Taxalot on his way to slay the debt and deficit dragon with his mighty surtax. This is Sur Taxalot, as we can see. The surtax is a large, heavy, painful weapon and lethal to America's job engine, the goose that lays the golden egg, small business America.  Take a good look at Sur Taxalot.  However, it is not effective against the debt and deficit dragon because it does nothing to slow the dragon's exponential growth. The cost of health care that the dragon feasts upon will continue to increase much faster than the revenues that Sur Taxalot can collect with his surtax.  CBO Director Doug Elmendorf testified in front of the Budget Committee 2 weeks ago. Dr. Elmendorf stated: None of the legislative changes looked at by CBO so far, including the House Democrats' small business surtax, ``represent the sort of fundamental change of the order of magnitude that would be necessary to offset the direct increase in federal health costs from the insurance coverage proposals.''  Clearly, unlike Sir Lancelot, Sur Taxalot is no dragon slayer.  Now let's look at how House Democrats' small business surtax works. In 2011 and 2012, singles making between $280,000 and $400,000 and families making between $350,000 and $500,000 will pay an extra 1-percent surtax. Singles making between $400,000 and $800,000 and families making between $500,000 and $1 million will pay an extra 1.5 percent. Finally, singles making more than $800,000 and families making more than $1 million will pay an extra 5.4 percent. Then in 2013 and after, these surtax rates go up to 2 percent, 3 percent, and 5.4 percent, respectively. The only way these rates would not go up in 2013 is if the President's adviser, the Director of OMB, determines in 2012 that there will be more than $675 billion realized in estimated health care savings by the year 2019.  That is right: The trigger mechanism is back. The House Democrats have made the surtax rate increase subject to a trigger. They have left the judgment on whether to pull the trigger in the hands of a partisan Presidential adviser, not a nonpartisan organization such as the Congressional Budget Office.  As Members of Congress, we should jealously guard our constitutional prerogatives to be the one branch of government tasked with deciding whether revenue is raised by increased taxes or revenue is reduced through decreased taxes. As the great Chief Justice John Marshall said almost 200 years ago:       The power to tax is the power to destroy.  So why would we hand such an enormous power over to the executive branch? I recall, over the last 8 years, hearing from the other side of the aisle that the executive branch was attempting to usurp congressional authority. So where is that jealous guardian of congressional authority now? It seems to be absent.  We have seen this trigger mechanism from the Democrats before. While it has been a couple years, I have spoken at length about this trigger right here on the floor of the Senate.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my speech of May 9, 2007, entitled ``A Trigger and a Tax Hike on the American People'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Statement of Senator Chuck Grassley: A Trigger Will Not Prevent a Tax                       Hike on the American People       Mr. President, press reports indicated we may be in the      ninth inning of the budget season. The President sent his      budget up to Capitol Hill over three months ago. The Senate      Budget Committee marked up a budget resolution. It passed the      Senate. That resolution lays out the Democratic Leadership      fiscal priorities for the next five years. As everyone knows,      the American People spoke last November and sent a Democratic      Majority to both Houses of Congress. For the first time in 12      years, Democrats have the privilege and the responsibility      for our budget.       The Senate spoke very clearly in support of some tax      relief. The voice came in the form of the Baucus amendment.      My friend, the Chairman, secured $180 billion to prevent part      of the big tax increase that will go into effect on January      1, 2011. Although the Baucus amendment only provides 44      percent of the tax relief room needed, it is far superior to      the House position. The House position is zero tax relief.      That's right, Mr. President, zero tax relief. Zero tax relief      means a total tax increase of $936 billion over 5 years.      That's the largest tax increase in history and one that      occurs without a vote of Congress.       That tax increase means real dollars out of the wallets of      real middle income families. I've got a chart here. The chart      shows a wall of tax increase. This chart shows that a family      of four at $40,000 will face a tax increase of $2,052. Now,      for a lot of my rich liberal friends that may not seem like a      lot of money. For a hard working family of four in Iowa, that      $2,052 matters.       As a senior Republican member of the Budget Committee, I've      not been consulted on the budget by our Chairman, but I've      made my views clear to our distinguished Chairman. What I      know about the budget I've learned from press reports. If      those reports are true, I'd encourage the Chairman and Senate      Leadership to stand strong for the Senate position.       Press reports indicate that the Democratic Budget Committee      chairmen are working on a compromise that would condition the      tax relief on a surplus. That is, the Baucus amendment would      be subject to a trigger. Now, Mr. President, what's a      trigger?       I have another chart. This chart deals with perhaps the      most famous trigger. The chart shows ``Trigger,'' the cowboy      actor, Roy Rogers', horse. You can see from the chart that      Trigger is a pretty impressive looking horse. Would      definitely like to have Trigger on my farm to help with the      chores. Am sure my grand kids would want to ride him if      Trigger were stabled on my farm.       As Western movie buffs know, Trigger is no longer with us.      Trigger is stuffed and on display at the Roy Rogers-Dale      Evans Museum in Branson, Missouri. Although Trigger was an      impressive looking horse, this trigger device the Democratic      Leadership is looking at is not impressive.       The trigger notion is something that has a long history      with the Democratic Leadership. Back in 1996, the Clinton      Administration and Democratic Leadership argued for a trigger      for the $500 per child tax credit and other family tax relief      proposals. They took this position after President Clinton      had vetoed the bill containing the family tax relief      proposals. If the Clinton Administration and the Democratic      Leadership had prevailed, millions of American families would      have received the $500 per child tax credit perhaps in 1999      through 2001 only. If the President Clinton and the      Democratic Leadership had won and the trigger were in place,      millions of families would have lost the child tax credit in      the years 2002 to now.       The same dynamic occurred in 2001. With surpluses, the      Democratic Leadership opposed broad-based bipartisan tax      relief, including a doubling of the $500 per child tax      credit. One of the ideas the Democratic Leadership flirted      with was a trigger. There were a few Republicans attracted to      the idea.       The trigger was debated somewhat, but never found to be      workable. It is a complicated matter. It could be suggested      that the mechanics of a broad-based tax trigger are like      trigonometry. Trigonometry is a division of mathematics that      deals with triangles. It is simple on its face, but you can      see from this text book, can become complicated quickly.       Interweaving the complexity and uncertainty of triggered      tax relief with the vast American economy could lead to a new      term. That new term would be ``trig-o-nomics.'' As much as      folks complain about uncertainty and complexity in tax      policy, I don't think the Democratic budget negotiators      should want to take us to the land of trig-o-nomics.       To some degree, the current law sunset of the 2001 and 2003      is a de facto trigger. If you look at those in opposition to      permanence of the bipartisan tax relief, you'll find that it      is, with very few exceptions, the same folks who like      triggers.       The tax system is a very complex and pervasive force in our      society. It affects all Americans and all economic activity.      Creating conditional tax relief through a trigger mechanism      would de-stabilize an already unwieldy tax system. How are      families, businesses, and investors supposed to plan their      affairs with a trigger hanging over current law tax rules      that keep taxes low? Think about that, Mr. President. What      would we be doing to the hard working American taxpayer?       As an aside, those taxpayers, by the way, are sending      record amounts of revenue to the Treasury. The bipartisan tax      relief plans of 2001 and 2003 are growing the economy.      Revenues are ahead of projections by double digit figures for      the third year in a row. It's there in the black and white of      Treasury and CBO reports. The American taxpayer is doing his      and her part to reduce the deficit. I ask unanimous consent      to insert in the record a couple of articles from the BNA      Daily Report for Executives, one dated May 3, 2007 and      another dated May 7, 2007.       So, why trigger on tax increases, when the current law tax      levels are bringing in plenty of money to the federal      Treasury? It makes no sense to punish the American taxpayer.       The biggest problem I have with a trigger is that it      creates yet another budget process bias for higher federal      spending. If Congress decides to spend more than planned, the      trigger gives the American taxpayer the shaft. Spending      taxpayers' money trumps future promised tax relief if a      trigger is in place.       The American taxpayer need look no further than the budget      resolution conference to see triggered future tax relief's      futility. After winning the November elections by claiming to      enforce fiscal discipline, Democrats have done three things      with the budgets in conference. One, they've guaranteed new      spending of at least $205 billion over the budget baseline.      Two, with multiple reserve funds, they've set up many arenas      of new spending and new taxes. Three, for the first time in      six years, a tax hike on virtually every American taxpayer is      built into the budget in future years. Did the American      People know that this was how fiscal discipline would be      defined after the votes were counted? Higher taxes and higher      spending? Did the American People vote for this definition of      fiscal discipline in last year's campaign? My guess is the      answer is the American taxpayer didn't think fiscal      discipline meant higher taxes and higher spending.       If fiscal discipline were the real goal of the Democratic      Leadership, they'd employ a trigger on the new spending      they've baked in the budget cake. Mr. President, how about      that? The new spending in this budget would only be triggered      if the federal budget were in surplus. Do I have any takers      among the Democratic budget negotiators?       Mr. President, before the Democratic Leadership rolled out      its budget, I challenged them to show a proposal with a      single dollar of spending restraint dedicated to deficit      reduction. It's a challenge I've issued for several years as      bipartisan tax relief has been attacked on fiscal discipline      grounds. My challenge has not been met. If you go back a      decade, you won't find a proposal for spending restraint from      the Democratic Leadership. Check the record. You won't find      anything on the spending side of the ledger.       The use of a trigger is more evidence of this obsession      with taxing and spending. Instead of accepting the Baucus      amendment, which is supported by strongly-bipartisan votes in      both bodies, the Democratic negotiators are taking a      different path. They want to use a trigger as cover. The      trigger will likely mean future Democratic spending proposals      will gut future tax relief, thereby guaranteeing a tax      increase on virtually every American taxpayer.       Mr. President, it's not too late. I suggest that, if the      Democratic budgeteers want to talk the talk of fiscal      discipline, they need to walk the walk of fiscal discipline.      Apply the trigger. But apply it to the $205 billion in brand      new spending. Don't build a wall of tax relief on America's      families. Build a wall of fiscal discipline against runaway      federal spending.       I yield the floor.
