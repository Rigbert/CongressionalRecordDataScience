J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union which represents nearly 5,000 Border Patrol agents, told my staff on March 4, 1997:       The level of trust for Mexican authorities is almost non-     existent. He said that ``the lack of cooperation includes      failure to provide assistance, aiding and abetting criminal     activity, and even acts of aggression against Border Patrol      Agents.'' He described U.S. agents observing Mexican officers      who were clearly escorting aliens and drug smugglers.  The police chief of El Centro, CA, Harold Carter, told my staff that his officers are very leery of who they can trust in Mexico.  These are the views of our law enforcement officers. But the question of whether Mexico is fully cooperating with the United States can also be easily answered by looking at Mexico's policies on working with DEA agents. In this area, there have been three significant failings.  One was the failure of the Mexican Government--the same one that has just been certified as fully cooperating--to adequately fund and staff the binational border task forces that had been agreed upon by the high level contact group.  What good are high-level meetings that produce agreements on cooperation if one side then fails to live up to its end of the agreement?  Second, Mexico has hampered the ability of the United States military to contribute to interdiction efforts. Mexico refuses to allow United States Navy ships on patrol for drug smugglers in the Pacific to put into Mexican ports to refuel without 30 days notice--and without paying cash. As the cartels increasingly turn to sea-routes to smuggle their drugs, this policy seriously hampers our ability to stop them.  Also, overflights by U.S. reconnaissance aircraft are still under negotiation. These flights would enhance the ability of both sides to find and disrupt drug shipments.  The third major failing has been Mexico's refusal to allow United States drug enforcement agents to carry sidearms to protect themselves while on the Mexican side of the border. As a result, Mr. Constantine had no choice but to suspend operations in which DEA agents cross the border, because they cannot protect themselves.  In the last several days, there has been a flurry of meetings between American and Mexican officials. Did the United States gain any concessions? Well, Mexican officials were quoted as saying that ``the rules have stayed exactly where they are''--which means no sidearms. There you have it. Full cooperation.                              Extraditions  The State Department's statement of explanation makes another astonishing claim on the subject of extraditions. It says:       The Government of Mexico established the important      precedent of extraditing Mexican nationals to the United      States under the provision of Mexico's extradition law      permitting this in ``exceptional circumstances.''  Here is my understanding of the actual facts:  First, Mexico says it has changed its policy to allow the extradition of Mexican nationals to the United States. Of course, we are talking about Mexican nationals who are wanted for crimes committed here in the United States.  Second, to my knowledge, the Mexican government has sent three Mexican nationals to the United States. One was Juan Garcia Abrego, head of the gulf cartel, but he was expelled, not extradited, because he held American as well as Mexican citizenship. The other two were for murder and sexual abuse, not for drug charges.  Third, to date, Mexico has never--never--extradited a single Mexican national to the United States on drug-related charges. That, I believe, is a fact.  Now the Mexican Government says, and the State Department apparently believes, that Mexico is prepared to extradite Mexican nationals on drug charges in ``special circumstances.''  If this is truly a change of policy on the part of Mexico, let us see results. There are 52 outstanding extradition requests for Mexican nationals wanted on drug charges. Mexico should honor these requests now.  It should be pointed out that these extradition requests are for crimes committed in this country. How can a good friend, ally, and neighbor deny extradition of 52 people wanted for drug-related crimes committed here, and the statement still be made that they are fully cooperating in our antidrug efforts?  A good place for Mexico to start would be with Francisco Arellano-Felix of the Tijuana cartel, who is currently in custody in a Mexican prison and wanted on narcotics charges here in the United States. Another good start would be Miguel Caro Quintero, who walks the streets of Sonora without fear of arrest and grants interviews with the Washington Post. He has four indictments pending against him in the United States.  Mexican nationals wanted on drug charges is clearly the highest priority. These include many of the drug kingpins. But there are other sensitive cases as well that need to be resolved.  John Riley Henrique was indicted by a Federal grand jury in the eastern district of California for trafficking at least 150 kilograms of cocaine from Mexico to the United States. Henrique, an American citizen, is thought to be connected with Miguel Angel Felix Guillardo, the mastermind of the 1985 murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena.  Law enforcement sources told my office that John Riley Henrique was detained by Mexican law enforcement and then suddenly released without warning. He is still believed to be in Mexico. The Mexican authorities should find him, apprehend him, and extradite him.  T.J. Bonner of the National Border Patrol Council testified before the Senate Banking Committee on March 28, 1996, about the tragic fatal shooting on January 19, 1996, of a Border Patrol agent, our agent, Jefferson Barr. Agent Barr was killed while intercepting a group of marijuana smugglers along the border near Eagle Pass, TX.  Before he died, Agent Barr wounded one of his assailants. The FBI interviewed the suspect, a Mexican national, in a Mexican hospital, and the United States later charged him with murder and sought his extradition. The Government of Mexico sentenced the individual to 10 years in prison on a narcotics-related charge but has refused to extradite him.  For the State Department to say that Mexico is fully cooperating on the issue of extraditions under these circumstances dishonors the memory of Agent Jefferson Barr.  America's law enforcement officers know how serious the problem is. I would like to quote from a March 2, 1997, press release put out by the National Border Patrol Council, local 1613, of San Diego. It reads:       The certification of Mexico is a clear blow to the efforts      of U.S. Border Patrol agents in their daily efforts at      thwarting the massive amounts of illegal drugs entering the      country every day. Additionally, this certification is a      disgrace to the memory of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Jefferson      Barr.                      The Need to Waive Sanctions  Some worry that decertifying Mexico will harm our relationship with an important friend and ally. Others worry that it will make Mexico's drug problem worse.  Mexico is a friend and an ally, but I ask my colleagues: Do we do Mexico any favors by turning a blind eye to the depth of the problem? Do we do Mexico any favors by suggesting that the status quo is good enough? Will Mexico take the steps necessary to combat the flow of drugs if the United States keeps telling them year after year after year that they are doing enough and that they are fully cooperating?  The truth is that failure to decertify Mexico makes a mockery of the entire certification process. Columbia is decertified. Mexico is not. And today, the drugs coming from Mexico are the greatest threat. It makes no sense.  I know of few Members of this body, if any, who want to impose sanctions on Mexico. Senate Joint Resolution 21, which the Senator from Georgia and I introduced last week, decertifies Mexico but authorizes the President to waive all sanctions if it is in the vital national interest, and we will give testimony to that resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee the day after tomorrow.  The same is true of House Joint Resolution 58, which passed the House International Relations Committee by a vote of 27 to 5 last Thursday and will likely pass the full House by a large margin later this week.  I believe that we do have vital national interests in Mexico that require us not to impose sanctions at this point. All we are asking for is an honest, accurate assessment of whether Mexico has fully cooperated with us in the war on drugs, and to send the message that this cooperation must improve rapidly or Mexico will be fully decertified next year. This is what the law provides, and the facts, I believe,speak for themselves. Mexico has not met the test of full cooperation required for certification.                      Steps Toward Recertification  I realize that the administration has been working feverishly to negotiate agreements with Mexico which will show that progress is being made, and I hope they can do that. But it is too late to improve Mexico's performance in 1996. The year is gone. But let me lay out some of the steps I believe Mexico needs to take in order to be eligible to be recertified, if she is decertified.  First, effective action to dismantle the major drug cartels and arrest their leaders.  Second, full and ongoing implementation of effective money-laundering legislation and rigorously enforced bank regulations with penalties for those who do not comply.  Third, compliance with all outstanding extradition requests by the United States so that cartel leaders and major traffickers can be brought to justice.  Fourth, help at the border. Mexico, as a friend, an ally, and a neighbor, should help enforce the border and prevent the flow of contraband. It is not enough to see this as simply America's problem. And this goes for the seas as well. Not to permit United States military ships to refuel in Mexican ports without 30 days notice is unacceptable from a friend.  Fifth, improved cooperation with U.S. law enforcement officials, including allowing United States law enforcement agents to resume carrying weapons on the Mexican side of the border, and for Mexico to pay their share of the effort and be fully supportive of United States help.  Any legitimate American law enforcement officer detailed to Mexico and working drugs should be permitted to carry a sidearm --or they should not go.  Sixth, implementation of a comprehensive program to identify, to weed out, and to prosecute corrupt officials at all levels of the Mexican Government, police, and military.  If Mexico takes these steps, I would support recertification even during the current year, which the law allows if there is significant progress in a decertified country.  Mr. President, I believe I have laid out a strong case that Mexico did not earn certification as fully cooperating on counternarcotics in 1996. Have there been instances of cooperation? Of course. But can anyone credibly say that Mexico has fully cooperated with the United States? It is not even close.  It is important for us to be honest with ourselves about this issue. If we are not honest with ourselves, we unreasonably lower our guard against the incredible danger that Mexican drug trafficking poses to our children, our schools, and our communities.  If we are not honest with ourselves, we dishonor the dedication of thousands of DEA and Border Patrol agents who put their lives on the line every single day to try to keep drugs from reaching our streets. I believe today those agents have every right to feel betrayed.  Senator Coverdell, Senator Helms, myself, and others will continue trying to disapprove the Mexico certification and enact a vital national interest waiver. Similar legislation is moving through the House. We will make our best effort.  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and ask unanimous consent that Senator Coverdell and Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas be permitted to speak during morning business charged to the time under my control.
