 President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators Boxer, Mikulski, Akaka, Bingaman, and Sarbanes in submitting a resolution to condemn all prejudice against individuals of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry in the United States, and to support the full participation by such individuals in the political and civic affairs of the United States.  Given some of the recent reactions and media coverage of the Cox committee report and campaign finance allegations, this resolution expresses the sense of Congress that no individual or institution of the United States should stereotype an entire group of people and that all individuals in the United States, including people of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry, are entitled to the same rights and privileges.  Indeed, over the past several months I have grown increasingly disturbed by some of the reactions and media coverage of the allegations of espionage at our national labs and illegal campaign financing that have called into question the loyalty of Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent.  Clearly, any individuals who are suspected of engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, regardless of their ancestry or heritage, should be investigated.  However, the entire Asian and Pacific Island community should not be stereotyped or impugned as a result of the alleged actions of a few.  Throughout the history of the United States, Americans of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry have suffered from unfounded and demagogic accusations of disloyalty. Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent have been subjected to discriminatory laws, such as the 1882 Chinese Exclusionary Act and a 1913 California law relating to alien-owned land.  They have also been subjected to discriminatory actions, including the interment of patriotic and loyal Japanese Americans during World War II, the repatriation of Filipino immigrants, and the prohibition of individuals from owning property, voting, testifying in court or attending school with other people in the United States.  In light of this history, I am appalled that in recent months some have resorted to negative stereotypes to question the integrity of an entire community.  In an impassioned letter, one of my constituents expressed, ``As a Chinese American . . . I ask no more than what is due to every citizen of this country, namely, to be treated with respect and dignity. I resent those who would question the loyalty of Chinese Americans any time a particular Chinese American is suspected of an egregious act. In their haste to decry the alleged espionage by an individual, not only are these public officials and said media guilty of a rush to judgment but of tarring with a broad brush other American citizens who are guilty of nothing else other than having the same ethnicity of the suspect.''  Another one of my constituents wrote, ``It appears that China has become Washington D.C.'s latest scapegoat. The accusations coming out of Washington severely damage what could be an excellent relationship and are dangerously close to spilling over in this country to an anti-Chinese and anti-Asian bias against solid U.S. citizens.''  These comments should not be taken lightly. All Americans should be highly offended by the negative stereotypes and media coverage of members of our community who have made profound contributions to our nation. Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent have made great contributions to the arts, the economy, the sciences, politics, sports, and technology, among other areas. They have honorably defended the United States in times of armed conflict, from the Civil War to the present. By virtue of their membership in American society, they have just as much stake in this country as an American from any other ethnic background, and should not be held to a different standard.  I hope my colleagues will support this resolution and join us in taking a firm stand against discrimination and prejudice against individuals of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry in the United States.                          ____________________
