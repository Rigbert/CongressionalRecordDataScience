But I will just give a personal example. There is a drug called Lomotil that you take if you get an intestinal problem and you are traveling overseas. My wife and I on a private trip were traveling overseas. My doctor said, ``You ought to take some of this with you.'' He gave me a prescription. Okay. I went to a local pharmacy. The pharmacies are not the ones that are ripping us off on this and that is something the American people need to know. They need to know where to focus their anger and it is not on the pharmacist because they are paying more than the drug company is selling the drug for to other customers. The pills were about a buck each. I got to India. I was sick. I was out of the pills. I went into a local pharmacy there, same manufacturer, exactly the same drug, made in America, that was good, I was happy to have a made in America drug, six cents per pill.
