 As I understand the unanimous-consent request, it is to the extent possible we will try to alternate between Democrat and Republican, opponents and proponents. That is the same as saying, with one exception, for and against. I do not expect that to mean that wewould not engage each other in colloquy and debate so we don't just have statement after statement.
