 President, I rise to submit to my colleagues a resolution that is very important to the history of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the history of our Nation. This resolution, S. Res. 357, sponsored by myself and my friend Senator Paul, commemorates the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Mill Springs and recognizes the significance of the great clash of the Civil War that took place there.  On January 19, 1862, the Battle of Mill Springs spilled across Pulaski and Wayne Counties in southeastern Kentucky. It was the second-largest battle to take place in the State, and involved over 10,000 soldiers. More importantly, it was the first significant Union victory to happen in what was then considered the western theater of the Civil War. The Union's victory meant that the main Confederate defense line that had been anchored in eastern Kentucky was broken, freeing Union soldiers to move through Kentucky and into Tennessee.  One hundred fifty years later, this battle is still a vital story in our Nation's history. That is why our resolution also salutes the Mill Springs Battlefield Association, which has worked hard to preserve the historic site and educate the public about what went on there. The Mill Springs Battlefield Association has a visitors' center, provides tours, displays Civil War artifacts and maintains a Civil War library. More than 50,000 visitors have traveled to see the preserved battlefield.  So Mr. President, I am proud to submit this resolution to the United States Senate, and proud of the history we have preserved for posterity in Kentucky.                          ____________________
