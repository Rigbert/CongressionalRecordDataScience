 President, on an entirely different matter, the Defense authorization legislation before the Senate would authorize the programs and funding that provide the kind of training and equipment our military needs in the face of aggressive threats such as ISIL. It would provide a well-deserved pay raise to the brave men and women who give us everything to keep us safe. It contains exactly the same level of funding--exactly the same level of funding--President Obama requested in his own budget: $612 billion.  It is just the kind of legislation you would expect to receive strong bipartisan support. Up until now, it has. The NDAA is a bill we typically consider every year, and it is one that typically passes with bipartisan support. This year's House bill passed with votes from both parties, while the Senate version of the bill passed the Armed Services Committee by a huge bipartisan margin of 22 to 4. That was in the Senate Armed Services Committee, the vote on the bill we have before us. It should be sailing through the Senate for passage by a similar margin this week, but some in the Democratic leadership are now trying to hold it hostage for partisan reasons.  We live in an age when, as Henry Kissinger recently put it, ``the United States has not faced a more diverse and complex array of crises since the end of the Second World War.'' Yet some Democratic leaders seem to think this is the moment to hold our national security hostage to the partisan demands for more spending on Washington bureaucracies, such as the IRS. They seem to think it is OK to hold our troops and their families to ransom if they can't plus-up unrelated bills, such as the one that funds their own congressional offices.  The Armed Services Committee chairman just penned an op-ed on the issue that I would ask my colleagues to read. It made many important points, including this one: There is bipartisan consensus that we cannot continue to hold defense funding at BCA levels after years of dangerous cuts. Military officials have told us that to do so could put American lives at risk, which means it is a scenario we should be working to avoid at all costs. But some Democratic leaders seem to view such a worrying scenario as little more than leverage to extract more spending for unrelated bureaucracies.  ``It is the first duty of the federal government to protect the nation,'' Senator McCain wrote in his piece. ``With global threats rising, it simply makes no sense to oppose a defense policy bill full of vital authorities that our troops need for a reason that has nothing to do with national defense spending.'' He is right.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain's op-ed be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Here is what I am asking today. I am asking every sensible Democratic colleague to keep onside with the American people and pull these party leaders back from the edge. I am asking my friends across the aisle to join with us to support wounded warriors instead of more partisan brinksmanship, to give our troops a raise instead of giving gridlock a boost. And I am asking them to work with us to defeat the contingency funding amendment offered by the senior Senator from Rhode Island so that we can keep this bill intact and consistent with the budget resolution.  The new Congress has been on a roll in recent months, getting things done for the American people in a spirit of greater openness and cooperation. Let's keep the momentum going. Let's keep that spirit alive. If Senators have amendments, I would encourage them to work with Senator McCain to get them processed. But above all, let's ignore the partisan voices of the past and work together for more shared achievements instead. I think our troops and their families deserve no less.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Politico, June 9, 2015]             Obama Is Wrong To Hold Defense Funding Hostage                         (By Sen. John McCain)       Congress has passed a National Defense Authorization Act,      vital legislation providing the necessary funding and      authorities for our military and the men and women who      volunteer to defend the nation, for 53 consecutive years.      This year's NDAA should be no different.       The NDAA delivers sweeping defense reforms that will enable      our military to rise to the challenges of a more dangerous      world. The legislation contains the most significant reforms      in a generation to a broken acquisition system that takes too      long and costs too much. It modernizes and improves our 70-     year-old military retirement system, expanding benefits to      the vast majority of service members excluded from the      current system. The NDAA reforms Pentagon management to      ensure precious defense dollars are focused on our war      fighters, not on expanding bloated staffs, which have grown      exponentially in recent years.       With $10 billion in wasteful and excessive spending      identified in the Pentagon's budget, the legislation invests      in crucial military capabilities for our war fighters. The      bill accelerates Navy shipbuilding and adds fighter aircraft      to address shortfalls across the services. As adversaries      threaten our military technological advantage, the bill looks      to the future and invests in new breakthrough technologies,      including directed energy and unmanned combat aircraft.       Despite these critical reforms, President Barack Obama is      threatening to veto the NDAA and future defense spending      bills for reasons totally unrelated to national security.       The Budget Control Act, which set in motion dangerous      defense cuts, establishes caps on defense and nondefense      discretionary spending. There is bipartisan consensus on the      dangerous impact these spending caps would have on defense.      All of the military service chiefs testified this year that      funding defense at the level of the BCA caps would put      American lives at risk.       Rather than seeking to avoid this scenario at all costs,      the president is using it as leverage to extract increases in      nondefense spending. As his veto threat made clear, the      president ``will not fix defense without fixing non-defense      spending.''       Such intransigence shows a disturbing misalignment of White      House priorities. It is the first duty of the federal      government to protect the nation. With global threats rising,      it simply makes no sense to oppose a defense policy bill full      of vital authorities that our troops need for a reason that      has nothing to do with national defense spending.       The NDAA fully supports Obama's budget request of $612      billion for national defense, which is $38 billion above the      spending caps established by the Budget Control Act. In other      words, this legislation gives the president every dollar of      budget authority he requested. The difference is that NDAA      follows the Senate Budget Resolution and funds that $38      billion increase through Overseas Contingency Operations      funds.       Parroting White House rhetoric, some Senate Democrats have      been spreading misinformation about OCO funding, saying this      funding is inappropriate or somehow limited in its ability to      support our military. This is nonsense. The NDAA purposefully      placed the additional $38 billion of OCO funding in the same      accounts and activities for which the president himself      requested OCO money.       To be clear, using OCO to pay for our national defense is      not my preference. But given the choice between OCO money and      no money, I choose OCO, and multiple senior military leaders      testified before the Armed Services Committee this year that      they would make the same choice for one simple reason. This      is $38 billion of real money that our military desperately      needs, and without which our top military leaders have said      they cannot succeed.       It remains my highest priority as chairman of the Senate      Armed Services Committee to achieve a long-term, bipartisan      solution that lifts the BCA caps once and for all. Obama says      this is his goal as well. But the NDAA is a policy bill--not      a spending bill--and cannot accomplish that goal. In the      absence of such an agreement, I refuse to ask the brave young      Americans in our military to defend this nation with      insufficient resources that would place their lives in      unnecessary danger. Holding the NDAA hostage to force that      solution would be a deliberate and cynical failure to meet      our constitutional duty to provide for the common defense.       It is simply incomprehensible that as America confronts the      most diverse and complex array of crises around the world      since the end of World War II, that a president would veto      funding for our military to prove a political point. The NDAA      before the Senate authorizes $612 billion for national      defense. This is the amount requested by the president and      justified by his own national security strategy. For the sake      of the men and women of our military and our national      security, it's time the president learned how to say yes.                          ____________________
