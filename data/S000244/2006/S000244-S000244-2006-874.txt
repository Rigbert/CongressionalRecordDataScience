Speaker, today I am introducing a bill to codify and enact certain general and permanent laws, related to public contracts, as Title 41 of the United States Code. This bill has been prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives as the successor to H.R. 4320, introduced in the 108th Congress on May 10, 2004. This bill reflects changes resulting from the review and comment process that was provided after H.R. 4320 was introduced. All issues raised during that process have been resolved to the satisfaction of the parties involved.  The bill, along with a detailed section-by-section explanation of the bill, can be accessed on the Office's website at http://uscode.house.gov. Anyone interested in obtaining a printed copy of the bill and explanation, and persons interested in submitting comments on the bill, should contact Ken Paretzky, Senior Counsel, Office of the Law Revision Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives, H2-304 Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515-6711. The telephone number is (202) 226-9061. Comments on the bill should be submitted to the Office of the Law Revision Counsel no later than July 16, 2006.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E861]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]     CODIFICATION OF TITLE 41, UNITED STATES CODE, PUBLIC CONTRACTS                                 ______                                                     HON.
