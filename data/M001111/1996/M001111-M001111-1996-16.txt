 President, in recent years, there has been been one issue that, perhaps more than any other, has sent waves of fear through our communities--the scourge of illegal drugs and the threat they pose to our children and families. As the 104th Congress comes to a close, I want to reflect on one aspect of this growing threat: the increasing use and manufacture of methamphetamines.  The use of this drug is increasing among youth and young adults. According to the most recent Drug Abuse Warning Network, methamphetamine-related deaths increased nationally by 145 percent between 1992 and 1994 and methamphetamine-related emergency room cases are up 256 percent since 1991. In addition, methamphetamine-related hospital visits more than tripled between 1991 and 1994, with the largest increases occurring in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Denver.  In case my colleagues are not familiar with this drug, it is commonly called, in its various forms, speed, crank, ice, and meth. It's cheap, easy to get, highly addictive, and very, very dangerous.  This drug can be inhaled, injected, ingested, or smoked. Its effects include feelings of alertness, euphoria, self-confidence, and impulsiveness. It can lead to rage, depression, paranoia, delusions,weight loss, abnormal heartbeat, insomnia, confusion, and auditory hallucinations. It has increased its purity in recent years and its effects can be sustained for up to 8 hours. Abusers may remain awake for days or weeks after a binge, then enter the most dangerous phase, know as tweaking, where they as most likely to suffer hallucinations, dramatic mood swings, and extreme violence.  While all drugs are cause for concern, the increase of methamphetamines pose unique problems for law enforcement and communities, namely clandestine labs.  In recent months, I have met with groups of law enforcement officials including Washington State Patrol Chief Annette Sandberg, U.S. Attorney Kate Pflaumer, and representatives of many local law enforcement agencies, including Shoreline Polices Department, Snohomish County Sheriffs Department, Lynnwood Police Department, Everett Police Department, Marysvill Police Department, and Mukilteo Police Department. Without exception, all mentioned the increasing numbers of clandestine laboratories used to manufacture methamphetamines.  These labs are easily assembled in hotel rooms, trailer homes, or other small structures in both rural and urban settings. Using a quick, easy and cheap method, dubbed the Nazi method because of its invention by the Germans to keep soldiers alert in World War II, legal ingredients are harnessed to create a potent form of methamphetamines.  Once these labs are located, local law enforcement officers must disassemble them, often at great risk to themselves. The chemicals used to make this synthetic drug include red phosphorous, iodine, hydrochloric acid, and, most importantly, ephedrine. These chemicals or their combination create hazardous waste and can be deadly if officers are overexposed to them.  According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, the clandestine nature of the manufacturing process and the presence of ignitable, corrosive, reactive, and toxic chemicals have led to explosions, fires, toxic fumes, and irreparable damage to human health and the environment. The so-called cooks or chemists in these clandestine labs simply dump hazardous chemical wastes on the ground, into streams or lakes, into sewage systems or septic tanks, or underground.  Law enforcement officials or firefighters require special training in health, safety, and disposal methods to deal with these labs. The cleanup of these dangerous sites is complex, expensive and time consuming. The contaminated materials and evidence can weigh up to several tons. The substances to which these law enforcement officers are exposed present very real health risks.  In addition to the danger posed to officers and the environment, unwitting future tenants of the motels, homes, or trailers may be exposed to toxic vapors that have permeated plaster and wood of buildings. Children may play in the soil or water onto which these chemicals have been carelessly or intentionally dumped. Passersby also may inhale these vapors as they pass a clandestine lab. Finally, chemicals may be stored in rental lockers or other semi-public places that lack proper ventilation or temperature controls. These improperly stored chemicals increase the likelihood of fire, explosion, and human exposure.  So, Mr. President, what should we do? I am in strong support of S. 1965, the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act passed by the Senate 2 weeks ago and the House this weekend. That bill takes a multifaceted approach to the problem by addressing, among other things, importation of chemicals used to make the drug; increased penalties for manufacturing, possession of manufacturing equipment, and trafficking; higher civil penalties for firms that knowingly supply precursor chemicals; restitution for cleanup of clandestine lab sites; development of an interagency task force; public health monitoring; and public-private education programs.  I congratulate Senators Hatch, Biden, and Feinstein on their efforts to help this Congress address the problem. I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Senators Hatch and Biden be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1996.     Senator Orrin Hatch,     Chairman, Judiciary Committee.     Senator Joe Biden,     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee.       Dear Orrin and Joe: Last week, the Senate passed a bill you      sponsored, the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of      1996. I understand the House intends to make up a similar      bill this week. I strongly support the Senate bill, S. 1965,      and urge you to work to ensure it becomes law this year.       In these last two months, I have visited with      representatives of local, state and federal law enforcement.      Over and over, these officials voiced concerns about the      increasing manufacture, potency, and availability of      methamphetamines. Local and state law enforcement officers      said they felt particularly ill-equipped to safely and cost-     effectively deal with clandestine labs and the hazardous      chemicals they contain. The high cost, technical expertise      and time required to investigate and eliminate these labs are      hampering law enforcement's ability to protect our young      people and communities from the threat not only of      methamphetamines, but of other illegal drugs as well.       I pledge my support in any way I can to helping ensure this      bill, S. 1965, becomes law. I also intend to work within the      Appropriations Committee to see that coordination efforts are      strengthened and our law enforcement officials have the tools      they need to combat this growing threat.       Thank you for all of your work to date on this issue. I      look forward to working closely with you on this important      public safety issue.           Sincerely,                                                     Patty Murray,                                                     U.S. Senator.
