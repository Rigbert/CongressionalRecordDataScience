I will do my best to always yield to meaningful questions and comments as those made by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But I want to return to my comments.  This is a curious situation, where the chairman of the committee who wrote the bill had to issue a subpoena to get the information about what the bill meant. Now that is a curious situation.

Who has enough interest in this matter to want to move forward with passing this bill outside of Capitol Hill? I gave one example earlier of one corporation which stands to gain $3.1 billion if this bill passes. Those are companies very interested in this bill.
