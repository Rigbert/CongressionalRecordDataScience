Speaker, it is with great pride and enthusiasm that I rise to recognize and congratulate Dr. Paul Swanson. This dedicated and giving man will be honored tonight with the Ambassador for Peace Leadership in Reconciliation and Peace-Making Award. A resident of Northwest Indiana, Dr. Swanson has devoted his life to the preservation of peace in his community and throughout the world. His work will be honored this evening at the Ambassadors for Peace Awards Banquet.  Throughout his career, Dr. Swanson has united his fellow citizens by demonstrating the importance of compassion and understanding toward those of different beliefs. As a mentor to many pastors in the Midwest, Dr. Swanson has broken new ground in the areas of ecumenical and interdenominational dialog.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Paul Swanson is currently a Professor Emeritus of Family Counseling for the Lutheran School of Theology at the University of Chicago. Although he has spent his career helping others, Dr. Swanson's family has always been his first priority. His wife Cordie, and their two children provide the inspiration for Dr. Swanson in his commitment to improve the community around him.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Paul Swanson for his outstanding service to the residents of Northwest Indiana. His efforts to improve his community should be commended, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________
