 Let me stress that is all today's vote is about. Today's vote is about accountability and transparency. It is a debate about whether we think Americans need more oversight over Washington or less.  Republicans made our position clear more than 7 months ago when 44 of us signed a letter saying we will not support a nominee for this Bureau, no matter who the President is, until three commonsense conditions are met that would bring some transparency and accountability to the CFPB. That letter now has 45 signatories.
