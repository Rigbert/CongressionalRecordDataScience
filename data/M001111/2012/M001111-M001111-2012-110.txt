 President, it is with great privilege that I congratulate BG John R. McMahon, division commander of the Northwest Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, on his well-deserved retirement after a long and successful career serving our country. Brigadier General McMahon has been stationed with the Northwest Division since 2009, and my staff and I have had the pleasure of working extensively with him during that time.  An example of Brigadier General McMahon's leadership ability was his response to a storm that caused serious damage to the Howard Hanson Dam in King County. The storm raised the flood threat for hundreds of thousands of residents in the Green River Valley, which is home to one of the largest manufacturing and distribution bases on the west coast. Brigadier General McMahon and the Army Corps reacted quickly and decisively to respond and repair right abutment seepage issues and other potential failure modes, allowing the facility to return to normal operation in less than three years.  During his tenure, Brigadier General McMahon addressed the need to replace three lock gates on the Columbia-Snake River navigation system, and that was no small feat. He has also worked extensively to lay the groundwork with the Department of State in preparation for the upcoming renewal of the Columbia River Treaty. Brigadier General McMahon's hard work leaves a strong legacy upon which these important efforts may progress.  Additionally, as we all know, the Missouri River system witnessed some of the worst flooding in history in 2011. Under Brigadier General McMahon's leadership, the Army Corps responded quickly and efficiently to minimize the threats of rising floodwaters and to answer calls for help in repairing the extensive damage caused by these floods. For this, so many are grateful. His professionalism and expertise helped our Nation through this disaster and undoubtedly lessened the destruction and prevented loss of life.  On behalf of all who live in the Pacific Northwest, I thank Brigadier General McMahon for his dedication to the safety and well-being of the people of our region. His knowledge, experience, and tireless effort will be sorely missed. Mr. President, I congratulate General McMahon and wish him and his family the best of luck in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
