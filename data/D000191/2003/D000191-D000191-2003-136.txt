  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, the Republican Medicare prescription drug bill will provide unprecedented benefits and protection. Unfortunately, the benefits and protection under this perverse legislation will all flow to the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, not the seniors who need help paying their prescription drug bills. That is right. The biggest beneficiaries are the wildly profitable pharmaceutical industry and the anticompetitive insurance industry. You cannot provide a meaningful benefit unless you deal with the obscene price of prescription drugs. And this bill does nothing, not reasonable pricing, not reimportation, not negotiated lowering of prices, nothing, because that would hurt the profits of the pharmaceutical industry. The insurance industry, they will get a subsidy under this bill to offer some sort of benefit without any requirement what those benefits might be, without any limit on the premiums they might charge, without any requirement who they might provide coverage to or exclude, all beginning in 2006.  We just heard about the great affordable plan we are going to offer today. This begins in the year 2006 and seniors who pay $4,500 a year for drugs will get $3,500 out of their pocket and a thousand from this bill. This is the pharmaceutical industry and insurance industry protection legislation.                          ____________________
