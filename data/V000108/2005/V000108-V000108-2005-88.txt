Speaker, it is with great pride and respect that I wish to commend Army Specialist Adam James Harting for his bravery in the field of battle and hiswillingness to fight for his country. Specialist Harting was assigned to the 3rd Battalion 69th Armor Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 42nd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, GA. Specialist Harting lost his life on Monday, July 25, 2005, in Samarra, Iraq. His sacrifice will be remembered by a community that has been struck hard by the devastating loss of one of its own.  A native of Portage, IN, Specialist Harting graduated from Portage High School. It came as no surprise to those who knew Specialist Harting that he would serve his country. A true patriot, his love for his country was evident from the time that he was a child. He wanted to help make a difference in the world. At a young age Adam and his twin brother, Alex, wrote contracts to their father promising they were going to join the military.  Specialist Harting wanted to be a hero. He began speaking to recruiters about joining the military. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 made his decision final. Specialist Harting felt tremendous pride for his country, and he was willing to endanger his own life to protect the lives of his fellow citizens. Soon after graduation he joined the military. In January 2003, at the age of 19, he was featured in Time magazine for being one of the youngest soldiers to arrive in Kuwait to serve in the conflict. He helped take a bridge over the Tigris River, and overran the airport in Baghdad. On July 25, 2005, less than 2 weeks after returning to the country for his third tour, Specialist Harting was killed when an explosive device detonated near the Bradley Fighting Vehicle that he was driving. His courage and heroism will always be remembered, and his sacrifice will forever live in the hearts and minds of those for whom he battled. He gave his life so that the freedoms and values he treasured could be enjoyed by those around the world.  Mr. Speaker, Adam's sacrifice for his country is a tribute to his dedication and willingness to put others before himself. He died not only while defending his fellow soldiers, but also defending his country and the Iraqi people from an oppressive regime. He is survived by his parents Jim and Katherine; stepmother Brenda; his twin brother, Alex, who served in the United States Air Force; and his siblings Mark, Josh, Jimmy, Tiffany, Tabitha, Hanna, and Leslie. Those who knew him best describe Adam as a kind, fun-loving person who always wanted to help others. He ultimately gave his life while protecting his fellow Americans and his heroism will never be forgotten.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Specialist Adam Harting. He will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country. Let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
