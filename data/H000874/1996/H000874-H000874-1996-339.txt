Speaker, we in Maryland are a proud lot. We take pride in the natural beauty of our State, in its diverse and flourishing business community, and in the variety and character of our citizens.  It is with this deeply instilled pride that I rise today to report the recent outstanding successes of one of the crown jewels in our State's educational system, the University of Maryland.  The University of Maryland at College Park is consistently noted as one of the finest institutions of higher learning in the country. To bolster this widely held view, the U.S. News and World Report's ``Graduate Rankings Issue'' hit the newsstands this spring to announce that an impressive number of the University of Maryland's graduate programs were ranked in the top tier. In fact, no university--public or private--in the mid-Atlantic region and few public universities in the country scored as consistently high as the University of Maryland in fields ranging from journalism, business, economics, and computer sciences to mathematics, physics, education, and engineering.  Specifically, the U.S. News and World Report survey ranked the public relations program in the college of journalism No. 1 in the Nation. The college of business and management was ranked in the top 25 in the country. The college of education and the A. James Clark School of Engineering, as well as the departments of computer science, mathematics and physics, were also highly ranked.  These achievements in excellence speak highly of the students and faculty thriving to achieve greatness and advance the threshold of knowledge.  But the excellence does not end there. It was nothing less than the national championship for the University of Maryland mock trial team. Competing with prestigious schools from across the country, including Yale, Cornell, Duke, Georgetown, and Carnegie Mellon, the Terps took home the top prize.  Not to be outdone, a team from the University of Maryland took top honors at this year's Texas Instruments DSP--digital signal processors--Solutions Challenge. The team of three beat out teams from MIT, Princeton, and the University of California-Berkley, among other schools to grab first prize. The team's successful design used a video compression system that compresses the large volume of data needed for the representation of video signals, making it possible to transmit video signals over communication channels, such as telephone lines.  And if Marylanders weren't already bursting with pride over these accomplishments, the Terps became the first ever back-to-back champions in women's division I lacrosse by defeating our neighbors, the Virginia Cavaliers. The win also extended their NCAA record for consecutive wins to 36.  Mr. Speaker, the University of Maryland is truly committed to excellence, both in the classroom and on the athletic field. These achievements make me extremely proud to have this fine institution in my district. I look forward to reporting further their scholastic and academic successes in the near future.                          ____________________
