  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the Republican image meisters and spin artists worked overtime for this week's production in Congress. They tapped a concern of average Americans over the growing litigiousness of our society, but with a breathtaking bait and switch. They have produced a bill beyond the dreams of the most corrupt financial swindler or the most irresponsible corporation. They call it the Common Sense Legal Reform Act.  In reality, it is the corporate dollar liability and litigation shield act.  No. 1, the loser pays. What does that mean? It means if you are an average citizen and you have been aggrieved by an exploding Pinto, if you wanted to sue Ford, you have to be ready to pay for all of Ford Motor Co.'s legal costs. Better think twice before you go to court to sue about an injury with products.  A blank check for bunko artists and new defenses for Wall Street. They forgot to inform you when you invest your pension in a bad deal. The new defense is, I forgot. It is actually written in the bill. It is almost a joke. I forgot. Thousand-dollar-an-hour lawyers and Wall Street forgot.  This is not for main street. It is for Wall Street.                          ____________________
