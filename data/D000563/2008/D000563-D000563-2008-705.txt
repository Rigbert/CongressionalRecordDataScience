I know the Republican minority set a record in the Senate with 62 filibusters last year. I don't know if the majority leader can tell us the ongoing number of filibusters from the Republicans at this point. I assume it is over 70 filibusters. The previous record was 62 filibusters in 2 years. Now we have had over 70 filibusters, and we are just into this new legislative year.  I ask the majority leader, in his experience in the Senate, does he ever recall a filibuster being mounted on a bipartisan bill that is a technical corrections bill related to highway projects and other building projects across the Nation, in both Democratic and Republican States?
