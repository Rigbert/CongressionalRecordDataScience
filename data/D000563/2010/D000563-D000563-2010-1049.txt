In my hometown of Springfield, IL, there is something called township assistance, when you have no place to turn. It is a fraction of the money you would receive for unemployment. It would barely provide money for food for these people.  Mrs. McCASKILL. I am assuming if they get to the point, then it is food stamps, right?
