 South Laurel Middle's dance team won a Universal Dance Association national title, marking the first time any dance team from South Laurel has won such an accolade.  Head coach Bettina Rogers recounts that ``they danced with all their hearts'' and gratefully recognized the support of the school and the friends, family, and community that surrounds these exceptional young ladies. The girls embody the Kentucky spirit of hard work and dedication, practicing up to 4 hours a day, 5 days a week, in preparation for their competition. The team, which formed in March, won a plethora of other titles this year, and it is clear that their hours of practice have paid off.  At this time, I would like to applaud and recognize the South Laurel Middle School Dance Team for their national title win and all their recent accomplishments, and I ask unanimous consent that an article extolling the team's achievements from a Laurel County-area newspaper, the Sentinel Echo, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Sentinel Echo, February 6, 2013]              CHAMPS! SLMS Dance Team Wins National Title                          (By Magen McCrarey)       Laurel County, KY.--South Laurel Middle's Dance Team broke      a Laurel County record last week and won a Universal Dance      Association (UDA) national title. The girls rode into school      on Tuesday morning on a City of London fire truck as the      entire school cheered them on as the Junior High Kick      National Champions.       ``This is the first time in Laurel County that any dance      team has won UDA nationals,'' said Bettina Rogers, head coach      for the team.       Rogers has been coaching the team for eight years and said      she couldn't be more     proud of her girls. South Laurel Middle's Dance Team has not      only won nationals this year, but also gained the title of      Kentucky Dance Coaches Organization Overall Middle School      Grand Champions, took first place in the Pom Division as well      as first place in the Open Division, JAMfest Dance Grand      Champions, and were the 2013 Big Blue Cheer and Dance      Challenge Grand Champions.       ``I believe that they danced with all their hearts and      souls on that stage, and I'm thankful for the support from      our school, administration and their parents,'' Rogers said.       ``Their dance was perfection, it was just incredible . . .      it was flawless,'' added Assistant Coach Jo Anna Sizemore.       The team of six eighth-graders, seven seventh-graders and      one sixth-grader took form in March following try-outs. The      girls practiced for the national competition five days a week      for approximately three hours, and sometimes four, Sizemore      said.       ``It means the world to me to get to spend five days a week      with my dance sisters, not only my sisters in dance, but my      sisters in Christ,'' said Megan Ford, an eighth-grade dance      team member.       ``I feel that our win was deserved, for all the hard work      we've done. But I also have to give all the glory to God for      keeping us safe as we go. I'm so thankful for all of these      girls for how we've been spending our time together and how      we've stuck together as a team--and not just as a team, but      as a family,'' said Hannah Sears, an eighth-grade dance team      member.       Six eighth-graders will be moving on to high school next      year, vacating their spots on the award-winning dance team.      Coach Rogers says try-outs will begin this March.                          ____________________
