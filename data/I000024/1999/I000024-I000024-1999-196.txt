President, following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 257, the missile defense bill. The majority leader has announced there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. However, Members are encouraged to come to the floor and offer amendments in relation to the missile defense bill. Any rollcall votes ordered today on amendments will be postponed to occur on Tuesday at a time to be determined by the two leaders.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
