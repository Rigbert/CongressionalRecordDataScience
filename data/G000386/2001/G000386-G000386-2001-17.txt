 I also understand that farmer owned cooperatives, including federated agricultural cooperatives, are exempt if they own a packing plant. But there is yet another situation in which some packers enter into joint ventures with farmer-owned cooperatives that has members which would supply the jointly owned packing plant.  It has never been our intent to prevent cooperatives from engaging in relationships with packers, and the amendment does not do that. For example, in Iowa, Excel, which is owned by Cargill, is in negotiations with a beef cooperative to build a packing plant to be owned by a joint venture. If that deal is completed, the actual packer would be the joint venture entity formed by Cargill/Excel and the beef cooperative. Co-op members who chose to participate in that endeavor can freely commit all or a portion of their cattle for slaughter without violating this amendment. The reason is that the packer in the exercises no operational control over livestock production. Rather, the package again has a mere contractual right to receive delivery of cattle that meet its specifically on graduate and quality. That contract may be a standards forward contract or marketing agreement, or the contract may take the form of a membership agreement between each farmer member and the beef cooperative. In either even, this amendment does not affect this joint venture arrangement.
