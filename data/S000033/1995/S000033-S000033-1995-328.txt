 Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment that saves human lives and I strongly urge its adoption.  In its current form, the moratorium does not apply to regulations that protect against imminent threats of serious illness, severe injury, or death or substantial endangerment to private property. As Mr. Waxman described, this is an absurd provision that gives greater protection to private property than to human life. I think this is a absurd set of priorities that needs to be changed.  Furthermore, the bill is misleading because it does not allow regulations that protect public health and safety. In fact, it threatens regulations implemented last year that:  Promote safer meat, poultry, and seafood;  Establish standards for water quality;  Set standards for disposal of nuclear and other hazardous waste;  Set motor vehicle safety standards for brake systems;  Amend performance standards for children's life jackets;  Set safety standards for baby walkers and children's toys; and  Standardize aviation rules.  Under the current definition of ``imminent threat of human health and safety,'' regulations that protect against activities that cause cancer, AIDS, or any other illness that has a latency period cannot be implemented. Today 1 in 3 of us will get cancer, and tragically 1 in 4 will die of it. Over 60 different occupations are at a documented risk of cancer, including farmers, petrochemical workers, asbestos workers, plastics manufacturers, and radiations workers. If this amendment is not adopted, the administration will not be able to respond to this expensive and debilitating health care crisis by implementing regulations that prevent cancer.  For instance, regulations that provide certification standards for mammography that are required by law will not be implemented unless this amendment is adopted. Regulations that prevent breast cancer and save lives should be implemented.  Indoor air regulations that protect against toxic exposures that ultimately cause asbestosis, lung cancer, or other serious respiratory illnesses, will also be prohibited if this amendment is not adopted. OSHA has been considering a rule banning smoking in workplaces nationwide, the FDA is considering to regulate cigarettes as a drug, and the Department of Health and Human Services is working on regulations that limit smoking in schools and other places where children congregate. All of these plans will be put on hold unless this amendment is adopted. Lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer. The immediate implementation of regulations like these could save many lives.  Also, nuclear safety standards for waste disposal, like the regulation allowing nuclear wastes to be transferred from sites in Idaho, Colorado and other States to a WIPP facility in New Mexico, will be retroactively canceled. Thus, more Americans could potentially be exposed to toxic substances that cause serious illness and death.  I simply do not see the sense in the current language which allows regulations that protect against deaths in 1995, yet prohibits regulations that protect against deaths in other years. If the drafters of this bill intended to protect against cancer and AIDs, then this intention should be made clear in the plain meaning of the definition of ``imminent threat to human health or safety.''  I strongly urge you to support this amendment which clearly states that we care enough about human lives to permit regulations that prevent serious illnesses, severe injuries, and death in any year and gives human lives as much protection as the bill gives to private property.                              {time}  1720
