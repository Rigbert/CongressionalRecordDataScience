 President I rise today with my good friend, Senator Mikulski, to discuss the Brilliant Anti--Armor Submunition BAT P\3\I. I want to express my disappointment with the $152 million cut taken by the committee from the President's budget request for the BAT program. Despite increased emphasis being placed on precision guided munitions, this cut will cripple a promising program that has shown progress in testing and is nearing the end of its development phase.
