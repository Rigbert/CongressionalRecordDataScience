President, I have worked with both the Senators from Missouri and Washington State for years. I know they have commitments to all these programs and have always worked in a bipartisan way. I would be willing to accept those assurances. I ask my chief cosponsor, the Senator from Minnesota, how he feels about this commitment from the chairman and ranking member of the TTHUD Appropriations subcommittee?
