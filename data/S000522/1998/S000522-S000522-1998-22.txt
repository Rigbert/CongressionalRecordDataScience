Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), our chairman, for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me begin by expressing my deep gratitude to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) for his courage and persistence in pushing this important bill through the long and arduous road to final passage.  Frankly, I am disappointed, and I know many of my colleagues are, that the Senate amendments have somewhat weakened our bill. For example, the House had given the President a great deal of flexibility in deciding whether to impose sanctions against governments that severely persecute religious believers, but the Senate stretches flexibility almost to the breaking point. I am informed that this was necessary in order to avoid a filibuster.  Even with the Senate amendments, let me say very clearly that the bill creates what I sincerely hope will be a strong and independent Commission on International Religious Freedom, which can be a voice on behalf of persecuted people around the world, and it provides modest but important safeguards for refugees and asylum seekers.  I just wanted to make it very clear that our Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, which I chair, will work with the Commission and watch closely to ensure that it acts boldly and in an unfettered way to expose religious persecution wherever and whenever it exists, even when it is not politically expedient.  Mr. Speaker, recently the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights held a hearing for the purpose of taking testimony from 5 witnesses to religious persecution: a Catholic from Pakistan, a Protestant from Cuba, a Muslim from East Turkestan, a Buddhist from Tibet, and a Ba'hai from Iran, each of whom had witnessed religious persecution firsthand.  Each of these people had seen close friends or relatives imprisoned, tortured, even executed for their faith, or had suffered such horrors themselves. Each presented compelling and recent evidence that religious persecution is not a problem that will go away if we just pretend that it does not exist.  This hearing was the latest in a series of hearings that our subcommittee has had, focusing in whole or in part on the persecution of religious believers. Other hearings focused on worldwide anti-Semitism; on the persecution of Christians around the world; on the 1995 massacre of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica; on the enslavement of black Christians in the Sudan; and on the use of torture against religious believers and other prisoners of conscience.  We have heard from Palden Gyatso, a Tibetan Buddhist monk who displayed--actually brought into the House, into our committee room--the instruments of torture that had been used against him by his communist jailers from the PRC.  We heard from Hasan Nuhanovic, a Muslim who unsuccessfully begged, begged the United Nations peacekeepers, UNPROFOR, not to turn his mother, father and brother over to the murderous Bosnian Serb militia.  We heard from a Russian Jewish member of parliament who observed,and I quote, that ``anti-Semitism was the first industry to be privatized in the post-Soviet Russia.''  We heard from the Karen refugees whose villages in Thailand were burned by the Burmese military dictatorship, which openly used their Christian religion as an excuse to conduct cross-border raids against them; and from Christians and Buddhists subjected to imprisonment and torture by the communist governments of China and Vietnam.  Wherever we hear from victims themselves, and whenever we hear from those victims, they make it very clear that the United States should press hard for an end to religious persecution abroad. This is important because the Clinton administration and some business people who had opposed the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act have suggested that by publicly demanding an end to the mistreatment of these people, we are more likely to hurt them than help them.  Personally, I believe it may be true occasionally in the short run that a totalitarian dictatorship used to being coddled by the United States Government will react with anger when we suddenly insist that they behave in a responsible and civilized fashion. This is true whether the issue is religious persecution, nuclear proliferation, or anything else.  In the long run, however, as we learned from the apartheid fight, these governments will act in their own self-interest. If we send them a strong and consistent message that economic and other benefits of a close relationship with the U.S. can be expected to flow to a government if and only if that government treats its own people decently, we are likely to save lives and promote human rights and freedom in the long run.                              {time}  1530  Whatever we do to other governments that persecute religious believers, it is also important that the U.S. put its own house in order. One way we can do this is to monitor and improve our treatment of refugees, with special reference to religious refugees. Unfortunately, in recent years, the U.S. commitment to refugees, both in the amount we spend on protection overseas and the number of refugees we admit into the U.S., has declined sharply.  In the last 4 years, our State Department has asked for and gotten a raise for itself every single year. Yet, the only major account in the Department that has not asked for an increase is the refugee budget. The administration's fiscal year 1999 budget request for refugees was $63 million lower than the amount we spent in fiscal year 1995. And this is when the world is absolutely awash in refugees.  The number of refugees admitted to the U.S. has gone down in this administration from 130,000 to 75,000 in only 4 years. These declining resettlement rates encourage first-asylum countries to forcibly repatriate refugees to countries where they face serious danger.  For example, in recent years we have seen Tibetan Buddhists forced back from Nepal into the hands of the Chinese Communists, and Iranian Christians and Bahais forced back to Iran from Turkey. We need to reverse that trend and restore the American tradition of a safe haven for the oppressed. In the words of President Ronald Reagan, the United States can and must be ``a shining city on a hill.''  Finally, I want to address those critics who suggest that by paying special attention to religious persecution, we somehow diminish the importance of those who have suffered persecution for other reasons. Nothing could be further from the truth, and it is no accident that those in Congress who have been the strongest in their support of persecuted believers also have stood up for all the other human rights issues as we have tried to deal with them in this body.  Again, I want to just ask all of my colleagues to support this legislation. It is a compromise; it does not go nearly as far as I would like to see it, as far as the House passed it, but it is certainly a step in the right direction.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), has spent 18 years fighting against religious persecution and deserves the lion's share of credit. He is the one who made this a reality today, and I want to thank him for his great work.
