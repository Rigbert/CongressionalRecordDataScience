President, I have to say this with my colleagues present. When the full history of Senate treatment of the nomination of Justice Ronnie White is understood, when the switches and politics that drove the Republican side of the aisle are known, the people of Missouri and the people of the United States will have to judge whether the Senate was unfair to this fine man and whether their votes served the interests of justice and the Federal courts.  I am hoping--and every Senator will have to ask himself or herself this question--the United States has not reverted to a time in its history when there was a color test on nominations.
