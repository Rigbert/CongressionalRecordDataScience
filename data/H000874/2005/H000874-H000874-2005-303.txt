Please convey the Democratic congratulations to the chairman and more importantly his wife, the mother.  Two last bills I will ask you about, Mr. Leader, and I appreciate the time we are taking on this. Reconciliation: There was a discussion about putting off reconciliation. We have put off reconciliation at least until the end of the month, as I understand it probably until October. Can you tell me whether or not we still anticipate reconciliation moving forward and, if so, are there going to be two bills? One the $35 billion in mandatory spending cuts among which is $10 billion in Medicaid cuts, and/or the $70 billion in tax cuts that was included in the budget reconciliation instructions.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding and for the question. The gentleman probably knows that I think today the Committee on the Budget has sent a notice to the House that they have postponed the process until the end of October because of what is facing us now. We thought it would be better to do that, and the Committee on the Budget agreed. And so this process will not even be started until the middle of October.  As the gentleman also knows, the budget that was passed by the House allows for two bills, one an entitlement reform bill and another a tax bill. We anticipate taking advantage of both and trying to reform entitlement spending so that real money is getting to real people that need it. And we also anticipate some sort of tax bill because we feel like, particularly under the present circumstances, to continue this good economy that we have got, we hope to enhance it even more.
