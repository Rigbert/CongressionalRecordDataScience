 Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I think the gentleman from New York [Mr. Lazio] dug himself a hole he did not have to dig. His speech was a great speech, but it had nothing to do with the amendment of the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Watt].  As I understand the Watt amendment, it says very simply, ``It is a goal of our Nation that all citizens have decent and affordable housing.'' Am I correct?
