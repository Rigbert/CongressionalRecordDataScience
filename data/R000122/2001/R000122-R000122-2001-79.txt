President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. Antoinette F. Downing.  Mrs. Downing, acclaimed architectural historian and founding member of the Providence Preservation Society, passed away on Wednesday morning, May 9, 2001 at the age of 96.  During her extraordinary lifetime, Antoinette believed in the intrinsic value of historic buildings, a revolutionary idea that changed Providence and Rhode Island. Mrs. Downing began her distinguished career as a scholar, researching and recording the State's historic structures. In 1937, her book Early Homes of Rhode Island was published, and remains the standard reference on 17th, 18th, and early 19th century building in the State. During the1930s and 1940s, Mrs. Downing raised a family and taught school. In the late 1940s, she returned to the study of architecture by assisting the newly founded Preservation Society of Newport County with a program to document and bring attention to the magnificent historic buildings in Newport. The effort produced the publication of The Architectural Heritage of Newport, Rhode Island, co-authored by Vincent J. Scully, Jr., in 1952.  In the 1950s', Mrs. Downing's scholarship turned into activism in the College Hill neighborhood of her adopted hometown of Providence, an area with many dilapidated and unappreciated historic buildings threatened by plans for demolition. Mrs. Downing and other residents, determined to maintain the character of this neighborhood, organized the Providence Preservation Society. A report, which she helped to research and write, College Hill, A Demonstration Study of Historic Area Renewal (1959), became the blueprint for the neighborhood's restoration and a national model for using historic preservation as a means of community renewal.  Through her hard work and conviction, Mrs. Downing made historic preservation part of every life in Rhode Island. Under her leadership, the Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission's statewide survey has identified about 50,000 historic buildings and sites in Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns. In all, more than 15,000 Rhode Island properties have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Furthermore, the reuse and rehabilitation of historic buildings has become an important part of the state's economy in the last decade.  Throughout Antoinette Downing's lifelong work has run the belief that our historic districts, structures, and sites are resources worth keeping. Her work has created for our time and coming generations a way of connecting to history while building links to the future. We remember and thank Antoinette for her tireless efforts to save our heritage. We are all the beneficiaries of her visionary leadership.                          ____________________
