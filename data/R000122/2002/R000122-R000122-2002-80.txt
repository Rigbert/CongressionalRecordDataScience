President, it gives me great pleasure to recognize an outstanding Rhode Islander, Stephen J. Anderson. Steve has distinguished himself with a rewarding career as a public school teacher and as an accomplished State Representative in the Rhode Island General Assembly.  In 1972, Steve began his teaching career in the Exeter West Greenwich School System where he has taught Social Studies, History and Geography. Even as a young child, Steve dreamed of being a teacher, and his enthusiasm, dedication and professionalism over the past three decades has had a profound effect on our community and in the lives of generations of young people.  Steve is described as a hardworking and imaginative teacher who has a special gift for relating to his students. He is modest, friendly and witty and easily earns their respect and admiration. He has a deep belief that every student can learn and that each has contribution to make. Moreover, Steve has been a leader in the School Department and has chaired the school improvement team and coordinated its professional development plan. He can be credited with bringing standards-based training to the school and has worked to provide graduate course work in support of these efforts. In addition to his classroom duties, Steve also devotes his time and talents as the Coach of the Jr. High Soccer Team and the Cross Country Team.  In 2000, Steve Anderson was honored as the recipient of both the Charles B. Willard Achievement Award and the Alumni Service Award from his alma mater Rhode Island College. The Charles B. Willard Award is presented to graduates who have brought honor to the College by distinguished service in their field. Additionally, the Alumni Service Award honors those who have made a contribution to the College by unselfishly devoting their time, talents and resources or to an individual who has made a contribution to the state or nation which reflects ideals of service to the community. Indeed, Steve Anderson epitomizes the spirit of both these coveted awards.  In the General Assembly, Steve has been a leader on education issues and successfully sought funding for National Board Certification for Professional Teaching Standards in Rhode Island, for innovative reading programs for pre-school children and for the Rhode Island Geographic Alliance.  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Stephen J. Anderson for his commitment to education and public service. He inspires us with his example of leadership, and I join with a grateful community in commending him for his efforts in the classroom, as a policy maker and as outstanding Rhode Island citizen.                          ____________________
