Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, again, I am not opposed to this motion to instruct, but I think that everybody ought to know what section 1071 of the Senate bill leaves out which is in the agreed-upon provision relative to family farms in the House-Senate compromise and the bankruptcy bill.  First of all, both 1071 and the compromise make Chapter 12 permanent. But what 1071 does not do is to increase the debt limits and index that debt limit to inflation. What is being proposed in the Senate version of the farm bill is going to have the debt limit be frozen on what it is now.  There also is a provision in the compromise that makes more flexible the percentage of income derived from farming for both spouses. And where one spouse works on the farm and another spouse has got a job off the farm, the current law which they are proposing to make permanent without anyimprovements, is going to make these types of farmers ineligible for Chapter 12, and they will have to go to either Chapter 11 or Chapter 13.                              {time}  1345  One of the improvements that has been agreed to in the bankruptcy conference is a prohibition on the retroactive assessment of disposable income, not in section 1071; and finally, the House-Senate bankruptcy conference has agreed to include family fishermen under Chapter 12 which is not in section 1071.  So even though I am supporting the gentleman's motion, I would really hope that the proponents of this motion would start putting pressure on the conferees over in the other side on the bankruptcy bill because we can make Chapter 12 much better by using the bankruptcy bill as a vehicle.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gekas), the principal author of the bankruptcy bill.
