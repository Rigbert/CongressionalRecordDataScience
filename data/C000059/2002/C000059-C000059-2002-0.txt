Speaker, I rise today in support of America's freedom, our Nation's security, and the resolution before us.  We have the responsibility to deal with Saddam Hussein, not only because we have the most to lose, but because it is American leadership that the world looks to in times of crisis. While it is always preferable to lead a large coalition, America must be willing to go with a few like-minded friends or even alone if the situation demands it.  Indeed, the United Nations is at a crossroads. Either it proves itself to be relevant to the 21st century or, in the words of Winston Churchill, it will be known that ``they decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all powerful for impotence.''  Our actions here in Congress speak to the world, and our resolve can onlystrengthen our case. For its own sake, the U.N. must act, not just engage in endless chatter.  That our Nation is willing to stand up to the most despotic and corrupt regime speaks not only to American leadership but to our vision for humanity. We desire only to see the peaceful development of Iraqi society and to witness Saddam Hussein's veil of insanity lifted from the minds of the Iraqi people.  We cannot sit idly by while Saddam Hussein stockpiles weapons of mass destruction to use against our allies and for distribution to those terrorists that would use them to attack America.  Mr. Speaker, Iraq poses a clear and present danger to the United States security and to the stability of a peaceful world; and, Mr. Speaker, in the words of Edmund Burke, ``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.''
