President, today, Senator Hagel and I introduced the bipartisan Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act. We were joined by Senator Feinstein. Our bill states that the consequences of global climate change represent a clear and present danger to the security of the United States.  For years, many of us have examined global warming as an environmental or economic issue. We also need to consider it as a security concern. Our bill begins this process by requiring a National Intelligence Estimate to assess the strategic challenges presented by the world's changing climate.  The National Security Strategy of 2006 stated that the United States now faces new security challenges, including ``environmental destruction, whether caused by human behavior or cataclysmic mega-disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or tsunamis. Problems of this scope may overwhelm the capacity of local authorities to respond, and may even overtax national militaries, requiring a larger international response. These challenges are not traditional national security concerns, such as the conflict of arms or ideologies. But if left unaddressed they can threaten national security.''  Global climate change represents one of the new environmental challenges outlined in the National Security Strategy that poses a threat to our national security. Failing to recognize and plan for the geopolitical challenges of global warming would represent a serious mistake.  A National Intelligence Estimate is a comprehensive review of a potential security threat that combines, correlates and evaluates intelligence from all of the relevant U.S. intelligence agencies. Various intelligence agencies--the CIA, NSA, the Pentagon, FBI, etc. must pool data, share perspectives and work together to assemble an accurate picture of threats to U.S. security.  Without an NIE, the various agencies may never have an opportunity to examine each other's data, and any differences or similarities between the reports could provide important information for policymakers.  In this legislation, we ask for the intelligence community to provide a strategic estimate of the risks posed by global climate change for countries or regions that are of particular economic or military significance to the United States or that are at serious risk of humanitarian suffering. This NIE will assess the political, social, agricultural, and economic challenges for countries and their likely impact.  Every region will be affected differently by global warming and it is critical that our intelligence and military communities are prepared to handle the situations most likely to arise.  For example, rising sea levels will have a profound impact on low lying coastal areas, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. This region is home to 58 percent of the world's population and 57 percent of the world's poorest population. More than 5 million people live in major cities that are in low lying coastal areas.  People in the Asia-Pacific region already endure coastal natural disasters, such as tsunamis, and inland flooding. Between 2001 and 2005, 62,273 people were killed annually by water related disasters in this region. This number is only going to increase as the world warms.  Africa is a place where changes in precipitation patterns will be particularly devastating. Many areas are already under enormous stress from drought and hunger. In 2005, 30 million people in 34 countries confronted food shortages as a result of drought. It is estimated that the droughts will become more severe and impact more people if the temperature continues to rise.  Environmental changes caused by global warming represent a potential threat multiplier for instability around the world. Scarce water, for example, may exacerbate conflict along economic, ethnic, or sectarian divisions.Water shortages, food insecurity, or flooding all of which may occur as a result of rising global temperatures could also displace people, forcing them to migrate. Many of the most severe effects of global warming are expected in regions where fragile governments are least capable of responding to them.  This NIE will examine these questions and more. It will also do something that we don't do often enough here in Congress: it will look beyond the near horizon of the next election or the next few years and require the intelligence community to think about these issues in the context of the next 30 years.  The bill we introduced today will also fund additional research by the Department of Defense in order to examine the impact of climate change on military operations.  Rising temperatures are altering the international environment. We need to be prepared for this new world.  We hope that our colleagues will join us in this bipartisan effort to assess the strategic implications of climate change. The scientific community has demonstrated that the earth is growing warmer. We are asking the intelligence community to analyze the geopolitical implications of these changes.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1018       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Climate Change      Security Oversight Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric      Administration, in 2007 the average annual temperature in the      United States and around the global is approximately 1.0      degree Fahrenheit warmer than at the start of the 20th      century, and the rate of warming has accelerated during the      past 30 years, increasing globally since the mid-1970s. The      fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on      Climate Change has predicted that the Earth will warm 0.72      degrees Fahrenheit during the next 2 decades with current      emission trends.       (2) The annual national security strategy report submitted      pursuant to section 108 of the National Security Act of 1947      (50 U.S.C. 404a) for 2006 states that the United States faces      new security challenges, including ``environmental      destruction, whether caused by human behavior or cataclysmic      mega-disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or      tsunamis. Problems of this scope may overwhelm the capacity      of local authorities to respond, and may even overtax      national militaries, requiring a larger international      response. These challenges are not traditional national      security concerns, such as the conflict of arms or      ideologies. But if left unaddressed they can threaten      national security.''.       (3) According to the fourth assessment report of the      Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, average      temperature increases of between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius over      preindustrial levels are projected to cause the sea level to      rise by between 2 and 4 meters by 2100 due to melting of the      Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.       (4) In 2007, more than 200,000,000 people live in coastal      floodplains around the world and 2,000,000 square kilometers      of land and an estimated $1,000,000,000,000 worth of assets      are less than a 1-meter elevation above sea level.       (5) An estimated 1,700,000,000 people in the world live in      areas where water is scarce and in 25 years that population      is projected to increase to 5,400,000,000. Climate change      will impact the hydrological cycle and change the location,      time of year, and intensity of water availability.       (6) The report of the World Health Organization entitled      ``The World Health Report 2002: Reducing Risks and Promoting      Healthy Life'' states that ``Effects of climate change on      human health can be expected to be mediated through complex      interactions of physical, ecological, and social factors.      These effects will undoubtedly have a greater impact on      societies or individuals with scarce resources, where      technologies are lacking, and where infrastructure and      institutions (such as the health sector) are least able to      adapt.''.       (7) Environmental changes relating to global climate change      represent a potentially significant threat multiplier for      instability around the world as changing precipitation      patterns may exacerbate competition and conflict over      agricultural, vegetative, and water resources and displace      people, thus increasing hunger and poverty and causing      increased pressure on fragile countries.       (8) The strategic, social, political, and economic      consequences of global climate change are likely to have a      greater adverse effect on less developed countries with fewer      resources and infrastructures that are less able to adjust to      new economic and social pressures, and where the margin for      governance and survival is thin.       (9) The consequences of global climate change represent a      clear and present danger to the security and economy of the      United States.       (10) A failure to recognize, plan for, and mitigate the      strategic, social, political, and economic effects of a      changing climate will have an adverse impact on the national      security interests of the United States.
