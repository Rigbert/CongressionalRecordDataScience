Speaker, I thank the gentleman for organizing this Special Order tonight, and certainly the people of New Jersey have sent the right Member here to fight this great fight. It is a privilege to stand here also with the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott), who is such a critical member of our Committee on Ways and Means and knows more about this probably than any other Member of the House, and has fought so hard to maintain the Medicare program that our Democratic forebears created, and we proudly stand on their shoulders. To stand here with both you gentlemen tonight is truly an honor.  I wanted to mention, as the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) said, the pharmaceutical companies around this Nation are making unbelievable profits off the pocketbooks of our senior citizens and theirfamilies, and to also mention that the reason we have such a terrible bill before us in the House and why we were denied the opportunity to offer a Democratic alternative, we were not even given a chance to debate our alternative, is because these very same pharmaceutical companies helped elect the people who have created this bill for the Congress.  And an organization like PhRMA gave 95 percent of its political contributions last year to one political party, the party that prevailed by one vote here in this House 2 weeks ago in getting this very flawed bill before us. Now, the Republican Party has produced a bill that is really a trick on the senior citizens of this country. It is a trick because of the language they use in the title that does not bear out real substance on the inside. Let me give a couple examples just to refine what my colleagues have talked about tonight.  I think the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) talked about the Democratic bill, which we were not allowed to offer, had a maximum premium per month for our seniors of $25. The Republican bill that passed starts out at $35 a month, but it does not have a cap so we really do not know what that monthly premium is going to be.  The Democratic plan is a defined benefit plan. You know exactly what it costs, and you know exactly what you get from it. The Republican plan is what we call a defined contribution plan. You only get so much, and then you do not know how much more you are going to have to pay. It is very unpredictable.  In the Democratic plan, which we were not allowed to offer, and imagine, a measure that affects over 40 million Americans and we were not even allowed to offer our alternative. I say to the majority, what are they afraid of? The deductible under the Democratic plan is $100 for seniors. Under the Republican plan, it is $250. Under the Democratic plan after you have paid your $2,000, if you reach that level which we call a catastrophic level, then you do not pay anything after that. We pick up the costs, the people of the United States through the premiums. Under the Republican plan, they make seniors pay an additional $1,500 beyond the $2,000 cap that we have in our bill, which means that it is going to cost seniors much more money under that plan.  So you pay a higher monthly cost, and we are not really sure how high that will go under the Republican plan. You pay a higher deductible. You have to pay costs over $2,000, up to $3,500, and the reference that the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) made to the fact that the Democratic bill provided for negotiated pricing for different drugs, the Republican plan prohibits us from negotiating the best price like we do already for the Department of Veterans Affairs and for the Department of Defense.  This is just a chart of some of the drugs that people buy. Norvasc, seniors in my district are very familiar with Norvasc which is used for high blood pressure. The general price at a drugstore is $182.99. The Canadian price is $152.82. Through our negotiated pricing through the Department of Veterans Affairs, we have gotten a price of $102.11. We wanted to get the same kind of negotiated pricing in the bill that was debated 2 weeks ago. We were not allowed to even offer the amendment.  I went up to the Committee on Rules, which met after midnight so nobody in America could really see what was going on, and we had to wait until 4:30 in the morning only to be denied the opportunity to offer this best-price amendment. We were trying to get not just Canadian prices, but even better prices on many of these drugs based on negotiated pricing. Our amendment was not even allowed to be offered.  So the Republican plan is really a tricky plan, and you have to read the fine print. The differences are very striking.  Let us say you live in a part of the country that has no plans. Let us say these private insurers who do not seem to be flocking to provide regular coverage under Medicare, if a plan does not exist in your part of the country, under the Democratic plan there is a fall-back government prescription drug plan that you can opt for. It requires that in the bill so no part of America would remain uncovered. The Republican bill does not provide that kind of fall-back where two private drug plans might fail to emerge, and we know they probably will fail to emerge.  I was home over the weekend talking to seniors, and one woman said, I belong to an existing HMO in this community for prescription drugs, but right now my coverage stops at $600. I cannot get anything beyond that. If my drugs cost more than $600, I have to pay that. So the current plans that exist are very, very inadequate.  I wanted to just take a moment to give, again, very specific information about the difference between the Democratic bill that we were not allowed to offer and the Republican bill which passed here by one vote in the middle of the night as they twisted arms, and we could see it happening right down that aisle.  If a senior's yearly drug costs are $1,500 for prescription drugs, their out-of-pocket expenses under the Democratic plan would be $680. Their out-of-pocket costs under the Republican plan would be $920, which means that seniors whose drug costs are up to $1,500 a year would pay $240 more a year under the Republican plan.  If a senior's yearly drug costs are $3,000 a year, their out-of-pocket expenses under the Democratic plan would be $980, but their out-of-pocket costs under the Republican plan would be $2,020. So the Republican plan costs seniors $1,040 more if their drug expenses go up to $3,000. What if their drugs cost $4,500 a year? Under the Democratic plan, their out-of-pocket costs would be $1,280; but under the Republican plan, their out-of-pocket costs would be $3,520. So the Republican plan costs seniors $4,500 more if their drug costs go up to $4,500 a year. So the sicker they get, the more it costs them under the Republican plan.  I must say, I have a lot of seniors in my district and they do not earn more than $8,000 under Social Security. The Republican plan is an unaffordable plan. What if you are so sick that your drug costs are over $12,000? Under the Democratic plan, your out-of-pocket costs would be $2,300. Under the Republican plan, your costs would be $3,920. So the Republican plan would cost seniors in that case $1,620 more a year.  So under the Democratic bill, as I have explained here, we tried to provide for negotiated pricing to match the Canadian prices and even better them in some instances. We were not allowed the opportunity to offer our amendment, and that is a major cost-saving amendment because it would use the power of group buying which every housewife in America knows about. Anybody who does shopping knows if you buy 12 cans of something, it is less expensive per unit than if you buy one. We are trying to do the same for 40 million people across this country. Imagine the savings involved, and the premium costs are less and guaranteed under the Democratic plan. Under the Republican plan, they start at $35 and raise it. The deductible is more affordable under the Democratic plan; under the Republican plan, it is more expensive.  If I can just perhaps summarize why the Republican plan might be so bad and why it really is a trick on our seniors, it is because fundamentally the Republican Party has never supported Social Security and Medicare. Back when Social Security was first created by this Congress long before I was born, and we go back to the Committee on Ways and Means votes, there were no Republican votes to create Social Security back in the 1930s when you go into the record of what happened back in that Committee on Ways and Means room.  When it got to the floor, enough people were embarrassed that they voted for it. Some did, not all. But back in committee where the real decisions are made, there was not a single Republican vote in the committee for Social Security.  On Medicare, when President Johnson fought for the creation of Medicare, and I was a young girl then, Senator Bob Dole said in 1995, ``I was there fighting the fight, voting against Medicare in 1965 because we knew it would not work.''  Well, for several generations of senior citizens, indeed, it has worked. It has helped keep American families from going to the poor house and going bankrupt; and it has given American seniors a level of security they neverknew before in American history. To me, Social Security and Medicare are the aorta of the Democratic Party of which I am proud to be a member.  I look at some of the other quotes that have come from contemporary Republicans. One of the Members from the other body in charge of Republican policy said back in May as this debate got underway, ``Congress should gradually end the traditional Medicare program as an option for new beneficiaries in the future, leaving them to choose from a variety of private plans. I believe the standard benefit, the traditional Medicare program has to be phased out.'' This was in The New York Times, May 21, 2003.  In this body, the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), according to MSNBC stated, ``To those who would say that our bill would end Medicare as we know it, our answer is we certainly hope so. Old-fashioned Medicare isn't very good.'' He said that June 25, 2003.  I would just like to say to the gentleman from California and to the gentleman from the other body, for our family and for 114,000 Ohioans in my district and for over 1.5 million Ohioans around our Buckeye State, we believe Medicare should be here to stay. We are here to strengthen it, not to weaken it; and we do not want to trick our seniors. We want to provide them with a guaranteed, affordable benefit that is voluntary if they wish to participate in something that is available to all.  It is a great pleasure to be here this evening to put on the record the truth and the actual costs of both plans and to say to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) thank you so very much for allowing me to join you this evening and to say I was somewhat offended this week when we came back here and our colleagues yesterday passed a measure in this House to give Members of Congress better prescription drug coverage than we are willing to give every single senior citizen that is out there.                              {time}  2230  Members of Congress make over $150,000 a year. Some do not accept all of that. A lot of people donate some of that to charitable causes. But what is interesting is that the Republican majority in this House snuck through a bill here yesterday that would actually ask senior citizens to pay 100 percent of their drug costs, between $2,000 and $3,500 a year, but yet they did not apply that same measure to themselves the other night. They are going to take that cost away from themselves. It is really a tragedy. Why should Members of Congress exempt themselves from the same regimen that they are asking of senior citizens across this country who do not earn anything like $150,000 a year? It is simply wrong.  I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) for allowing me to participate with him this evening and for his continuing leadership on this really critical, I call it aorta, issue for our country and our party.
