President, today I want to honor longtime Oregon journalist Steve Forrester.  Steve has retired as editor and publisher of the Daily Astorian. He will remain president and chief executive officer of the EO Media Group, which owns the Astorian, as well as several other newspapers, including publications in eastern Oregon, but we will no longer benefit from his day-to-day leadership at the Astorian.  I have known Steve for nearly 40 years, since he was a reporter in Washington, DC, and I was a young Member of the House. In all that time, Steve has never hesitated to ask the tough questions and to be fiercely devoted to local journalism's principles and importance. The theme running consistently throughout Steve's career has been always to ensure local readers understand the impact of decisions and policies made in Congress, the statehouse, and city hall.  I particularly wanted to honor Steve today because, over the Fourth of July recess, I will be home in Oregon highlighting the foundational freedoms of the First Amendment with events celebrating those freedoms of religion, speech, assembly, and the press.  The Founding Fathers knew those First Amendment freedoms were core to our country and to creating the values that have made America a destination for all who hunger to be free of fear and liberated to pursue their dreams. As the child of parents who fled the Nazis for refuge in the United States, I learned early on about the importance of these freedoms. As the son of a reporter, I also learned especially about the importance of the freedom of the press.  Because Steve has contributed so much to a vibrant and free press in our great State of Oregon, I will be proud to present him on July 1, in Astoria, with a ``Go Fourth'' award. Steve's career makes him richly deserving of this award and an inspiration for Oregon journalists for generations to come.  I suspect Steve will exercise his self-deprecating modesty and question why he is worthy of such attention. I know Steve would much rather shine the spotlight on others, but the bottom line is I want Oregon to recognize his enormous and long-lasting contributions to making our State a better place to live and to making all of us as Oregonians better-informed citizens.                          ____________________
