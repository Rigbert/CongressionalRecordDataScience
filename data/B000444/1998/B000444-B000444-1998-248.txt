 President, there is absolutely no evidence today that expanding NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary would do anything to exacerbate the problem we all are concerned about--the proliferation of nuclear capability.  The truth is, notwithstanding the knowledge on the part of Russia that we are going to expand, they continue to destroy their nuclear weapons under the Nunn-Lugar agreement, they have endorsed and have ratified the CWC agreement, and they have committed to take up the START II agreement. Nothing we have done relative to expansion has any negative impact on the continued cooperation between the United States and Russia to deal with the threat of nuclear warfare.  I respectfully suggest that to vote for this amendment turns over the future of what we think the defense architecture of Europe should be to an organization of which we are not a part, and that is the EU. It says that no one can join NATO unless they are first a member of the EU. Why would we turn our fate over to an organization of which we are not a member? I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.
