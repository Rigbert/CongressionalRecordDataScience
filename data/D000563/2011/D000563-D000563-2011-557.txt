When we take a look at the most powerful special interest groups in Washington, we have to put the banking industry near the top, if not on the top, of the ladder. Throughout my career I have tackled them on the floor. I can recall many years ago, brandnew to the Senate, when I said we ought to change the banking laws so we would put an end to the so-called subprime mortgages. I was in a debate with Phil Gramm of Texas, who said at that time that if the Durbin amendment passed, it would be the end of the subprime mortgage business. I lost by one vote. If I would have prevailed, history might have been a little different. The subprime mortgage mess created an economic downturn from which we still suffer.  I stood up as well when it came to this foreclosure crisis and said that at some point these banks have to be reasonable. You just can't take homes away from people, board them up, and watch them deteriorate into nothing. You have to give people a fighting chance to stay in their homes. I said at the end the bankruptcy court should have the last word on that. The banking industry, the credit unions, the community banks opposed me. Take a look across America today at the foreclosed homes, in Chicago, in Aurora, in Springfield, all across my State, and across this Nation. The outcome, years after I lost that battle, certainly does not speak to a stronger America because of these foreclosures. The banking industry beat me on that.  Last year, fighting for these small businesses, retailers, I stood up and said: Somebody has to step up here and argue that there ought to be fairness in the fees they charge to businesses and consumers across America. We rallied 64 Senators--a bipartisan group--in support of that.  The banks want a second run at this. They want to take this game into overtime. They want to come back today and count their friends here and hope they can come up with 60 in the hopes that if the big banks and credit card companies can win this battle, we will leave them alone, we will not ask hard questions about the interchange fees that are charged. I am asking my colleagues in the Senate not to give the banks this overtime, extra-time victory. Give the victory to consumers. They have precious few on the floor of the Senate. Stand up for small businesses that do create jobs across America, and give them a chance to create jobs in this country by not being overcharged by the credit card networks and the biggest banks in America.  How many of us have come to the floor and said small business is the key to economic recovery? If you believe it, if you mean it, vote against the Tester-Corker amendment. That amendment is a blow to small and large businesses alike, large retailers and merchants alike, all across America. They stand in support of my effort to have a reasonable interchange fee on debit card transactions and to make sure they have a fighting chance to be profitable, to expand their businesses, and to hire more employees. That would be good for economic recovery. A vote for the Tester-Corker amendment unfortunately would be a win for the banks at the expense of an economy that desperately needs our help and support today.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
