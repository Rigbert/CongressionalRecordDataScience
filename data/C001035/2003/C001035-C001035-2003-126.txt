President, at a time when our men and women in uniform are fighting valiantly to bring peace and opportunity to an oppressed people and ensure the security of our homeland, I am pleased to introduce the Selected Reserve Educational Assistance Act of 2003 to extend the opportunity of higher education to many of those very same men and women in uniform. This legislation provides our National Guard and Reserve personnel, hundreds of thousands of whom are currently mobilized, deployed, and fighting around the globe, with educational opportunities as intended by the Montgomery GI bill. I am pleased that my colleagues, Senators Tom Daschle, Tim Johnson, and Bill Nelson, have joined as cosponsors.  Through this legislation, we week to promote both service to country and education in a way that is both logical and fair. Members of our National Guard and Reserve are members of our communities. The skills they learn from military service are reflected in the positions of leadership they assume among us. These citizen-soldiers have demonstrated their commitment to serve and as members of the ``total force'' deserve opportunities to further improve themselves through the civilian educational opportunities the Montgomery GI bill promotes. Service and education are prerequisites of a strong, vibrant democracy. This legislation seeks to further this combined effort.  The original GI bill, known as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, was enacted in 1944. That bill provided a $500 annual education stipend as well as a $50 subsistence allowance. As a result of this initiative, 7.8 million World War II veterans were able to take advantage of post-service education and training opportunities, including more than 2.2 million veterans who went on to college. My own father was among those veterans who volunteered for the war, fought bravely, and then returned to college with assistance from the GI bill.  Since the 1940's various versions of servicemen's education assistance have allowed millions of veterans to take advantage of educational opportunities. Over time, however, inflation and the escalating costs of higher education have eroded the value of those educational benefits. During the 107th Congress with the enactment of Public Law 107-103 Senator Johnson and I, along with many of our colleagues, made great strides returning value to educational assistance benefits available for active component service members and veterans. More remains to be done.  The United States military is an all volunteer force. In times of peace and prosperity and in times of trial, we rely on young men and women to come forward of their own accord to stand up for our collective defense. Though service to country and patriotism, particularly in times of crisis, factor into recruiting this all volunteer force, benefits still do and ought to matter. We must remain vigilant, as we are constantly recruiting new members of our armed forces, ensuring the benefits these individuals receive from military service are commensurate with the service they render to this nation.  At its inception in 1985, the Reserve Montgomery GI bill program, had been pegged at 47 percent of basic active component Montgomery GI bill benefits. During the ensuing 18 years, the parity of the reserve program with its active duty counterpart has slipped. At present the Chapter 1606 program, Selected Reserve Montgomery GI bill, is only about 28 percent of the Chapter 30 program. This legislation attempts to bring the reserve program back in line with the active component benefit.  In each of the last three years over 75,000 National Guard and Reserve members have taken advantage of Veterans Administration educational benefits for pursuing their educational or vocational objectives. While those citizen-soldiers currently mobilized may become eligible for veterans benefits, we must correct the disparity between the active and reserve Montgomery GI bill programs. Only two benefit increases have been legislated in the reserve program since its inception in 1985, other than cost-of-living increases. The reserve Montgomery GI bill benefit for full-time study stands at $276 compared to $985 per month for the Title 38 program. This legislation will bring the reserve Montgomery GI bill benefit to $428 per month in fiscal year 2004 and $473 per month in fiscal year 2005 and continue out-year increases in accordance with advances in the consumer price index.  The Military Coalition comprised of 33 member organizations representing over 5.5 million veterans and family members endorses rate increases and funds for the reserve Montgomery GI bill program so that National Guard and Reserve service members can reap an educational return on their voluntary service to country.  It is time to return reserve educational assistance benefits to the level intended by the original drafting of the Reserve Montgomery GI Bill. Coupling and reinforcing service with higher education will pay dividends for our future security, strength and prosperity. This legislation fulfills the promise made to our Nation's service members, helps with recruiting and retention, strengthens the economy, and partly offsets the increasing costs of higher education.  I urge all Members of the Senate to join me in support of the Selected Reserve Educational Assistance Act of 2003 and quickly pass this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 812       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
