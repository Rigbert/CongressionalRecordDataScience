 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a distinguished Kentuckian, a self-described ``jack of all trades'' who has come through for his family, friends and neighbors time and again. Whether it is as a teacher, a law-enforcement officer, a fireman, a father, a grandfather or a great-grandfather, people know they can always rely on Mr. Ernest Ray Rudder.  Mr. Rudder--or, to those who know him, E.R.--has worn many hats throughout his life. Born in Laurel County, KY, in 1947, E.R. attended Bush School and Berea College, then transferred to Cumberland College where he earned his bachelor of science degree in biology and chemistry. During his college years he also married his childhood sweetheart Judy Hacker, and they have been married now for 44 years.  E.R. began work as a teacher, teaching all subjects, including chemistry and biology, in Clay, Jackson and Laurel Counties. He also worked for many years as a school assistant principal and principal. In 2000, E.R. retired fromteaching after more than three decades of service.  But an easy retirement spent in a rocking chair was not for E.R. He was one of the charter members of the Bush Volunteer Fire Department, organized in 1975. While still serving as a school principal, he had worked occasionally as a sworn-in deputy for the Laurel County Sheriff's Office, transporting inmates. Now in retirement, he renewed his commitment to law enforcement. Recently promoted to administrative sergeant, he has worked for the Laurel County Sheriff's Office for the last 2\1/2\ years under two sheriffs.  ``No matter how small the complaint, it is a legitimate concern for them,'' E.R. says of the people he works to serve and protect. And luckily for E.R., he has not gotten into any, as he likes to call them, ``bugtussles'' of the dangerous variety.  E.R. has also worked as a school bus driver, an assistant manager at a restaurant and as a chemist for the London Utility Commission. He is a member of Providence Baptist Church and a deacon there since 1985. When his wife Judy is asked what E.R. does in his spare time, she answers, ``He has no spare time.''  Kentucky is lucky to have men like Ernest Ray Rudder, who works hard to protect and provide for his family and his community. I am sure his wife Judy, his children, his grandchildren and his great-grandson are very proud.  Mr. President, the Sentinel Echo recently published an article illuminating Mr. Ernest Ray Rudder's life and his career. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From Sentinel Echo Laurel County, Feb. 21, 2011]                Rudder Has Lived Every Lil' Boy's Dream                            (By Sue Minton)       Have you passed someone on the street or in the mall,      looked at them in church or school, or just seen them out      your car window and wonder where have they been or where are      they going, and what is their story?       It's easy to forget that everyone has a story to tell and      when we take the time to ask questions and listen, we find      that every person has a fascinating story to tell and a      unique perspective from which to tell it.       Ernest Ray Rudder's--E.R. to those who know him best--story      began May 14, 1947 when he was born, at home, to Birchell and      Maxine Rudder, the oldest of three children.       ``I was born in a little white house on East 80, grew-up on      Tom Cat Trail, and moved back to East 80,'' he said.       Rudder attended Bush School graduating in 1965 and attended      Berea College for 1\1/2\ years.       He, along with his new bride transferred to Cumberland      College graduating in 1969 with a bachelor of science degree      in biology and chemistry.       Rudder and his childhood sweetheart, Judy Hacker, will be      married 44 years in May.       ``She was only girl I ever dated,'' he said. ``We met in      Sunday School class.''       Judy said they met when she was in the eighth grade. E.R.      said they met before that.       ``But I didn't notice you before then,'' Judy said      laughing.       ``I noticed you,'' he said. ``With your pigtails and big      brown eyes.''       ``Her mom, Granny Hacker, was my Sunday School teacher, and      Judy was in the class.''       After receiving his degree, Rudder began his career as an      educator in Clay County, teaching all subjects to seventh and      eighth graders at Paces Creek. ``This was an experience,'' he      recalled. ``I had some famous people in the class, like Gary      Gregory, the current Clay County Commonwealth Attorney, for      one. And another was the late Cecil Darrell Hooker.''       Rudder remembers there being seven seventh graders and 17      eighth graders in the class. ``I was 21-years-old and one of      the eighth-grade students was 18.''       Rudder taught at Paces Creek for half-a-year and the      following two years were spent teaching in Jackson County.      After which he returned to Laurel County, teaching chemistry      and biology for 13 years at Laurel County High School.       ``I absolutely loved teaching. I loved the part where you      could teach and actually see the students experience the      learning part,'' he said. ``And when you could really have      fun teaching.''       ``When you saw them light-up, you knew they `got-it','' he      added. ``And the students learned because they wanted to, not      because they had to know it on some test.''       Rudder said some of his former students are now doctors,      attorneys, teachers and Pentagon officers, and unfortunately      some who wear orange jumpsuits.       After 15\1/2\ years, Rudder left the classroom for a      principal's position at the former Felts Elementary. For 16      years he held principalships at Felts Elementary (four      years), assistant principal at Laurel County High School      (three years), and Sublimity Elementary (nine years).       Rudder retired in 2000 after 31\1/2\ years of teaching and      caring for the students of Laurel County.       Rudder recalls the ``editorial'' he included in the last      newsletter he prepared for his staff and students at      Sublimity Elementary. ``I told them `Every little boy wants      to be a policemen, fireman or teacher and I have been all      three. I have been a volunteer fireman for over 30 years and      a part-time policeman. So I have succeeded at what all little      boys dream of a I threw 30 some years of teaching in there      for fun.''       Rudder was one of the charter members of Bush Volunteer      Fire Department that was organized in 1975. Except for a      couple of years he has been secretary/treasurer.       And during his principalship at Sublimity Elementary he      worked occasionally with the Laurel County Sheriff's Office      transporting inmates.       ``I was sworn-in as a deputy in 1994,'' he said.       ``And, I once ran for sheriff,'' he added.       Retirement for Rudder was short lived, lasting less then      two weeks.       ``I knew when I retired from the school system that I      wanted to work with the sheriff's department,'' he said.      ``But, I planned on taking some time off. I left school on      June 21 and started at the S.O. July 5.''       Ruder has worked for the past two sheriffs and the last      2\1/2\ years he has worked the roads. He was recently      promoted to administrative sergeant, and some of his duties      include walk-in reports, accident reports, sending reports to      Frankfort and logging, cataloging and transporting evidence.       ``I enjoy answering calls, reacting with and helping the      people when you can,'' he said. ``I try to help the S.O. have      a good image and know that it is serving the people.''       When Rudder was asked about taking the administrative      position he said he was not dumb enough to think that a 63-     year-old man should be out there chasing young punks. ``You      are inviting trouble,'' he added. ``And I have been lucky, I      have not got into any bugtussles, but I have talked several      down.''       Rudder said there is something new everyday. ``A lot of      times you will hear the same story but from different people.      You never know what or who is going to walk in. No matter how      small the complaint, it is a legitimate concern for them.''       ``People think that everything they see on NCIS or CSI we      can do,'' he added. ``I tell them `if Gil Grissom was here,      it is untelling what we could do, but in the real world,      we're not able to do all that'.''       ``Like teaching, I absolutely love working for the S.O.,''      he added.       Educating and protecting the citizens of Laurel County was      only two of Rudder's jobs.       During his teaching career he also drove a school bus, was      assistant manager at Burger Queen and was a chemist for the      London Utility Commission.       Rudder drove a school for 13 years, mostly the Marydell      route.       ``But, my first route was in the Sinking Creek area,'' he      added. ``Judy took over my route when I quit and drove for      seven years and today Kay Bowling (Rudder's sister) drives      the route.''       Rudder remembers his Uncle George driving basically the      same bus route 50 years ago.       With the jobs Rudder has had and his work schedule today      when asked what he does in his spare time, Judy was quick to      answer, he has no more spare time.''       But Rudder said he doesn't feel like he is pushed. ``I      would go crazy if I didn't have something to do.''       ``I like to read history and historical books,'' he said.      ``Over Christmas I read George W. Bush's new book ``Decision      Points.'' Loved it. I'm now reading ``15 Stars.'' I watch the      History Channel and classic westerns, ``Pawn Stars'' and      ``The Pickers'' with a cop show or two thrown in.''       ``He is also clerk, treasurer and Sunday school director at      church,'' Judy added.       Rudder has been a member of Providence Baptist Church since      1964 and a deacon since 1985.       When asked how he keeps finances from the church, fire      department and home straight, he replied laughing ``Judy      takes care of all personal finances, and I take care of the      rest.''       Rudder said his biggest regret was not being around much      when his daughter, Dawn, was growing up. And his biggest      rewards are his grandchildren and Easton, his great-grandson.       ``Dawn and Marc have grown up so fast,'' he said. ``And      what can you say about your grandchildren and great-     grandchild. And the hardest thing I've ever faced was when we      lost Susan, our 18-year-old granddaughter.''       Rudder describes himself as a ``Jack of all trades and a      master of none.''                          ____________________
