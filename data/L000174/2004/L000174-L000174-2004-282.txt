It was well noted here before all Senators. Nobody, either Republican or Democrat, made the normal motion to strike that was done when you have a part to which you object. The Senator from Virginia is right that this is slightly different. That one was just for Iraq. This includes Afghanistan and elsewhere and does not contain a sunset provision.  I must admit that we are somewhat inclined to do that, especially after hearing of these e-mails that have just been made public. We are not talking about somebody who shows up and provides five dozen baseball caps to one of our military groups somewhere around the world. We are talking about people getting a billion dollars, with no-bid, no-competition contracts. I think we ought to at least be able to look at them and make sure they are spending our money correctly.
