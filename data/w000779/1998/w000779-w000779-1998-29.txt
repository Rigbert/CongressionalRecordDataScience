What we are saying in this bill is that we are trying to deal with a different set of economic issues, and if we don't deal with these questions of Internet policy now, I and the Senator from Arizona submit that we will be dealing, just as we are now with the mail-order questions, with these issues with respect to the Internet. Let us try to get out in front of these issues facing the digital economy rather than duplicating the mistakes we made with respect to mail-order and catalog sales.  I thank the Senator for the time.
