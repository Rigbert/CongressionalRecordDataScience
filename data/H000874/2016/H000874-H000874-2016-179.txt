Speaker, I had the privilege of meeting on March 30 with William ``Bill,'' Dawson of Waldorf; Maryland, in the Fifth Congressional District. Bill is the last living member of the first class of Naval Special Warfare Operators to train for duty with the U.S. Naval Combat Demolition Units that were the precursor to today's Navy SEAL teams. He is ninety-one years old and a retired Washington, D.C. firefighter who remains deeply proud of his service to our nation and to his community. I was honored to receive from him a copy of his book Before They Were SEALS They Were Frogs, which recounts the story of the Naval Combat Demolition Units during the Second World War and his own service in the Pacific.  First created in 1943 and led by Lt. Draper L. Kauffman, the first Naval Combat Demolition Units were tasked with the reconnaissance of amphibious landing sites and the demolition of enemy obstacles that would hinder the advance of invading Allied forces. After their specialized training at Fort Pierce in Florida, including the series of grueling tests that is now considered to have been the first-ever ``Hell Week,'' the first Navy ``Frogmen'' deployed to the European and Pacific theaters of operation in support of combat operations.  Navy Frogmen were instrumental in clearing obstacles on Omaha Beach and Utah Beach during the Normandy invasion on D-Day in 1944, and many were killed or wounded performing their dangerous missions. In the Pacific, Frogmen demonstrated similar gallantry during the operations to liberate the Philippines, Guam, Borneo, and many other places that had been occupied by Japanese forces and that were instrumental in the advance toward victory. Frogmen were training for cold-water operations in preparation for an anticipated invasion of the Japanese home islands when the war ended.  The Underwater Demolition Teams that succeeded the initial Naval Combat Demolition Units saw action in Korea and Vietnam, and it was in the early 1960's that the Navy decided to transition them into the Navy SEAL teams we know today, in a reflection of their broadening role beyond the water's edge. Americans are grateful for the extraordinary service and sacrifices of our Navy SEALs, among the most skilled, experienced, and courageous to serve in defense of our nation. I'm proud to represent many Navy personnel and veterans in Maryland's Fifth District, which is home to Pax River Naval Air Station, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division, and Webster Field. I join in thanking Bill Dawson and all of those who were our nation's first Navy Frogmen for their gallant service in defense of freedom and for their crucial role in the history of U.S. Naval Special Operations.                          ____________________
