Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 409) condemning the Government of Zimbabwe's ``Operation Murambatsvina'' under which homes, businesses, religious structures, and other buildings and facilities were demolished in an effort characterized by the Government of Zimbabwe as an operation to ``restore order'' to the country, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 409       Whereas on May 19, 2005, the Government of Zimbabwe      launched ``Operation Murambatsvina'', translated from the      Shona language as ``Operation Drive Out the Trash'', in major      cities and suburbs throughout Zimbabwe in an effort that it      characterized as an operation to ``restore order'' to the      country;       Whereas hours after the Governor of the Reserve Bank of      Zimbabwe called for an end to the parallel market, Operation      Murambatsvina began in the city of Harare and subsequently in      other urban areas, such as the city of Bulawayo, ostensibly      to oust illegal vendors and eliminate illegal structures;       Whereas Operation Murambatsvina was carried out as an      indiscriminate demolition of the homes and livelihood of      thousands of Zimbabwean citizens already suffering from a      protracted economic and political crisis brought on by poor      policy directives by the Government of Zimbabwe that forced      masses of rural dwellers to urban areas of the country for      survival;       Whereas in some communities that were victimized by the      forced demolitions, including Cheru Farm and Killarney Farm      where more than 20,000 people lived, Zimbabweans had lived in      residences for over 20 years and had well-functioning      schools, health and HIV/AIDS clinics, orphanages for AIDS-     affected children, viable businesses, places of worship, and      other amenities;       Whereas in 1993, the Government of Zimbabwe moved families      from Cheru Farms to a new location, Porto Farm, which during      Operation Murambatsvina was demolished by Zimbabwean      Government forces;       Whereas government security forces carried out Operation      Murambatsvina, and in doing so, beat residents and forced      them to destroy their own homes and places of business,      though many residents provided permits from municipal      authorities granting permission to build their structures;       Whereas Operation Murambatsvina resulted in the demolition      throughout the country of homes, businesses, and religious      structures, including a mosque, and an AIDS orphanage and in      the intimidation, harassment, and arrest of tens of thousands      of people;       Whereas Operation Murambatsvina cut off many AIDS patients      from anti-retroviral medicines which will likely lead to a      reversal of their health, resistance to the drugs, and a more      virulent form of AIDS in Zimbabwe with potential for      spreading throughout the region and worldwide;       Whereas churches and private citizens sheltering the      victims of Operation Murambatsvina were also intimidated,      harassed, and arrested for their efforts to provide a safe      haven for the victims during Zimbabwe's harsh winter;       Whereas armed soldiers and police forcibly removed hundreds      of homeless people from     churches in the city of Bulawayo and banned religious groups      from providing humanitarian assistance to those seeking      shelter at Hellensvale, a transit camp north of Zimbabwe's      second city, and where police arrested and detained religious      leaders;       Whereas a strongly worded statement issued by the Bulawayo      clergy stated: ``The removal of the poor, innocent, weak,      voiceless and vulnerable members of society by riot police in      the middle of the night was uncalled for and unnecessary. It      is inhumane, brutal and insensitive, and in total disregard      of human rights and dignity. These people are not criminals      but bona fide citizens of this nation. It seems the crime      they committed is that they are poor.'';       Whereas the African Commission for Peoples' and Human      Rights dispatched an African Union envoy, Bahame Tom      Nyanduga, Special Rapporteur on Refugees, Internally      Displaced Persons, and Asylum Seekers in Africa to      investigate the ongoing demolitions;       Whereas the Government of Zimbabwe refused to allow the      African Union envoy an opportunity to conduct his mission      after being accused by the Government of Zimbabwe through its      government-controlled media of ``following the agenda of      western countries'';       Whereas the decision to block access to the African Union      envoy is representative of a larger pattern of behavior,      whereby the Government of Zimbabwe uses violence,      intimidation, and demagoguery to subjugate its people, relies      on scapegoats to justify the economic, political, and social      crises in Zimbabwe, and detains and slanders United States      diplomats who challenge the ruinous policies of that      government;       Whereas in response to the crisis, the Secretary-General of      the United Nations dispatched a special envoy, Ms. Anna      Kajumulo Tibaijuka, Deputy Secretary General, United Nations      Human Settlements Program (UN-HABITAT), on a factfinding      mission to assess the scope and impact of Operation      Murambatsvina on the people of Zimbabwe and its consequences      for the Zimbabwean Government;       Whereas the mission of the United Nations special envoy was      undertaken between June 26 and July 8, 2005, where she      visited the cities of Harare, Headlands, Rusape, Mutare,      Gweru, Bulawayo, Hwange, and Victoria Falls and met with      victims of Operation Murambatsvina, heard personal testimony      from victims, and met with members of the diplomatic      community, the Government of Zimbabwe, and international      nongovernmental organizations;       Whereas the United Nations special envoy estimated that      approximately 700,000 people in cities across the country      have lost either their homes, their source of livelihood, or      both, and that a total of 2.4 million people or 18 percent of      the population was directly or indirectly affected by      Operation Murambatsvina and that the operation would have      considerable short-term and long-term impact on social and      economic conditions in the country;       Whereas 40,800 families directly affected by Operation      Murambatsvina were headed by women, and 83,530 children under      the age of four and 26,600 people age 60 and older were      directly affected;       Whereas President Robert Mugabe described this sudden and      extensive operation against thousands of families and      business persons in the dead of winter as necessary ``to      eliminate hideouts of crime and grime'';       Whereas the United Nations special envoy is quoted as      saying ``the poor are not criminals . . . [t]hey work hard to      obtain the little which they have and they should not thus be      treated like criminals'';       Whereas the United Nations special envoy assessed the      negative impact of Operation Murambatsvina on shelter, water      and sanitation, food and nutrition, basic health services,      HIV/AIDS, education, women and girls, refugees and other      vulnerable groups;       Whereas the special envoy concluded that Operation      Murambatsvina ``has rendered people homeless and economically      destitute on an unprecedented scale; most of the victims were      already among the most economically disadvantaged groups in      society; and they have now been pushed deeper into poverty      and have become even more vulnerable; and the scale of      suffering is immense, particularly among widows, single      mothers, children, orphans, the elderly and the disabled      persons'';       Whereas at the time of independence, President Robert      Mugabe was hailed as a liberator and Zimbabwe showed bright      prospects for democracy, economic development, domestic      reconciliation, and prosperity;       Whereas President Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party in recent      years have turned away from the promises of liberation and      become a party that uses state power to deny the people of      Zimbabwe the freedoms and prosperity for which they fought      and deserve;       Whereas the rise of urbanization and the informal sector in      Zimbabwe has been the direct result of failed economic      policies, a bitterly disputed fast track land reform program,      unplanned cash handouts to appease war veterans, the costly      military intervention in Congo, and persistent drought;       Whereas before Operation Murambatsvina, unemployment in      Zimbabwe was between 70 and 80 percent, the HIV/AIDS      prevalence rate was 24 percent, and the inflation rate was      164.4 percent (but was as high as 522.8 percent), and      currently Zimbabwe has the world's fastest shrinking economy,      there is an ongoing fuel crisis in the country, and the      Zimbabwean economy had contracted 7 percent; and       Whereas the staggering suffering brought on by Operation      Murambatsvina has been added to the already large-scale      humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved,  That--       (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--       (A) through Operation Murambatsvina, the Government of      Zimbabwe has created a humanitarian disaster that has      compounded the already existing humanitarian food and      economic crises in the country, and the Government of      Zimbabwe has insufficient resources to address such crises;       (B) the Government of Zimbabwe has a duty to protect the      economic, social, and political rights of its citizens as      guaranteed by the Constitution of Zimbabwe and the African      Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights; and       (C) the Government of Zimbabwe also is subject to the      International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural      Rights, to which Zimbabwe is a party, which states in part      that ``forced evictions are prima facie incompatible with the      provisions of the Covenant and can only be carried out under      specific circumstances''; and       (2) the House of Representatives--       (A) condemns Operation Murambatsvina as a major      humanitarian catastrophe caused by the Government of      Zimbabwe's callousness toward its own people, disregard for      the rule of law, and lack of planning to move families and      businesses to more desirable locations;       (B) calls on the United Nations, the African Commission for      Peoples' and Human Rights, and the African Union to continue      efforts to investigate the impact of the demolitions of      housing structures and premises from which informal      businesses operated and to provide the international      community with a viable strategy to address the problems;       (C) calls on the Government of Zimbabwe to allow      international humanitarian organizations access to those      affected by the operation who are in need of food, medicine,      shelter, sanitation, and water;       (D) calls on the Government of Zimbabwe to hold accountable      those responsible for this egregious injury to the Zimbabwean      people, both the decisionmakers of the operation and those      who carried out the operation;       (E) calls on the Government of Zimbabwe to immediately and      aggressively implement policies to promote the private sector      and create jobs and build housing to accommodate those      displaced by the operation;       (F) calls on the United Nations and the international      community to stand by the people of Zimbabwe who have been      victimized by their government in this operation and to help      them with relief and reconstruction of their lives;       (G) calls on the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the      United States Executive Director at the International      Monetary Fund (IMF) to use the voice, vote, and influence of      the United States to continue to advocate for further action      at the IMF should the Government of Zimbabwe continue to fail      to meet its obligations to the IMF;       (H) condemns President Mugabe's harassment of the United      States Ambassador to Zimbabwe, including by threatening the      Ambassador's expulsion from the country and asserting that he      could ``go to Hell''; and       (I) calls on President Mugabe to recognize that absent      meaningful corrective actions on his part, President Mugabe's      legacy will be defined by his responsibility for the ruinous      policies and draconian laws that brought untold suffering of      his people and the near collapse of Zimbabwe as a nation.
