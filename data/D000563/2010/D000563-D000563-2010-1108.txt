Now they tell us we cannot extend unemployment benefits to people in Kentucky and Illinois and Missouri because we have not paid for them. Clearly, it is a double standard.  I might add that when it came to the estate tax, aka the ``death tax,'' according to some, on June 7, 2006, the Senator from Kentucky took the floor and said:       Mr. President, I rise today in strong favor of abolishing      one of the most unjustified taxes we have in America today,      the death tax. Americans should not have to talk to their      undertaker and their tax man on the same day. Small      businesses and family farms should not be forced to close      down in order to pay the government money because a loved one      has passed away.  Then when the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act was called for a vote, the Senator from Kentucky voted to repeal this tax, costing the government $300 billion; that is over $300 billion added to our national debt. This tax affects less than one-half of 1 percent of all the people in America, the wealthiest people in our country. To provide $300 billion in tax relief to them--the Senator from Kentucky said we can add that to the deficit and that is OK. But when it comes to providing a $1,100 monthly unemployment check to someone in Illinois who is struggling to find a job, he says no, that adds to the deficit. So for the wealthiest in America on the estate tax, there is no accountability, no reckoning, but for the poorest in America, the most struggling families in America, we are going to hold them to the hardest economic standard. To me, that is at least inconsistent, if not inexplicable.
