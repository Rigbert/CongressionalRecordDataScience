President, I rise today to speak on behalf of a Sense of the Senate amendment that Senator Sarbanes and I are offering with respect to the section 8 housing voucher program. This amendment states that section 8 housing vouchers are a critical housing resource, that public housing authorities must be able to use all of their authorized vouchers, and that the Senate expects the Department of Housing and Urban Development to take all necessary steps to encourage full voucher utilization.  Our Nation is facing a critical shortage of affordable housing. A recent study by the Joint Center on Housing Studies at Harvard University indicates that approximately 30 percent of American families have housing affordability problems, with as many as 14.3 million families paying more than half of their income for housing costs and 17.3 million families paying 30 to 50 percent of their income toward housing costs.
