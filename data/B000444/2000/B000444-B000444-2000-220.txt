 President, I rise today to make special note of the national honor bestowed upon one of the leading citizens in the central part of my State, in historic Kent County, Delaware. At the very heart of this national recognition for his business excellence is the story of a strong, close family, which makes this award all the more special.  TIME Magazine has named John W. Whitby, Jr., President of Kent County Motor Sales Company, as its recipient of the 2000 Quality Dealer Award. The competition was formidable--Whitby won over 63 other dealers nominated for the 31st annual award, from more than 20,500 auto dealers nationwide. And make no mistake--this is a coveted award for auto dealers. It's the equivalent of TIME's ``Man of the Year'' award for automobile dealers.  John operates Kent County Motor Sales in Dover, building on the successful business his dad, Jack Whitby founded. Upon accepting the award at the National Auto Dealers Association Convention, John readily gave credit to his father for the extensive training he received and to his employees and colleagues for their dedication and commitment to excellence.  American philosopher and poet, George Santayana, wrote that: ``The family is one of nature's masterpieces.'' To extend that metaphor: The Whitby family is one of Kent County's masterpieces. Not only is John a top business owner, he is a community leader as well. John is a member of the Delaware Business Roundtable Greater Dover Committee; the Central Delaware Chamber of Commerce; the Quarterback Club of Kent County; and, Friends of Capitol Theatre among many other civic contributions. John is continuing the strong Whitby family tradition. He lives in his native Dover, with his wife Diane and two children, Emily and Jay.  Mr. President, it is with great pride that I commend John Whitby, Jr. and his family for this outstanding national award.                          ____________________
