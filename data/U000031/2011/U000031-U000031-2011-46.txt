Chairman, if I might just enter in a brief colloquy with my friend, the gentleman from California.  Each of us has about the same amount of time left. I have allocated my time; I presume you have as well. My remaining speakers are meeting someplace, and I'm prepared to close and yield back if you are, unless somebody comes to the floor awfully fast.  Is it the same for you?
