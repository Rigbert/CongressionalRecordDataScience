 President, let me begin by once again thanking Senator Lieberman and Senator Carper and Senators Collins and Brown for their long and hard work on this issue, which is of enormous consequence to the American people.  Sometimes what people inside the beltway perceive as opposed to what people outside the beltway perceive are two different worlds. I can tell you that back in Vermont--and I suspect in rural areas and States all over this country--people want to save the post office. They know how important it is for small businesses, for our economy, and for their own needs. So the issue we are dealing with is a very significant issue, and I hope that as a Senate we can show America that we can come together regardless of political ideology. This is not a progressive issue, a conservative issue, Republican, Democratic or Independent. This is an issue that impacts tens of millions of Americans, and I hope we can move together as we should.  I wish to say a few words on the Postal Service and finances today. Everybody knows the Postal Service is, in fact, facing significant financial difficulties. Revenue at the Postal Service has gone down from about $75 billion in 2008 to $66 billion last year. In the midst of the digital revolution, first-class mail has gone down significantly--no debate about that--and it has been replaced and will continue to be replaced by e-mail usage and the Internet. There is no question but that this is a real issue that has to be addressed.  But let me be very clear that in terms of the revenue problems facing the Postal Service, the major problems we have are not just the decline in first-class mail. It is an issue that happens not to be the major issue. The major issue, in fact, is that the Postal Service has seen a significant loss in mail volume and revenue due to the most severe recession our country has faced since the 1930s. As the Postal Service indicated on May 30, 2010, ``The effects of the recession account for two-thirds of the mail volume decline.''  The first point we want to understand is, yes, decline of first-class mail is a real issue. But second of all, similar to businesses all over this country, revenue is being impacted by the recession. How we can get our country out of the recession, create more jobs, put more money into the hands of working people is, of course, a major issue we must address.  In that regard, I do wish to say that in the middle of this terrible recession, when real unemployment--real unemployment; it is not 8.2 percent but, in fact, is closer to 15 percent, counting those people who have given up looking for work, those people working part time--it would seem to me this body wants to do everything we can not to see 200,000 jobs slashed at the U.S. Postal Service, many of them decent-paying jobs, many of them union jobs.  We may not be able to save every one of those jobs; we want the Postal Service to be efficient. But on the other hand, I would hope we see as a significant priority that in the midst of a recession, we do not want to downsize a major American institution by 200,000 jobs--many of them, by the way, jobs belonging to veterans.  A couple months ago there was a whole lot of debate about how do we create jobs for veterans. I can tell you one thing we don't do is downsize the Postal Service by 200,000 workers, many of them being veterans.  We talked about the decline in first-class mail being important. We talked about the recession being important. But I wish to raise another issue that I think many people are not familiar with and that has nothing to do with first-class mail, nothing to do with the recession or, in fact, e-mail or the Internet; that is, to a very significant degree, the major reason the Postal Service has been running a deficit since 2007 is due to accounting issues.  For example, everybody has to understand this issue if we are going to have an open and honest debate about the future of the Postal Service: Due to a law passed in 2006, the U.S. Postal Service--uniquely in America, uniquely within government, Federal, State, local, uniquely in terms of the private sector--has been forced to prefund 75years' worth of future retiree health benefits in just 10 years--seventy-five years' worth of future retiree health benefits in just 10 years. There is no other agency of government that comes close to that onerous requirement, nor are there any companies in the private sector that have been asked to do that. This mandate costs the U.S. Postal Service between $5.4 billion and $5.8 billion per year.  So what I beg of my colleagues is when they look at the financial problems facing the Postal Service--which are real--do not forget that, because of this 2006 legislation, the Postal Service needs to come up with approximately $5.5 billion every single year to prefund retiree health care. This is an important point, and I hope my fellow colleagues in the Senate are listening. One hundred percent of the Postal Service's $20 billion debt from 2007 to 2010 is the result of this prefunding mandate. Let me repeat it. One hundred percent of the Postal Service's $20 billion debt from 2007 to 2010 is the result of this $5.5 billion per year prefunding mandate. Without this mandate, the Postal Service would have made a $700 million profit from 2007 to 2010.  Let me repeat that, because these are facts that have not often been introduced into this debate. We have folks coming up here who are saying the Postal Service is collapsing financially and so forth and so on. But it is important to understand the facts, and the facts are that despite the worst recession--which we are currently in--since the 1930s, despite the competition from e-mail and the Internet, the Postal Service would have made a $700 million profit from 2007 to 2010 if it was not forced to prefund future retiree health benefits.  In addition--and I hope people listen to this as well--during the first quarter of 2012, a few months ago, the U.S. Postal Service would have generated a $200 million profit had it not been required to prefund its future retiree health benefits.  I think as we debate these issues about the future of the post office, it is absolutely imperative that we understand the role of the $5.5 billion every single year that the Postal Service has to come up with to prefund retiree health benefits.  A few months ago I asked the Inspector General of the Postal Service, whose name is David Williams, David C. Williams--he is the Inspector General of the Postal Service--I asked him to talk a little bit about what this prefunding of health benefits meant. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of his letter, which is dated February 6, 2012.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Office of Inspector General,                                 United States Postal Service,                                                 February 6, 2012,     Senator Bernie Sanders     Dirksen Building, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Sanders: For several days last week, I met      with you and your staff to discuss solutions to the current      financial crisis within the Postal Service. At the conclusion      of those discussions, you requested that our office focus on      one of the solutions that we presented which examined an      option to address the current benefit fund financing. This      proposal would eliminate the requirement for the Postal      Service to make annual $5.5 billion payments into its retiree      health benefit fund, and allow the $44 billion currently in      the fund to grow with interest. No payments would be made      from the fund until it is deemed to be fully funded, and the      Postal Service would continue to directly pay the healthcare      premiums for retirees. An additional element of the proposal      would allow current overpayments of $13.1 billion in the      Postal Service pension funds to be refunded to the Postal      Service. Any future overpayments would also be refunded in      the year of occurrence.       Our analysis of this proposal shows that if it were      adopted, the amounts in retiree healthcare fund would grow      from $44 billion to the $90 billion estimated current      liability, in 21 years. This $90 billion projected liability      is not a static or precise figure, as there are forces that      will increase and decrease the liability. Historically, the      figure has risen, but we note that the $90 billion has not      changed significantly over the last 3 years ($87 billion in      2009, $91 billion in 2010, and $90 billion in 2011).       This solution is one option to provide needed short-term      flexibility for the Postal Service to address its current      financial crisis. It would alleviate payments due of nearly      $30 billion over the next 4 years, and provide an additional      $13 billion to address current needs. Though this would      provide substantial relief, additional actions would be      necessary to address remaining financial gaps between      projected revenues and expenses during the next four year      period.       To put the pension and retiree health funding issue into      perspective, my office has conducted benchmarking to evaluate      the Postal Service's prefunding levels as compared to both      the public and private sector. The Postal Service has 2      significantly exceeded pension and retiree healthcare      benchmarked funding levels of both public and private sector      organizations. Using ratepayer funds, it has built a war      chest of over $326 billion to address its future liabilities,      prefunding combined pension and retiree healthcare      obligations at 91 percent. This is an astonishingly high      figure for a company with such a large employee base.       For example, the Postal Service is currently over 100      percent funded in its pension funds. The federal government      is funded at a much lower 42 percent level, and the military      is funded at 27 percent. The average Fortune 1000 pension      plan is funded at 80 percent, and only 6 percent of the      Fortune 1000 companies have pension plans that are 100      percent funded.       Prefunding retiree healthcare is rare in the public and      private sectors. We have been unable to locate any      organization, either public or private, that has anything      similar to the Postal Service's required level of prefunding      of retiree healthcare benefits. The Postal Service is      currently funded at 49 percent of its estimated current      liability. The federal government does not prefund its      retiree healthcare liabilities at all, and the military is      funded at a 35 percent level. Only 38 percent of Fortune 1000      companies who offer retiree health care benefits prefund the      expense at all, and the median funding level for those      organizations is 37 percent.       I appreciate the opportunity to analyze this proposal, and      describe it further. If you have any questions, please do not      hesitate to call me or Wally Olihovik.           Sincerely,                                                David C. Williams,                                                Inspector General.
