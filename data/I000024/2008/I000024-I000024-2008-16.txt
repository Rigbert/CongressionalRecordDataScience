President, the discussion is on the serious problem this country is facing. While I take a position against the administration's program, I know they are behind closed doors with the leadership on both sides, both Houses, trying to come up with something that is workable.  I suggest what we are going to vote on, scheduled for 11:30 a.m., which I think will be a little later than that, does not have a solution. One of the points I want to make sure everyone knows is that in this legislation is the extension of the moratorium on oil shale.
