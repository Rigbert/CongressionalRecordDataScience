 The record before us does not demonstrate that Judge D. Brooks Smith merits a promotion to the Court of Appeals. He is already serving a lifetime position as a Federal judge, but he continued as a member of a discriminatory club more than a decade after he toldthe Senate he would quit. He did not resign until 1999, and then only after this vacancy on the Third Circuit opened up.  It should make no difference whether this club discriminated against women, or people because of their race or creed; it is discriminatory. He acknowledged that continuing in the club would be inconsistent with ethical rules, but he continued to serve there, even after he told Senator Heflin under oath in 1988 that under these rules he would be required to resign.  I believe he did not keep his word. I think this is, frankly, the kind of lapse that, had it been somebody nominated by the previous President, my friends on the other side of the aisle would have voted against him. I think they should vote against this one, even though he is a member of their own party. We have the areas where he did not recuse himself in a case where he had a clear conflict of interest. He took special-interest-funded trips. I think his record as a whole calls into question his sensitivity, his fairness, his impartiality, and his judgment.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
