President, I am pleased to support the introduction today, along with my colleagues Senators Clinton and Kennedy, of Senator Murray's bill to improve America's high schools.  We have all heard a lot of talk these days about the need to improve America's high schools. Bill Gates makes the point that the academic caliber of our high school graduates is one of the greatest factors in our country's ability to innovate and to compete internationally in technological advancements.
