 I am amazed at this whole process. Look at judges who have been pending for almost a year and their names are not coming to the surface. That is something more at work than the breaks of the game. That is a deliberate attempt by the majority to suppress the nomination of individual judges.  Frankly, an offer to bring some judges to the floor is, in my view, insufficient unless that offer was transparent, saying we will begin to work down the judges who have been pending longest, with perhaps other criteria, such as districts or circuits that need judges.  But that is not how it is working. These magnanimous offers of bringing up a couple of judges--I believe I saw yesterday where three judges from Arizona were just nominated by the President, and they already have hearings scheduled. We have other judges who were nominated over a year ago, and they have not even had a hearing, a year later. Some magnanimous gestures by the majority leader are self-serving and ultimately had to be rejected by the minority.  I respect the Senator, but I will continue my discussion on some other points.
