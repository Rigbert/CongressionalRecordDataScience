 President, in light of the most recent evidence uncovered about Enron's participation in the Western Energy Crisis, I rise today to introduce the Energy Market Oversight Bill with Senators Levin, Harkin, Cantwell and Wyden.  This bill would: Improve Price Transparency in Wholesale Electricity Markets. The bill directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to establish an electronic system to provide information about the price and availability of wholesale electricity to buyers, and sellers, and the public.  Prohibit Round Trip Electricity Trades. The bill prohibits the simultaneous buying and selling of the same quantity of electricity at the same price in the same location with no financial gain or loss. Round trip or ``wash trades'' are essentially bogus trades whereby no electricity changes hands, but the profit from the trades enriches the bottom-line of a company's financial report.  Increase Penalties for Violations of Federal Power Act. Maximum fines for violations of the Federal Power Act are increased from $5,000 to $1,000,000.; and maximum sentences are increased from 2 to 5 years. Current fines are extraordinarily low and therefore provide no deterrence to illegal activity.  Increase Penalties for Violations of Natural Gas Act. The bill increases maximum fines for violations of the Natural Gas Act from $5,000 to $1,000,000.  Prohibit Manipulation in Electricity Markets. Manipulation is prohibited in the wholesale electricity markets and FERC is given discretionary authority to revoke market-based rates for violations. Strangely enough, manipulation of energy markets is not specifically prohibited. This would add language to Part II of the Federal Power Act.  Repeal the ``Enron exemption''. Repeals the Commodities Future Modernization Act exemption for large traders in energy commodities and applies the anti-manipulation and anti-fraud provisions of the Commodities Exchange Act to all Over the Counter trades in energy commodities and derivatives. In my view, when Congress exempted energy from the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, it created the playing field for the Western Energy Crisis of 2000 and 2001, and cost millions of people millions of dollars.  Provide CFTC the Tools to Monitor OTC Energy Markets. For Over the Counter trades in energy commodities and derivatives that perform a significant price discovery function, including trades on electronic trading facilities, the bill requires large sophisticated traders to keep records and report large trades to the CFTC. This does not change the law, only applies the law that exists for futures contracts to over the counter trades in the energy markets.  Limit on Use of Data. Requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to seek information that is necessary for the limited purposes of detecting and preventing manipulation in the futures and over the counter markets for energy; to keep proprietary trade and business data confidential except when used for law enforcement purposes. This does not require the real-time publication of proprietary data.  No Effect on Non-Energy Commodities or Derivatives. The bill would not alter or affect the regulation of futures markets, financial derivatives, or metals. We have specifically stated on page 20 the following: ``The amendments made by this title have no effect on the regulation of excluded commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act.''  In addition, the bill states: ``The amendments made by this title have no effect on the regulation of metals under the Commodity Exchange Act.''  The Western Energy Crisis of 2000-2001 has still not been resolved. Meanwhile, more and more information about Enron's role in the crisis emerges. On February 3, 2005, the Snohomish Public Utility District released transcripts of tapes showing that on January 17, 2001, Enron traders concocted false repairs for a Las Vegas power plant--making power unavailable that would have been delivered to California--on the very same day that supplies were so tight that Northern California experienced a Stage 3 power emergency and rolling blackouts hit as many as 2 million consumers.  By taking the plant offline, Enron was also in direct violation of an Emergency Power Order by U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson that required power generators to make power available to California.  Telephone transcripts between Enron and the Las Vegas plant confirming the effort to falsify repairs read as follows:       Bill: Rich: Ah, we want you guys to get a little creative.       Rich: OK.       Bill: And come up with a reason to go down.       Rich: OK.       Bill: Anything you want to do over there? Any----       Rich: Ah----       Bill: Cleaning, anything like that?       Rich: Yeah, Yeah. There's some stuff we could be doing.  Enron knew exactly what it was doing when it manipulated the Western Energy markets. Enron traders tested gaming techniques in the California market as early as May 1998, creating imbalances in the California market as a result of loopholes it discovered in the system.  The schemes the company used in 2000-2001 had already been rehearsed inCanada. ``Project Stanley'' was one such technique--Enron traders inflated energy prices in Alberta, Canada by colluding with other energy marketers.  Enron advocated for ``de-regulation'' of California's energy markets while drafting language that was full of loopholes it could exploit. Similarly, the company was the main force behind a provision that exempted it from federal oversight. This exemption, known as the ``Enron loophole,'' was created in 2000 when Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.  The loophole exempted energy trading from regulatory oversight and excluded it completely if the trade was done electronically.  We must close this loophole in order to prohibit fraud and price manipulation in all over-the-counter energy commodity transactions, and provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the authority it needs to investigate and prosecute allegations of fraud and manipulation.  We need to give the CFTC this authority because we learned during the Western Energy Crisis that there was pervasive manipulation and fraud in energy markets, and that FERC and the CFTC were unable or unwilling to use the authority they had to intervene.  We need to give the CFTC this authority because we need regulators to protect consumers and make sure they're not taken advantage of.  We need to give the CFTC this authority because when there are inadequate regulations, consumers are ripped off.  The Western Energy Crisis cost California about $40 billion. California has been asking for $9 billion in refunds. However, given the fact that Enron is in bankruptcy, it would be a miracle if the State receives even half of that amount.  Yet there is nothing preventing another energy crisis from happening again, in my State or elsewhere.  Therefore, we need Federal oversight of our energy markets.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 509       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
