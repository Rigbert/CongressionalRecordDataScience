 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Environment and Public Works be authorized to hold a hearing on November 17, 2005 at 9:35 a.m. to evaluate the degree to which the preliminary findings on the failure of the levees are being incorporated into the restoration of hurricane protection.
