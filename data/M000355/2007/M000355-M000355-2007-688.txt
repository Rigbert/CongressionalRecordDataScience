 President, I might add, I agree with everything the majority leader said. This substitute is essentially what passed the Senate last year 90 to 8. The Senate is ready to act or close to ready to finish this important piece of legislation. We were last year. It was bogged down in the legislative process in dealing with the other body. But we are going to pass this next week with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. And the majority leader and I will be working together to make that possible.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
