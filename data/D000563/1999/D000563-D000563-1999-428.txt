President, I think it is fundamentally unfair. I agree with the Senator from California. Most people who are in these high-net-worth situations would not miss a decimal point in their net worth, but the Republican tax cut plan wants to give them more money. Yet when we try to bring up an issue such as increasing the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour, the Republicans just will not accept that. So we are going to have that fight later this year, I am sure, on the floor of the Senate.  That gives me an opportunity to summarize, if I may, my view of this Congress and the difference between the two parties. Take a look at the Senate over the last 2 months if you want to know the difference between this side of the aisle, the Democratic side, and the Republican side.  On the issue of gun control, sensible gun control, after the shootings in schools across America, the Democrats pushed a sensible gun control plan which attracted the support of six Republican Senators. I salute their courage for joining us, giving us finally enough votes, as a minority, to bring in Vice President Gore casting the tie-breaking vote for sensible gun control--trigger locks for guns that are safer for kids, trying to make sure people buying guns at gun shows are not criminals or children, trying to make sure we do not keep importing these high-capacity ammunition clips of 240 rounds of ammunition. Who needs that for hunting or safety in their homes?  We passed it, sent it over to the Republicans in the House, and they just beat it to pieces. There is nothing left. We have to get back and pass sensible gun control--a clear difference between Democrats and Republicans.  On the Patients' Bill of Rights, we on the Democratic side came in and said what is going on is scandalous; doctors should make decisions, not insurance companies; and insurance companies should be held accountable when they make the wrong decision. The Democrats stood for that position. The Republicans, with the exception of two Senators, opposed us. The difference between the Democrats and Republicans: We believe in the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Republicans oppose it.  When it comes to this issue, what a change of hats. The Democrats are in the role of fiscal conservatives. The Democrats are saying mind our own business when it comes to Social Security, the future of Medicare, and retiring the national debt; the Republican side says at least $1 trillion in tax cuts the first 10 years, and then watch it explode in the outyears.  For the American people following this debate in the Senate, they have a choice. If you buy into the Republican philosophy of runaway tax cuts and irresponsible spending in the future, if you buy into the idea of standing up on the floor of the Senate for the health insurance companies and opposing the efforts of families and doctors and hospitals to bring some sanity back to health care, if you buy into the Republican position supporting the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby, then that is your party, that is where you should turn, and be proud of it.  But if you think there is a better choice, if you think coming together on a bipartisan basis for sensible gun control, for the Patients' Bill of Rights, and for a fiscally responsible approach to our budget in the future, I think that is the better way to go. That is the clear choice, and politics is about choices.  I thank my colleagues from California and Maryland for joining me in the morning business, and I yield the remainder of my time.                          ____________________
