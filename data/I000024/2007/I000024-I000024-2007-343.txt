President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senate amendment No. 37 that has been offered by the Senator from South Dakota to the legislative and lobbying transparency legislation, S. 1.  The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which became law this past September 26, 2006, requires that the Office of Management and Budget develop a single, searchable, public Web site that provides information on all types of Federal awards including Federal grants, sub grants, loans, contracts, cooperative agreements, and other forms of financial awards that entities, including nonprofit organizations, receive from the Federal Government. This Web site is to be accessible to the public at no cost and contains information such as the entity receiving the award, the amount, and the purpose.  Senate amendment No. 37, that has been offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Thune, builds upon the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act by requiring entities that receive Federal funding to publicly disclose those funds, disclose that entity's political advocacy, and the amount spent on its political advocacy. Under this amendment, political advocacy includes influencing legislation, involvement in political campaigns, litigation with the Federal Government, and supporting other entities that engage in these types of political advocacy. In his remarks upon offering Senate amendment No. 37, the Senator from South Dakota stated that his amendment will shed further light on organizations that receive Federal funding that are at the same time also involved in advocacy on Federal issues. I could not agree more that the transparency required in this amendment is necessary and that this is something the American people would like to see happen.  For the past two Congresses, I have been the chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. In that role, I designated grants management at the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, as one of the priority oversight areas of the committee. I began this oversight by conducting a committee hearing where representatives from the EPA, EPA inspector general, the Government Accountability Office, and a private organization called Taxpayers for Common Sense testified to severe deficiencies in grants management at EPA for at least the past 10 years and regardless of Presidential administration. In fact, the EPA inspector general's testimony at that hearing focused on a nonprofit Federal grant recipient that had received close to $5 million over 5 years in violation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The EPA has had a particularly bad habit of awarding large grants to special interest and partisan groups and, in many cases, with little oversight. However, this is a problem that can plague all Federal agencies and departments.  Since the beginning of this oversight, EPA has taken a number of positive steps, and I would like to focus on one of those positive developments. I suggested in May 2004 that to increase transparency in grant awards, the EPA should develop a publicly accessible, no-cost Web site with information on EPA's grants and recipients. I suggested this Web site cover future grant recipients as well as grants awarded over the past 10 years. I also provided some examples of useful information to include on the Web site such as the grant recipient's name, agency grant number, Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number, the type of recipient--governmental entity, nonprofit, eductional institution, foreign recipient, etc.--the grant project location, beginning and ending project dates of grants, the amount of the grant, the total cost of the project or cumulative amount of grants for the particular project, the grant description or purpose, the grant's expected outcome, the approving office or program within the agency, and the agency project officer and awarding officers' contact information.  Since that time, EPA has created this new Web site with the most publicly available information ever provided on EPA grants and recipients. The EPA's grant awards database may be easily found on the EPA's Web site and has been available since 2004.  I believe that placing this information on the World Wide Web for anyone to access has greatly increased the transparency of the grants process within the EPA and has required EPA to be more accountable for the types of grants, recipients, and oversight of the grants awarded. Likewise, I believe that placing information on the World Wide Web concerning the political, lobbying, and litigation activity of regular recipients of Federal funds provides needed transparency that I believe the American people may be surprised to see and may provide a tool for appropriate Federal agencies to use to ensure that Federal dollars are not being misused for political purposes.  In many cases, when the Federal Government awards a grant to a private organization, it is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization. The Internal Revenue Service has classified these organizations as section 501(c)(3) charitable organizations after that section of the Internal Revenue Code. However, I have delivered remarks concerning the political activities of recipients of Federal funds or their closely affiliated organizations. Some of these 501(c)(3) organizations that regularly receive Federal funds are often closely affiliated with corresponding section 501(c)(4) and 527 organizations and political action committees all highly involved in lobbying and political activities every year and in each election cycle. Although this article is dated, one of the best articles that describes this tangled web of political financing and advocacy was a Washington Post article from September 27, 2004, which Iwill request to have printed in its entirety at the conclusion of my remarks. This article contains a quote from a former Federal Election Commission official stating:       In the wake of the ban on party-raised soft money, evidence      is mounting that money is slithering through on other routes      as organizations maintain various accounts, tripping over      each other, shifting money between 501(c)(3)'s, (c)(4)'s, and      527's. . . . It's big money, and the pendulum has swung too      far in their direction.  While I understand that Senate amendment No. 37 does not reach into this tangled web of political and lobbying financing to separate Federal funding from private dollars, this amendment does make publicly available on a single Web site information on recipients of Federal awards and a description of the political and lobbying activities in which those organizations have been involved. This kind of disclosure has begun the process of applying transparency and reform to grants management at the EPA and I believe will also direct needed public attention on the political and lobbying activities of organizations that regularly receive taxpayer funding.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 27, 2004]  New Routes for Money To Sway Voters--501c Groups Escape Disclosure                                  Rules              (By Thomas B. Edsall and James V. Grimaldi)       In recent months, ads mocking Democratic presidential      nominee John F. Kerry have been surfacing in battleground      states and on national cable channels, paid for by a group      called Citizens United.       In one television commercial playing off the MasterCard      ``Priceless'' ads, the announcer describes Kerry's $75      haircuts, $250 designer shirts and $30 million worth of      summer and winter homes. As a picture of Kerry and Sen.      Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) appears on screen, the announcer      concludes: ``Another rich, liberal elitist from Massachusetts      who claims he's a man of the people. Priceless.''       The spot, more hard-edged than the ads run by the official      Bush-Cheney '04 campaign, is in the same provocative vein as      the controversial Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ads that have      dominated much of the campaign since late August. There is      one major difference, however: The Swift Boat group must      disclose who is paying for its ads; Citizens United does not      have to tell anybody where it got its money or how it is      spent.       Neither does Project Vote, a group run by former Ohio      Democratic Party chairman David J. Leland that hopes to      register 1.15 million new voters in black, Hispanic and poor      white communities. Nor do two major voter registration and      turnout projects called ``I Vote Values'' and ``The Battle      for Marriage,'' backed by some of the largest organizations      on the religious right that are coordinating a drive to      register millions of evangelical Christians.       Unlike the campaigns of President Bush and Kerry, the two      major parties, political action committees and the Swift Boat      Veterans--one of the ``527'' advocacy groups that have become      part of the 2004 campaign lexicon--Citizens United and      Project Vote operate under the radar of regulation and public      disclosure in what campaign finance expert Anthony Corrado of      the Brookings Institution and Colby College described as ``a      real black hole.''       Known as 501c groups, for a statute in the tax code, these      tax-exempt advocacy and charitable organizations are conduits      for a steady stream of secretive cash flowing into the      election, in many respects unaffected by the McCain-Feingold      legislation enacted in 2002. Unlike other political groups,      501c organizations are not governed by the Federal Election      Commission but by the Internal Revenue Service, which in a      complex set of regulations delineates a range of allowable      activities that are subject to minimal disclosure long after      Election Day.       A 501c (3) group can register voters, and donations to it      are tax deductible, but it is prohibited from engaging in      partisan or electioneering work. A 501c (4), (5) or (6) group      can be involved in elections, but the cost of doing so must      be less than one-half the group's total budget. Public      Citizen, in a report last week titled ``The New Stealth      PACs,'' contended that many of the politically active 501c      (4) groups regularly spend more than half their budgets on      political activities in violation of IRS rules.       IRS rules also stipulate that electioneering by 501c (4),      (5) and (6) groups cannot be ``express advocacy''--that is,      telling people to vote for or against specific candidates.      But such groups can run ads that address public issues such      as immigration or taxes and that refer to the stands of      candidates in ways that help or hurt them.       In the 2004 campaign, these legal distinctions have      translated into two specific roles for these groups. One is      to mobilize voters for Election Day. The other is to      articulate criticism and orchestrate attacks that      candidates and their parties may not want to launch      themselves. That is the role assumed by Citizens United,      whose president, David N. Bossie, is no stranger to      hardball conservative politics.       Asked whether he would provide the names of his donors,      Bossie said, ``No, we follow the rules that are in place for      501c groups.''       The rapid emergence of 501c and 527 groups in this election      cycle is a direct consequence of the changes in political      spending brought about by McCain-Feingold. The groups have      essentially emerged to do what the law prevents parties from      doing: They raise and spend unlimited contributions of ``soft      money'' from corporations, unions and wealthy donors to      influence federal elections.       Kent Cooper, who has watched the intricate ways money gets      into the political system, first as chief of public records      at the FEC and now as co-founder of PoliticalMoneyLine, said      there is a growing need for more stringent regulation of 501c      groups.       In the wake of the ban on party-raised soft money, Cooper      said, evidence is mounting that money ``is slithering through      on other routes,'' as organizations ``maintain various      accounts, tripping over each other, shifting money between      501c (3)s, c (4)s and 527s. . . . It's big money, and the      pendulum has swung too far in their direction.''       Until 2000, neither 527s nor 501c organizations were      required to list donors or account for expenditures. Sen.      John McCain (R-Ariz.), angered at smears aimed at his      presidential campaign by a 527 group, succeeded that year in      passing legislation requiring the IRS to report the spending      activities of 527s throughout the election cycle. That left      the 501c organizations as the only groups with virtually no      disclosure requirements.       To arrive at a total expenditure figure for 501c groups is      impossible, given their nondisclosure requirements. But,      based on interviews and an examination of available records,      it seems likely their total spending will be from $70 million      to $100 million this election cycle, with expenditures by      pro-Republican and pro-Democratic groups roughly equal.       There are huge unknowns, however. For example, the U.S.      Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform, a 501c (6)      business organization, has an annual budget of more than $40      million. The National Rifle Association, a 501c (4), has a      budget of more than $200 million, which the group's chief      executive, Wayne LaPierre Jr., can tap to increase voter      turnout among not only its 4 million members but also the 14      percent of the electorate that has a ``very favorable'' view      of the NRA.       Equally difficult to track is the burst of money going to      the network of hundreds of generally liberal and pro-     Democratic turnout operations, including Project Vote, the      NAACP Voter Education Fund and USAction, none of which      discloses its contributors.       Some board members, consultants, lawyers and staff members      of many of these nonpartisan 501c organizations are, in fact,      active partisans, separately working for campaigns, political      parties and groups.       Perhaps no one better illustrates the host of interlocking      roles than Carl Pope, one of the most influential operatives      on the Democratic side in the 2004 election. As executive      director of the Sierra Club, a major 501c (4) environmental      lobby, Pope also controls the Sierra Club Voter Education      Fund, a 527. The Voter Education Fund 527 has raised $3.4      million this election cycle, with $2.4 million of that amount      coming from the Sierra Club. A third group, the Sierra Club      PAC, has since 1980 given $3.9 million to Democratic      candidates and $173,602 to GOP candidates.       These activities just touch the surface of Pope's political      involvement. In 2002-03, Pope helped found two major 527      groups: America Votes, which has raised $1.9 million to      coordinate the election activities of 32 liberal groups, and      America Coming Together (ACT), which has a goal of raising      more than $100 million to mobilize voters to cast ballots      against Bush. Finally, Pope is treasurer of a new 501c (3)      foundation, America's Families United, which reportedly has      $15 million to distribute to voter mobilization groups.       ``I am in this as deeply as I am,'' Pope said, ``because I      think this country is in real peril.''       Although the McCain-Feingold law was generally a boon for      501c groups, one provision has tightened restrictions on the      way they spend their money. The law's ban on the use of      corporate and union funds to finance issue ads in the final      60 days before the general election has prompted such      conservative groups as Americans for Job Security and the 60      Plus Association to move away from radio and television      advertising and toward voter mobilization and non-broadcast      advocacy, primarily through direct mail, newspaper ads and      the Internet.       Although corporate-backed tax-exempt groups are struggling      to comply with McCain-Feingold, liberal, pro-Democratic      charitable and tax-exempt organizations are concentrating      much of their time, money and effort on voter registration      and turnout. These activities do not fall under the 60-day      broadcasting ban and can be structured as nonpartisan work      eligible for tax-deductible support.       For many groups doing voter mobilization, it is crucial to      have a 501c (3) group to tap into what has become a      multimillion-dollar commitment by a host of liberal      foundations and wealthy individuals to increase turnout among      minorities and poor people.       Among the foundations investing substantially in voter      registration and turnout programs likely to benefit Democrats      are the Proteus Fund, which, in addition to direct grants,      set up the Voter Engagement Donor Network in 2003 as an      information service to 130 other foundations and individual      donors; the Pew Charitable Trusts; and America's Families      United, which was created in 2003 to channel about $15      million to voter registration and turnout groups. Most of      these foundations voluntarily identify the groups to which      they make grants on their Web sites.       One of the best-funded organizations is Project Vote, a      501c (3) group that has an $18 million fundraising goal and      had raised, as of early September, $13.2 million in tax-     deductible contributions. Similar work in registering and      turning out urban voters, especially minorities, is being      conducted by USAction Education Fund, the 501c (3) arm of      USAction. Board members for America's Families United include      not only Pope, but also Dennis Rivera, president of New York      Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union and a      major figure in Democratic politics, and William Lynch Jr.,      who served as board secretary until he recently became deputy      manager of the Kerry campaign.       The close connection between partisan activists and 501c      groups is equally clear among conservative groups. Benjamin      L. Ginsberg has been a lawyer for the Bush campaign, the      Republican National Committee, Progress for America and the      Swift Boat Veterans (both 527s) and Americans for Job      Security, a 501c (4). Ginsberg was forced to resign as chief      outside counsel to the Bush campaign during a controversy      over his simultaneous involvement with the Swift Boat group.      But he is one of the few activists whose involvement in      multiple groups has come under scrutiny.
