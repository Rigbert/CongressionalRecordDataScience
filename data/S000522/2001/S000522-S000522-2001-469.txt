Mr. Speaker, it is not an exaggeration to say that autism spectrum disorders may be the silent epidemic of our time. It is silent because this developmental disorder has robbed at least 400,000 children of their ability to communicate and interact with their families and loved ones. It is silent because there are currently no operational autism registries in the nation to tell us how many people are actually afflicted with this disorder. Current statistics tell us that autism affects at least one in every 500 children in America, and much of the recent anecdotal evidence suggests that autism rates are increasing. The real prevalence rate may be closer to one in every 250 children.  One of the reasons Congressman Mike Doyle and I formed the Coalition for Autism Research and Education (C.A.R.E.), which now has 115 members, is to provide us with a critically needed forum where autism issues--and proposed solutions--can be debated and discussed. Autism briefings, such as the one we held earlier today on early identification and intervention of autism, allow us to talk about the many problems associated with this disorder and give us the opportunity to find legislative remedies to these problems.  For example, I am in the process of drafting legislation that I believe can help the victims of autism and their families. This legislation will focus on improving education and support services, such as early intervention, for persons with the autism spectrum disorder.  First, my proposed legislation will seek to correct the inequities of existing early  Another provision in this bill will address the lack of specially trained professors to educate autistic children by increasing funding in Part D (the National Activities Programs) of OSEP. Increasing funding at OSEP will provide federal grants to states to help them rigorously prepare teachers for educating children with autism. The program will provide both advanced education training for current special education teachers and introductory through advanced education training for future special education teachers. In addition, tax credit incentives will be provided for those who receive training in autism.  Finally, my legislation will help children with autism make the transition to work. The bill will require the Department of Labor to conduct a comprehensive review of existing vocational training programs to assess whether they are adequately serving the needs of disabled persons, particularly those persons with autism. The Department of Labor will then establish an annual report to Congress in which each department lists what measures it is taking to make their training programs more accessible and more effective in helping autistic adults make the transition to part time or full time employment. The Department of Labor should also include a list of legislative recommendations to Congress for making improvements in ways to make the transition to work for disabled persons easier.  As you may know, there is limited information on the prevalence, cause, or treatment of autism. In order to unlock the mysteries of autism, the members of C.A.R.E. are working to increase funding levels for programs focusing on autism spectrum disorders so that our nation can pursue several emerging scientific opportunities.  First, we requested a $20 million increase at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for  Second, we asked for a $5 million dollar increase at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for FY 2002. These additional funds would be used to implement the ``Centers of Excellence in Autism Epidemiology'' specified in P.L. 106-310. This is a program I authored, which was included as Title I of P.L. 106-310. Furthermore, funding will go towards awarding grants and assistance to states which want to establish their own autism surveillance programs. This funding is essential as the CDC must collect data from approximately 30 states before it can move forward with a comprehensive analysis of trends that may reveal correlative factors, potential causes, and hopefully effective treatments and cures for autism.  C.A.R.E. has been involved in other autism initiatives as well. On March 29, C.A.R.E. introduced H. Con. Res. 91, which calls upon Congress to support April as Autism Awareness Month and today as Autism Awareness Day. The resolution also commends the parents and relatives of autistic children for their sacrifice and dedication in providing for the special needs of their autistic children. In addition, H. Con. Res. 91 endorses the goals of increasing federal funding for aggressive research to learn the root causes of autism.  The Second Annual Autism Rally that is being held today in Washington is a prime example of how important citizen participation in our democratic process is. There are no more eloquent and powerful advocates for autism research and education than the parents of those who must love and care for their autistic child each and every day. We are deeply indebted to the parents and families who care for autistic children. Without you, these children would be hopelessly lost. It is my hope that the federal government can help provide you with its tools you need to continue your excellent work.                          ____________________
