 I think that is so vague that it is going to ignite a litigation derby. That is No. 1.  No. 2, we have had a kind of mixing of the concept of punitive damages and proportionality by the Senator from Massachusetts that I think is just not borne out by the bipartisan bill. Our punitive damage limitation applies only to small business. It has nothing to do with reckless behavior or careless behavior.  On proportionality, we are saying that you can hold everybody liable for exactly what they contribute, whether they are a small business or anything else.  Finally, on the example of the person, I believe it was Mrs. Barnes, and the chemical plant, she has all her existing remedies with respect to personal injury and wrongful conduct under negligence law. That is all outlined on page 10.  I appreciate the chairman of the Commerce Committee yielding me the time to briefly make a response to the Kerry amendment. As I say, I am a Senator who agrees with the Senator from Massachusetts on so many things. I do share his view that I hope by the time we are done with this legislation, we can have something that gets upwards of 70 votes. But suffice it to say, this Senator believes, with all due respect, the proposal of the Senator from Massachusetts will be a lightning rod for a variety of frivolous lawsuits.  I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding.
