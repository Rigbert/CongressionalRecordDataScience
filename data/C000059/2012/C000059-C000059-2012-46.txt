Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Janet Cleghorn. Jan passed away on Thursday, February 16, 2012. Jan was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother and she will be deeply missed.  Jan was born July 20, 1936 in Los Angeles, California. She was the daughter of Howard B. Everett and Florence Mae Hunt. On February 3, 1956, Jan married her high school sweetheart John Cleghorn. John would later serve as Corona's Chief of Police. Jan cherished her role as wife, mother and homemaker for 56 years.  Jan loved family, friends, crafting, RV traveling, decorating her home and more recently ``Facebook social networking.'' She was a member of the Philanthropic Educational Organization Chapter SI, Corona-Riverside U.S. Navy League, Corona Heritage Foundation (Museum Docent Heritage Park), Trilogy RVers and Friday Night-Dinner Group.  Jan is survived by her husband, John Cleghorn, father, Howard B. Everett, son, David Cleghorn, daughter, Nancy (Tim) O'Gorman, daughter, Karen (Roger, Sr.) Minnick, grandchildren, Roger (Angela) Minnick, Jr., Elijah Minnick, Jonah Minnick, Melissa O'Gorman, Joseph O'Gorman, great-grandchildren, Berkleigh Minnick and Max Minnick. Memorial Services to celebrate Jan's life were held at Trilogy Lodge Ballroom, Tuesday, February 28, 2012.  Jan will always be remembered for her devotion to family, caring nature and selfless giving. Her dedication to those she loved is a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Jan's family and friends; although Jan may be gone, the light and goodness she brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
