President, at the end of this year, Congress will say farewell to Dr. James Billington, a dear friend who, for the last 28 years, has dedicated his life to ensuring that the Nation's most prominent library is an unparalleled resource for all who visit, either in person or online. Since his nomination by President Reagan in 1987 and subsequent confirmation by the United States Senate, Dr. Billington has led the Library of Congress into the digital era, and expanded its relationships internationally and with the private sector.  For almost three decades, Dr. Billington championed the National Digital Library program, which made millions of rare and one-of-a-kind historical and cultural documents readily available to the public. The National Digital Library was a colossal undertaking and one that students and scholars alike will utilize for many years to come.  In 1990, Dr. Billington created the James Madison Council, an advisory panel that serves as a liaison between the Library and the business community. The Council was the Library's first national private-sector advisory and support group, and has since helped to fund more than 360 projects. Dr. Billington's devotion to the growth and development of the Library of Congress has helped bring a national treasure into the 21st Century and improve access for people all over the country and the world.  Dr. Billington has also worked to expand the Library of Congress' online resources by collaborating with Russian libraries to establish a major bilingual website. He later completed similar joint projects with the national libraries of Brazil, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and Egypt. Dr. Billington spearheaded efforts to create the World Digital Library, which was successfully launched in April 2009. Today, the site contains cultural materials from all 193 countries in the United Nation's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, with commentary in seven languages. As the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Billington led a delegation to Tehran, Iran, in October 2004, making him the most senior U.S. government official to visit Iran in 25 years and furthering his international leadership.  Throughout his 42 years in public service in Washington, Dr. Billington has collaborated on numerous programs such as the Veterans History Project, highlighting the great accomplishments of countless Americansthrough oral histories, the National Book Festival, and the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Dr. Billington's brilliance, devotion, and vision throughout his career is unparalleled and incredibly appreciated.  Marcelle and I were happy to welcome Dr. Billington to Vermont in 2012, to celebrate the sesquicentennial of the historic Land Grant College Act, authored by Vermont Senator Justin Morrill in the 1800s. Like Justin Morrill, Dr. Billington and I share a profound regard for the importance of Federal investment in access to education. I have deeply appreciated Dr. Billington's commitment to preserving and advancing the incredible resource that is the Library of Congress. Marcelle and I both thank him for his service and wish he and his wife Marjorie well as he begins this new chapter.                          ____________________
