Speaker, at a time when crime concerns are on every citizen's mind, those who have dedicated their lives to law enforcement are to be commended. I would like to make a special commendation to three law enforcement officers from Indiana's First Congressional District: Chief Jesse W. Cook, Sgt. William Schultz, and Sgt. Stephan Neese. Chief Cook will retire in October of this year, Sergeant Schultz will retire this month, and Sergeant Neese retired back in May of this year. These three men celebrated their retirement at a testimonial dinner on Friday, September 13, 1996, at Teibel's Restaurant in Schererville, IN.  When Chief Cook began his career at the Schererville Police Department in 1972 as a juvenile detective, he was one of only seven officers. Currently, the Scherervill Police Department boasts 37 police officers. After working his way up the ranks, he became chief of police in 1972. During his distinguished career, Chief Cook completed studies at the FBI National Academy in 1984, and he earned a degree in criminal justice from Indiana University Northwest in 1994.  Sergeants Schultz and Neese each served 20 years with the Schererville Police Department. In 1976, they both began their careers as probationary patrolmen. Sergeant Schultz was next assigned as the Schererville Police Department's first K-9 officer, and Sergeant Neese became the department's first accident reconstructionist. Sergeant Neese was instrumental in developing this particular department. Both men worked diligently through the ranks to earn their final appointments as sergeant.  These brave men can be proud of their service to Indiana's First Congressional District. They worked hard to make the town of Schererville a safer place in which to live and work. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Chief Jesse W. Cook, Sgt. Stephan Neese, and Sgt. William Schultz on their service and dedication to the citizens of Schererville.                          ____________________
