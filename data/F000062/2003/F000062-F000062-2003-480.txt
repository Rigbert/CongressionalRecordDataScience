 President, I wish to ask the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Indiana some questions about one of the issues that was raised during the hearings conducted by his committee on this treaty, and one of the questions not addressed by this treaty that I believe to be critical to reducing the danger of accidental or unauthorized nuclear war: the alert status of U.S. and Russian nuclear forces.  Like me, I know that they are concerned that the current alert status ofU.S. and Russian nuclear forces leaves open the possibility that, by continuing to maintain those nuclear forces that will not be operationally deployed under the Moscow Treaty on so-called hair trigger alert status, we increase the chances of an accidental or mistaken launch of nuclear weapons or, worse still, provide additional vulnerability to terrorist who might seek to hack into our nuclear command and control system and launch weapons.  I was pleased to note that the report of the Foreign Relations Committee on this treaty addresses the concerns that the alert status issue creates for crisis stability raised by former Senator Nunn, and the suggestion made by Gen. Eugene Habiger, the former Commander in Chief of U.S. Strategic Command that ``We may have to find a way to move more weapons off alert status''.  What are the views of the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Indiana on this issue, and the desirability of moving nuclear weapons off alert status?
