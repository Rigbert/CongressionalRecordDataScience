Speaker, it's no secret that Wall Street is rampant with cases of outright fraud, backroom deals and very, very special political access. Meanwhile, Main Street is pushing back hard against this tide by investing in our communities and struggling to create jobs so our economy can grow.  A steady series of probing news stories have begun to expose the depth of corruption that precipitated the Wall Street meltdown and why it is so hard for Main Street to recover.  Bloomberg just released a story detailing how the former Secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson, provided special insider information to well connected Wall Street executives in July of 2008, just before the meltdown. According to Bloomberg, on the very same day the former Secretary told The New York Times that he expected the examinations of the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would ``give a signal of confidence to the markets,'' he informed a select group of his friends on Wall Street later in the day that in reality, there was a plan for placing ``Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship,'' which amounts to a government seizure. Those firms got insider information, and one can ask, did they then place bets to protect their interests? I bet they did.  One of the fund managers in that meeting said ``he was shocked that Paulson would furnish such specific information, leaving little doubt that the Treasury Department would carry out that plan.'' In the words of William Black, law expert at the University of Missouri, ``There was no legitimate reason for these disclosures.''  The Secretary of Treasury is supposed to be a public steward of our Nation's financial well-being. But when he told the public one story and then shared the inside track with his friends and colleagues from Goldman Sachs and other large firms, he broke that trust.                              {time}  1030  To be blunt, this is self-serving crony capitalism at its worst.  This is hardly the only case of special treatment of Wall Street insiders by Washington, insiders like Paulson, who was the former head of Goldman Sachs. Earlier this week, we saw a U.S. District Court throw out a settlement between the Securities & Exchange Commission and Citigroup. In 2008, Citigroup reportedly created, marketed, and sold a fund to investors. What Citigroup did not disclose is that the bank itself was actually betting against their own fund. This fraudulent deal made Citigroup $160 million while costing the fund's investors $700 million in losses, and counting.  The SEC's response to this fraud was a $285 million settlement, slightly more than a third of the reported losses incurred by the victims of this fraud. Citigroup was not even required to admit any wrongdoing. The federal judge was absolutely correct to throw this case out. The SEC's policy of allowing large Wall Street firms to walk away from fraud cases without so much as admitting any wrongdoing is completely inappropriate and invites more corruption.  Growing reports of fraud are staggering, and they underlie the Wall Street dealing that has so harmed our Nation. Throughout November, we saw headline after headline of how MF Global took money from its own private customer accounts as it tried to stay afloat in the days before it filed one of the largest bankruptcies in American history. There may be as much as $1.2 billion unaccounted for. We used to call that stealing.  The fact is our Justice Department has only a handful of FBI agents to properly investigate the volume of corruption infecting our markets. After reviewing the FBI's own testimonies, I introduced H.R. 1350, the Financial Crisis Criminal Investigation Act, to authorize an additional 1,000 FBI agents and forensic experts to prosecute white collar crime, especially Wall Street. Back in the 1990s when we had the S&L crisis, we had a thousand agents. When this crisis started, there were but a handful because they had all been switched to terrorism investigations.  When you look at these cases, what is astounding is just how well connected so many of these institutions on Wall Street are to the corridors of power in Washington. It now appears even former Speaker Newt Gingrich was paid millions of dollars by Freddie Mac before it went bankrupt.  At a minimum, our Nation needs an independent commission to investigate what actions led to the eventual collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by which Wall Street turned over all of its toxic mortgage paper to the taxpayers of the United States for the next three generations.  I have a bill to do just that, H.R. 2093. I ask other Members of the House to sponsor the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Criminal Investigative Commission Act.  So while real justice for Wall Street languishes in places from Cleveland to Toledo, Main Street America is trying to create jobs. It's over time for Washington to get its House in order to restore accountability to Wall Street so that full confidence can be restored to our economy. Exacting justice for Wall Street wrongdoing is long overdue. That task remains fundamental to economic recovery and job growth.         [From the Bloomberg Markets Margazine, Nov. 29, 2011]     How Paulson Gave Hedge Funds Advance Word of Fannie Mae Rescue                        (By Richard Teitelbaum)       Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson stepped off the elevator      into the Third Avenue offices of hedge fund Eton Park Capital      Management LP in Manhattan. It was July 21, 2008, and market      fears were mounting. Four months earlier, Bear Stearns Cos.      had sold itself for just $10 a share to JPMorgan Chase & Co.      (JPM).       Now, amid tumbling home prices and near-record      foreclosures, attention was focused on a new source of      contagion: Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac, which together      had more than $5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and      other debt outstanding, Bloomberg Markets reports in its      January issue.       Paulson had been pushing a plan in Congress to open lines      of credit to the two struggling firms and to grant authority      for the Treasury Department to buy equity in them. Yet he had      told reporters on July 13 that the firms must remain      shareholder owned and had testified at a Senate hearing two      days later that giving the government new power to intervene      made actual intervention improbable.       ``If you have a bazooka, and people know you have it,      you're not likely to take it out,'' he said.       On the morning of July 21, before the Eton Park meeting,      Paulson had spoken to New York Times reporters and editors,      according to his Treasury Department schedule. A Times      article the next day said the Federal Reserve and the Office      of the Comptroller of the Currency were inspecting Fannie and      Freddie's books and cited Paulson as saying he expected their      examination would give a signal of confidence to the markets.                          A Different Message       At the Eton Park meeting, he sent a different message,      according to a fund manager who attended. Over sandwiches and      pasta salad, he delivered that information to a group of men      capable of profiting from any disclosure.       Around the conference room table were a dozen or so hedge-     fund managers and other Wall Street executives--at least five      of them alumni of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), of which      Paulson was chief executive officer and chairman from 1999 to      2006. In addition     to Eton Park founder Eric Mindich they included such boldface      names as Lone Pine Capital LLC founder Stephen Mandel,      Dinakar Singh of TPG-Axon Capital Management LP and Daniel      Och of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC.       After a perfunctory discussion of the market turmoil, the      fund manager says, the discussion turned to Fannie Mae and      Freddie Mac. Paulson said he had erred by not punishing Bear      Stearns shareholders more severely. The secretary, then 62,      went on to describe a possible scenario for placing Fannie      and Freddie into ``conservatorship''--a government seizure      designed to allow the firms to continue operations despite      heavy losses in the mortgage markets. . . .                              shares rally       At the time Paulson privately addressed the fund managers      at Eton Park, he had given the market some positive signals--     and the GSEs' shares were rallying, with Fannie Mae's nearly      doubling in four days. William Black, associate professor of      economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City,      can't understand why Paulson felt impelled to share the      Treasury Department's plan with the fund managers.       ``You just never ever do that as a government regulator--     transmit nonpublic market information to market      participants,'' says Black, who's a former general counsel at      the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. ``There were no      legitimate reasons for those disclosures.''       Janet Tavakoli, founder of Chicago-based financial      consulting firm Tavakoli Structured Finance Inc., says the      meeting fits a pattern.       ``What is this but crony capitalism?'' she asks. ``Most      people have had their fill of it.''                           A Lawyer's Advice       The fund manager who described the meeting left after      coffee and called his lawyer. The attorney's quick      conclusion: Paulson's talk was material nonpublic      information, and his client should immediately stop trading      the shares of Washington-based Fannie and McLean, Virginia-     based Freddie. . . .                             Goldman Alums       One other Goldman Sachs alumnus was at the meeting: Frank      Brosens, founder and principal of Taconic Capital Advisors      LP, who worked at Goldman as an arbitrageur and who was a      protege of Robert Rubin, who went on to become Treasury      secretary.       Non-Goldman Sachs alumni who attended included short seller      James Chanos of Kynikos Associates Ltd., who helped uncover      the Enron Corp. accounting fraud; GS. Capital Partners LP co-     founder Bennett Goodman, who sold his firm to Blackstone      Group LP (BX) in early 2008; Roger Altman, chairman and      founder of New York investment bank Evercore Partners Inc.      (EVR); and Steven Rattner, a co-founder of private-equity      firm Quadrangle roup LLC, who went on to serve as head of the      U.S. government's Automotive Task Force. . . .                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Nov. 28, 2011]             Judge Blocks Citigroup Settlement With S.E.C.                           (By Edward Wyatt)       Washington.--Taking a broad swipe at the Securities and      Exchange Commission's practice of allowing companies to      settle cases without admitting that they had done anything      wrong, a federal judge on Monday rejected a $285 million      settlement between Citigroup and the agency.       The judge, Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court in      Manhattan, said that he could not determine whether the      agency's settlement with Citigroup was ``fair, reasonable,      adequate and in the public interest,'' as required by law,      because the agency had claimed, but had not proved, that      Citigroup committed fraud.       As it has in recent cases involving Bank of America,      JPMorgan Chase, UBS and others, the agency proposed to settle      the case by levying a fine on Citigroup and allowing it to      neither admit nor deny the agency's findings. Such      settlements require approval by a federal judge.       While other judges are not obligated to follow Judge      Rakoff's opinion, the 15-page ruling could severely undermine      the agency's enforcement efforts if it eventually blocks the      agency from settling cases in which the defendant does not      admit the charges.       The agency contends that it must settle most of the cases      it brings because it does not have the money or the staff to      battle deep-pocketed Wall Street firms in court. Wall Street      firms will rarely admit wrongdoing, the agency says, because      that can be used against them in investor lawsuits.       The agency in particular, Judge Rakoff argued, ``has a      duty, inherent in its statutory mission, to see that the      truth emerges.'' But it is difficult to tell what the agency      is getting from this settlement ``other than a quick      headline.'' Even a $285 million settlement, he said, ``is      pocket change to any entity as large as Citigroup,'' and      often viewed by Wall Street firms ``as a cost of doing      business.''       According to the Securities and Exchange Commission,      Citigroup stuffed a $1 billion mortgage fund that it sold to      investors in 2007 with securities that it believed would fail      so that it could bet against its customers and profit when      values declined. The fraud, the agency said, was in      Citigroup's falsely telling investors that an independent      party was choosing the portfolio's investments. Citigroup      made $160 million from the deal and investors lost $700      million.       Judge Rakoff said the agency settlement policy--``hallowed      by history, but not by reason''--creates substantial      potential for abuse because ``it asks the court to employ its      power and assert its authority when it does not know the      facts.'' That undermines the constitutional separation of      powers, he said, by asking the judiciary to rubber-stamp the      executive branch's interpretation of the law.       The agency said that it disagreed with the judge's ruling      but did not say whether it would appeal, or try to refashion      the settlement or prepare to begin a trial, as the judge      directed, on July 16.       Robert Khuzami, the agency's director of enforcement, said      in a statement that the Citigroup settlement ``reasonably      reflects the scope of relief that would be obtained after a      successful trial,'' and that the decision ``ignores decades      of established practice throughout federal agencies and      decisions of the federal courts.''       Citigroup said it also disagreed with Judge Rakoff's      decision, adding that it would fight the charges if the case      indeed went to trial.       ``We believe the proposed settlement is a fair and      reasonable resolution to the S.E.C.'s allegation of      negligence, which relates to a five-year-old transaction,''      Edward Skyler, a Citigroup spokesman, said in a statement      ``We also believe the settlement fully complies with long-     established legal standards. In the event the case is tried,      we would present substantial factual and legal defenses to      the charges.''       In his decision, Judge Rakoff called Citigroup ``a      recidivist'' or repeat offender, for having Previously      settled other fraud cases with the agency where it neither      admitted nor denied the allegations but agreed never to      violate the law in the future.       Citigroup and other repeat offenders can agree to those      terms, the judge said, because they know that the commission      has not monitored compliance, failing to bring contempt      charges for repeat violations in at least 10 years.       A recent analysis by The New York Times of the agency's      fraud settlements with Wall Street firms found 51 instances,      involving 19 companies, in which the agency claimed that a      company had broken fraud laws that they previously had agreed      never to breach. Securities law experts said that the ruling      presents the agency with a tough dilemma. In future cases, it      will have to consider the risk that another judge may be      reluctant to approve a settlement given the Rakoff ruling.       ``This is clearly a case of great significance,'' said      Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the agency who is now chief      executive at Kalorama Partners in Washington. ``It's also a      case for which there is no direct precedent Courts have been      approving settlements by government agencies without any      admissions of wrongdoing for years.''       On the other hand, Mr. Pitt noted, ``there is no suggestion      here that this decision would apply in every single case,''      because Citigroup has reached such settlements before, a      situation that sets this case apart from many Securities and      Exchange Commission settlements.       Judge Rakoff has been a frequent critic of the agency's      settlements. In 2009, he rejected a proposed $33 million      settlement with Bank of America for a case in which the      agency said the bank had misled shareholders over its      acquisition of Merrill Lynch. He eventually approved a $150      million settlement after the agency presented further      evidence of the bank's wrongdoing.       The judge also noted the difference between the agency's      settlement with Citigroup and its settlement last year with      Goldman Sachs in a similar mortgage-derivatives case. Goldman      was required to say that its marketing materials for the      product ``contained incomplete information.''       In the Citigroup case, no such facts were agreed on. ``An      application of judicial power that does not rest on facts is      worse than mindless, it is inherently dangerous,'' Judge      Rakoff wrote. ``In any case like this that touches on the      transparency of financial markets whose gyrations have so      depressed our economy and debilitated our lives, there is an      overriding public interest in knowing the truth.''       Mr. Khuzami took issue with the judge's characterization of      the settlement ``These are not `mere' allegations,'' he said,      ``but the reasoned conclusions of the federal agency      responsible for the enforcement of the securities laws after      a thorough and careful investigation of the facts.''       Barbara Black, a professor at the University of Cincinnati      College of Law who edits the Securities Law Prof Blog, said      that the decision was interesting because Judge Rakoff      carefully treads the line between the deference that judges      are supposed to show to regulatory agencies while also      ensuring that the court does not simply rubber-stamp      decisions.       In a legal dispute between two private parties, they can      agree to whatever settlement they desire, Ms. Black said. But      in a case involving a public agency with consequences that      affect the public interest, there has to be some kind of      acknowledgment that certain things did occur, she added.      Duties and Functions of the U.S. Department of the Treasury                                Mission       Maintain a strong economy and create economic and job      opportunities by promoting the conditions that enable      economic growth and stability at home and abroad, strengthen      national security by combating threats and     protecting the integrity of the financial system, and manage      the U.S. Government's finances and resources effectively.       Treasury's mission highlights its role as the steward of      U.S. economic and financial systems, and as an influential      participant in the world economy.       The Treasury Department is the executive agency responsible      for promoting economic prosperity and ensuring the financial      security of the United States. The Department is responsible      for a wide range of activities such as advising the President      on economic and financial issues, encouraging sustainable      economic growth, and fostering improved governance in      financial institutions. The Department of the Treasury      operates and maintains systems that are critical to the      nation's financial infrastructure, such as the production of      coin and currency, the disbursement of payments to the      American public, revenue collection, and the borrowing of      funds necessary to run the federal government. The Department      works with other federal agencies, foreign governments, and      international financial institutions to encourage global      economic growth, raise standards of living, and to the extent      possible, predict and prevent economic and financial crises.      The Treasury Department also performs a critical and far-     reaching role in enhancing national security by implementing      economic sanctions against foreign threats to the U.S.,      identifying and targeting the financial support networks of      national security threats, and improving the safeguards of      our financial systems.                              Organization       The Department of the Treasury is organized into two major      components the Departmental offices and the operating      bureaus. The Departmental Offices are primarily responsible      for the formulation of policy and management of the      Department as a whole, while the operating bureaus carry out      the specific operations assigned to the Department. Our      bureaus make up 98% of the Treasury work force. The basic      functions of the Department of the Treasury include:       Managing Federal finances;       Collecting taxes, duties and monies paid to and due to the      U.S. and paying all bills of the U.S.;       Currency and coinage;       Managing Government accounts and the public debt;       Supervising national banks and thrift institutions;       Advising on domestic and international financial, monetary,      economic, trade and tax policy;       Enforcing Federal finance and tax laws;       Investigating and prosecuting tax evaders, counterfeiters,      and forgers.                          ____________________
