 That turnout is directly related to what we have been talking about in terms of huge tax breaks for large corporations and wealthy people and cutbacks that will be coming in Medicaid, Medicare, student loans for those young people who today are having a hard time getting into college, WIC, Head Start, you name it. Every program that every working person, elderly person and kid in this country needs is on the chopping block.  What is going on, and Mr. DeFazio stated it well, if you have only 38 percent of the people who are voting and if the vast majority of low income and working people do not vote, those people are invisible.                              {time}  2045  You don't have any health insurance, so what? Who cares? Your pain is not reflected on the floor of this House.  You can't afford to send your kid to college? So what? No one is going to pay attention to you unless you make your concerns known by getting involved politically.  What goes on is that the vast majority of poor people and working people don't vote. Therefore, they are politically invisible. But there are some people who understand the political system very well. It is not just that the upper income people vote in very high percentages, but they contribute huge amounts of money to political campaigns. If a corporation like Amway or some other large corporation contributes hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party, don't you think that maybe the leadership of the Republican Party is going to sit down and listen to their concerns? If wealthy people contribute thousands and thousands of dollars to the party of their choice, they have enormous power in shaping the agenda.  The gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio] was suggesting that on his subcommittee, lobbyists paid a major role in writing the legislation. That is what is going on. The only way to change that situation is when working people and low-income people say, ``Wait a minute. This country belongs to all of us, not just the wealthy and the powerful.'' One person-one vote. It is not how much you contribute. It is not a $10,000 contribution gives me power. That is not what it is supposed to be about. One person-one vote.  I absolutely agree with the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio] that we are not going to change the priorities and the agenda of the Congress so that it begins to pay attention to ordinary Americans, working people, unless we make radical changes in who participates, who votes.  If you are not happy with what is going on, you can ignore everything and not vote. The people who own America are delighted. That is exactly what they want. They want you to think that politics is a joke, that it is irrelevant. They don't think it is irrelevant. They contribute huge amounts of money. They help determine the agenda. So if you want to have some input, you have got to participate politically, you have got to vote, you have got to get involved.  Mr. DeFAZIO. If the gentleman would yield, I am going to have to leave shortly, I would just like to change the subject for a moment but it bears on the whole discussion, again, why people are so cynical about what is going on in Washington. It goes to the subject that we have spent some time on, on the floor earlier this year, which is the bailout of Mexico.  There is an article, a very interesting article from yesterday's Los Angeles Times. It says it more succinctly than I could.  Thus far, the United States has put up $20 billion of our taxpayer dollars through a rather secretive fund controlled by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury and Mexico has spent slightly more than $4 billion of the funds. There is some discussion, we heard certainly from Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole in the Senate who were avid supporters of the Mexico bailout who are not trying to sort of cover that up, but they were there, they signed on with the administration, the President and Robert Rubin. They were all together. This is again why people are cynical because they saw a Democratic President and a newly elected House Speaker and a newly elected majority leader, both Republicans, in the House and the Senate signing on to the same $40 billion bailout of Mexico.  Here is what the Los Angeles Times says about the first $4 billion of our money that has gone to this bailout:       Much of the money never left New York. It was paid out by      the Federal Reserve in New York, where it was used to redeem      the high profit bonds held primarily by major U.S.      institutions, Wall Street speculators, and wealthy Mexicans      who bought the securities largely through non-taxable      offshore corporations according to investment sources and      market analysts.  So here it is. We are supposedly saving our neighbors to the south in a gesture of good will and the money changes hands from our tax deposits with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve in New York directly into the bank vaults of the speculators and the wealthy investment banks in New York City. This kind of outrage is again part of what brings people to cynicism. At the same time as that is going on, we see in yesterday's Washington Post a little headline saying power to boost dollar doubted. Dollar hits a record low 3 days in row against the Japanese yen. We are basically heading to one dollar and one yen the way we are going here and the United States cannot do anything about it.  Why? In great part because we are too involved in attempting to prop up the failing government of Mexico and the crashing peso and as soon as we became associated dollar with peso like a Eurocurrency, the dollar started plummeting. This is a good part of the problem.
