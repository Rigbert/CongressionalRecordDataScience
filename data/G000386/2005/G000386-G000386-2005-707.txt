 President, after great effort by many people, the Senate is ready to move us one step closer to enacting legislation with the potential to impact all Americans in every state. Crumbling infrastructure and poor transportation choices impede our ability to live and do business, and the Senate clearly recognizes that fact. Our transportation bill utilizes more than $295 billion to ensure all Americans have access to efficient and reliable transportation as they go about their professional and personal lives.  Among the many people whose hard work has made the difference, I must first thank the chairmen and ranking members of all the appropriating committees that have been involved in this process.  Credit must also go to all members of my staff, who spent many hours sifting through the nuts and bolts of this bill. Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr, Ed McClellan, Dean Zerbe, John O'Neill, Sherry Kuntz, and Nick Wyatt showed great dedication to the tasks before them.  As is usually the case, the cooperation of Senator Baucus and his staff was imperative. I particularly want to thank Russ Sullivan, Patrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Kathy Ruffalo-Farnsworth, Matt Jones, Jon Selib, Anita Horn Rizek, Judy Miller, Melissa Mueller, Ryan Abraham, Mary Baker, and Wendy Carey.  I also want to mention George K. Yin, the chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and his staff, especially the fuel fraud team of Tom Barthold, Deirdre James, Roger Colinvaux, and Allen Littman, as well as the always invaluable assistance of Mark Mathiesen, Jim Fransen and Mark McGunagle of Senate Legislative Counsel.  This bill is infused with the spirit of bipartisan cooperation. Hopefully that spirit will survive the ongoing legislative process.
