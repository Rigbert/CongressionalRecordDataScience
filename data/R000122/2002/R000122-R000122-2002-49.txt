Senator Warner's amendment directs that any savings from inflation should be used in one of two ways: for the research and development of missile defense or for combating terrorism. However, Senator Warner's amendment does not choose which area is more worthy of attention, and therefore it risks compromising both.  Our job in deciding the budget is about making hard choices. Senator Levin's amendment simply sets priorities and it states that combating terrorism should be this administration's top priority.  I do not think this is a difficult decision. We must remember that this amendment only authorizes funding for fiscal year 2003. And in the next 18 months, the citizens of the United States are going to be anxious, and even afraid, of a car bomb, an explosion in a harbor, an explosion in a mall, a dirty bomb, a biological attack. I think the way to protect Americans is clear: put resources into counterterrorism.  The senior Senator from Virginia has been assured by the Office of Management and Budget that there will be over $800 million in inflation savings at the midsession review. At that time, the President will have a choice. He can invest $800 million more into a missile defense program that has already been robustly funded at $6.8 billion or the President can invest the funds in the $1 billion of counterterrorism requirements that the military has asked for and not received.  The Levin amendment expresses the views of Congress, and I believe the views of the American people, that resources directed toward the most immediate need, the most immediate threat, fighting terrorism, will best protect the United States and its citizens.
