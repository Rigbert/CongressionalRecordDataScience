 President, I ask unanimous consent that the fiscal year 1994 compliance option request regarding the budget, where the IRS requested this, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  Fiscal Year 1994 Compliance Options     Key Area: Accounts Receivable.     Concern: Implementation of Private Collection Agency Program          Pilot Objective.       We are requesting the direct hire of 41 FTEs and $5.790      million in start up funds. This will enable the IRS      Collection to contract for a test to determine the      effectiveness/cost benefit of having private sector      collection agencies work a portion of delinquent taxes      inventory not being worked due to resource constraints.                              program area       A feasibility study on contracting our collection work was      completed by a cross-functional group in December 1991. This      group concluded that contracting out could be an effective      means to address portions of the Collection inventory that      have not been worked, or that have been worked with little or      no revenue collected. Benefits of this approach would include      a direct reduction in accounts receivable dollar inventory      (ARDI), and a reduction of taxpayer burden.       A test using commercial vendors to collect delinquent taxes      will require the establishment of a national program office      to plan and oversee implementation of the pilot test site.      Collection agencies would be involved      with the collection of accounts with a balance due of $10,000 or less,      or accounts receivable deemed too low for immediate IRS      involvement. This project requires a national centralized      focal point to oversee the program development and to      complete testing before implementation. This proposal has the      potential to reduce excessive taxpayer burden while      increasing revenue.       In addition to personnel this initiative will require start      up funds for contractual services. It is not anticipated that      the IRS will be able to have a normal business relationship      with the collection agencies involved with this program. In      the private sector, accounts receivable are collected or sold      to a vendor who then retains a portion of the receipts as      payment. The IRS must receive the entire portion that is to      be applied towards the taxpayer balance due. Then a      prearranged payment would be paid to the vendor. We estimate      $12.5 million would be needed up-front, $5.790 million in      FY94 and $6.710 million in FY95.                           types of employees       We are proposing the direct hiring of 41 FTE/positions, to      be distributed as follows: 14 positions to be hired by the      beginning of the first quarter of FY 1994 for the project      office; 17 positions to be located at the ACS test site      location; and 10 positions will be located at the Service      Center support site.                            historical data       This is a first time pilot, there are no historical      records.                           revenue estimates----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                         Fiscal year--                                                                                        ----------------------------------      Total                                                                          1994             1995                      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Revenue:                                                                                                          Projections................................................     $26,859,000      $34,993,000      $61,852,000   Cost.......................................................

We assume a collection rate of 5% of the case value.       The test is scheduled to start in January of FY94; 75% of      the revenue is reported in FY94 and 25% in FY95.       As of June 1992 inventories in the queue and currently not      collectable (CNC) were as follows:------------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Queue       CNC        Total  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Taxpayers.............................   470,000   1,400,000   1,870,000Dollar/value (billions)...............         3          30          33Avg dollars per T/P...................     6,410      21,311  ..........------------------------------------------------------------------------       This request is for a limited one year controlled pilot.      The experience gained through a pilot test would enable the      Service to better evaluate the concept's direct benefits and      costs, and to measure public acceptance. The contract would      include a one year renewable option for FY95.                              methodology       Contract out approximately 100,000 cases (taxpayers) from      the two categories listed.       The mix of cases will be approximately 60,000 out of the      queue and 40,000 from CNC.       The average dollar per case is assigned to the number of      cases that will be contracted out in each area:------------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Queue        CNC        Total  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Taxpayers...........................      60,000      40,000     100,000Avg dollars per T/P.................       6,410      21,311  ..........Dollar value (thousands)............     384,600     852,440   1,237,040------------------------------------------------------------------------       Dollars collected would be approximately 61,852,000, (5%      collection rate).       The contract will be a fixed price deliverable contract      with an award fee pool, i.e. a fixed price per module with an      award if the contractor does an excellent job. The total cost      is based on the industry standard, which is 20% of what is      collected, approximately $12,500,000.       $5.790 million will be needed in FY94 and the other $6.710      million in FY95.
