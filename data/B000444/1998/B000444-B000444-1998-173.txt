 President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the House companion legislation--H.R. 3565--to S. 1985 the ``Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998'', which I introduced along with Senators Hatch, Leahy, DeWine and Sessions.  This week we celebrate National Police Week. As we honor those who protect us, it is important that we remember those who have fallen in the line of duty. However, more than mere remembrance is necessary. We must work to ensure that the loved ones these officers leave behind are comforted and assisted in every way. The Care for Police Survivors Act does just that.  This legislation modifies the Public Safety Officers Death Benefit program, which--as my colleagues know--establishes national programs that counsel and assist the families of slain police officers. The purpose of the Care for Police Survivors Act, which the House of Representatives passed overwhelmingly (403-8), is to enhance these national programs. It does so by directing more funds to these programs that counsel and support these families in the aftermath of tragedy. Under current law, these counseling programs have a ceiling of $150,000, this bill changes this to a floor of $150,000.  Mr. President, I have long been concerned about the plight of families of public safety officers killed in the line of duty--last year, Senator Specter and I introduced the Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act which provides for the education of the spouse and dependent children of law enforcement officers who die or are totally disabled in the line of duty. In that vein, this legislation offers assurance to those in the public safety profession--and even to those consideringservice as public safety officers--that there is a well established support system in place to comfort and assist their families and loved ones in the event that they die in the line of duty.  Mr. President, it is critical that we not only remember, but offer real help to the families of those police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our streets and homes safe.                          ____________________
