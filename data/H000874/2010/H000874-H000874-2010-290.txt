Since 1960, The Monocle has been a Capitol Hill institution--a place where generations of legislators, staff members, and visitors have come together to share stories and good food. As they mark a half-century of success, I offer my congratulations to Connie Valanos, who founded The Monocle and has passed it down as a legacy to his family; John Valanos and his wife Vasiliki, who own and operate The Monocle today; and maitre d' Nick Selimos, who has worked there for more than 30 years. May The Monocle enjoy another 50 years as a Washington landmark.
