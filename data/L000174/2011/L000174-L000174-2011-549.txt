I appreciate his work in the committee to expedite getting the bill out of the committee. Like him, I believe it is extraordinarily important to level the playing to allow American innovators to compete in the world and within our country. I compliment the Senator and, as he knows, I have included his proposal in the managers' amendment because I thought it was a good proposal.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 5 p.m. be for debate on the Leahy-Grassley amendment No. 121, as modified, which I believe is pending, and the Vitter for Toomey amendment No. 112, as modified, en bloc, and divided between the two leaders or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Leahy-Grassley amendment No. 121, as modified; that upon disposition of the Leahy-Grassley amendment, the Senate vote in relation to the Vitter for Toomey amendment No. 112, as modified; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; and that there be no amendments in order to any of the amendments listed in this agreement prior to the vote; further, that the Vitter amendment No. 113, as modified, be withdrawn.
