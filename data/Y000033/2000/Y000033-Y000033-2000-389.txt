Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this is a very simple amendment. It eliminates the incentives claim. It more clearly defines the State plan within title I, and ensures the coastal impact assistance uses adhere to the State and Federal laws. It creates a multi-State competitive grant program. It removes a typo error within title II. It clarifies a provision within title II.  It is supported by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Boehlert), the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone). The gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) and I have agreed to this amendment, and it is in the manager's substitute. I urge the passage of the legislation.
