R. 2673, the Omnibus appropriations measure. Under the order, there will be 4\1/2\ hours for debate prior to the second cloture vote. I join with the majority leader in hoping cloture will be invoked tomorrow and that the Senate can then conclude action on this vital funding measure. Senators should, therefore, expect votes tomorrow afternoon, and all Members will be notified when those votes are scheduled.  I see the chairman of the Appropriations Committee sitting over there with a smile on his face at the prospect of completing our work for the current fiscal year.                          ____________________
