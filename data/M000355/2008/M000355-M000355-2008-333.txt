 President, I had a chance earlier this morning to attend the signing ceremony for legislation to award Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal. I wish to thank the President and the First Lady for their continued support on this issue.  For more than 20 years, Aung San Suu Kyi's support for justice and democracy has placed her at odds with the tyranny and oppression of the Burmese junta. She and her supporters have combated the brutality of the junta with peaceful protests and resistance. Suu Kyi has chosen dignity as her weapon, and she has found allies around the world to aid her in this struggle.  By awarding Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal, we are letting the world know the American people would stand with her and the freedom-loving people of Burma.                          ____________________
