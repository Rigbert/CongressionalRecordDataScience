 Apparently, there is a delegation leaving for Doha Wednesday night. Can the gentleman reflect upon what might be on the schedule for Thursday that they might miss?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, I have heard of delegations leaving on Wednesday night and understand that, and that is why we anticipate a very light load, if any, on Thursday. But I cannot definitively say there will not be votes on Thursday. I think with the two sides of the aisle working together, we can come to some accommodation to where we can properly celebrate, not celebrate, that is not the right word.
