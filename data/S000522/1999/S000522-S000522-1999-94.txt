Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, again, I want to repeat my request to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters). We were unable to work it out in that short time we had together.  I wanted to put, in lieu of ``the release of'' Lori Berenson, ``a fair trial pursuant to international standards.'' Regrettably, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters) wanted to add the words, ``or release,'' or, as she just pointed out, 1 year later there would be a release.  I can say this having raised this issue myself before, with all my force. I have been concerned about it, like many Members on both sides of the aisle. But the issue here is one of fair trial and not of judging the evidence, because there is a lot of evidence, pro and con. Regrettably, in a sense of the Congress, which is a very serious matter, we should not go on record calling for the release of someone about whose innocence we are not persuaded one way or the other when the allegation is of a very, very serious terrorism charge.
