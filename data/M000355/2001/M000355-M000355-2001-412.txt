 President, I say to the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Oregon, we have had an opportunity to review the amendment and discuss it on the floor. As everyone knows, current law already requires certain things of the candidates, but this amendment is a useful addition that codifies and clarifies the law.  Consequently, I am happy to support it and see no particular need for a rollcall vote unless there is a desire to do so on the other side.
