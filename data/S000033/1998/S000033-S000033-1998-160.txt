 Speaker, I submit for the Record statements by high school students from my home state of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today:       Statement by Nat White-Joyal regarding Medicinal Marijuana       Hi. My name is Nat White-Joyal. I want to talk about the      legalization of marijuana for medical and homeopathic uses.       I think that it is necessary, for people who suffer from      certain diseases where marijuana can be helpful to them, that      it be legal. For someone to always be knocking on your door      and wondering what that smell is and needing to have that to      be comfortable and to sort of have--I don't want to say      survival, but to have a more comfortable life.       I know that in several states, California and Arizona, that      laws are either to be introduced or have been passed about      legalizing medical marijuana. I am also aware of the pressure      that these people who grow it and use it receive from the      authorities. And I think that it is very important for these      people not to have that pressure. I know from people that I      know with certain diseases, hepatitis C and AIDS, that they      need marijuana to improve their appetite so that they don't      starve, so they can actually have some sort of energy. And I      think that it needs to be passed, not only in certain states,      but in the entire country.       I think it's something that is very important, and if you      were to look at actual numbers, it does actually help people      more than it hurts people. It is documented that marijuana      does kill brain cells, but so does alcohol and cigarettes,      and they are both legal, and they really don't provide any      use for any other purpose except for taste and addiction.       Now, people would argue that marijuana is only used to--you      know, people would only use marijuana to get stoned, but that      is really not true. The people who I know who use it use it      so that they can go on with their daily lives and, you know,      hold down a job, not have to call in sick every other day. I      feel it would be very important to have it legalized in      Vermont as well, because, I mean, it is a very important crop      for Vermont, whether it is legal or not. Statement by Ewing Fox and Damien Wyzga Regarding Youth Group Centers       EWING FOX: This room looks a lot bigger from up here.       Many students have already mentioned the need for a safe      teen environment. We think that we have a healthy alternative      to some of the ideas that people have come up with so far. I      think people have some good ideas, but I know a lot of kids      feel that there is a stigmatism around community youth      centers, and they're boring. There are too many adults, all      you can do is sit on a couch and, you know, watch TV or      something, and I think that Burlington's youth needs more      than that to stay occupied.       We are modeling a center, a youth group center, that is      called Main Street Park after a youth program that I visited      in Massachusetts several years ago. It was completely run by      students and volunteer parents. They had a snack bar,      concessions and vending, which paid for a lot of the cost. It      was housed in a public building. There were vending machines      that were donated, there was pool playing, and the parents      that would stay in an outer room that do the vending and      admissions, there was a small admissions fee, and the      majority of the center was run by the students. I think that      a program similar to that could work in Burlington.       I think we can also address the issue around skateboarders      in Burlington. I know I was eating lunch in City Hall park,      and I was appalled by watching these skateboarders like, you      know, walk up, take a jump, and get off their skate board,      tiptoe down the street and walk back. I think that is so      ridiculous, that some people have to be reduced to breaking a      law to do something that is as simple as riding a skateboard.       I think also, for a center like this to work, we need to      have a location. I know there is an empty building on lower      Main Street where the old flea market was. It has been like      that since I have been here, which isn't very long. And it is      useless property right     now, it's been sitting there and is pretty ugly, and nobody      does anything with it. It is close enough to downtown where      it would be, people who are downtown, hanging out, it is a      safe option for people, yet it is not so far from the      residential areas that it would be impossible to get to.       Our facility would have a movie room, pool tables, a skate      park, and vending machines to help pay for these things. The      reason for the skate park that I think is a really good idea      is we have a lot of skaters in Burlington, and there is no      skate parks in Vermont. I have a friend, josh, who was      supposed to be here, but could not. He traveled to Montreal,      travels like two and a half hours and pays $15 to $20 to go      skating to ride a skateboard. And I think that, the town      could charge $5, which would help cover maintenance costs and      things like that. And we can cut costs also by being indoors.      You might think that indoors is more expensive, but with an      outdoor facility you have to store all the ramps. You can't      just leave them out.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Let me just jump in there. Damien, do      you have something you wanted to add to that?       DAMIEN WYZGA: No.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Okay. You are here for company.       EWING FOX: I think this would allow kids to have a safe      place to be after school, even in the winter, because it goes      all the way through. We also have some safety requirements      like helmets and safety gear, and legal waivers.       It will be expensive though, it won't be cheap, and will      require the town's support, and Damien has some ideas on how      to finance it.       DAMIEN WYZGA: To finance this endeavor, we are going to      draw upon the city skate park fund. As far as I know, I think      there is about $60,000 in it. Once the center is open, we are      going to maintain it with revenue from vending machines,      video games, dollar movies, and a small entrance fee. We will      also promote local skate shops in Burton. Burton has excelled      in community outreach, programs, including its CHILL program,      which I was in. This is a program designed to give youth the      chance to snowboard.       We believe that, to begin this program, we will require      about $100,000 to build the ramps, jumps and half pipes. This      would also include the upkeep. We believe we will receive the      support from the community at large, and companies like      Burton, Original Sin. Cherry Bone, B Side, Snow School, Snow      Board Attic, and the American Ski Corporation.          Statement by Abby Krasner Regarding Student Activism       ABBY KRASNER: I am presenting the need for government      support for student activism and involvement in politics.      This issue is of great importance, because we have the lowest      voter turnout in any industrialized nation. Since the voting      age is 18, the best time to start to engage people in our      political system is in high school. Now, few 18-year-olds      know enough about policy issues beyond the sex lives of their      politicians.       Our involvement ensures a reversal in the trend of low      voter turnout. If this generation started to be involved, our      voter registration rates would increase as we got older. Soon      almost everyone would have a sense of responsibility for the      political and social state of our nation. Also, perhaps our      idealism can counteract the cynicism of the older people, to      put a positive slant on politics. If we become involved, the      word ``politics'' might not just mean a spectator sport in      which people are expected only to care about the winning and      losing sides; it might become a word that connotes caring      about other people and the condition of our society.       My experience shows that getting young people involved is      much less difficult than is ordinarily supposed. I am the co-     chair in Vermont for an organization called the International      Student Activism Alliance, a nationwide group dedicated to      helping students find a voice and express their concerns. In      this role, I have discovered many students in the state and      county who deeply care about the world around them. They      simply lack the resources to connect with each other, and      therefore often find it difficult to make a difference.       Since the student activism groups that exist have limited      funding, they are unable to reach the number of students they      would like to. I propose that state and/or national      governments support activism through several methods,      including funding. This student/congressional town meeting is      a good first step. If every state could have a comparable      meeting or conference put together by their Congressperson or      other elected official, students around the country would      have a forum to exchange their ideas.       The goal would be to involve as many students as possible.      Local groups of students would meet more frequently to focus      on what their involvement means to their community, state and      country. The statewide coalition of groups created by the      conference or meeting would communicate regularly. Delegates      from the state group would come together in a national      conference, where they would be able to share their opinions      with people from around the country. Their lawmakers would be      requested to meet with the group or with delegates privately,      to advise them. This would provide a link to the political      system, that would encourage the students to attempt to solve      their problems through the system. Another way to connect      students around the country is through electronic media.      Funding from the state could allow for a central web site to      be set up, an E-mail mailing list, or a national database      that listed the names and issues of socially active youth      around the country.       In all these efforts, we need the advice and support of our      lawmakers. We are fledgling activists, and are often so      unsure we can change anything that we don't attempt to. If      every politician were like Bernie and supported youth      involvement through involvements like this, the country would      be invigorated by young activists. We need financial support      to extend the research of organizations; but we also need      moral support to disprove the myth of teen apathy to the      world.                               ____________________
