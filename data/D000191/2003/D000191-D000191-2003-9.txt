  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, we have before us not a simple prescription drug benefit for seniors which they need and which is long overdue, not just a complicated, convoluted, expensive and inadequate benefit for seniors, it is the pharmaceutical promotion and profits protection act. It prohibits any mandated, or even negotiated reductions in the extortionate price of pharmaceuticals. Yes, it would outlaw the Federal Government negotiating for price reductions on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. It will block seniors who are seeking to import less expensive U.S. manufactured drugs from Canada. It provides a $20 billion subsidy to the private insurance industry to undermine Medicare. It is a cruel hoax targeted on the most vulnerable among us. It is not, as the gentleman from Florida said, bipartisan.  I knew Claude Pepper. I served with Claude Pepper. And FDR, I did not know him, but I know that he passed Social Security without a single Republican vote. And LBJ passed Medicare without support on that side. Now suddenly in defense of the pharmaceutical industry and the private insurance industry, they want to attack Medicare but pretend they are doing this for the good of seniors.                          ____________________
