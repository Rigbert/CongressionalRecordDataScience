In true patriotic fashion, on the day of our great Nation's celebration of independence, a naturalization ceremony will take place, welcoming new citizens of the United States of America. This memorable occasion, coordinated by the Hammond Public Library and presided over by Magistrate Judge Andrew Rodovich, will be held at Harrison Park in Hammond, Indiana.  America is a country founded by immigrants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the globe to the United States in search of better lives for themselves and their families. The upcoming oath ceremony will be a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America--that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize the great things America has to offer. They realize that there is nowhere else in the world that offers a better opportunity for success and a good life than here in America.  On July 4, 2009, the following individuals, representing many countries throughout the world, will take their oath of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Daniele Giuseppe Manfre, Ugochi Genevieve Okoro, Ilidoro Natanael Nevarez Rivas, Ravindranath Chigurupatl, Leela Rani Chigurupatl, Tran Quynh Nguyen, Miroslav Tepavac, Du Lin, Rosalia Navarrete, Igor Dmitriy Harris, Lubov Mullens, Rogelio Hernandez Plata, Erika Blacburn, Dhanwant Singh Sidhu, Konstantina Andreas Prokopos, Oluwabusola Anuoluwapo Binutu, Jori Beniaminovitch Tsvik, Nelia Prokophievna Repkina, Abdulla Hussein Ahdelqader, Ikram Sharawi, Juan Montoya Garcia, Jesus Loe Baeza, Humaira Sameer Minhas, Maribel Orozco De Loe, Marilyn Vincoy Morana, Anatoly Fedorovich Kolesnichenko, Inna Veniaminovna Borysova, Vesna Balac, Ruchira Shukla, Jacklyn Luong, Joanna Jadwiga Pierce, Rolee Khurana, Nikoleta Maginas, Yousef Shurri Qarbeit Al Armani, Said Yousef Musleh, Mohammed Ben Wanes, Juan Jose Lopez Moreno, Milena Losic, Alma Laura Nunez, Ramadan Amzai, Jose Antonio Garcia Guzman, Dao Chieu Anh Hui, Yasmeen Mohammd Yaseen ShreeiQun, Kamila Hendzel, Natalia Pelc, Truc Phuong Thi Lai, Katarzyna Jowita Przybyla-Kelly, Tanja Ognenovska, Suwit John Sangkaratana, Chirag Patel.  Though each individual has sought to become a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupation, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln described it, a country ``. . .of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful protest should they choose to do so.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals, who will become citizens of the United States of America on July 4, 2009, the day of our Nation's independence. They, too, will be American citizens, and they, too, will be guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic society, congratulate them and welcome them.                          ____________________
