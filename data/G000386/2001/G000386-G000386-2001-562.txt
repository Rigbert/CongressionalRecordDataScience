  The commissioners themselves said the vote was 8 to 1 on the small business provisions. So it is not accurate that there are major tensions with respect to these provisions.  I have a letter that I will put in the Record that shows a former commissioner of the Bankruptcy Commission saying the vote was 8 to 1 on the small business provisions.  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Bankruptcy Tax Consultant     To: Senator Charles E. Grassley     From: James I. Shepard       Senator Grassley: The National Bankruptcy Review Commission      adopted the Small Business Provisions in its report with      solid support, the vote was 8 to 1 in favor. There was little      dissension, the vote was NOT 5 to 4 as has been stated, the      Commission was not bitterly divided but, in fact, was      strongly in favor of the provisions.           Thank You,                                                 James I. Shepard.
