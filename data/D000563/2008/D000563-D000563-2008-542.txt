 On Wednesday, June 4, the International Olympic Committee announced that it had selected Chicago as one of the four finalists for 2016.  The Chicago 2016 organizers, the U.S. Olympic Committee, and the people of Chicago deserve praise for a job well done.  Because of their fine efforts, Chicago is well prepared to face stiff competition from the three remaining cities--Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo.  Chicago is a diverse city with culture and history to inspire people around the world. From our beautiful downtown parks to magnificent lakefront to terrific sports venues, Chicago is a world-class city that has what it takes to bring the Olympics back to the Midwest for the first time in over 100 years.  Last October, Chicago demonstrated its ability to host a major international sporting event, when 557 boxers and several thousand other visitors from more than a hundred countries traveled to Chicago for the World Boxing Championships, a qualifying event for this summer's Beijing Olympics.  Many of these people were first-time visitors who hadn't known what to expect going in, but who fell in love with the city. Those of us who know Chicago, who have lived and worked there, were not at all surprised by the visitors' rave reviews.  As the Chicago 2016 organizing committee has so eloquently put it:       Chicago is built on a bold tradition of dreams that we turn      into reality. From rebuilding our city to even greater glory      after the 1871 Fire, hosting the World's Columbian Exposition      and the 1933 World's Fair and transforming an old rail yard      into Millennium Park, dreaming and achieving is part of      Chicago's DNA.  The U.S. Government is working on several fronts to help support the U.S. bid. The Departments of State and Homeland Security are working to make the travel of legitimate Olympic athletes, coaches, and fans as smooth and hassle-free as possible.  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently held a hearing on ratification of the United Nations Convention Against Doping in Sport. The International Olympic Committee expects adherence to this Convention by countries that will host future Olympic Games.  I look forward to working with the Chicago 2016 organizing committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee, and my colleagues here in Congress as we move forward over the next 16 months preparing for the IOC's final decision in October 2009.  Again, I congratulate the great city of Chicago on its achievements to date, and I look forward to welcoming the 2016 Olympics to Illinois.                          ____________________
