 President, I rise this evening to talk about the budget that is before the Senate. But before I do, I want to add my voice to my colleagues who have come out here to express their condolences to our colleague, Senator Inouye, on the loss of his wife and long-time partner. Certainly, as the Senator from New Jersey said, Senator Inouye is the most respected Senator in this body, and he served his country well. Mrs. Inouye, too, has served her country by allowing Senator Inouye to be such a historic figure in this country and such a great leader and by all the time that was demanded by that. She has served her State, she has served her country, and we are all grateful. And to Senator Inouye, he and his family are in my thoughts and prayers as well.
