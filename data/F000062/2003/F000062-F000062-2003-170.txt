 President.  Just to continue on for a moment, I think what's going to happen in America is that more mayors of big cities will get more control over the schools, whether it is by appointing the school board or whether it is by having a separate entity involved in it. In the case of Chicago, I remember the Mayor appointed his chief of staff as head of the school board and his budget person, Paul G. Vallas, as superintendent of public instruction. So they had a working team to really turn the public school system around.  I would like to welcome the Mayor of the District of Columbia to the floor of the Senate.  Welcome, Mr. Mayor. Thank you very much.  I want everybody to know this is your request and your program. I don't know how many votes on our side of the aisle we will have for it, but I think it is a very important program to try. I think it is very important. I think because of the testing we have built into it, the same tests, the evaluation component, the fact is that your feet are going to be to the fire because this is your program and it is going to succeed or fail based on your energy, your staying power, your drive, your motivation. And I know it is there.  To the Presiding Officer, and to the manager of the bill, I have made my arguments. I am happy to answer any questions there may be, but I am hopeful this amendment will be agreed to and we will have an opportunity to try this pilot program.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Tennessee.
