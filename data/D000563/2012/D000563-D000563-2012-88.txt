America can breathe a sigh of political relief. When it was all said and done, more than 120 million Americans participated.  As we know, the American people have returned a divided government to Washington. We have a Democratic Senate with an increased majority, a Democratic President, and a Republican House of Representatives. Yet by a margin of 3.4 million popular votes and 126 electoral votes, President Obama was reelected.  Now that the dust has settled, we begin the time-honored tradition of inaugurating the President, swearing in new Members of Congress, and beginning a new session.
