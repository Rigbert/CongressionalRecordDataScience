Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Virginia Saunders, congressional document specialist at the Government Printing Office, for reaching 50 years of dedicated and enthusiastic Federal service on Friday, May 26, 1995.  Ms. Saunders was born Virginia R. Frisbie in Darlington, MD, on October 11, 1926. After working briefly at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, she came to the Government Printing Office on February 4, 1946, as a war service junior clerk typist in the division of public documents, stock section. Two years later, she was promoted to the division of public documents reference section. In February 1951, Ms. Saunders was promoted to indexing clerk and earned subsequent promotions in the same classification. In July 1958, she was promoted to library technician. Becoming a congressional documents specialist in April 1970, she was then promoted to supervisor of the congressional documents section in July 1974. In October 1983, Ms. Saunders assumed her current position of congressional documents specialist in the congressional printing management division, customer services.  Although one may not yet recognize the name of this outstanding GPO employee, the end product of her dedicated efforts is certainly familiar. Ms. Saunders has primary responsibility for the Congressional Serial Set, which is a compilation of all the House and Senate documents and reports issued for each session of Congress. Dummy volumes establishing the format for each edition are prepared and assigned a serial number following each session of Congress. The actual books are produced by GPO's binding division, often as many as 100 volumes per set for each session of Congress. As a chronicle of events of the U.S. Congress over the years, the Congressional Serial Set is rivaled only by the Congressional Record. While the Serial Set records behind-the-scenes legislative activities for the United States, the Congressional Record reflects the ``in session'' proceedings. Distributed to the House and Senate libraries, the Archives, the Library of Congress, and depository libraries, the Congressional Serial Set joins the Congressional Record in offering students and historians a rich insight into the American system of government.  In late 1989, Ms. Saunders drew upon her indepth knowledge of depository library program responsibilities in informing the Nation, and her then-43 years of GPO experience, to submit an employee suggestion regarding the appendix to the Iran Contra Report to Congress. She suggested that this 40-volume publication, which was printed as both a Senate and House report, be bound only once for the serial set volumes of House and Senate reports that are sent to depository libraries. She further suggested that the Schedule of Volumes, which is a listing of the bound volumes, contain a notation explaining the mission serial number voluments. The implementation of this suggestion resulted in a reduction of 13,740 book volumes to be bound, saving the Federal Government over $600,000. In recognition of these efforts, she received GPO's top monetary Suggestion Award for that year. In ceremonies held on January 9, 1991, Ms. Saunders was awarded a Presidential letter of commendation under the Presidential Quality and Management Improvement Award Program. In his letter to Ms. Saunders, President Bush noted, ``You have demonstrated to an exceptional degree my belief that Federal employees have the knowledge, ability, and desire to make a difference.''  I know my colleagues and Ms. Saunders' family, friends, and coworkers join me in congratulating her on 50 years of exemplary Federal service.                          ____________________
