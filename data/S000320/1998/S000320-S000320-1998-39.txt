 President, I rise today to eulogize and celebrate the life of one of Alabama's great native sons--Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr., who passed away July 21, 1998.  Dr. Irons was Distinguished Professor of History and Political Science Emeritus at Samford University, having served the University for 43 years. During that time, he taught a record number of University Presidents, 17.  Dr. Irons was the oldest member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and one of Alabama's athletic greats---the only Alabama track and distance star inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame from the University of Alabama. Mr. President, only three men have been inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame on the first ballot: Ralph Shug Jordan, Paul ``Bear'' Bryant, and Dr. George Irons.  Dr. Irons is survived by his wife, Velma Wright Irons, a distinguished educator and nominee for the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame at Judson College; two sons: Dr. George Vernon Irons, Jr., a cardiologist in Charlotte, North Carolina; and William Lee Irons, a prominent Birmingham attorney. Dr. Irons and his son William are the only father and son to be selected for the 1998 Who's Who in America from Alabama.  Mr. President, Dr. George Vernon Irons Sr., gave tirelessly of himself to God and country. He was a man of great distinction, and I take great pride in offering this tribute on his behalf.  Mr. President, the following tribute, edited to meet Congressional Record length requirements, was written by Dr. Irons' son. It provides a comprehensive and detailed account of Dr. Irons' life and many accomplishments.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the tribute written by Dr. Irons' son William be printed in the Record.  The tribute follows:                Tribute to Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr.                         (By William L. Irons)       Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr., arrived at Birmingham's      Howard College (now Samford University) in 1931. At that      time, the school was experiencing serious financial      difficulty, owing more than $400,000. Dr. Irons' first      assignment for the troubled school began when University      President Neal called him in and explained that the school      had been noticed for foreclosure. ``Your job, Irons, is to go      to the banker and stop this foreclosure,'' President Neal      directed.       Dr. Irons persuaded the banker, after much deliberation, to      grant the university a two-year extension. The rest is      history. Today, Samford University is the largest privately      endowed Baptist school in the world, and is the only Baptist      institution in America with an inspiring domed school of      divinity.       As a result of Dr. Irons' key role in assisting Howard      College to grow into an internationally acclaimed university,      he was elected by the Samford University faculty to serve as      Grand Marshall of all academic, graduation and commencement      exercises. Leading the academic processional for 15 years. In      1976, he was recognized by Samford University Faculty      Resolution for ``his impeccable character and qualities of      modesty, humility, kindness, and selfless service to the      University.''       While the final years of service often ebb, this was not      the case for Dr. Irons. In the last few months of his life,      at nearly 96 years of age, Dr. Irons secured a $100,000      scholarship contribution to Samford University as a perpetual      memorial to his academic excellence as Distinguished      Professor for 43 years.       In addition to his tireless efforts on behalf of Samford      University, Dr. Irons is known as a sports legend. In the      early 1920's, George Irons kept the athletic flame burning at      the University of Alabama as its ``Knight of the      Cinderpath.''       As a Junior in 1922, Irons won the prestigious A.A.U. Road      Race in Atlanta. That same year, Irons broke the A.A.U.      record,     running four miles in 17-minutes and 24-seconds---an average      of four, four-minute 21-second miles in succession. The four      minute mile record would not be broken until 30-years later.       Irons then won the All Southern S.I.A.A. Road Race in      Birmingham--a grueling three mile event over solid pavement.      In a hard, driving rain, he broke the record by more than 20      seconds. This record has never been equaled nor broken.       For his prowess on the track field, Irons ran himself into      the Alabama record books, including his addition to the      Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1978 on the first ballot--the      only track and distance runner ever inducted into the Hall of      Fame.       While at the University of Alabama, Dr. Irons was a Phi      Beta Kappa honors student, and the University's nominee for      the Rhodes Scholarship in 1924. From there, he went on to      Duke University where he earned his doctorate degree in      history.       To his friends, Dr. Irons was the quintessential American.      With large inviting hands, captivating smile and charming      gentleman's demeanor, he radiated a generous spirit      accessible to everyone. Witty and charming, he always made      the other person ``look good,'' even if to his own detriment.      Eager to listen, never critical or negative, he could      penetrate the soul of another and give an inspiring uplifting      word of encouragement or silently go about doing good. A      generous heart who cared deeply and passionately about the      loves of his life and consecrated his energies to them. A      braveheart of Scottish ancestry, he had the heart of a lion      when his interests were challenged.       A consummate gentleman with the ``can do'' American spirit      on any endeavor--interested in what you were doing and how he      could help accomplish your objectives. With foresight he      encouraged female colleagues to pursue their professional      goals long before it was a popular undertaking.       He was a genteel man ever sensitive to another's hurt. He      went about assisting without being asked. Dr. Irons had an      unlimited capacity to give his endless energies to any task.      His crisp walks across the Samford campus at near running      gait were legendary among his students and the faculty. He      had a great fighting heart for his beliefs and often referred      to his middle initial ``V'' as ``V for victory.'' Dr. Irons      had an elegance rarely seen rivaling the beauty and grace of      a swan, yet strong with the swift power of a lion if called      upon.       Loyal and faithful, easy to greet, he was at ease before a      large convocation audience or content to enjoy cherished time      of solitude.       In addition to his other accomplishments, Dr. Irons, who      was also Colonel Irons, proudly defended the United States in      war and in peace for over one-third of the 20th Century. Dr.      Irons, who achieved the rank of Lt. Col., served in the Anti-     Aircraft Artillery branch of the U.S. Army and reserves.       Devoted to God, Dr. Irons gave selfless service to his      Church as deacon, Sunday school teacher, and Chairman of the      Board of Deacons. He was elected as lifetime Deacon,      Southside Baptist Church. His life reflects his depth of      devotion in word, deed and thought. Dr. Irons was an icon of      virtue and a legendary role model for Samford students for      almost a century.       Dr. Irons' life was one of sacrificial service. From his      service to our nation, to his work on behalf of Samford      University students and faculty, Dr. Irons was a figure of      character, devotion to cause, and exemplary standards of      honor, duty and integrity. His life is an inspiration to all.       Funeral services for Dr. Irons were conducted at Mountain      Brook Baptist Church Chapel on July 27, 1998 by Dr. Irons'      former student, Dr. James D. Moebes, Senior Minister.                          ____________________
