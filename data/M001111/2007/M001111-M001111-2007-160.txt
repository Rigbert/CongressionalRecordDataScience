 President, my understanding is that the Senator from Oklahoma is going to come back and debate his amendment that he combined. Can he let us know what time he will be back so we can make sure we are able to fit in that debate time so we can possibly add the votes on those amendments onto the end of the votes we now have starting at 7 as well?  Before the Senator from Missouri speaks, let me say that when the Senator from Oklahoma comes back, then we will try to work with him to get a time agreement to vote as well at the 7 o'clock time so we can have four votes and move expeditiously to finish this bill tonight.
