 President, I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the Lieberman amendment, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate; provided further that the amendment to the title then be agreed to, the Senate then insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.  I further ask unanimous consent that following the first vote there be 2 minutes equally divided between the votes.
