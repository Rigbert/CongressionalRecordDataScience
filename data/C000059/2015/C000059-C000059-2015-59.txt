Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2822) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
