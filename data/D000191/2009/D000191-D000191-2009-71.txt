Now, he is not explicitly asking the Congress for more TARP money. In fact, the Senate already gave him $350 billion more of TARP money, but they are tapping the Federal Reserve, in addition to that $350 billion, for hundreds of billions of dollars for his new plan.  As the New York Times says, ``For all of its boldness, the plan largely repeats the Bush administration's approach of deferring to many of the same companies and executives who peddled risky loans and investments at the heart of the crisis.'' That's right. The people who have gotten us into this and who have enriched themselves are the people who are going to protect the taxpayers and who are going to get us out of this. I don't believe that.  Some of the most glaring deficiencies of his plan are the so-called restraints on the obscene executive compensations. They are a pale shadow of what they could be. There was one good provision in TARP that almost everybody missed. It said that, if Congress passes a law, all of the past TARP agreements--all of them--will have to be brought in compliance of that law. We could get back the money they paid out in bonuses if we pass a law to do that. I would suggest Mr. Geithner should ask, but if he will not ask, we should still pass the law and begin to make taxpayers whole.  Beyond that, instead of tapping the taxpayers and borrowing money, the other tremendous failure is to put in place a mechanism to pay for this in the names of the American taxpayers in this generation and in the two generations to come.  A modest imposition of a transfer tax--something we had from 1917, it was doubled during the Great Depression and only expired in the sixties--a transfer tax of up to one-quarter of 1 percent, something the British have on the London Exchange, would raise about $150 billion a year.  Wall Street--those scions of ``lift yourselves up by the bootstraps; we are capitalist types''--could pay for their own bailout. Now, there are a couple of things wrong with the proposal. One is it would hurt some speculators. Of course, people seem to think there is some value in speculators because some of them trade on one-tenth of 1 percent or less margin 100 or 1,000 times a day. It wouldn't hurt people whose 401(k)s have already been decimated. In fact, it would stabilize the markets, and it wouldn't put the taxpayers on the hook. It would be Wall Street on the hook. Now, I don't know what is wrong with that. I don't think Main Street America thinks there is anything wrong with that, but somehow, downtown at the Treasury, Mr. Geithner and, obviously, Wall Street think that's wrong.  So let's protect the taxpayers. Let's raise the money from Wall Street, itself, and let's put in meaningful and punitive restrictions on executive compensation, and if they want to go work somewhere else, good luck to them. Mr. Geithner said, ``Oh, they'll all go work for foreign banks.'' Good. Maybe they'll ruin the foreign banks, too, and that will give us a competitive advantage in the future when we grow our small- and medium-sized banks that didn't gamble like these jerks on Wall Street.                          ____________________
