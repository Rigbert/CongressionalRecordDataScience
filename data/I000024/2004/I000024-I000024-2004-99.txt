President, we have repeatedly regulated tobacco consumption because it is a real public health hazard and we need to make certain that people are aware of the risks they take in using it. Of course, that does not mean that any law that regulates tobacco is a good one. The amendment we are discussing would indeed not make good law. I would like to call your attention to troubling aspects of this current amendment that authorizes Food and Drug Administration, FDA, regulation of tobacco.  This amendment would create more bureaucracy and increase the size of government by giving the FDA more control over the tobacco industry. This increased bureaucracy will lead to the need for more funding and personnel to enact the new regulations. This amendment would give the Secretary the power to impose ``restrictions on the sale and distribution of a tobacco product, including restrictions on the access to, and the advertising and promotion of, the tobacco product, if the Secretary determines that such regulation would be appropriate for the protection of the public health.'' Here are some further examples of the increased FDA authority: It would allow the Secretary to require warning labels to cover half a pack of cigarettes, even requiring colors, graphics, and formats.  It would give the Secretary authority to require disclosure of any cigarette or other tobacco product constituent including any smoke constituent that he deems to benefit public health. This could very easily be an impossible burden levied at the Secretary's whim.  When it comes to record keeping, this bill simply says that the Secretary of the FDA will take into account the size of businesses when putting the regulations into place. This new authority is too vague, and it could be interpreted as giving the FDA the ability to discriminate based on arbitrary ideas of what size a business should be. This amendment would give the FDA wholesale authority to regulate every aspect of construction, ingredients, components or properties, including the sale, distribution, access, marketing and labeling, through the application of ``product standards.''  I am also troubled by the fact that we do not have the option to make amendments to such an expansive bill since it is being rushed through the Senate attached to the FSC/ETI bill instead of following traditional committee procedures such as hearings and markup and floor amendment.  This amendment cites underage tobacco use as a reason for increased regulation. Underage use is troubling, but the fact is that there are already decisive laws in place to prevent minors from purchasing tobacco. There is a need for better enforcement, not more FDA regulation. The authority given to the FDA in this amendment no longer focuses on reducing youth usage, but rather, on adult consumption by stating that the new restrictions focus on protecting the public health.  Another problem is that this amendment holds retailers accountable for labeling when it is the manufacturer's responsibility. ``This paragraph shall not relieve a retailer of liability if the retailer sells or distributes tobacco products that are not labeled in accordance with this subsection.''  These FDA regulations would reduce competition by increasing regulatory costs and restricting the ability to communicate with adult smokers.  These proposals place so many barriers to the introduction of new conventional products, those making no health claims and potentially reduced risk, that it discourages their development.  It increases black market attractiveness. The numerous restrictions and regulations provide ample incentives to illegal operators.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of several statements made by the National Association of Convenience Stores, the American Conservative Union, the Association of National Advertisers, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the American Advertising Federation, the American Wholesale Marketers Association, and many on the HELP Committee, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              National Association                                        of Convenience Stores,                                    Alexandria, VA, June 17, 2004.     Re KEY VOTE ALERT.     Hon. Senator Frist,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Frist: I am writing on behalf of the National      Association of Convenience Stores (NACS) to inform you that      as drafted, and without significant changes, the Kennedy-     DeWine amendment to the FSC/ETI bill, regarding FDA's      authority to regulate the sale of tobacco products has a      significant negative impact to the retailing community and      therefore, NACS urges you to oppose this effort.       NACS is an international trade association that represents      the over 130,000 convenience stores across the United States      whom employ over 1.4 million hard working Americans. Small      family- owned operations predominant in the convenience store      industry, and in fact, 70 percent of NACS members own and      operate 10 or less stores.       This legislation, introduced by Senators Ted Kennedy and      Mike DeWine and Representatives Henry Waxman, Tom Davis and      Marty Meehan, has several fundamental problems.       Convenience Stores Receive Unequal Treatment: Under this      legislation, all tobacco retailers are NOT treated equally.      To be comprehensive, all retailers of tobacco, including      those selling over the internet, through the mail, through      adult-only locations, and on Indian reservations, must abide      by the same regulations, however, these bill fall far short.      Further the bill does not specify how the law will be      enforced (state, local or federal authorities), thereby      neglecting the issue of Native American sovereignty and      enforcement on tribal lands (to which all consumers have      access through the internet).       Responsible Retailers Treated Unfairly: Authors of this      legislation continue to hold retailers liable for actions out      of their control. For example: If a company trains its      associates in an agreed-upon age-verification course, that      company should not lose its tobacco license if a trained      associate makes a mistake (knowingly or accidentally). If the      company is irresponsible and does not prepare its associates      properly, only then should the store have its tobacco license      suspended. Additionally, retailers should not be held      responsible for the numerous warning labels being required on      product delivered to them.       Missing Penalties on Minors: Minors, not retailers,      initiate attempted illegal transactions. There should be      adequate penalties to discourage both supply and demand of      underage tobacco consumption. These bills have no such      provision.       Lacking Key Provision: Retailers need tools to help      continue to crack down on illegal sales. Another provision      missing would allow for easier electronic age verification      for retailers choosing to use this tool.       Unconstitutional Provisions Included: There are also      advertising restrictions, which the U.S. Supreme Court has      already struck down as unconstitutional. Moreover, these      restrictions could negatively impact signage inside a store      since it may be visible from outside the store.       Although the authors indicated that retailers' concerns      were addressed in this legislation bill, they fell short in      several areas and failed to address several major points of      contention. Without significant changes to the Family Smoking      Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (S. 2461 and H.R. 4433),      NACS urges Members to oppose this legislation and will KEY      VOTE AGAINST any similar amendment that negatively impacts      the retailing industry.           Sincerely,                                               Allison R. Shulman,     Director, Government Affairs.                                  ____                                  American Conservative Union,                                    Alexandria, VA, July 15, 2004.       Dear Senator: The American Conservative Union has learned      that anti-smoking and public health advocates are dropping      their support of the proposed FDA legislation which is      scheduled for consideration on the Senate floor today.      Members of these groups have concluded that no evidence      exists that links established performance standards by the      FDA to safer products and fewer deaths, as argued by Philip      Morris.       In fact, public health advocates are convinced that the      basic regulatory framework established by the FDA bill will      make it virtually impossible for reduced-risk products to      enter the marketplace. When the economic incentive for      companies to fund comprehensive and meaningful research into      significantly safer products is taken away, the economic      enticement of profit ceases to exist.       FDA regulation could potentially be used to encourage      research, develop and market actual reduced risk products,      but the proposed legislation does the opposite. It acts as a      roadblock preventing development and marketing of these      constantly evolving products.       The passage of FDA regulation is good for only one thing:      padding Philip Morris' bottom line.       This new information further reinforces ACU's opposition to      the current FDA regulation legislation. On behalf of our one-     million members and supporters, the American Conservative      Union strongly urges you to oppose and vote against FDA      regulation of American tobacco, an industry that already is      sufficiently regulated by the federal government. This      harmful prospect is bad for American business, and more      importantly, curbs the incentive for continuing the research      and development of safer products, as public health experts      have concluded.                                  ____                                                     June 1, 2004.     Hon. Judd Gregg,     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions,          U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Association of National      Advertisers (ANA), the American Association of Advertising      Agencies (AAAA) and the American Advertising Federation      (AAF), we are writing to express our opposition to several of      the marketing provisions of S. 2461, the ``Family Smoking      Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.''       We oppose section 102 of the bill, which would direct the      Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish an interim      final rule that is ``identical in its provisions'' to the      proposed rule promulgated by the FDA in 1996. Legal experts      from across the political spectrum agree that the sweeping      and unprecedented restrictions in that proposal, which would      result in a de facto ban on tobacco advertising, would      violate the First Amendment. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court      held in the Lorillard case in 2001 that a Massachusetts      tobacco regulation that was virtually identical to one part      of the FDA proposal was unconstitutional.       Section 201 of the bill would add new disclosure      requirements for all tobacco advertising on top of those      contained in the FDA's 1996 proposed rule. In addition, the      bill would require the FDA to conduct a rulemaking to      determine whether it should mandate the inclusion of tar and      nicotine yields in all labels and advertising. All of the      various disclosure requirements of S. 2461 place the      government in the role of copywriter. By ``seizing'' a      substantial portion of every tobacco ad for government-     mandated disclosures, the bill raises First Amendment      concerns about ``compelled speech'' and could result in an      unconstitutional ``taking'' of a company's commercial      property in violation of the Fifth Amendment.       We also oppose section 203 of S. 2461, which would grant      new authority to state and local governments to impose      ``specific bans or restrictions on the time, place and      manner'' of tobacco advertisements. Much of the advertising      for tobacco products occurs in interstate commerce. Allowing      individual states and local governments to impose their own      bans or restrictions would result in a crazy-quilt of      inconsistent laws, making tobacco advertising virtually      impossible.       We take no position on the provisions of the bill that      would generally grant the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)      the authority to regulate tobacco products.     Enacting the FDA's 1996 Tobacco Advertising Restrictions          Would Violate the First Amendment       We believe that the sweeping tobacco advertising      restrictions promulgated by the FDA in 1996 violate the First      Amendment rights of tobacco companies to communicate with      adults. The FDA's proposal would impose the following      restrictions on tobacco advertising:       Ban all outdoor advertising for tobacco products within      1,000 feet of any elementary or secondary school or      playground;       Require all permitted tobacco advertising, including direct      mail, to be black text on a white background, except in      magazines, newspapers or other periodicals with adult      readership of 85% or more, or fewer than 2 million readers      under the age of 18;       Require all advertisements and labels to identify the      tobacco product as a ``nicotine delivery device'';       Require all advertisements to contain a government-dictated      ``brief statement'' (in     addition to the current Surgeon General's warning) to serve      as a warning about possible dangers associated with the use      of tobacco products;       Ban the use of promotional items such as hats or T-shirts      containing the name or logo of a tobacco product, and      prohibit other promotional techniques such as product give-     aways, rebates or refunds;       Require sponsorship of athletic, musical, social or other      cultural events in corporate name only;       Require all advertisers of tobacco products to fund and      participate in a national public education campaign designed      to discourage the use of tobacco products by minors. The FDA      would require the annual fund established for this campaign      to total $150 million;       Require compliance with more stringent requirements as      enacted by state and local governments; and       Authorize the enactment of additional restrictions seven      years after implementation of a final rule if the number of      minors who use tobacco products has not decreased by 50% from      1994 levels.       The net effect of the FDA proposal would be a de facto ban      on advertising tobacco products. This regulatory package      violates the First Amendment protections for commercial      speech.       The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that truthful,      nondeceptive commercial speech cannot be banned or restricted      unless the restriction ``directly and materially advances'' a      ``substantial governmental interest'' and is ``narrowly      tailored'' to ``reasonably fit'' that interest. See Central      Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation v. Public Service      Commission of New York, 447 U.S. 557 (1980).       In 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484      (1996), a unanimous Supreme Court reaffirmed that all      truthful, nondeceptive advertising about a legal product is      entitled to the same level of First Amendment protection,      regardless of the product.       In the Lorillard case, the Supreme Court struck down a      regulation promulgated by the Attorney General of      Massachusetts that was similar in many respects to the FDA's      proposed rule. The Massachusetts regulation banned outdoor      ads within 1,000-feet of schools, parks and playgrounds and      also restricted point-of-sale advertising for tobacco      products. See Lorillard Tobacco Company v. Thomas Reilly,      Attorney General of Massachusetts, 533 U.S. 525 (2001).       In finding that the Massachusetts regulation was not      narrowly tailored, Justice O' Connor actually noted a similar      problem with the FDA regulation: ``First, the Attorney      General did not seem to consider the impact of the 1,000-foot      restriction on commercial speech in major metropolitan areas.      The Attorney General apparently selected the 1,000-foot      distance based on the FDA's decision to impose an identical      1,000- foot restriction when it attempted to regulate      cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising. (Citations      omitted) But the FDA's 1,000-foot regulation was not an      adequate basis for the Attorney General to tailor the      Massachusetts regulations. The degree to which speech is      suppressed--or alternative avenues for speech remain      available--under a particular regulatory scheme tends to be      case specific. (Citations omitted) And a case specific      analysis makes sense, for although a State or locality may      have common interests and concerns about underage smoking and      the effects of tobacco advertisements, the impact of a      restriction on speech will undoubtedly vary from place to      place. The FDA's regulations would have had widely disparate      effects nationwide. Even in Massachusetts, the effect of the      Attorney General's speech regulations will vary based on      whether a locale is rural, suburban, or urban. The uniformly      broad sweep of the geographical limitation demonstrates a      lack of tailoring.'' (Emphasis added)       Thus, the Supreme Court has already examined one provision      of the FDA proposal--the 1,000-foot ban on outdoor ads--and      suggested that it violates the First Amendment because it is      not narrowly tailored.       The Supreme Court rejected the efforts of the Massachusetts      Attorney General to ``childproof' the flow of information in      our society. Children deserve to be protected from      inappropriate or harmful material, but the government may not      use the guise of protecting children to impose sweeping      restrictions on information intended for adults. In Bolger v.      Youngs Drug Products Corporation, 463 U.S. 60 (1980), the      Court stated that efforts to restrict advertising cannot      lower discourse in society ``to the level of the sandbox''      and citing Butler v. Michigan, 353 U.S. 383 (1957), that      ``Government may not reduce the adult population . . . to      reading only that which is fit for children.'' 463 U.S. at      73.       One of the most vocal critics of the tobacco industry,      Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe, argued that the      tobacco advertising bans included in the master settlement      agreement between the tobacco companies and the states, if      legislated, would raise serious First Amendment concerns. So      have a broad range of public policy groups, from the      Washington Legal Foundation to the American Civil Liberties      Union (ACLU). In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee      on February 20, 1998, the ACLU stated: ``The ACLU believes      that . . . both legislation and proposed regulation by the      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . . . on tobacco      advertisements . . . is wholly unprecedented and, if enacted,      will most likely fail to withstand constitutional challenge.      Moreover, we believe that the enactment of the proposed      tobacco advertising restrictions would impose a drastic      curtailment of commercial speech and could have a chilling      effect on the right of the public and businesses to engage in      free speech about controversial subjects.''       A number of legal scholars, including Judge Robert Bork;      Burt Neuborne, Professor of Law at New York University School      of Law; Rodney Smolla, Professor of Law at the College of      William & Mary; and First Amendment expert Floyd Abrams have      all publicly testified regarding the constitutional problems      with legislating this type of speech restriction. In a      Washington Legal Foundation publication in 1996, Judge Bork      stated: ``[T]he recent proposal of the Food and Drug      Administration (FDA) to restrict severely the First Amendment      rights of American companies and individuals who, in one way      or another, have any connection with tobacco products [is]      patently unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's current      doctrine concerning commercial speech as well as under the      original understanding of the First Amendment.''       While the government has a legitimate interest in fighting      the use of tobacco products by minors, the FDA's proposed      regulations sweep far too broadly and result in massive      censorship of truthful speech aimed at adults.     New Disclosure Requirements Would Overload Advertisements       As noted above, the FDA's proposed rule from 1996 would      require that all ads identify the tobacco product as a      ``nicotine delivery device'' and contain a government-     dictated ``brief statement,'' in addition to the current      Surgeon General's warnings. Section 201 of S. 2461 would add      another layer of disclosures to all ads. It would require the      ``label statement'' to comprise at least 20% of the area of      the ad, to be placed at the top of each ad with specific      type-sizes. Further, section 206 of the bill requires an FDA      rulemaking to determine whether the agency should also      mandate the inclusion of tar and nicotine yields in all      labels and advertising.       These various disclosure requirements would result in      information overload for all tobacco product ads. By      mandating these disclosures and requiring specific type      sizes, the bill would place the government in the role of      copywriter. It raises serious First Amendment concerns about      ``compelled speech.'' It could ultimately result in an      unconstitutional ``taking'' of the company's commercial      message in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Advertising is      not free. When a tobacco company purchases advertising space,      it acquires an important property interest. The multiple      disclosure requirements of S. 2461 would literally ``seize''      a substantial portion of the company's space and conscript it      for government-mandated messages. This would be an      interference with both free speech and property rights.     New State/Local Ad Restrictions Would Make Tobacco          Advertising Impossible       We are strongly opposed to section 203 of S. 2461. That      provision would authorize states and thousands of local      governments to impose ``specific bans or restrictions on the      time, place and manner, but not content,'' of tobacco      advertising. This could result in a crazy quilt of      inconsistent advertising restrictions, both intra-state and      inter-state. For example, tobacco advertising is often placed      in publications with regional or national distribution. How      could a tobacco company place an ad in a popular magazine      that complies with hundreds or potentially thousands of      inconsistent restrictions on the ``time, place and manner''      of tobacco ads?       This provision would make tobacco advertising impossible on      a regional or national basis and result in a defacto ban on      this category. It would authorize state and local governments      to engage in censorship of one form of speech based solely on      its content.     Conclusion       Some claim that tobacco products are unique, so that it is      permissible to ignore the First Amendment just for those      products. The Supreme Court has rejected this theory in a      series of cases, including Lorillard and the 44 Liquormart      case. What you do to tobacco advertising today, you will be      urged to do to advertising for many other ``controversial''      products tomorrow. Justice Thomas recognized this in his      concurring opinion in the Lorillard case: ``Nevertheless, it      seems appropriate to point out that to uphold the      Massachusetts tobacco regulations would be to accept a line      of reasoning that would permit restrictions on advertising      for a host of other products.''       Don't start down this road to content-based censorship of      advertising. We urge you to remove these marketing provisions      from S. 2461. The government can take strong, effective steps      to restrict tobacco sales and access to minors without      trampling on the First Amendment.

As President of the American Wholesale Marketers      Association (AWMA), I represent convenience distributors      nationwide and our distributor members represent more than      $85 billion in US Convenience product sales. Many of our      members are your constituents. On behalf of my AWMA members,      I am writing to let you know of our deep concerns over the      devastating impact this legislation would have upon our      industry.       Tobacco products are among the many goods distributed by      our members and many of these businesses are small, family-     owned operations. The burdensome recordkeeping requirements      and the onerous regulations resulting from this legislation      would work a tremendous hardship on these business owners. In      addition, there are concerns that this legislation could be      ``the camel's nose under the tent'' and create a back door      ban on tobacco products through additional restrictions on      the approval, sale, distribution and advertising of these      products. And, the costly layer of regulation to be imposed      by this legislation would cause problems for these family-     owned businesses while providing no real benefit to the      public.       Our AWMA members consider this issue to be of vital      importance and, therefore, I urge you to vote against any      legislation that would provide for FDA regulatory authority      over tobacco products. Thank you in advance for your kind      consideration of these concerns.           Sincerely,                                              Scott Ramminger,                                                        President,     American Wholesale Marketers Association.                                  ____   Statement by Members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions                                Committee       Many on the HELP Committee have concerns with the FDA      aspect of the amendment based on the following reasons, ``In      our view it does not represent principles of good government.      It does not produce a strong uniform FDA. For example, we are      concerned about the preemption provisions--we are concerned      about the lack of due process in the reissuance of a Clinton      era tobacco rule--also we are concerned about the claims of      the provisions of the bill.''
