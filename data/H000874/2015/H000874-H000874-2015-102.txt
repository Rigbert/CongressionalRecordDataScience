 Lastly, as the gentleman knows, I have been very much involved with the authorization of the Export-Import Bank through the years. As the gentleman knows, Mr. Cantor and I worked together and came up with a bipartisan proposal in 2012 that passed this House overwhelmingly with approximately 140 Republicans and about 185 or more Democrats, so it passed overwhelmingly.  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not there is any possibility of assuring that the majority of this House can work its will and the majority of the Senate--and I say that because Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate, is quoted as saying the supporters of the Federal Export-Import Bank have the Senate votes to revive it and will get a chance to do so.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, It looks to me like they have the votes--and I am requesting to give them the opportunity. McConnell, who opposes the Bank, said he expects supporters to try to attach the reauthorization to a highway bill.  Assuming that we get a bill from the Senate with the Export-Import Bank attached to it, does the majority leader believe that we will have the opportunity--and I think the majority of the Members of the House would vote in favor of it--will have the opportunity to vote on the Export-Import Bank before we leave here on Thursday?  I yield to my friend  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I thank my friend for his weekly questions. I think you may have asked these questions actually more times than we repealed ObamaCare, but my answer remains the same.
