Speaker, the House voted down two campaign finance proposals today, neither of which solves the fundamental problem: the excessive influence of wealthy interests on our political process crowding out and even alienating average citizens from their own democracy. It is increasingly true that the real two-party system in our country consists not of Republicans and Democrats, but the party of donors and the party of voters.  I voted in favor of the Farr substitute today because voluntary spending limits are better than no limits at all, and I completely disagree with Speaker Gingrich, who says that he would emphasize far more money in the political process.  That is absolutely ludicrous. In fact the New York Times in a recent story says money is not speech, it is raw power, and that is why the only answer to this problem, because of the Supreme Court decisions, is passage of H.J. Res. 114 to allow Congress and the States to set mandatory limits on campaign expenditures.  The choice is clear: More money in the process or less.                          ____________________
