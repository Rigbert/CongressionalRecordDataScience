Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 33, which will transfer the Stuttgart Fish Farming Experimental Laboratory in Arkansas from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture.  This Laboratory has been instrumental in the development of various techniques for the commercial production of catfish, baitfish, and other finfishes worth in excess of $600 million.  Furthermore, this facility conducts extensive research on warmwater aquaculture and, since the vast majority of those who utilize Stuttgart are farmers, the Department of Agriculture is a logical home for this laboratory.  Based on the testimony received, it is clear that this transfer is not controversial and is strongly supported by all of the affected parties. I, therefore, urge an ``aye'' vote on this legislation and I compliment our distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Blanche Lambert Lincoln, for her leadership in this matter.
