I know the Senator from Arizona and some of his colleagues have produced an alternative. I support the bipartisan bill that Senators Lieberman and Collins have brought to the floor.  The major group who opposes the passage of the cyber security bill is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an organization that represents the largest businesses in America, and what I have heard the Senator from Arizona say over and over is that they have to be an important part of this conversation and this discussion. I think Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins would say: We have engaged them. We have listened to them. We have made changes consistent with what they were looking for. But clearly they have not reached the point where they are satisfied.  I learned yesterday, when Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island came to the floor, that, in fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce really turns out to be pretty expert on this issue of cyber security. And I call the attention of the Senator from Arizona, if he is not aware of it, to a Wall Street Journal article of December 21, 2011. This Wall Street Journal article is entitled ``China Hackers Hit U.S. Chamber,'' and it starts by saying:       A group of hackers in China breached the computer defenses      of America's top business lobbying group and gained access to      everything stored on its systems, including information about      its three million members, according to several people      familiar with the matter. The complex operation involved at      least 300 Internet addresses. . . . Four chamber employees      who worked on Asian policy had six weeks of their emails      stolen.  The article goes on to say that the Chamber of Commerce did not notice this breach that went on for 6 months. The Federal Bureau of Investigation brought it to their attention. And then they learned that the Chinese had not only hacked into the computer mainframe, they had somehow hacked into the computer-driven thermostats in their office, and at times in the office of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, their copy machines and fax machines were spitting out pages with Chinese characters on them. They were completely compromised by this cyber attack. Now they come us to as experts on how to avoid a cyber attack.  I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal article be printed at this point in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 21, 2011]  China Hackers Hit U.S. Chamber--Attacks Breached Computer System of                  Business-Lobbying Group; Emails Stolen                          (By Siobhan Gorman)       A group of hackers in China breached the computer defenses      of America's top business-lobbying group and gained access to      everything stored on its systems, including information about      its three million members, according to several people      familiar with the matter.       The break-in at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is one of the      boldest known infiltrations in what has become a regular      confrontation between U.S. companies and Chinese hackers. The      complex operation, which involved at least 300 Internet      addresses, was discovered and quietly shut down in May 2010.       It isn't clear how much of the compromised data was viewed      by the hackers. Chamber officials say internal investigators      found evidence that hackers had focused on four Chamber      employees who worked on Asia policy, and that six weeks of      their email had been stolen.       It is possible the hackers had access to the network for      more than a year before the breach was uncovered, according      to two people familiar with the Chamber's internal      investigation.       One of these people said the group behind the break-in is      one that U.S. officials suspect of having ties to the Chinese      government. The Chamber learned of the break-in when the      Federal Bureau of Investigation told the group that servers      in China were stealing its information, this person said. The      FBI declined to comment on the matter.       A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Geng      Shuang, said cyberattacks are prohibited by Chinese law and      China itself is a victim of attacks. He said the allegation      that the attack against the Chamber originated in China      ``lacks proof and evidence and is irresponsible,'' adding      that the hacking issue shouldn't be ``politicized.''       In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said at a      daily briefing that he hadn't heard about the matter, though      he repeated that Chinese law forbids hacker attacks. He added      that China wants to cooperate more with the international      community to prevent hacker attacks.       The Chamber moved to shut down the hacking operation by      unplugging and destroying some computers and overhauling its      security system. The security revamp was timed for a 36-hour      period over one weekend when the hackers, who kept regular      working hours, were expected to be off duty.       Damage from data theft is often difficult to assess.       People familiar with the Chamber investigation said it has      been hard to determine what was taken before the incursion      was discovered, or whether cyberspies used information      gleaned from the Chamber to send booby-trapped emails to its      members to gain a foothold in their computers, too.       Chamber officials said they scoured email known to be      purloined and determined that communications with fewer than      50 of its members were compromised. They notified those      members. People familiar with the investigation said the      emails revealed the names of companies and key people in      contact with the Chamber, as well as trade-policy documents,      meeting notes, trip reports and schedules.       ``What was unusual about it was that this was clearly      somebody very sophisticated, who knew exactly who we are and      who targeted specific people and used sophisticated tools to      try to gather intelligence,'' said the Chamber's Chief      Operating Officer David Chavern.       Nevertheless, Chamber officials said they haven't seen      evidence of harm to the organization or its members.       The Chamber, which has 450 employees and represents the      interests of U.S. companies in Washington, might look like a      juicy target to hackers. Its members include most of the      nation's largest corporations, and the group has more than      100 affiliates around the globe.       While members are unlikely to share any intellectual      property or trade secrets with the group, they sometimes      communicate with it about trade and policy.       U.S. intelligence officials and lawmakers have become      alarmed by the growing number of cyber break-ins with roots      in China. Last month, the U.S. counterintelligence chief      issued a blunt critique of China's theft of American      corporate intellectual property and economic data, calling      China ``the world's most active and persistent perpetrators      of economic espionage'' and warning that large-scale      industrial espionage threatens U.S. competitiveness and      national security.       Two people familiar with the Chamber investigation said      certain technical aspects of the attack suggested it was      carried out by a known group operating out of China. It isn't      clear exactly how the hackers broke in to the Chamber's      systems. Evidence suggests they were in the network at least      from November 2009 to May 2010.       Stan Harrell, chief information officer at the Chamber,      said federal law enforcement told the group: ``This is a      different level of intrusion'' than most hacking. ``This is      much more sophisticated.''       Chamber President and Chief Executive Thomas J. Donahue      first learned of the breach in May 2010 after he returned      from a business trip to China. Chamber officials tapped their      contacts in government for recommendations for private      computer investigators, then hired a team to diagnose the      breach and overhaul the Chamber's defenses.       They first watched the hackers in action to assess the      operation. The intruders, in what appeared to be an effort to      ensure continued access to the Chamber's systems, had built      at least a half-dozen so-called back doors that allowed them      to come and go as they pleased, one person familiar with the      investigation said. They also built in mechanisms that would      quietly communicate with computers in China every week or      two, this person said.       The intruders used tools that allowed them to search for      key words across a range of documents on the Chamber's      network, including searches for financial and budget      information, according to the person familiar with the      investigation. The investigation didn't determine whether the      hackers had taken the documents turned up in the searches.       When sophisticated cyberspies have access to a network for      many months, they often take measures to cover their tracks      and to conceal what they have stolen.       To beef up security, the Chamber installed more      sophisticated detection equipment and barred employees from      taking the portable devices they use every day to certain      countries, including China, where the risk of infiltration is      considered high. Instead, Chamber employees are issued      different equipment     before their trips--equipment that is checked thoroughly upon      their return.       Chamber officials say they haven't been able to keep      intruders completely out of their system, but now can detect      and isolate attacks quickly.       The Chamber continues to see suspicious activity, they say.      A thermostat at a town house the Chamber owns on Capitol Hill      at one point was communicating with an Internet address in      China, they say, and, in March, a printer used by Chamber      executives spontaneously started printing pages with Chinese      characters.       ``It's nearly impossible to keep people out. The best thing      you can do is have something that tells you when they get      in,'' said Mr. Chavern, the chief operating officer. ``It's      the new normal. I expect this to continue for the foreseeable      future. I expect to be surprised again.''  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, could I say that is just unfair. They are not claiming to be experts on cyber attacks. They are claiming that there are issues of liability, issues of information sharing, and other issues that they believe will inhibit their ability to engage in business practices and grow and prosper. So to say that somehow they claim they are experts on cyber security, they are not, but they are experts on how their businesses can best cooperate, share information, resist these attacks, and come together with other people and other interests to bring about some legislation on which we can all agree.  There are 3 million businesses and organizations that are represented here, I say to my colleague, so it seems to me that we should continue this conversation with them, particularly on issues of information sharing and liability. But to somehow say ``well, we talked to them, but we did not agree with anything they wanted to do'' is not fair to those 3 million businesses. We are making some progress. But please don't say they portray themselves as experts.  By the way, they hacked into my Presidential campaign, which shows they really were pretty bored and did not have a hell of a lot to do. But, anyway, go ahead.
