 President, I want to begin by saying that I very much agree with what Chairman Burr has just stated. It is factual. It is the truth.  For me, I have worked on this issue for 7 years now. And this is actually the third bill that we have tried to move.  I want to thank the two leaders for bringing the bill to the floor, and I hope it can be considered quickly.  Up front I want to make clear, if it hasn't been made clear, that this legislation is a first step only to improve our Nation's defenses against cyber attack and cyber intrusion. It is not a panacea, and it will not end our vulnerabilities. But it is the most effective first legislative step we believe that we can take.  This legislation is about providing legal clarity and legal protection so that companies can share cyber threat information voluntarily with each other and with the government. It provides companies the protections they need and puts strong privacy rules in place.  At the beginning of this debate, I think it is important to talk about the depth and breadth of the cyber threat we actually face every day, because rarely does a month go by without the announcement of a significant cyber attack or intrusion on an American company or an agency of the U.S. Government. These attacks compromise sensitive personal information, intellectual property or both.  Just in the last year, major banks, health insurers, tech companies, and retailers have seen tens of millions of their customers' sensitive data stolen through cyber means. In 2014 the Internet security company Symantec reported that over 348 million identities were exposed through data breaches. Threats in cyber space do not just risk the personal data of Americans. They are a significant and growing drain on our economy as malicious actors steal our money, rob companies of intellectual property, and threaten our ability to innovate.  The cyber security company McAfee and the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated last year that the cost of cyber crime is more than $400 billion annually. The same study stated that losses from cyber theft could cost the United States as many as 200,000 jobs. These are not theoretical risks; they are happening today and every day.  As we know all too well in the wake of cyber intrusions at the Office of Personnel Management, cyber threats are not only aimed against the private sector. They are also aimed against the public sector. Every day, foreign nation-states and cyber criminals scour U.S. Government systems and our defense industrial base for information on government programs and personnel--every single day.  More than 22 million government employees and security clearance applicants had massive amounts of personal information stolen from the Office of Personnel Management, reportedly taken by China. These employees now face increased risk of theft and fraud, and also their information could be used for intelligence operations against them and the United States.  As bad as this is--and it is bad--we have seen in the last few years an acceleration of an even more concerning trend, that of cyber attack instead of just cyber theft. In 2012 major U.S. financial institutions saw an unprecedented wave of denial-of-service attacks on their systems.  Saudi Aramco--reported to be the world's largest oil and gas company--was the victim of a cyber attack that wiped out a reported three-quarters of its corporate computers. In 2013 we saw further escalations of these threats as waves of denial-of-service attacks were aimed at some of our largest banks. In early 2014 Iran launched a cyber attack on the Sands Casino which, according to the public testimony of the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, rendered thousands of computer systems inoperable. Last November we saw one of the most publicized cyber attacks when North Korean attacks broke into Sony Pictures Entertainment, stole vast amounts of sensitive and personal data, and destroyed the company's internal network.  These breaches of personal information and loss of intellectual property and destructive attacks continue online every day. It is only a matter of time before America's critical infrastructure--major banks, the electric grid, dams, waterways, the air traffic control system, and others--is targeted for a cyber attack that could seriously affect hundreds of thousands of lives.  Clearly it is well beyond the time to act. There is no legislative or administrative step we can take that will end cyber crimes and cyber warfare. However, since the Intelligence Committee began looking seriously at this in 2008, we have heard consistently that improving the exchange of information about cyber threats and cyber vulnerabilities can yield a real and significant improvement to U.S. cyber security. That is why this bill is the top cyber legislative priority for the Congress, the Obama administration, and the business community.  I have heard directly from dozens of corporate executives about the importance of cyber security legislation, as have the Intelligence Committee staff in hundreds of meetings over the course of years in drafting this legislation. As Chairman Burr has said, not only has the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called for this legislation but so have dozens--specifically 52--of industry groups representing some of the largest sectors of our economy. On the floor in early August, I listed 40 associations that have written in support of the legislation. Today there are 52.  I ask unanimous consent that the list of supporters of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act                              Endorsements       Agricultural Retailers Association, Airlines for America,      Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, American Bankers      Association, American Cable Association, American Chemistry      Council, American Coatings Association, American Fuel &      Petrochemical Manufacturers, American Gaming Association,      American Gas Association, American Insurance Association      American Petroleum Institute.
