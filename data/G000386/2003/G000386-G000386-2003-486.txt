 President, for our leader, I ask unanimous consent that the next amendments in order be the following in the order mentioned: Senator Daschle, substitute; Senator Nickles, on the subject of dividends; Senator Reid; then Senator Breaux, and Senator Breaux's deals with section 911; Senator Santorum, dealing with annuities; Senator Bingaman, small business pensions; Senator Mikulski, caregivers; Senator Sessions, sunset tax increase provisions; and Senator Dayton, a substitute.  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote in relationship to the amendments, that no amendments be in order to the amendments prior to the vote, and, finally, that this sequence of votes be limited to 10 minutes each.
