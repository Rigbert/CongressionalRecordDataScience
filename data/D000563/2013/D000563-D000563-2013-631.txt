Ayotte has said, there are four members who wish to speak. I don't want to be presumptuous, but if we each speak for 5 minutes, then that leaves 10 minutes for those who might arrive whom we are not aware of. So two Senators on the Republican side speak for 5 minutes, I will speak 5 minutes, and then Senator Hatch can speak for 5 minutes. Is that fair?
