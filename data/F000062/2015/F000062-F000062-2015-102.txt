 President, today I am introducing the State Licensing Efficiency Act with my colleagues Senators Lankford, Cotton, Capito, Leahy, Merkley, and Crapo.  This bill provides a simple, commonsense change to the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, SAFE Act, which became law in 2008 as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act.  Overall, this bipartisan bill streamlines the licensing process for financial service providers, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  The SAFE Act required that state banking regulators use the electronic Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System, NMLS, to license or register mortgage loan originators.  As the author of the SAFE Act, I have been pleased to see the NMLS' success over the past five years in facilitating mortgage loan originator licensing.  The use of the NMLS for mortgage loan originators benefits state regulators, those seeking licenses to conduct financial services, and consumers.  First, it increases efficiency and consolidates the licensing process and relevant information in one place for state regulators. This also allows for easier coordination between regulators.  Second, it provides a uniform licensing process for mortgage loan originators seeking licenses.  Finally, it allows consumers to verify the credentials of financial service providers to ensure that they are truly licensed or registered in the state in which they are conducting business.  Today, over half of the States now use the NMLS for licensing entities other than mortgage loan originators, including for non-depository financial service providers like check cashers, debt collectors, and money transmitters.  Many States require Federal background checks as part of the licensing process for financial service providers.  However, the SAFE Act only provided the Attorney General with the authority to share federal background check information with the NMLS for mortgage loan originators.  The FBI does not have the authority to share this information with the NMLS for any other financial service provider.  This means that while the rest of the licensing process for other financial service providers can be conducted through the NMLS, the background check cannot.  I believe background checks are a critical component of State licensing and regulation. It does not make sense to allow for the licensing process to be delayed by barring certain background checks from being coordinated through the NMLS.  The State Licensing Efficiency Act would provide the authorization needed for the Attorney General to allow the FBI to share background check information for non-depository financial service providers with state regulators through the NMLS, just as it currently does for mortgage loan originators.  Let me be clear that this bill does not change any state licensing requirements or impact any state laws. States fully retain the ability to determine when they want to use the NMLS for other financial service providers.  However, should states continue to expand their utilization of the NMLS, it makes sense to allow them to fully do so by ensuring federal background checks can be coordinated through the NMLS.  Additionally, this bill will help financial service providers seeking licenses in multiple states.  Instead of submitting federal background check requests for each State where they are seeking a license, they can submit one request via the NMLS for Federal background check information, which will be sent to the NMLS.  States conducting the licensing process will then have access to the information through the NMLS.  This should reduce the number of background check processing fees paid by financial service providers seeking licenses and reduce the processing period for the background checks so that financial service providers can get licensed more efficiently.  The State Licensing Efficiency Act makes a reasonable change to allow state regulators who use the NMLS for licensing financial service providers to fully benefit from a streamlined, transparent, and more efficient process.  Many regulatory associations support this bill including: the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators, the Money Transmitter Regulators Association, the North American Collection Agency Regulatory Association, and the National Association of Consumer Credit Administrators.  Additionally, associations representing a variety of financial service providers have voiced support, including: the Appraisal Institute, the Mortgage Bankers Association, and the Money Services Round Table.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation and am hopeful that this Congress will move it forward.                                 ______                                       By
