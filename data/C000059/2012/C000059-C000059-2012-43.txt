Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a community leader and friend of mine, Richard Milanovich. Richard was the longtime chairman of Riverside County's Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. On Sunday, March 11, 2012, Richard passed away at the age of 69 with his family at his bedside at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage. He will be deeply missed.  In 1942, Richard was born on the Soboba Reservation in the San Jacinto area and grew up in subsidized housing in Palm Springs. At that time, the tribe was almost entirely dependent on government help, eating out of government-issued cans. As a boy, he attended Cahuilla Elementary School and Palm Springs High School. After high school, he served honorably in the United States Army and in 1972 he returned to the Palm Springs area. He unsuccessfully ran for Tribal Council three times between 1972 and 1978. Finally, in 1978 he was elected to the Tribal Council and in 1984 he was elected Chairman. From 1984 to 1989, Chairman Milanovich helped craft groundbreaking land-use agreements with city of Cathedral City, city of Rancho Mirage, and Riverside County, modeled on an agreement struck with city of Palm Springs in the late 1970s, while he was a member of the Tribal Council. The intergovernmental deals were among the first of their kind and served as a model for Tribes throughout the rest of the country.  Richard Milanovich was an early proponent of allowing California tribes to have gambling on tribal lands. After the successful negotiation of the land-use agreements with local cities, Richard moved forward and in 1998 the Agua Caliente tribe, along with other tribes, pushed and passed Proposition 5 which allowed for gambling on tribal lands. Although the proposition was ruled unconstitutional, the tribes were able to later negotiate pacts with then-Governor Gray Davis and a subsequent proposition passed which put the pacts in place. Richard would later win another battle in 2008 when the voters approved a casino-expansion deal.  Richard never lost sight of the poor conditions that he grew up in and early on decided to become a champion for his people. He led the Agua Caliente tribe for nearly three decades and helped California tribes become self-sufficient moving many out of poverty through the success of the Indian casinos. Richard successfully negotiated on the local, state and federal level to advance the priorities of the Agua Caliente tribe and throughout his career he remained humble, compassionate, and engaging.  Richard Milanovich changed the course of history for California and, most importantly, for the Indian community in California. He saw circumstances that disadvantaged the Indian people and set about to change them. Milanovich never wavered in his commitment, and despite all obstacles persevered for the betterment of his tribe and the entire Indian community in California. His leadership, vision and uncompromising compassion were truly an inspiration to his people and testimony to his character.  On Wednesday, March 21, 2012, a memorial service celebrating Richard Milanovich's extraordinary life was held at the Palm Springs Convention Center. Milanovich will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the Indian Community and love of family. His dedication to his work, family, and tribe are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to his family and friends; although Richard may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
