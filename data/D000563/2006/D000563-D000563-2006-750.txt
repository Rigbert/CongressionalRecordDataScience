President, on vote No. 175, I was necessarily absent due to a weather delay with my plane from New York (Delta 1959). Had I been present for that vote, I would have voted to confirm the nomination of Sandra Segal Ikuta to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit.                          ____________________
