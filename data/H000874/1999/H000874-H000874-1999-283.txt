Speaker, let me add that this exhibition is not an abandonment of our Nation's policies toward Castro or his regime, nor is it a weakening of our resolve against the tyranny of communism. The proceeds from this game, in fact, will go to build baseball stadiums, not politics. But it is an opportunity to showcase what is common to the people of the United States and Cuba, a passion for the game of baseball.  I want to join the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) in congratulating Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, who has done so much for baseball, so much for Baltimore and is now doing so much to reach out a hand to try to bring better relations but doing so in the context of not accommodating a regime with which we do not agree but telling a people that is sometimes under that regime that we want to be their friends, if not the friends of their government.  Governments cannot come together unless the people they serve find a common ground.  This exhibition will not dissolve the differences between our two governments but it will allow the people of both lands to share in their common passion.  Once again this spring, children in this country will pick up their bats and gloves andhit the playing fields with the same passion that has motivated children and lovers of the game for years.  So too will the youth of Cuba.  Their determination and effort will be directed to the game.  They will be absorbed in the pitching and power hitters of their opponents not their politics.  The Baltimore Orioles exhibition in Havana will allow the people of both countries to share their passions for the game and perhaps highlight what the people of our nations have in common and not the differences that divide them.  It comes as no surprise to me that Peter Angelos and the Baltimore Orioles have led the effort to see this game become a reality and on behalf of the State of Maryland I want to thank Peter Angelos for his vision for baseball.  A vision broader than the game itself which removes the barriers for all who share a love for the great game of baseball.                          ____________________
