 President, today, I applaud my colleagues for passing the Federal Firefighters Retirement Age Fairness Act. This legislation raises the mandatory retirement age for Federal firefighters from 55 to 57.  Federal firefighters are first on the scene to many types of disasters in addition to fires. They respond to hazardous materials threats and terrorist incidents such as the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.  Due to an oversight, however, Federal firefighters are currently the only Federal law enforcement employees required to retire at 55 years.  Because many Federal firefighters wish to continue providing their services to the American people after the age of 55, they are frequently hired back by the Federal Government as ``consultants.'' Private consultants charge a higher fee than Federal firefighters' salaries. As a result, the Federal Government pays more money for the same individuals' services, simply because they are over the age of 55.  This bill does not change the minimum age to retire with full benefits. If an individual wishes to retire at 55, he or she may do so without penalty. The legislation gives firefighters the option of working until the age of 57 if they wish.  The bill enjoys broad bipartisan support and the endorsement of key labororganizations such as the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Government Employees, and the International Association of Fire Chiefs.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation will save taxpayers more than $4 million over the next four years. Federal firefighting capabilities are being sorely tested; we need to make it possible for agencies to retain experienced, qualified firefighters.  ``The Federal Firefighters Retirement Age Fairness Act'' was the first bill the House of Representatives passed unanimously this year. I am pleased my colleagues here in the Senate chose to support this important legislation, as well.                          ____________________
