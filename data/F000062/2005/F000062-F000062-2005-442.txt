 President, I rise to introduce the Fifty Caliber Sniper Weapons Regulation Act of 2005. I am joined by Senators Corzine and Durbin.  This bill would add the .50-caliber sniper rifle to the list of ``firearms'' governed by the National Firearms Act. This means that this weapon would be subject to the tax and registration rules imposed by the Internal Revenue Service under that Act. The practical effect would be that a transfer of such a weapon, by sale or by gift, would require registration pursuant to IRS regulations.  The bill would not ban any guns, and existing .50 caliber owners would be unaffected by this law until, and unless, they sell or give away their weapon.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, respecting the rights of those who have followed the law, but making future changes in the law to regulate new .50-caliber guns.  .50-caliber sniper rifles, manufactured by a small handful of companies, are deadly, military weapons, designed for combat with wartime enemies. They are capable of piercing light armor at more than four miles. The guns are designed to enable a single soldier to destroy enemy aircraft, HumVees, bunkers, fuel stations, and communication centers, as well as target and kill enemy personnel. As a result, their use by military organizations worldwide has been spreading rapidly.  This is a weapon designed to kill people efficiently, or destroy machinery, at a great distance. But along with the increasing military use of the gun, we have also seen increased use of the weapon by violent criminals and terrorists around the world, and the potential for much worse.  These weapons are deadly accurate up to 6,000 feet. This means that a shooter using a .50-caliber weapon can reliably hit a target more than a mile away. To further illustrate what this means, a shooter standing on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial can kill a person standing on the White House lawn, or shoot down the President's helicopter.  And the gun is effective at more than four miles. Although it may be hard to aim at this distance, the gun will still have its desired destructive effect. That means a shooter in Arlington Cemetery can send a bullet crashing into this building.  This is, of course, is using ordinary ammunition. I had one of my staff members obtain a blank .50-caliber bullet. I was amazed to see what was brought back. Senate rules forbid me from bringing the bullet to the floor, so I will describe it for my colleagues.The casing for this bullet is about five inches in length, and three-quarters-of-an-inch in diameter. The entire round is almost as big as my hand.  But don't just take my word for it. Each one of my colleagues should examine these bullets for themselves. Take a look at the projectile these weapons fire. This is not a recreational gun that can be used for hunting.  This gun can be used by civilians against armored limousines, bunkers, individuals, and aircraft--in fact, one advertisement for the gun promoted the weapon as able to ``wreck several million dollars'' worth of jet aircraft with one or two dollars worth of cartridges.''  A recent CNN news report powerfully illustrates this issue. In one on-camera demonstration, a .50 caliber bullet is fired through the door of a commercial jetliner--it continues to blast through a steel plate. A marksman on the steps of the Capitol could bring down a plane coming into National Airport.  This gun is so powerful that one dealer told undercover General Accountability Office investigators, ``You'd better buy one soon. It's only a matter of time before someone lets go a round on a range that travels so far, it hits a school bus full of kids. The government will definitely ban .50-calibers. This gun is just too powerful.'' In fact, many ranges used for target practice do not even have enough safety features to accommodate these guns.  A study by the GAO revealed some eye-opening facts about how and where this gun is used, and how easily it is obtained. The GAO reports that many of these guns wind up in the hands of domestic and international terrorists, religious cults, outlaw motorcycle gangs, drug traffickers, and violent criminals.  According to a special agent at ATF's Atlanta Field Division, the Barrett .50-caliber rifle is ``a tremendous threat'' for ``those most shocking and horrifying crimes, assassinations, murders, assaults on law enforcement officers.''  But these fears are not hypothetical. Recently we have learned that Al Qaeda has received .50-caliber sniper rifles--rifles that were manufactured right here in the United States. Nearly two years ago today, Essam al Ridi, an Al Qaeda associate, testified that he acquired 25 Barrett .50-caliber sniper rifles and shipped them to Al Qaeda members in Afghanistan. We have no way of knowing whether Al Qaeda has obtained more or who has supplied them with these weapons, but we can be sure that any .50-caliber weapon in the hands of Al Qaeda will likely be used against Americans.  In 1998, Federal law enforcement apprehended three men belonging to a radical Michigan militia group. The three were charged with plotting to bomb Federal office buildings, destroy highways and utilities. They were also charged with plotting to assassinate then-Governor Engler, Federal judges, and our colleague, Senator Levin. A .50-caliber sniper rifle was found in their possession along with a cache of weapons that included three illegal machine guns.  One doomsday cult headquartered in Montana purchased ten of these guns and stockpiled them in an underground bunker, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition and other guns.  At least one .50-caliber gun was recovered by Mexican authorities after a shoot-out with an international drug cartel in that country. The gun was originally purchased in Wyoming, so it is clear that the guns are making their way into the hands of criminals worldwide.  The U.S. Air Force has studied the scenario of a potential terrorist attack with a .50-caliber weapon. According to a November 2001 article in the Air Force's official magazine, Airman, an anti-sniper assessment claimed that planes parked on a fully protected U.S. airbase are as vulnerable as ``ducks on a pond'' because the weapons can shoot from beyond most airbase perimeters. The Air Force has addressed the issue and the effectiveness of specially-trained countersnipers to respond to a .50-caliber weapon attack on aircraft, fuel tanks, control towers, and personnel.  I am glad to know our military has given some consideration to the threats posed by .50-caliber weapons, but I have real concerns over the threats posed to civilian aviation.  Our Nation's airports in no way match the security measure at Air Force bases. These commercial facilities handle millions of passengers and tons of cargo each day and are especially vulnerable to the threats posed by .50-caliber weapons.  Experts have agreed that .50-caliber weapons aimed at a plane while stationary, or taking off or arriving, could be just as disastrous as a hit from a missile launcher. Gal Luff, Co-Director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, has described .50-caliber weapons as ``lethal to slow moving planes.''  For further illustration of the potential destruction of these weapons, simply listen to the manufacturers themselves. According to a Barrett Firearms Manufacturing Model 82A1 .50-caliber sniper rifle brochure: ``The cost effectiveness of the Model 82A1 cannot be overemphasized when a round of ammunition purchased for less than ten U.S. dollars can be used to destroy or disable a modern jet aircraft. The compressor sections of jet engines or the transmissions of helicopters are likely targets for the weapon, making it capable of destroying multimillion dollar aircraft with a single hit delivered to a vital area.''  The Nordic Ammunition Company is the developer of the Raufoss multipurpose ammunition for .50-caliber weapons that combines armor-piercing, incendiary, and explosive features and was used by U.S. forces during the Gulf War. According to the company, the ammunition can ignite military jet fuel and has ``the equivalent firing power of a 20mm projectile to include such targets as helicopters, aircrafts, light armor vehicles, ships, and light fortifications.''  Ammunition for these guns is also readily available in stores and on the Internet. This is perfectly legal. Even those categories which are illegal, such as the ``armor piercing incendiary'' ammunition that explodes on impact can, according to a recent ``60 Minutes'' news report, be purchased online.  Several ammunition dealers were willing to sell armor piercing ammunition to an undercover GAO investigator even after the investigator said he wanted the ammunition to pierce an armored limousine or maybe to shoot down a helicopter.  Current law classifies .50-caliber guns as ``long guns,'' subject to the least government regulation for any firearm. In other words, the law makes no distinction between the .22-caliber target rifle, a .30-06 caliber hunter's weapon, and this large-caliber combat weapon. Simply, I believe the law is wrong and needs to be changed.  This weapon is not in the same class as other rifles. Its power and range are of an order of magnitude higher.  Sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and even handguns are more highly-regulated than this military sniper rifle. In fact, many States allow possession of .50-caliber guns by those as young as 14-years old, and there is no regulation on second-hand sales.  Just this past year, the RAND Corporation released a report which identified eleven potential terrorist scenarios at Los Angeles International Airport. In one scenario, ``a sniper, using a .50 caliber rifle, fires at parked and taxiing aircraft.'' The report concludes: ``we were unable to identify any truly satisfactory solutions'' for such an attack.  Last June, a Department of Homeland Security representative told the Dallas Morning News that ``we remain concerned about any weapon of choice that could potentially be used by a terrorist, including a .50-caliber rifle.'' I think the Department's concerns are well founded.  The bottom line is that the .50-caliber sniper weapon represents a national security threat requiring action by Congress.  This is a weapon which should not be available to terrorists and criminals, and should be responsibly controlled through carefully crafted regulation.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 935       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Fifty Caliber Sniper Weapons      Regulation Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Certain firearms originally designed and built for use      as long-range .50 caliber military sniper weapons are      increasingly being sold in the United States civilian market.       (2) The intended use of these long-range firearms, and an      increasing number of models derived directly from them, is      the taking of human life and the destruction of materiel,      including armored vehicles and components of the national      critical infrastructure, such as radar and microwave      transmission devices.       (3) These firearms are neither designed nor used in any      significant number for legitimate sporting or hunting      purposes and are clearly distinguishable from rifles intended      for sporting and hunting use.       (4) Extraordinarily destructive ammunition for these      weapons, including armor-piercing and armor-piercing      incendiary ammunition, is freely sold in interstate commerce.       (5) The virtually unrestricted availability of these      firearms and ammunition, given the uses intended in their      design and manufacture, present a serious and substantial      threat to the national security.
