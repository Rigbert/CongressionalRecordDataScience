President, today Senator Chambliss and I are introducing legislation that could have a far-reaching impact on the national security of the United States. As every American knows, one of the most important elements of our national security infrastructure is the collection of agencies that make up our national intelligence community. But when most Americans think about the CIA, the FBI, or the NSA, they tend to think of agencies that are focused on a small handful of James Bond-style issues, such as missile stockpiles, new weapons technologies, and coups in foreign lands. These issues are still important, but in the modem world it is essential to recognize that protecting national security is a lot more complicated than it was during the Cold War, and there are many other issues that require attention and action.  Thankfully, the men and women of the intelligence community already recognize this crucial fact, and are working hard to address the wide variety of threats and challenges that face America in the 21st century. Unfortunately, many policymakers still think of intelligence in 20th century terms, and as a result many of our national intelligence capabilities are underused and underappreciated.  The best example of this is unquestionably in the field of energy security. American dependence on foreign oil has made our Nation less safe. Oil revenues have provided income for dangerous rogue states, they have sparked bloody civil wars, and they have even provided funding for terrorism. In a sickening phenomenon that I call the terror tax, every time that Americans drive their cars down to the gas station and fill up at the pump, the reality is that a portion of that money is then turned over to foreign governments that ``backdoor'' it over to Islamist extremists, who use that money to perpetuate terrorism and hate. As the GAO has pointed out, while talking about the oil-rich nation of Saudi Arabia:       Saudi Arabia's multibillion-dollar petroleum industry,      although largely owned by the government, has fostered the      creation of large private fortunes, enabling many wealthy      Saudis to sponsor charities and educational foundations whose      operations extend to many countries. U.S. government and      other expert reports have linked some Saudi donations to the      global propagation of religious intolerance, hatred of      Western values, and support to terrorist activities.  Furthermore, by allowing our national energy security to depend on foreign oil, we are leaving the American economy vulnerable to external shocks and disruptions. Recent American history is full of examples of events overseas jolting U.S. energy supplies, and just a couple decades ago the oil cartel known as OPEC declared an embargo which sent the U.S. economy into a tailspin.  There are many other challenges out there that have the potential to affect U.S. national security and energy security. For example, it seems clear that the Middle East will remain in turmoil for years to come, and policmakers will have to consider the potential impact of events such as a terrorist attack on a major oil facility, or a change in government in an oil-producing state, or the further deterioration of the situation in Iraq. Outside of the Middle East there are other challenges to face, including the continued growth of major energy consuming countries like India and China, the policies of less-predictable governments such as Russia and Venezuela, and the emergence of new energy producers in unstable areas of the world.  As policymakers attempt to grapple with these challenges, it is vital for them to be informed by the best thinking available, and as I said, the men and women of our national intelligence agencies are already performing quality analysis on many topics relevant to national security. This expertise is spread throughout the intelligence community, and includes professionals at the National Intelligence Council, the CIA's Office of Transnational Issues, and the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence at the Department of Energy.  Unfortunately, this expertise is rarely used to inform energy policy debates, primarily because these agencies generally use it to produce classified assessments. This means that I can discuss them in closed sessions of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, but not at hearings of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, even though I am a member of both committees. This legislation would address this problem by requiring the Director of National Intelligence to coordinate the production of an unclassified report on the intelligence community's assessments of key energy issues that have implications for the national security of the United States. It will be up to the intelligence agencies to determine what information can safely be discussed in public, but I am confident that the Director will be able to provide Congress with a report that includes thoughtful, insightful discussion of these issues, without revealing any sensitive information or compromising any sources and methods.  This legislation is entitled the Weighing Intelligence for Smarter Energy Act, or the WISE Act for short. I think that my colleagues and the American public would agree that when it comes to protecting our national energy security, it certainly wouldn't hurt for Congress to be a little bit wiser.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1613       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Weighing Intelligence for      Smarter Energy Act of 2007'' or the ``WISE Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The members of the intelligence community in the United      States, most notably the National Intelligence Council, the      Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence of the      Department of Energy, and the Office of Transnational Issues      of the Central Intelligence Agency, possess substantial      analytic expertise with regard to global energy issues.       (2) Energy policy debates generally do not use, to the      fullest extent possible, the expertise available in the      intelligence community.     SEC. 3. REPORT ON ENERGY SECURITY.       (a) Requirement.--       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of      the enactment of this Act, the Director of National      Intelligence shall submit to Congress a report on the long-     term energy security of the United States.       (2) Form of report.--The report required by subsection (a)      shall be submitted in an unclassified form and may include a      classified annex.       (b) Content.--The report submitted pursuant to subsection      (a) shall include the following:       (1) An assessment of key energy issues that have national      security or foreign policy implications for the United      States.       (2) An assessment of the future of world energy supplies,      including the impact likely and unlikely scenarios may have      on world energy supply.       (3) A description of--       (A) the policies being pursued, or expected to be pursued,      by the major energy producing countries or by the major      energy consuming countries, including developing countries,      to include policies that utilize renewable resources for      electrical and biofuel production;       (B) an evaluation of the probable outcomes of carrying out      such policy options, including--       (i) the economic and geopolitical impact of the energy      policy strategies likely to be pursued by such countries;       (ii) the likely impact of such strategies on the decision-     making processes on major energy cartels; and       (iii) the impact of policies that utilize renewable      resources for electrical and biofuel production, including an      assessment of the ability of energy consuming countries to      reduce dependence on oil using renewable resources, the      economic, environmental, and developmental impact of an      increase in biofuels production in both developed and      developing countries, and the impact of an increase in      biofuels production on global food supplies; and       (C) the potential impact of such outcomes on the energy      security and national security of the United States.
