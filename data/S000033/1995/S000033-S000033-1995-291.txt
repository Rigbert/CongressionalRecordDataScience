 Sixty-two percent of the people are so turned off by the political system they did not bother to vote. Most poor people in America, many working people in America do not vote. So what ends up happening is you have 38 percent of the people who vote, you have people who contribute huge amounts of money to the political system, they are able to finance candidates of their choice, so you have one whole group is invisible. If you do not vote and you are earning the minimum wage, who do you think is going to care about you? If somebody contributes, they buy a table for $10,000 at the Republican fundraiser, that 10 people will have far more influence over the political process than 20,000 people in Louisiana who are working for minimum wage or farmers in Vermont who are trying to get by on $10,000 a year.  So I would simply hope that we can revitalize the political process. If we increase voter turnout by 20 percent, this institution would be radically different. Mr. Becerra.
