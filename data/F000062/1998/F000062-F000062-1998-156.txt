 President, I rise today to submit a resolution expressing concern over the continuing deterioration of the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan, and calling on the administration to increase its efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and to protect the human rights of Afghan women.  I am joined in this resolution by Senators Brownback, Dodd, and Landrieu.  Mr. President, every day the women of Afghanistan are excluded from the international community's prevailing vision of human rights, and continue to lack basic legal rights, access to education, and access to economic opportunity. Indeed, perhaps nowhere in the world today is there a clearer test of our commitment to the cause of women's rights than Afghanistan.  In March of this year I convened a meeting with leading Non-Governmental organizations, the Administration, and Afghan women themselves to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and what options are available to the international community to make the lives of Afghanistan's women better.  Among those participating were representatives of the Department of State, the International Commission of the Red Cross, Save the Children, the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, Women in Refugee Development, and the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan, among others.  We discussed the legacy of close to twenty years of war and bloodshed which has torn apart Afghanistan: More than 1 million people have died, and much of the capital of Kabul lies in ruins.  There are more than 50,000 war widows in Kabul alone, many dependent on international humanitarian assistance for their very survival. The ICRC, for example, distributes food to some 15,000 widows in Kabul.  According to Theresa Loar, the State Department's Senior Coordinator for Women's Issues, in the 1980s a growing number of Afghan women worked outside the home. There were female lawyers, judges, doctors, and teachers. This trend was reversed in 1992 and now, under the Taliban, ``women and girls became, and remain today, virtually invisible.''  Education is a major concern, where edicts prevent girls from attending school and receiving an education. A small, low-profile, ``home school'' movement has started, with an estimated 6,500 girls and boys attending classes in Kabul. These home schools, however, are no substitute for access to a real education.  On September 6, 1997 the Taliban government issued a statement demanding that admission of female patients to hospitals cease immediately, and that all female medical staff stop working. After negotiations with the ICRC the Taliban government reconsidered, but women still face great difficulties in getting access to medical care.  Many Non-Governmental Organizations are doing work which I can describe as nothing short of heroic to provide medical and humanitarian assistance under the most adverse of circumstances. But they are faced with numerous constraints, from difficulties in collecting data and verifying beneficiary cards, to laws and practices which prevent the distribution of assistance or services directly to the women in need.  The U.S. State Department's 1997 human rights report states: ``Women were beaten for violating increasingly restrictive Taliban dress codes, which require women to be covered from head to toe. Women were strictly prohibited from working outside the home, and women and girls were denied the right to an education. Women were forbidden from appearing outside the home unless accompanied by a male family member. Beatings and death resulted from a failure to observe these restrictions.''  The women of Afghanistan, who have seen their families destroyed by war, are now having their economic life and their fundamental human rights stripped away, and an already war-torn and war-weary Afghanistan has been pushed to the brink of disaster.  Fully half of Afghanistan's population cannot work for a living or be educated. Fully half the population of Afghanistan are being systematically denied their basic human rights. We must act to stop these injustices and to bring peace to Afghanistan.  Ambassador Richardson's recent initiative, which led to the unprecedented peace talks between representatives of the Taliban and the Northern Alliance in Islamabad last month and an agreement to set up a 40-member Ulema commission to find a solution for the civil conflict, represents perhaps the best opportunity for a comprehensive peace in Afghanistan in over a generation.  The ultimate outcome of these discussions are still in doubt, however, and, movement at the peace talks has been accompanied by reports of new fighting in the fields, with both sides reportedly acquiring new weapons.  I believe we must give our full support to these peace talks. But I also believe that we must be prepared for continued violence in Afghanistan, and for the situation faced by Afghanistan's women to get worse before it gets better. As we await the outcome of these peace talks--and there is no quick or apparent solution in sight--we must continue to work to alleviate the plight of Afghanistan's women.  The resolution I submit today calls on the administration to create an Afghan Women's Initiative, along the lines of the successful Bosnian and Rwandan Women's Initiatives which the administration has created in the past two years. Those initiatives have assisted the victims of those wars by promoting the reintegration of women into the economy with an emphasis on capacity-building, training programs, legal assistance, and support for microenterprise projects, as well as refugee reintegration and protection.  I believe that the successes of those two programs can serve as a model for a similar initiative for the women of Afghanistan, as well as the numerous Afghan women in refugee camps in Pakistan. The women of Afghanistan could greatly benefit from such a women's initiative, and I look forward to working with the administration to design and implement such a program.  Second, this resolution calls for the international community to investigate charges of rape and abuse as instruments of the now almost decade-long civil war which has torn Afghanistan apart, and, if credible evidence exists, to convene a war crimes tribunal to prosecute the perpetrators.  Credible charges have been made about the systematic use of rape by several of the factions and parties involved in this struggle, and I believe that these charges must be investigated and, if true, must lead to indictments and trials.  Finally, I believe that the United States must be clear in stating that we will not recognize any government in Afghanistan unless it is broad-based, respective of all Afghans, and respects international norms of behavior in human rights, including the rights of women and girls. As we continue to work for peace in Afghanistan, this resolution calls for an unequivocal statement of administration policy on this point.  The United States, with our history of commitment to women's rights and equality, must redouble its efforts to place respect for women's rights at the top of the international community's agenda in Afghanistan, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  This resolution, essentially, asks the President and the Secretary of State to work with the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees to guarantee the safety of and provide development assistance for Afghan women in Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan, and to increase support for various refugee programs, to explore options for resettlement, and to establish in Afghanistan a women's initiative which is based on the successful model of the Bosnian women's initiative and the Rwandan women's initiative that are targeted toward Afghani women's groups.                          ____________________
