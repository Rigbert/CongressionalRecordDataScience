President, as I listen to the debate over this constitutional amendment, I am struck by thecircular and contradictory arguments offered by some supporters of this measure. It is clear even to a casual listener that the arguments from some proponents of this effort to use the Constitution to restrict individual freedom for the first time ever actually make the case for why there is no necessity for it. They must acknowledge that the Federal Defense of Marriage Act remains on the books and has been upheld by every Federal court that has considered it, including the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Their talking points proclaim that 45 States already passed legislation or contain provisions in their State constitutions that define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. They point out that 19 States have in the last 10 years passed referendums to amend their State constitutions and that decisive majorities approved a definition of marriage. These arguments beg the question as to why we are spending several days of a waning session on an amendment that is not only divisive but also unnecessary.  To propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of each House of Congress must ``deem it necessary.'' That is the constitutional standard for proposing a constitutional amendment. How, in light of this record, could Senators who value individual liberty, respect the States, and understand the Constitution vote any way other than against proceeding to this measure?  The Constitution is not some all-purpose bulletin board on which to hang political posters or to post bumper stickers. Our Constitution is the foundation of our rights and freedoms. The Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, were adopted to ensure limits on the Government and to protect the liberties of Americans. Vermont did not and would not become a State until 1791, the year the Bill of Rights was ratified. The structure of the Constitution, with its separation of powers and checks and balances, was designed by the Founders to protect our rights.  Sadly, the Bush-Cheney administration, with the acquiescence of a Republican Congress, has done much to remove those protections to the detriment of the rights of all Americans. In this regard, I note the recent report of the CATO Institute entitled, ``Power Surge: The Constitutional Record of George W. Bush.'' This report criticizes this administration for not upholding the text, history, and structure of the Constitution and recognizing the limits on Presidential power.  As congressional Republicans have returned time and again to use constitutional amendments as election year rallying cries to excite the passions of some voters, those in Congress who respect the Constitution and honor our oath of office to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United States'' are cast in the unpopular role of seeking to conserve the Constitution and constitutional principles in the face of demagogic proposals.  Several years ago a bipartisan group was formed to inject some reason into these debates. The Constitution Project has worked long and hard to develop guidelines for when constitutional amendments are appropriate. They have noted: ``The Founders created a Constitution that is difficult to amend, thus insuring a stable constitutional structure. In The Federalist No. 47, James Madison highlighted this very point. He argued that the Constitution should only be altered on `great and extraordinary occasions.' '' Proponents have not shown how this proposal meets those sensible guidelines, nor could they.  Recently, the CATO Institute and the Center for American Progress jointly held a symposium lending further support to rejecting this proposed amendment for a variety of reasons from across a wide spectrum of opinion.  All this raises the obvious question why this is the Republican leadership's priority in the face of an unfinished agenda of legislative matters that deeply concern Americans, ranging from escalating gas prices and health care costs to the ongoing violence in Iraq to homeland security. While the news articles and editorials characterizing this effort as crassly political are too numerous to include in the Record, I do ask consent to include a few that are representative. I ask that copies of the USA Today editorial from June 1, 2006, the New York Times editorials of June 5 and June 1, 2006, and the Washington Post editorial of May 24, 2006, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From USA Today, June 1, 2006]                          Just Say ``I Don't''       Apparently, issues such as immigration, corruption, gas      prices, the budget deficit, the war in Iraq and the prospect      of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons aren't substantial enough      to occupy members of Congress.       When senators return from their Memorial Day recess next      week, their thoughts will turn to June weddings. They plan to      spend their time on a bitter, divisive and unnecessary debate      over a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.       Even supporters of the Marriage Protection Amendment      readily concede that the measure to ban same-sex marriage      nationwide has virtually no chance of becoming part of the      Constitution. (It would need approval from two-thirds of both      chambers of Congress, plus ratification by three-fourths of      the states.)       So why bother?       Well, Election Day is a few months off. Supporters hope the      controversy will energize their base of social and religious      conservatives opposed to same-sex marriage.       Their plan could well backfire. Polls show that Americans      are evenly divided about the amendment. Religious activist      groups are annoyed that President Bush, who supports the      amendment, isn't lobbying hard enough for it.       At the same time, the 31 Republican sponsors risk      alienating moderate and independent voters who are turned off      by the pandering for a futile effort that will further divide      the nation.       The gay-marriage issue exploded when Massachusetts' highest      court ruled in November 2003 that same-sex couples have a      right to marry. Since then, more than 7,300 gay couples there      have done so. The commonwealth has survived.       But the public backlash elsewhere has been strong. Nineteen      states have amended their constitutions to ban gay marriage.      Most other states prohibit it as well.       The state activity makes the proposed constitutional      amendment all the more unnecessary. It would take away the      traditional authority of states to regulate marriage and      impose a one-size-fits-all edict on a nation still grappling      with the issue.       Most partisan drives to write social policy into our      enduring Constitution have, fortunately, failed. The      prohibition of alcohol was such a disaster that it was      repealed 14 years later. The Framers purposely made it      difficult to amend the Constitution so that intense passions      of the day wouldn't lead to laws that might last forever.       Supporters of the amendment trumpet the need to protect the      ``sanctity'' of marriage. But preserving the authority of      states to decide how to handle same-sex unions--whether      through marriage or some domestic partnership or civil union      law that protects the basic financial, health and legal      rights that heterosexual couples take for granted--doesn't      affect anyone else's marriage. And the 1996 federal Defense      of Marriage Act already says states may refuse to recognize      same-sex marriages performed in other states.       The proposed amendment would squelch the important debate      going on at the state level and poison political dialogue. It      should be jilted and left at the altar.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, June 5, 2006]                     Divide and Conquer the Voters       President Bush devoted his Saturday radio speech to a      cynical boost for a constitutional amendment banning gay      marriage, It was depressing in the extreme to hear the chief      executive trying to pretend, at this moment in American      history, that this was a critical priority.       Mr. Bush's central point was that the nation is under siege      from ``activist judges'' who are striking down anti-gay-     marriage laws that conflict with their own state      constitutions. That's their job, just as it is the job of      state legislators to either fix the laws or change their      constitutions.       If there's anything the country should have learned over      the past five years, it is that Mr. Bush and his supporters      have no problem with judicial decisions, no matter how      cutting edge, that endorse their political positions. They      trot out the ``activist judge'' threat only when they're      worried about getting out their base on Election Day.       The aim of the president's radio address--which darkly      warned that Massachusetts and San Francisco (nudge, nudge)      are going to destroy marriage--is the same as the Republican      leadership's plans to trot out one cultural hot button after      another in the coming weeks. After gay marriage comes the      push for a constitutional ban on flag burning, a solution in      search of a problem if there ever was one.       All this effort to divert the nation's attention to issues      that divide and distract would be bad enough if the country      were not facing real, disastrous problems at home and abroad.      But then, if that weren't the case, Mr. Bush probably      wouldn't feel moved to stoop so low.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, June 1, 2006]                      On the Low Road to November       Republicans are trying to rally their far-right base for      the fall elections with a mean-     spirited sideshow threatening to the Constitution: a ban on      same-sex marriage.       The Senate Judiciary Committee has endorsed the amendment,      which would write bigotry into the nation's charter, by a 10-     to-8 vote along party lines, and the full Senate is expected      to take it up soon. Since the measure's language covers not      only marriage but the ``legal incidents'' of marriage, its      approval could jeopardize civil unions, domestic partnerships      and other legal protections that many state and local      governments now provide for same-sex couples and their      children.       No one, including the G.O.P. strategists urging it's fast-     tracking, expects the amendment to get the two-thirds      Congressional approval needed to send it to the states for      consideration. Two years ago, when Republicans staged a      Senate vote on the same dismal amendment just before the      Democratic convention, it ran into unexpectedly broad      opposition. Some conservatives correctly opposed grabbing      power from the states by suddenly federalizing marriage law.      Supporters of the amendment could muster only 48 votes, well      shy of the 60 required to cut off debate and avoid a      filibuster.       Plainly, the real purpose of this rerun is to provide red      meat to social conservatives, and fodder for commercials      aimed at senators who vote to block the atrocious amendment.       It is sad that Senator Arlen Specter, the Republican      chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who personally opposes      the measure, chose to lend his gavel and vote to speed it to      the floor. He got angry when Senator Russell Feingold, the      Wisconsin Democrat, objected in forceful terms to both the      amendment and the politically motivated scheduling. Mr.      Specter and the other members of his committee who approved      the amendment have no reason to be angry--just ashamed.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, May 24, 2006]  Running Against Gays; As an Election Approaches, Can a Vote to Ban                     Same-Sex Marriage Be Far Behind?       The Senate Judiciary Committee last week churned out a      transparent effort to energize the restive Republican      electoral base by picking on gays and lesbians. It reported,      on a 10 to 8 vote along party lines, a federal constitutional      amendment stating that ``Marriage in the United States shall      consist only of the union of a man and a woman''; the      amendment would prevent federal and state constitutions alike      from being ``construed to require that marriage or the legal      incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the      union of a man and a woman,'' Senate Republican leaders are      determined to promptly bring up the resolution on the floor,      though it has no chance of passage. Its purpose, at this      stage anyway, is simply to make a statement--of solidarity      with socially conservative voters, of hostility toward      marriage equality for gays and lesbians, and of contempt for      state governments that might choose to move toward a more      inclusive conception of marriage.       Senators will indeed make an important statement with their      votes on this amendment--just not about the ``sanctity of      marriage,'' The vote, rather, will tally each member's      willingness to deform the U.S. Constitution.       On the merits, there is simply no case for an amendment      that would write into the Constitution an express command to      every state and federal official to discriminate against a      class of people. Marriage has always been a state matter in      the American system, and nothing about the advent of gay      marriage in a single state should change that. Opponents of      same-sex marriage outside of Massachusetts have no cause for      complaint. What goes on in that state doesn't concern them,      and they have shown themselves perfectly capable of      organizing in many other states to nip marriage rights for      same-sex couples in the bud. What's more, federal law already      guarantees that no state need recognize same-sex marriages      performed in any other. So the only purpose of a federal      amendment would be to prevent states that wish to move toward      marriage equality from doing so. Even within Massachusetts,      where opposition to same-sex marriage is hardly overwhelming,      the experiment with it will not succeed if a majority of      citizens over time believe strongly that the decision by the      state's high court creating marriage equality should be      overturned.       What exactly is the problem that requires upsetting 200      years of constitutional norms? The question answers itself.
