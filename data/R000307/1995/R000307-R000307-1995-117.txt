Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, so finally, a third rule, Mr. Chairman, as I continue with memories are made of this, and would call for the attention of the gentleman from Florida if he might, was reported which provided for 4 hours of general debate, only minority substitute, and a set of en bloc amendments by the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Andrews]. Both the Michel and Andrews amendments were subject to 1 hour of debate each. The rule made in order a compromise and reported bill put together by the four committees of jurisdiction, 1 hour, four committees, not what we are having here today, as the base text for the amendment purposes.  The rule was adopted 213 to 206, so there was just a tad bit of controversy in regards to that rule back in 1987 on the very same subject.  The manager of the rule, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Frost], said that was a modified closed rule, and so here we are today after hours of debate, many hours of debate.  I would remind the gentleman from Florida that Members are in their offices. Members have heard this debate on and on and on, 15 hours in the Ag Committee, many, many hearings. I think the commentary is specious. I think it ill serves the House. I think it ill serves the intent of Members who brought to this title of the bill important amendments that they thought were important.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Upton] if he chooses to comment.
