Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember, to honor and celebrate a great citizen and a dear friend, Maynard Jackson.  Maynard Jackson's untimely death was shocking and is still unbelievable. I have known Maynard Jackson for more than 35 years; and, Mr. Speaker, I must tell my colleagues Maynard Jackson was a man who thought the impossible was possible. In 1973, he was the first African American to be elected mayor of the city of Atlanta. He served 12 years as mayor of the city.  During his tenure as mayor of Atlanta, he began encouraging and fostering an interracial understanding, transforming the city into a new Atlanta, to the gateway to the South, the city that was too busy to hate. I truly believe that Maynard Jackson must be looked upon as one of the founding fathers of the new Atlanta, the new South and the new America.  Maynard Jackson was a strong supporter of affirmative action, civil rights and expansion of social and economic gain for minorities. As our current mayor Shirley Franklin stated a few days ago, Maynard Jackson was a lion of a man. He was a champion of inclusion for all people and never wavered in his commitment to Atlanta.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Maynard Jackson helped create an Atlanta that we all could be proud of. He was not afraid or scared to do what was unpopular. He was not scared to take a chance. Maynard Jackson was not afraid to do the right thing.  Because of his leadership, vision and dedication, our city, State and Nation will never be the same. We will miss you, Maynard. Atlanta will miss you, the Nation will miss you, but we would never, ever forget you. You have left your mark on each and every one of us. Thank you for your service. Thank you for giving your heart and your soul. As you take your passion and energy to the great beyond, again a grateful Nation, a grateful people and a grateful city say thank you.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1100
