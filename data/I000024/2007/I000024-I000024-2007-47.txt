President, every once in a while we disagree with the majority leader. In this case, I do. When he says the immigration bill brought us together, it didn't bring us together. Let us remember what happened, though. The immigration bill: We came in on a Monday and expected to vote on a bill that no one had seen until Saturday afternoon. Now, this is another sudden thing upon us, and let us keep in mind this is an amnesty bill. We are talking about people who came to this country illegally, regardless of age.  This says: If you have lived in the United States for more than 5 consecutive years, even though you came in illegally, and if you entered this country at age 16 or before--and you could have been here for as long as 14 years illegally, because they have the cutoff at age 30--then you will be getting a conditional, lawful permanent residence--a green card--for up to 6 years.  What can you do during that 6-year period? During that 6-year period you can actually bring in other members, parents and others, who were brought here illegally in the first place, so they can enjoy that same type of citizenship.  Now, I know I am prejudiced on this issue because I have had the honor of speaking at naturalization ceremonies. When you look at the people who have done it right, done it legally--they have learned the language and the history--this or any other type of an amnesty bill would be a slap in the face to all those who came here legally.  So I would ask the question: When do we learn? We went through this thing before. I know we try to fast-track these things so people will not catch on, but I can assure you, all of America is awake on this one and they know exactly what we are doing. This is another amnesty bill, and I believe we should not proceed to it.  I yield the floor.
