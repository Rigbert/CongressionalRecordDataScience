 Mr. President, I rise to discuss the need to provide emergency financial relief to our country's farmers and ranchers and to rural America in what will hopefully be short-term assistance that will allow our producers to meet their cash flow needs while Congress also pursues the long-term objectives needed to provide a profitable agriculture sector into the 21st century.  As one Kansas farmer told me recently: ``Pat, in farm country today we are just not in very good shape for the shape we are in.''  Farmers today, as many of my colleagues are pointing out, are struggling with depressed prices and cash flow difficulties, especially farmers who do not receive program payments under the current farm bill.  We can and should provide relief to enable our producers to get through these very difficult times, and the choice between the relief package that has been offered by Senator Cochran and that offered by Senator Harkin will determine the kind and amount of assistance that will be forthcoming--or some other substitute.  In this regard, I have been urging Congress to act on a program of limited but effective assistance before this August break to send a strong signal to farmers, ranchers, and most important, the agriculture lending community. Land values have not tailed off, but the continuing stress certainly could lead to that. We need to nip that in the bud.  On the other hand, I do not believe it is in the interest of American agriculture to rewrite the current farm bill or to enact policy that will be market interfering, market disruptive, and lead us back down the road to command and control farm policy from Washington. Unfortunately, I believe both of the proposals that are before us today, or at least some aspects of those proposals, do fall into that category, especially the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle.  I will discuss the shortcomings of these proposals later, but first let me point out, this emergency assistance debate is only part of the story. The rest of the story involves the drumbeat of rhetoric we have heard from our Democrat colleagues and friends across the aisle, and the Clinton administration, who, month after month, week after week, day after day, have blamed the 1996 farm bill, called Freedom to Farm, for the collapse of commodity prices, if not the end of production agriculture and family farms in the United States.  Reading the press releases, the resulting headlines, and listening to my colleagues, you would think the current farm bill was the result of some sinister plot concocted in the dead of night.  Apparently, they would like farmers and ranchers to believe our current farm policy is responsible for record worldwide production; increasing and record yield production and productivity; the worst international economic crisis since the early 1980s decimating our largest markets; record subsidies by the European Union, some $60 billion; weather--too much rain, too little rain, the obvious drought in the Atlantic States, La Nina and El Nino; persistent plant diseases in the northern plains, and crop infestation in all other regions; new technology and precision agriculture; currency changes and the value of the dollar that have reduced American exports--that would be some farm bill. But those are the causes that have actually led to the low commodity prices.  In fact, the current farm bill came after 38 full committee and subcommittee hearings in the House Agriculture Committee during my tenure as Chairman, 21 of which were held in farm country--every region, every commodity--all open-microphone listening sessions. Extensive hearings were also held here in Washington on this side of the Capitol in the Senate Agriculture Committee.  Literally thousands of farmers and ranchers voiced their opinion. They overwhelmingly stated they wanted the Government to get out of their planting decisions, to quit interfering in the marketplace, so they could make their own marketing decisions based on what was best for their farms, their ranches, according to the market.  The bottom line, farmers told us there was too much in command and control that came from Washington. They were tired of standing in line outside the Farm Service Agency so that Washington could tell them what to plant in exchange for a Government subsidy.  As one 89-year-old Kansas farmer told us in Dodge City--and I quote:       I farmed for nearly 60 years and I never planted a crop      that the government had not told me I could plant.  The single most important goal and rationale behind the 1996 farm bill was to restore decision making back to the individual producer, i.e., the freedom to farm.  It is true--almost all of the speeches that have been made on the floor of the Senate, and all of the press conferences that we have heard all throughout farm country--it is true our commodity prices are depressed. Markets are depressed worldwide. Everyone involved in agriculture certainly knows and is dealing with that firsthand.  But as the saying goes in farm country: Comin' as close to the truth as a man can come without gettin' there is comin' pretty close but it still ain't the truth.  Or put another way, no matter who says what, don't believe it if it doesn't make sense. With all due respect to my colleagues who apparently believe the 1996 Farm Act is the root cause of problems in farm country, I do not believe that is simply the case.  I understand the politics of the issue. As scarce as the truth is, the supply seems greater than demand. And with Freedom to Farm, there is no demand amongst some of my Democrat friends.  But politics aside, I must admit I am both puzzled and amazed by the rhetoric we have heard over and over and over and over again. How can a farm bill that has provided on average more income assistance during difficult times over the past 3 years than occurred during the five-year average under the old farm bill be bad for farmers?  Let me point out that the market situation for all raw commodities is under stress. In addition to low crop prices, we have also been suffering through low farm prices for cattle, for hogs, for oil, for gold, for gas, and all raw commodities. None of these commodities has been covered by a farm bill--any farm bill. Is the current farm bill responsible for the market collapse in these commodities? Obviously not. But the causes that caused those low prices are the same ones that caused the problem with regard to farm country.  There was an interesting press report about a week ago. It was on the front page of a newspaper about the severity of the agriculture situation--and it is severe. The lead of the story said:       In the wake of dismal prairie farm income projections,      agriculture officials emphasized the need for an improved      long term safety net. If something is not done we are going      to lose a lot of farmers.  But you know, that story was not about the United States; it was about Canada and their farm crisis. Canadian farmers are facing bleak prospects; and the same is true in Great Britain; and the same is true in Europe; and the same is true all over this world, in Latin America and South America, as well.  I do not think that Freedom to Farm caused their problems. This is a worldwide market decline, and as such is unprecedented.  What has caused the low commodity prices?  First, farmers worldwide have had good growing weather and produced record crops for 3 years in a row--unprecedented. That is what my good friend and colleague, the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, said a few weeks ago when we attended a joint meeting--unprecedented record crops.  Second, we have experienced a world depression in regard to our export markets, both in Asia and Latin America and South America.  Third, the European Union is now spending a record $60 billion--85 percent of the world's ag subsidies--on their subsidies.  Fourth, the currency exchange rates reduced the level of farm exports and farm prices. A 16-percent appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar has been responsible for 17 to 25 percentage points of the decline in corn and wheat prices.  Fifth, a market-oriented farm program depends on an aggressive trade policy. In regard to trade, although it is very controversial, we did not do fast track. We had a very historic agreement with China, with bipartisan work on it, and then it was pulled back; and then it was followed by the bombing of the Chinese Embassy. That was not the intent, but that is what has happened. And we are about to put agriculture last--certainly not first--in the coming WTO trade talks in Seattle. We continue to employ counterproductive sanctions that punish U.S. farmers and reward our competitors with market share and have no effect on our foreign policy.  The administration has moved in this regard. We have bipartisan support for sanctions reform, but we still cannot use the USDA export programs in regard to making those sales.  Again, the cause for these low prices is not the 1996 farm bill. Quite the contrary, under Freedom to Farm--and I want everybody to listen to this--farmers in each State represented by most of the critics of the 1996 act have and are receiving more income assistance on average than they did under the old bill.  Under Freedom to Farm, farmers themselves--not Washington--have set aside their crop production and switched to other higher value crops. Nevertheless, we hear the mantra that we do not have a safety net.  Let me point out, for the past 3 years of the current farm bill we have provided transition payments--somehow or other in this debate the reality of transition payments over the 6-year life of the farm bill has been ignored. It is almost like they do not exist in the minds of the critics, but we have provided them. They are direct income support, and that amounts to approximately $23 billion to our farmers and ranchers for the past 3 years of the bill.  On the downside, we have also provided nearly $3 billion in what is called loan deficiency payments. That means the price goes below the loan rate. The loan rate was pretty low. We would never have imagined we would have to use the LDP program, but we had to--$3 billion. Recent estimates by the USDA are projecting possible LDPs totaling $8 billion this year.  These numbers total to nearly $34.5 billion by the end of 1999, and they do not include the $6 billion in lost market payments and disaster relief that were paid to farmers in 1998.  If you add in the $6 billion emergency package of last year, and the proposed assistance now being debated, the total is unprecedented--unprecedented--but even before these disaster payments you still had more income under the current farm bill than farmers would have received under the old one, under the 5-year average. So from that standpoint, I do think we have a safety net.  In the past 3 years in Minnesota, for the benefit of my dear friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone, the safety net for farmers under Freedom to Farm averaged $136 million more in total payments compared to the state average under the old bill.  In South Dakota, the safety net for farmers under Freedom to Farm averaged for the past 3 years was $58 million more than the state average under the old bill.  In North Dakota--Senator Dorgan and Senator Conrad are two Members who fight for their farmers and believe very passionately that we must address this problem--$15 million more; in Nebraska, $109 million more; and in Iowa, the safety net for farmers under Freedom to Farm in the last 3 years provided $162 million more than the previous bill.  Is it enough in regard to the problems we face that are unprecedented? Is it enough for the northern prairie States with border problems and wheat scab and weather you can't believe? I do not know. That is for those Senators and those farmers to determine. But there has been a significant increase in that direct income assistance to those producers.  Finally, for those who like roosters at the dawn and coyotes at dusk, crow and howl that we have ripped the rug out from underneath our farmers and the safety net, let me point out that during the first 3 years of Freedom to Farm, the average amount of income assistance to hard-pressed farmers was higher in every one of the 50 States than the 5-year average for each State during the previous farm bill. Again, these higher 3-year averages do not include emergency assistance that producers received through the structure of the Freedom to Farm Act that farmers received last year and they will receive this year when we finally get to the determination of whatever emergency package we should pass.  In making these statements, let me urge my colleagues to do their homework. Take time to read an assessment of the 1996 Farm Act by the Coalition for Competitive Food in the Agriculture System, published this June. In brief, the summary concluded the act did not cause the low commodity prices--I mentioned the two causes--supported the underlying health of the farm economy, and has provided a strong safety net--yes, buttressed by the emergency legislation--and, one of the biggest conclusions, forces U.S. competitors to adjust to the world market.  There is a summary of this report, and I ask unanimous consent to have the summary printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     An Assessment of the FAIR Act       Food and agriculture remains the US economy's largest      single economic sector, accounting for $1 trillion in      national income, and employing 18 percent of the nation's      entire work force. Almost one-fourth of US economy.       In 1996, the US Congress passed historic farm legislation,      allowing the US agricultural economy to respond to the global      market. The FAIR Act provided farmers with a strong safety      net, coupled with the freedom to plant for the market. It      ended the counterproductive practices of taking good US      cropland out of production and of setting a global price      floor for all the world's farmers, which served only to      intensify foreign competition against U.S. growers.     Fundamentals of the FAIR Act       Eliminated planting requirements.       Eliminated supply controls and acreage idling programs.       Freed farmers to plant for the market.       Eliminated variable deficiency payments.       Provided guaranteed transition payments.       Retained competitive price support levels.       Retained marketing loans to prevent government stockpiling.            the FAIR Act Did Not Cause Low Commodity Prices       The passage of the FAIR Act coincided with sea changes in      the global economy, which have dramatically affected the US      agricultural economy. Years of worldwide economic growth,      particularly in middle income developing countries, led to      rising demand for meat and animal feed. Increased market      access achieved by the Uruguay Round Agreement, as well as      regional agreements such as NAFTA, allowed US farmers to take      advantage of that growth overseas. New technologies      (biotechnology, precision farming, no till agriculture) were      increasing crop yields at the same time as record high prices      led farmers in the United States and overseas to expand      acreage.       Two years after the enactment of the FAIR Act, the global      economy suffered the worst international crisis since the      early 1980s. The fast growing Asian economies, which together      are the largest single market for US exports had been the      fastest growing importer of US food and agricultural      products, suffered dramatic reversals, as did Russia.       Asian demand was down 17 percent in 1998, and will be down      another 23 percent this year. Ironically, sales to Mexico      were up 17 percent, and NAFTA is the fastest growing market      for U.S. farmers.       The sharp drop in demand for food and agricultural products      coincided with record harvests in the United States, Brazil,      Argentina and other food producing nations. Between 1993 and      1998, world wheat production has shifted from 65.4 MMT below      trend to 31.7 MMT above trend--an increase in supply of      nearly 100 MMT. World corn production has shifted from 52 MMT      below trend in the early 1990s to 36 MMT above trend in the      late     1990s--an increase of 88 MMT. Soybean production has seen      similar trends, with production 7 MMT below trend in the      early 1990s and 11 MMT in the latter half of the 1990s. As a      result of these huge shifts in supply, world prices have      dropped far from their uncharacteristic highs in the mid-     1999s, to slightly below average levels, when compared to the      firt half of the decade.  The FAIR Act Has Supported the Underlying Health of the Farm Economy       During the tenure of the FAIR Act, the underlying financial      health of the sector has improved, when compared to the first      half of the 1990s. Total farm assets were 18 percent higher      than the 1990-94 average in 1996 and are estimated to be 30      percent higher in 1999. Similarly, land values in 1998 were      16 percent higher than their average value in 1990-94, and      are projected to be 38 percent higher in 1999. Moreover,      liquidity ratios are up, debt servicing ratios are down, and      return on equity has increased from 0.5 percent in 1995 to      2.3 percent in 1998.       While there have certainly been regions and commodities      that have suffered from sharp prices declines and from      various weather and crop related disasters, overall, average      farm income during the FAIR Act has been higher than farm      income under previous legislation. Even with the declines in      1998 and 1999, farm income during the FAIR Act is higher on      average than during the previous farm legislation.       In perhaps the most important measure of the financial      outlook for the sector, farmland prices continue to rise      throughout the country. Since 1995, the price of farmland in      the Corn Belt has risen from $1600 per acre to over $1800 per      acre; land in the Great Lakes has risen from just over $1000      per acre to almost $1300 per acre. Even in the Northern      Plains, which has suffered the most in terms of prices and      disasters, farmland prices are up from just under $1000 per      acre to almost $1100 per acre.               The FAIR Act Provides a Strong Safety Net       Under the terms of the FAIR Act, $35.6 billion will be      provided to farmers through direct income payments over seven      years, for an average of $5 billion annually. In addition,      expenditures under the commodity loan program, which makes up      the difference between the loan rate and a lower market      price, have added an additional $1 billion annually, an      amount that could reach $3.5 billion in 1999 alone. In      addition, the disaster relief and market loss payments during      1998 added an additional $6 billion in government payments to      farmers. In all, payments under the FAIR Act have totaled      $5.7 billion per year. By comparison, payments under the old      farm program averaged $5.5 billion per year. Because they are      based on previous production levels and historical program      yields, the bulk of those payments go to large, commercial      farmers who account for the bulk of U.S. production.   The FAIR Act Forces U.S. Competitors to Adjust to the World Market       In the past, when the United States took land out of      production in response to low prices, our competitors in      Brazil, Argentina and other countries simply expanded their      acreage to take up the slack. When the United States raised      its support prices in the early 1980s, farmers in other      countries took advantage of the price floor set by the United      States, to expand their production. In effect, the United      States functioned as the Saudi Arabia of the World grain      market. Those policies provided a safety net not just to US      farmers, but to the world's farmers.       Under the FAIR Act, U.S. farmers face no government-     mandated set-asides. As a result, they have brought nearly 10      million acres back into production. With the safety net of      the marketing loan in place, U.S. farmers are guaranteed to      receive the loan rate, even if world prices fall to lower      levels. This means that farmers in other countries will be      forced to respond to world markets prices, while U.S. farmers      benefit from the higher U.S. loan rate. Should world prices      rise above U.S. loan rates, U.S. farmers will be able to      receive the full benefit of those higher prices.
