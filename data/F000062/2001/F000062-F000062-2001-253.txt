 President, today, I am introducing legislation designed to eliminate injuries and deaths that result from crib accidents.  While there are strict guidelines on the manufacture and sale of new cribs, there are still 25 to 30 million unsafe cribs sold throughout the U.S. in ``secondary markets,'' such as thrift stores and resale furniture stores. These cribs should be taken off the market, and either made safe, or destroyed.  There are a number of reasons why unsafe cribs should be taken off the market.  Each year, at least 50 children ages two and under die from injuries sustained in cribs. That is almost one child a week.  The number of deaths from crib incidents exceeds deaths from all other nursery products combined.  Over 12,000 children are hospitalized each year as a result of injuries sustained in cribs.  To illustrate the need for this legislation, I want to share with you the story of Danny Lineweaver.  At the age of 23 months, Danny was injured during an attempt to climb out of his crib. Danny caught his shirt on a decorative knob on the cornerpost of his crib and hanged himself.  Though his mother was able to perform CPR the moment she found him, Danny lived in a semi-comatose state for nine years and died in 1993. This injury and subsequent death could have been prevented.  Since Danny's accident, we have passed laws mandating safety standards for the manufacture of new cribs. But this is not enough.  There are nearly four million infants born in this country each year, but only one million new cribs sold. As many as half of all infants are placed in secondhand, hand-me-down, or heirloom cribs, cribs that are sold in thrift stores or resale furniture stores. These cribs may be unsafe, and may in fact threaten the life of the infants placed in them.  This legislation requires thrift stores and retail furniture stores to remove decorative knobs on the cornerposts of cribs before selling those cribs.  Additionally, the bill prohibits hotels and motels from providing unsafe cribs to guests, or risk being fined up to $1,000.  The Infant Crib Safety Act makes the sale of used, unsafe cribs illegal. I hope my colleagues will join me in putting a stop to preventable injuries and deaths resulting from unsafe cribs.                                 ______                                       By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, Mr. McCain,         Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Helms, Mr. Miller, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr.         Cleland, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr.         Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inouye,         Mr. Johnson, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr.         Thurmond, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Lott).  S. 540. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow as a deduction in determining adjusted gross income the deduction for expenses in connection with services as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States, to allow employers a credit against income tax with respect to employees who participate in the military reserve components, and to allow a comparable credit for participating reserve component self-employed individuals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleagues, including Senators Warner, Levin, McCain, Lieberman, Helms, Miller, Hutchinson from Arkansas, Cleland, Inhofe, and Landrieu, to introduce the ``Reserve Component Tax Assistance Act of 2001.''  We are introducing this bill today because it represents one way we can help retain the brave men and women who serve in our military's Guard and reserve components. Our bill would offer much-needed support for them and their families by restoring a tax deduction to our reservists for travel expenses incurred getting to and from duty assignments. The bill also would provide a tax credit to employers who support employees serving in the reserve component.  As my colleagues are well aware, the security of our nation hinges on all the men and women who serve in uniform, both active duty and reserves. That became very clear a decade ago, when members of our active duty and reserve forces came together to drive Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi Republican Guard out of Kuwait. Operation Desert Storm was one of the largest and most successful military operations since the inception of the all-volunteer force of the early 1970's. Its success was due in large part to the efforts of reserve component personnel. Since then, our reservists and Guardsmen and women have contributed in every U.S. military and humanitarian operation.  This increased reliance on our reserve personnel came at a time when U.S. military forces were downsizing in response to the ``peace dividend'' linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Despite the end of the Cold War, the tempo of our military's operations remains at a steady beat. In fact, the military's dependence on our reservists and Guardsmen and women has remained at near Gulf War levels. The military has placed greater training and participation demands on our reservists, taking them away from family and civilian employment.  This increased demand does not occur without cost, particularly financial costs to our reserve military components and their full time employers. The bill we are introducing today is an attempt to provide some additional compensation for these dedicated men and women. It is a small step, but one that is necessary. I urge my colleagues to support our bill and demonstrate our commitment to supporting the proud and dedicated reservists, Guardsmen and women, and employers who play such a pivotal role in our national defense. I am pleased that this legislation already has the support of the Reserve Officers Association, the National Guard Association, the Military Coalition, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 540       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
