Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my Republican colleagues to stop blocking action on the minimum wage. I have said it before and I will say it again here today: Raising the minimum wage is not just an economic issue, it is a moral issue; it is the right thing to do.  The Republicans in this House tried to block an increase in the minimum wage and failed. The Republicans in the Senate tried to block it and failed. Having lost on the floor, Republicans now are holding the minimum wage hostage. The Republicans in Congress will do anything to deny hard-working people a small raise.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Majority Leader, I know you vowed to fight an increase in the minimum wage with every fiber in your being, but you cannot fight the will of the American people forever.  One thing is for sure, come November, working people will remember.                          ____________________
