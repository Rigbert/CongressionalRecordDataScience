Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Mr. Davis, the chairman of the committee, for bringing this resolution to the floor in such a timely fashion.  I certainly want to thank my good friend, Curt Weldon, the cochair of the Fire Service Caucus, who has been the leader of the Fire Service Caucus, and the Fire Service of America and emergency medical response teams have no better friend than Curt Weldon in the Congress of the United States or, frankly, in any place else.                              {time}  2000  I am pleased to rise in support of our Nation's firefighters on this day that 2,100 of them from around the country are gathered in Washington for the annual National Fire and Emergency Services Dinner.  As Mr. Weldon said, we will be bringing them this resolution in just a few minutes as we go down to the Hilton to address them. I am proud to have cosponsored this resolution.  And I want to say that the Fire Caucus has long championed initiatives to improve the safety and well-being of our Nation's firefighters. Specifically, we have worked to establish and fund the assistance to the Firefighters Grant program, which has provided more than $3 billion in equipment and training grants for career and volunteer departments across the country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).
