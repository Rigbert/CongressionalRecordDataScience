Chairman, I move to strike requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I respect my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], and I respectfully disagree with his amendment.                              {time}  1645  One of the saddest responsibilities of any Member of Congress is to stand at the funeral of a fallen soldier. Many of us have had to do it. After the crack of the rifles, after the honor guard has folded the flag from the casket into a neat tri-corner and handed it to the family, it is often our responsibility to walk over to the family of the fallen serviceman and to strain to find some words to say.  I do not know that I could walk up to the family of a soldier who has died in the invasion of a foreign land, and say I am very sorry, but Congress voted just a few weeks ago not to have any voice in the decision as to whether your son or daughter would go to war. You elected me as your Representative, but I had no voice in a premeditated declaration of war which ultimately took the life of your son or daughter. You gave me your voice in Congress to represent you, and I gave it away. I could not say that.  Our Constitution could not make it clearer. Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution confers on Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate alone, alone, the power to declare war, and the War Powers Act, imperfect though it may be, is an effort to carry out the intent of our Constitution, the clear unambiguous intent of that Constitution, to require Congress, and the American people through them, to enter into a debate and deliberation before we send our sons and daughters off to die.  I think today, 22 years after the fact, we may have forgotten the circumstances of the creation of this War Powers Act. It is said that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. This act was enacted in 1973 over the veto of President Richard Nixon. It followed the Vietnam war. It was an extraordinary situation. Congress came together, Democrats and Republicans, and rebuked the sitting President of the United States and said ``We have learned our lesson. Vietnam has taught us a bitter lesson. Never, never, never again will this country allow so many wonderful young men and women to give up their lives without the kind of full-scale national debate of this Nation through its Congress.''  Then we enacted the War Powers Resolution, after 58,000 Americans lost their lives in an undeclared war which Robert McNamara now concedes as unwinnable in his infamous apologia. An America ravaged by the divisive national debate over Vietnam, an America devastated by the loss of so many good men and women in that war, an America cynical over being lied to and misled by Presidents of both political parties, that America of 1973 passed this law and vowed to do everything in its power to avoid any repetition of the national tragedy of Vietnam.  So today, 22 years later, we come to repeal the law, to walk away from it, to basically abdicate our congressional responsibility, to say to this President and every President to come, it is your responsibility. It is your war. Come see us, consult us, talk to us. If we get upset with it after it is done, we will probably try to address it through an appropriations process.  Like so many other actions we have taken over the last several months, this is a further erosion of the power of everyone sitting in this gallery and everyone listening to my voice who elects a man or a woman to come and stand in this well before this microphone and speak for them. It takes away that power. It takes away the authority of your family to be represented in that national debate.  As I reflect on what I have accomplished in the years that I have served in the House of Representatives, one of my proudest moments was to cosponsor a resolution with former Congressman Charles Bennett before the Persian Gulf war. That resolution brought every Member of the House of Representatives to the floor in an all-night session to express their most heartfelt views as to whether or not we should engage in war. It was the finest hour of this Chamber in all the years that I have served. We stood tall for the constitutional principle that it was our responsibility to declare that war and to decide whether anyone's life would be risked. And we passed that resolution, saying it was the congressional responsibility, by a bipartisan vote of 302 to 131. We then went on to vote on the question.
