Think about this. This father saw this come through the mail. Think of the world we live in, with the Internet and the webs. How many others are trying to lure kids into the purchase of weapons or a membership in a National Rifle Association and the like? I really think when we talk about responsibility and accountability, it applies to parents and it applies to organizations such as the NRA as well.  I say to my friend from Nevada that he raises an excellent point. If we are going to make sure our kids have a fighting chance, we have to keep guns out of their hands. When the Senator from Nevada and I were both growing up a few years ago, there were always troubled kids in the schools. We called them bullies in those days. You feared getting punched in the nose on the playground. I wish that is all our kids had to fear today. Now they have to fear that the bully will get a gun and show up in school, as it happened in Conyers, GA; at Columbine High School; Jonesboro; West Paducah; Springfield, Oregon; Pearl, Mississippi. Those unfortunate incidents are the reality of the dangers our kids can face.
