Leader, my point is this, and I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. This is not an accusation of one side or the other. This is a history of practice that has occurred. But I say to the leader, the reason the President of the United States has said that he will not allow this bill to go forward if the CR is included, and I am one who voted to include the CR, as the leader knows. I was on his side of that vote. But the reason the President of the United States has said I will not sign this bill, because we know there is not the same kind of compulsion to pass appropriation bills consistent with the budget agreement that there is, Mr. Leader, for the empathy that we have for the flood victims.  Therefore, I say to the leader that we ought to consider passing a clean supplemental at some point in time, tonight, tomorrow, whenever we get back to it, Mr. Leader, so that we do not again revisit this anguish that we are now experiencing because of our inability to act. I would urge the leader that we do the unanimous consent that the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], the chairman, wanted to do. If we cannot do it, I will lament that, but I think we ought to consider doing a clean CR for the victims of this flood.
