 Putting down numbers on a piece of paper--that is not reality, that does not provide teachers, that does not provide classroom space, that does not provide afterschool care--does not mean anything to anybody.  We want to make sure the budgets we pass are real, that they are funded in reality, that those programs are there, and that this country makes sure that our kids get the education we ought to be providing in our schools.
