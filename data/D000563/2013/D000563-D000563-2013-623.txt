And this has been controversial. I can remember that in the last debate--and it was a few years ago--the argument being made was that we should have free access to the Internet. I don't quarrel with that. The Internet has been a powerful force in our economy. It is going to grow as a force in our economy, and I don't believe we should tax access to the Internet. There are also a myriad of bills related to services over the Internet and whether they should be taxed. We do not get into that in any way whatsoever. What we are talking about are taxable goods by State law subject to State sales taxes as they currently exist. We don't change those taxes in any way.  A point that was raised in our press conference is an important one. Some States treat food differently, prescription drugs differently. The State has to basically tell the retail community what the State standard is going to be for the categories of goods that are being sold. So we make it as easy as humanly possible for the Internet retailers, providing at the expense of the State the software they need to make this work.
