President, before I begin, I assume we will go back and forth, from side to side of the aisle on this. But as Democrats are recognized, I ask it be in this order: Senator Kennedy for 20 minutes, Senator Durbin for 15, Senator Feinstein for up to 20 minutes, Senator Salazar for up to 15 minutes, as Democrats, are recognized. I ask unanimous consent to that.
