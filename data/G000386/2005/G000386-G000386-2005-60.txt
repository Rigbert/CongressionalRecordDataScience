 President, I rise today to mark the loss of one of my staff members and to make a statement for The Congressional Record about the good work of this individual for the people of Iowa. Earl Lee Monholland died at home on October 31, 2005, due to heart illness, at the age of 37. Earl worked on my staff for 12 years as a constituent services specialist in Davenport, Cedar Rapids, and Washington, DC. He was a dedicated public servant who thoroughly enjoyed helping Iowans. He was committed to providing assistance in a responsive and timely manner and to making sure that whatever could be done got done behalf of a constituent having problems with the Federal bureaucracy. Earl also was an outstanding colleague to his fellow staff members, going out of his way to make things work for the entire team, especially with the computer systems. I greatly appreciate the fine work that Earl did during the last 12 years and the unassuming way hegot the job done. There is no doubt that Earl Monholland will be missed by his friends and colleagues on the Grassley staff.                          ____________________[Pages S13347-S13348]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     TRIBUTE TO EARL LEE MONHOLLAND
