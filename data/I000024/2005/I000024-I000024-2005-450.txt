President, somewhere in the world a child dies from malaria every 30 seconds. The disease debilitates more than 500 million people annually and kills well over 1 million of them. Suffering most acutely from this epidemic is the continent of Africa where 90 percent of the world's malaria deaths occur. In fact, malaria is the No. 1 killer of pregnant women and children under the age of 5 in Africa.  I have personally visited nearly 20 countries in Africa. Everywhere you go there, children have it. These trips have changed statistics into incomprehensible reality for me. Malaria--a debilitating and deadly disease--is a huge problem. I recently heard from a young boy in Ghana named Ibrahim who has accepted the dismal reality of dealing with malaria. ``Malaria is just a part of life,'' Ibrahim told me.  The United States has been concerned about this problem for many years. The United States Agency for International Development, USAID, budget to fight this disease has increased nearly fivefold since 1998 to $90 million in 2005. However, the incidence of malaria continues to increase alarmingly in underdeveloped African countries. Unequivocally, the current strategy is not working. USAID spends 90 percent of its money on advice giving, conferences, and technical assistance, but not on direct interventions that produce significant results.  Insecticides to preempt malaria are cheap. Drugs to cure malaria can be purchased for $2--less than a cup of coffee at Starbucks. Indoor residual spraying is a technique that has eradicated malaria in many regions. We know how to address malaria and we have the resources to do it.  We have talked enough about the problem. It is time to fix it.  I am pleased that we have addressed this problem with language in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. This is an important step toward achieving real results. Instead of doling out money to beltway-based consultants, this language will ensure that tangible aid reaches desperate African women and children. It is vital that we require USAID malaria allocations go toward lifesaving drugs, mosquito nets, and pesticides, which are proven to reduce malaria death and infection rates. In the hands of the affected individuals these commodities can save lives. It does not take a lot of money to make a huge difference.  Additionally, this language requires transparency from USAID. I have often had difficulty determining exactly how USAID malaria money is being spent. In fact, the latest data available to Congress on how USAID spends malaria funding is from fiscal year 2004.That year only 1 percent of total malaria funding was spent on indoor residual spraying, 1 percent was spent on purchasing antimalarial drugs, and 6 percent was used to purchase insecticide-treated bed nets.  I am also concerned that too much of our foreign aid goes to conferences and research. Not enough resources get directly to the Africans who suffer so acutely. No more studies. It is time to act and to prevent that aid from being diverted to Washington consultants.  To effectively address this epidemic, Congress needs to ensure that the money it appropriates is wisely spent. Within 90 days of enactment, this language requires USAID to submit their malaria expenditure report to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to describe how they plan to follow these new priorities. I am confident that this increased accountability will prevent funds from going primarily primarily to beltway-based consultants.  When we know how to eradicate malaria and possess the resources to do that, there is no reason that six children should have died in the time it took me to give this speech. It is a needless tragedy that we have the opportunity to arrest.  Children in Africa have accepted the reality that malaria is inevitable. Today, we have the chance to change that dismal reality into tangible hope.                          ____________________
