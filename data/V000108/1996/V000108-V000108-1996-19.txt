Speaker, one of the remarkable qualities of Indiana's First Congressional District is the harmony between its massive industries and its exquisite natural treasures. One of the northwest Indiana's jewels is the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore [IDNL] on the shores of Lake Michigan. Two outstanding individuals, who have dedicated their lives to successfully preserving the beauty of northwest Indiana, are Herb and Charlotte Reed. Herb and Charlotte are two of a select few people in the country to be named ``American Heros'' for their work to protect our national public lands.  Herb's direct involvement with the Indiana Dunes began in 1952, when he joined the Save the Dunes Council. Save the Dunes was formed to establish a dunes national park, as well as to preserve the Indiana Dunes, which were threatened by powerful political and economic interests trying to industrialize all of Indiana's Lake Michigan shoreline. As a result of the fine work of the Save the Dunes Council, the 5,800-acre Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was established in 1966. Today, the park consists of approximately 15,000 acres, 2,182 of which are located in Indiana Dunes State Park and managed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.  In 1966, Charlotte joined the fight after Congress agreed to authorize the IDNL. She served as one of the very first park rangers and later became the Save the Dunes Council's first paid staffer. Since that time, Charlotte served as the Council's executive director from 1974 to 1992, and she currently serves as its assistant executive director.  Over the years, Herb and Charlotte have been actively involved in several other environmental organizations. In the late 1950's, Herb founded the Porter County Chapter of the Izaak Walton League, which is one of the region's strongest voices for environmental action. Charlotte is cofounder of the Hoosier Environmental Council.  Charlotte is a recipient of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's [IDEM] Environmental Impact Award. She was chosen for this honor as a result of her advocacy on behalf of environmental protection issues during IDEM's formative years. Herb and Charlotte have both been recognized by several organizations for their joint efforts to preserve our natural treasures. Awards bestowed upon them include the 1990 Gold Cup Award from the Hoosier Environmental Council, the 1991 Gold Cup Award from the Hoosier Sierra Club, and two industry-sponsored awards.  As a result of the Reeds' work, a State and national park will forever protect 15,000 acres of Indiana's dunes, home to giant sand dunes, river forests, prairie lands, and bogs. The national lakeshore contains 1,400 plant species--only four national parks contain more plant diversity.  Herb and Charlotte Reed are dear friends and successful environmental activists. I cannot say enough about this exalted couple. Their efforts to create the national lakeshore in Indiana will forever remain a large part of the history of Indiana's First Congressional District. It seems only fitting that Herb and Charlotte live in a cabin enveloped by the national lakeshore. It is from this vantage point that they fought their four-decade war for the dunes, while at the same time raised their five wonderful children.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Herb and Charlotte for their commitment and valiant efforts to protect and preserve the environment for generations to come. Herb and Charlotte Reed are, indeed, living legends.                          ____________________
