President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will help crack down on illegal sales of tobacco to underaged young people by banning the shipment of cigarettes and other tobacco products through the U.S. mail. Not only does the delivery of cigarettes and other tobacco products through the mail create opportunities for tax evasion, but it also creates an easy means through which children and young people can obtain these potentially deadly products.  Tobacco remains the No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United States today, accounting for more than 400,000 deaths a year and billions of dollars in health care costs. Moreover, tobacco addiction is a ``teen-onset'' disease: Ninety percent of all smokers start before they are 21. If we are to put an end to this tragic, yet preventable, epidemic, we must accelerate our efforts not only to help more smokers to quit, but also to discourage young people from ever lighting up in the first place.  Internet sales of tobacco are growing and growing fast. Unfortunately, effective safeguards against illegal sales to young people are virtually nonexistent on the more than 400 Web sites selling tobacco, making it easier and cheaper for kids to buy cigarettes.  A 2002 American Journal of Public Health study found that 20 percent of cigarette-selling Web sites do not say anything about sales to minors being prohibited. More than half require only that the buyer say they are of legal age. Another 15 percent require only that the buyer type in their date of birth, and only 7 percent require any driver's license information.  It is no wonder that Internet ``stings'' conducted by attorneys general in at least 15 States have found that children as young as 9 years old are able to purchase cigarettes easily. One study in The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that kids as young as 11 were successful more than 90 percent of the time in purchasing cigarettes over the Internet. Moreover, since Internet cigarette vendors typically require a two-carton minimum purchase, many high school and middle school buyers of Internet tobacco also end up serving as suppliers of cigarettes to other kids.  In an effort to combat this problem, all of the major credit card companies have taken steps to ensure that their systems are not used to process payments for illegal cigarette sales. Moreover, all of the major commercial carriers--UPS, DHL and FedEx--have agreed to put a stop to the mail order sale and delivery of tobacco products. This leaves our U.S. Postal Service as the sole remaining courier for the delivery of tobacco products to minors. I believe that it is time for us to close this final delivery gap so that cigarettes and other tobacco products are not so easily accessible to our Nation's children.  The Postal Code already makes it illegal to mail alcoholic beverages and guns. The legislation I am introducing today will amend title 39 of the United States Code to add cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to the list of restricted, nonmailable matter. Any person found guilty of mailing such a product would be liable for a civil penalty of up to $5,000 or 10 times the estimated retail value of the tobacco products, including all Federal, State, and local taxes, whichever is highest, for a first violation. Civil penalties of up to $100,000 would be imposed for a second or each subsequent violation.  Mr. President, the U.S. Postal Service should not be the delivery agent for illegal cigarette traffickers. The legislation I am introducing today will close a loophole that has allowed Internet and mail order companies to circumvent the law, and I urge my colleagues to support this reform.                                 ______                                       By
