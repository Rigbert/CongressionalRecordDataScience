 President, let me echo the remarks of the majority leader. As he has indicated, the administration takes a view that if the final appropriations bills pass one House this afternoon--we could have that vote today or it could be tomorrow--but the administration, I am told by the majority leader, takes the view that it has passed one House, there would not be a government shutdown. So I think everybody should be reassured that that is not going to happen.
