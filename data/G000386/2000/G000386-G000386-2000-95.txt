 President, I say on behalf of the leader, the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 10 a.m. Following morning business the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the conference report to accompany the Transportation appropriations bill or the sex trafficking conference report. The House is expected to consider the Transportation appropriations legislation this morning. Therefore, it is hoped that a vote can occur prior to noon today. Senators will be notified as soon as votes are scheduled. The leader thanks our colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
