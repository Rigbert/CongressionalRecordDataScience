 ROBERTS. I would be delighted to yield to the distinguished Senator.  Mr. McCONNELL. Reading from the Hollings amendment, it says, ``A State''--this is referring to the power given to the States. Same power to the Federal Government. ``A State shall have the power to set reasonable limits.'' I say to my good friend, the Senator from Kansas, put another way, the Government would decide how much speech is reasonable. Is that the interpretation of my good friend?
