 There is a basic conflict between those who think the money should be spread around and those who believe this money should be used based on risk, vulnerability, and threat. I am in the latter. If the big threat is in Vermont, I am all for the money going to Vermont. I have no problem with that.  I look at the intelligence and I see the threats as they come in and I think the agencies that make the decisions should send the money based on their analysis of the intelligence and the threats.  I do wish to at least give my source, which is the Congressional Research Service, for these numbers which show 35 States as beneficiaries.  I know Senator Lautenberg should be here momentarily. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Who yields time?
