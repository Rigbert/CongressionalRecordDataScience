 Chairman, in my view, CPB is a unique entity and its unique nature may be used by supporters of this provision to justify the restrictions on list sharing. CPB is unique because it is created, controlled and funded by the government with a legal obligation to be balanced and objective.  Many non-profit organizations rely upon exchanges of lists with political organizations as a way to attract new members to their organizations to support their charitable works. A number of mainstream non-profit organizations, such as the Disabled Veterans of America, have expressed concern that this CPB provision may set a precedent for future restrictions on list sharing by other non-profit organizations. It is my understanding, however, that this list sharing restriction is not a precedent for similar restrictions on other non-profits that are not: (1) created by the federal government; (2) controlled by the federal government; (3) funded by the federal government; and (4) legally required to be balanced and objective. Thus, I do not think this provision relating to CPB is a precedent for imposing such restrictions on other non-profits. Does the Chairman agree with my assessment?
