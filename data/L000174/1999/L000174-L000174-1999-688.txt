President, I am proud to be joined by Senators Jeffords, Harkin, Kohl, and Feingold, and Representative Hinchey in the House of Representatives, in introducing the ``Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999.'' This bill seals a loophole undermining our children's nutritional health.  One of the most important lessons we can teach our children is good health. Good health includes keeping our children tobacco and drug free, and includes nutrition education for healthy living.  Every day, more than 26 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program. One-quarter of those children--approximately seven million--also participate in the National School Breakfast Program. According to a United States Department of Agriculture study, school children may consume between one-third and one-half of their daily nutrient intake at school. Knowing how important school meal programs are to the nutritional health of children, I am extremely concerned by reports of soft drinks being given to children before or during lunch.  Current law prohibits the sale of soft drinks during lunch. This prohibition has been around for a long time. However, some schools are now getting around this prohibition by giving soda to children for free. This is a loophole--big enough to drive a soda truck through--that hurts our children. The bill which we are introducing today would close this loophole so that soft drinks cannot be distributed--for free or for sale--during mealtime at schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. Also, the bill would prohibit giving away sodas before lunch.  As a parent, I would be outraged to discover that my efforts at teaching my child good nutrition were being undermined by free sugar and caffeine laden soft drinks at school.  Studies based on statistics from the USDA Continuing Surveys of Food Intakes by Individuals have shown that heavy soft drink consumption correlates with a low intake of magnesium, calcium, ascorbic acid, riboflavin and vitamin A. The loss of calcium is particularly alarming for teenage women, as calcium is crucial for building up bone mass to reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life, and women build 92 percent of their bone mass by age 18.  Many sodas also contain caffeine, which is not only an addictive stimulant, but which also increases the excretion of calcium.  In its Food Guide Pyramid for Young Children, which recommends good dietary habits for children, the United States Department of Agriculture continues to recommend serving children fruits, vegetables, grains, meat and dairy, while limiting children's intake of sweets - including soft drinks.  Statistics regarding children's intake of soft drinks are alarming. For instance, teenage boys consume an average of 2\1/2\ soft drinks a day--which equals approximately 15 teaspoons of sugar--every day.  While children's consumption of soft drinks has been on the rise, their consumption of milk has been on the decline. Statistics from the USDA demonstrate that whereas 20 years ago teens drank twice as much milk as soda, today they drink twice as much soda as milk. Unlike milk, soft drinks have minimal nutritional value and they contribute nothing to the health of kids. One need only compare the ingredient and nutrition labels on a Coke can versus a milk carton to see what a child loses when milk is replaced by a soft drink.  The consequence of replacing milk with soda is clear: the declining nutritional health of our children. In her book Jane Brody's Nutritional Book, Jane Brody articulates this point in saying:       Probably the most insidious undermining of good nutrition      in the early years comes     from the soft drink industry. Catering to children's innate      preferences for a sweet taste, the industry has succeeded in      drawing millions of youngsters away from milk and natural      fruit juices and hooking them on pop and other artificially      flavored drinks that offer nothing of nutritional      significance besides calories.  The Vermont State Board of Education's School Nutrition Policy Statement actually touches on this very issue. Among its recommendations to school districts for dietary guidelines and nutrition, the Board of Education advises:       Certain foods which contribute little other than calories      should not be sold on school campuses. These foods include      carbonated beverages, nonfruit soft drinks, candies in which      the major ingredient is sugar, frozen nonfruit ice bars, and      chewing gum with sugar.  It was only a few years ago that, as Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, that I fought the soft drink behemoths--Coca-Cola and Pepsi--over vending machines in schools. I felt that schools should be encouraged to close down vending machines before and during lunch. I was unprepared for the wealth of opposition which ensued.  However, despite the well-financed opposition by soda companies, the Nutrition and Health for Children Act was met with bipartisan support in Congress. Former Senator Bob Dole noted that ``too often a student gives up his half dollar and his appetite en route to the cafeteria'' and criticized the ``so-called plate waste, where young students and other students decide it is better to have a candy bar and a soft drink rather than eat some meal that is subsidized by the Federal Government.''  Just as the Better Nutrition and Health for Children Act passed with bipartisan support in 1994, I am sure that the Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999 will pass with bipartisan support this year.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 998       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Better Nutrition for School      Children Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to close the loophole that allows competitive foods of      minimum nutritional value that cannot be sold during meals in      schools participating in the school breakfast and lunch      programs to instead be donated or served without charge to      students during or before breakfast or lunch;       (2) to protect 1 of the major purposes of the Child      Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.) and the      National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), which is      to promote better nutrition among school children      participating in the school breakfast and lunch programs; and       (3) to promote better nutritional habits among school      children and improve the health of school children      participating in the school breakfast and lunch programs.     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON DONATION OR SERVICE WITHOUT CHARGE OF                    COMPETITIVE FOODS OF MINIMAL NUTRITIONAL VALUE.       Section 10 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C.      1779) is amended--       (1) by striking ``(b) The'' and inserting the following:       ``(b) Donation or Service Without Charge of Competitive      Foods of Minimal Nutritional Value.--       ``(1) Sales.--The''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(2) Donations or service without charge.--The regulations      shall prohibit the donation or service without charge of      competitive foods not approved by the Secretary under      paragraph (1) in a school participating in a meal service      program authorized under this Act or the National School      Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) before the end of the last      lunch period of the school.''.
