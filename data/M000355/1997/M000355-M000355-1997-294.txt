 President, I rise today to commend an extraordinary woman for her lifelong dedication to service and charity. Ninety-two-year-old Mildred Sosh volunteers at the Wayside Christian Mission in Louisville one morning every week where she showers needy infants with loving care.  Mrs. Sosh never had children of her own, so she loves the children at Wayside with all her heart. Mrs. Sosh also taught first grade for 44 years. This remarkable woman has volunteered at Wayside Christian Mission for 28 years where she first worked with the Mission's auxiliary mending clothes and making homemade gravy. She later volunteered in the day care where she remains today. Mrs. Sosh also volunteers at Salem United Church of Christ where she is a member. Mrs. Sosh was deservedly honored this spring at the J.C. Penney Golden Rule Awards Banquet for her dedication to helping the homeless.  Despite her dependence on a cane to walk, Mrs. Sosh arrives at Wayside every Tuesday morning to rock the babies. She recruited a friend about 4 years ago to volunteer also so that she would always have a ride to the mission. Although not everyone can volunteer as extensively as Mildred Sosh, we can all take inspiration from her selfless sacrifice for the sake of others.  Mr. President, I ask that you join me in honoring Mildred Sosh.                          ____________________
