 In Senate Republican Leader McConnell's own words, ``The compromise that you are rejecting today was designed to pass.''  In fact, the bill that you passed you knew was designed to fail. Because you knew it was going to fail, your Republican leadership in the Senate objected to its being considered on the floor of the United States Senate, just as you have refused to consider the Senate's compromise on this floor.  It did so in the Senate. That bill that was designed to pass, according to Senator McConnell, did so in the Senate with overwhelming support from 83 percent of Republicans and from every Democrat, including the entire Senate Republican leadership and the entire Democratic leadership.  Democrats, Mr. Speaker, are fighting to prevent a painful tax increase for the middle class. The way to do that is to pass the Senate compromise while we continue to work on a yearlong extension. That's what Senator Reid said he'll do, Mr. Speaker, and that's what we're prepared to do, Mr. Speaker. But we don't want to put at risk January 1 coming and that tax cut disappearing. If they fail to pass the compromise, House Republicans will have to answer to the American people whose taxes will go up.
