 President, recently, we have seen the culmination of one of the most successful undercover operations in history by theUnited States Customs Service. This effort, known as ``Operation Casablanca,'' has infiltrated and dismantled a group of international bankers, mostly in Mexico, who have been laundering drug money. The threat of drug trafficking is serious enough. But to have their financial advisors leading their effort to facilitate the smuggling of illicit narcotics is much worse. Complicit bankers devising schemes can make it much easier to move and hide the ill-gotten gains of drug cartels.  As this latest law enforcement operation illustrates, we must be sure that we are taking the necessary steps to protect the citizens of our nation. We must prevent drug traffickers and organized crime groups from obtaining the profits of their illegal activities. Much has been done and said about the movement of illegal drugs into the United States. But the opposite side of the business does not always get the publicity, and is just as important. We need to go after the profits from drug sales and other illegal enterprises.  Last week, Representative Leach, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services introduced legislation to amend title 31, United States Code. The bill H.R. 4005, ``the Money Laundering Deterrence Act of 1998,'' would improve methods for preventing financial crimes. And as Operation Casablanca shows this legislation, is timely and needed. We need to tighten up our financial control capabilities to prevent criminal enterprises from abusing our financial and banking systems. The bill is supported by the American Banking Association (ABA), the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve. Today, Chairman Leach's bill has already been marked up in the House.  I call for my colleagues to help support this companion legislation. I hope this would be a continuation of efforts by Congress to go after the growing threat of money laundering not only to our nation, but worldwide.                                 ______                                       By
