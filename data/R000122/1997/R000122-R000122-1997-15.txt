Let me give an example within the text of the agreement. Part of the negotiating objectives is to develop internationally agreed rules, including settlement procedures, which are consistent with the commercial policies of the United States. So when it comes to commercial law, dispute resolution, we want our American laws down there because they are balanced, fair, they work, are effective, and are comfortable to the investors going to these countries.  I daresay, if we tried to substitute our ideas consistent with the environmental policy of the United States, we would draw the unalloyed opposition of the proponents of the fast-track procedure. In our view, I believe environmental quality is one important factor in terms of economic competition between our country and other countries. So, in effect, I think you are right. I think that the thrust of this agreementis that it is unbalanced. You and I--I will speak for myself--we believe that we have to have sensible rules about investment.  We have certain guarantees that our investors are protected. We have to have protection for intellectual property. We have to have protections for dispute settlement. We certainly don't want to have a situation where American companies go into a foreign land, make investments, and then can't repatriate their profits or, in fact, go to court and solve commercial disputes. That is fine. But we have to take the next step. We also have to negotiate with those countries so that their environmental policies are not inconsistent with ours and at least move toward an international standard.
