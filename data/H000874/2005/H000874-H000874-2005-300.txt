I would simply add again that as the gentleman indicated, trying to go regular order, obviously, both sides understand that these are things we need to move with great dispatch so we can help the people that need help and get it to them when they need the help. We are all for that.  On the supplemental, the President has indicated there is going to be a need for another supplemental. Do you know when we might consider such a supplemental; how much that supplemental might be for? And if we start considering it early, while the $52 billion is still available to be expended to assist those, it will give us a little bit of time to go through the process that the gentleman indicates is the best process.  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I do not know, other than in the press, and in many of these issues the press has gotten it wrong, that there has been any supplemental suggested by the President of the United States. He has not contacted my office. As far as I know, he has not contacted the Speaker's office, nor the chairman of the appropriations office about another supplemental. Quite the contrary. They are trying to avoid having another supplemental and trying to spend the money properly and get it to the people that need it. So I am not aware of any supplemental certainly in the short term.
