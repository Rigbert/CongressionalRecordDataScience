As vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he brings extraordinary knowledge to this debate. We are very grateful for his contributions to the Collins-Lieberman bill.  As both Senator Lieberman and I mentioned, Senator Rockefeller responded to our request for input and advice. We incorporated into our legislation several of the suggestions he provided. We are very grateful to have his support. It means a great deal as we proceed with this debate.
