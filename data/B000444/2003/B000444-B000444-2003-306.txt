  Mr. McCAIN. They are the words of Mr. Gunn, the new President, not mine--the new President of Amtrak, Mr. Gunn, about their failures. I am sorry the Senator from Delaware wasn't here:       Amtrak pretended it was on a glidepath to self-sufficiency      and maintained that fiction far too long. It took action      such as borrowing money through a variety of means, the      primary example being the mortgaging of Penn Station last      year, and now debt service is a huge cost. That's not the      way to run a railroad and not the way I will run the      railroad. Too many happy words have hidden very dismal      financial results.  I come to this floor year after year, talking about these problems and, in all due respect to my dear friend from Delaware, he never recognized these problems. These problems were never recognized by the proponents of Amtrak. These were serious problems.
