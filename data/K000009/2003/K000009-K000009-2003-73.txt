If you look at the rest of the world, a country like Canada negotiates price. Even parts of our government, the Department of Veterans Affairs gets a much better price than other seniors pay simply because they do group buying and do negotiated pricing with these companies. With the kinds of billions and billions of dollars of profit they have, there is a little cushion there for our senior citizens.  I just want to thank the gentleman very much for standing up for the Democratic bill that should have been allowed to be offered here on this floor and was not. It is a sad day for our seniors.              2002 Pharmaceutical Contributions, By Party       Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America:      $3,180,552; Democrats 5%; Republicans 95%.
