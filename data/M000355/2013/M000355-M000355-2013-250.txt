 President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota. He is entirely correct. This budget is extreme, and it is unbalanced. What would happen if it passed? We would have a tax hike of up to $1.5 trillion. That would be the largest in U.S. history. It would cost the average middle-class family literally thousands.  Democrats here in Washington, as Senator Thune and Senator Sessions pointed out, already just got billions of dollars in new taxes at the end of the year--about $600 billion because the tax law expired, the fiscal cliff; then they got $1 trillion more out of ObamaCare. So this would be on top of all of that--$1.5 trillion on top of the $1.6 trillion that is already going into effect. And there is a nearly two-thirds increase in big government spending.  It would siphon $\1/2\ trillion out of our economy and into the hands of Washington bureaucrats and the people in Congress to spend; 42 percent more debt, with each American owing up to $73,000; and an average of 850,000 fewer jobs every year. That is about 11,500 jobs in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Medicare would be allowed to go bankrupt in a few years, and this budget would not balance--not this year, not tomorrow, not ever.  A lot of Democrats here in Washington are saying they simply don't care about balancing the budget anymore. It certainly shows with this one.
