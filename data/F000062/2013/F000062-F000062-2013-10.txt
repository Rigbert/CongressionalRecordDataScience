 President, I just visited the 9/11 memorial this past Saturday and was extraordinarily moved by that memorial. It is an amazing place. It really brings to one's heart the gravity of what that situation was. We then went down to the museum and I saw exactly where the plane went through the steel superstructure and the staircase where hundreds of our people fled with smoke following them down those stairs. We must prevent another 9/11.  I note there is a letter from certain members of the September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows that has been sent to us in favor of this bill and the detainee transfer provisions in the bill. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from the September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Peaceful Tomorrows,                                  New York, NY, November 18, 2013.       Dear Senator: We are writing to ask you to support the      Guantanamo detainee transfer provisions included in the      National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year      2014, as reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee      (SASC). We are all family members of those killed in the     9/11/2001 terrorist attacks. Since that tragic event, we have      worked together as members of September 11th Families for      Peaceful Tomorrows [http://www.peacefultomorrows.orgl for      long-lasting solutions to the violence that claimed our loved      ones' lives.       In recent years, Guantanamo prison and the on-going      Military Commission hearings for the 9/11 suspects at      Guantanamo have been a particular focus of our concern and      action. We believe closing Guantanamo is good human rights      policy and good national security policy. The Guantanamo      provisions in the Senate NDAA provide the necessary      flexibility to execute that policy responsibly. We urge your      support of the Guantanamo provisions in the Senate NDAA and      urge you to vote ``no'' on any amendments that would further      restrict transfers.       When Peaceful Tomorrows first organized, we committed to      working together to promote U.S. foreign policy that places a      priority on internationally-recognized principles of human      rights and to calling attention to threats to human rights      that might result from U.S. responses to 9/11. Guantanamo has      become a stain on our national reputation. Today, it is      simply no longer sustainable--ethically, strategically, or      financially.       We are keenly aware of the continuing injustice of holding      the 164 prisoners now at Guantanamo prison without trial for      these many years. These prisoners have been denied the      justice which Americans take pride in as a source of national      strength. At the same time, our 9/11 family members continue      to be denied justice by the seemingly imperceptible progress      of trying those prisoners under the current military      commissions. We advocate the immediate release of those who      have been cleared for release, and the transfer of the      remaining prisoners to be tried in US federal courts, which      have successfully tried and convicted scores of terrorists in      the past decade.       More than half of the Guantanamo detainees have long been      cleared for transfer by our own national security and      intelligence agencies. Current law has needlessly complicated      moving these cleared detainees. This law must be revised. The      SASC foreign transfer provisions will do that while ensuring      that any risks are far outweighed by the dangers of      continuing the status quo. Major General Paul Eaton (Ret.)      has cautioned that unless we institute change, Guantanamo      will serve as ``a recruiting tool of the first order'' for      those who wish us harm, while damaging cooperation with our      allies on counterterrorism that will result in lost      intelligence opportunities. Worse yet is the effect it has      had on Americans, corrupting their faith in American values      that has taken centuries to build.       To continue to spend nearly $2.7 million per detainee, per      year makes no sense at a time when Congress is wrestling with      deep budget cuts. We can institute an intelligent, factor-     based system that will allow the Secretary of Defense to      explain to Congress whether a transfer is in America's      national security interests, and the steps that will be taken      to mitigate any risk of a detainee engaging in terrorist      activities after release.       In his May speech at the National Defense University,      President Obama recommitted his administration to closing      Guantanamo. Since that time, the administration has appointed      envoys at the Departments of Defense and State to oversee the      closure of Guantanamo. This is absolutely the right thing to      do now, but Congress must also do its part.       The Guantanamo provisions in the Senate NDAA clarify and      modify the President's authority to transfer detainees to      foreign countries and provide important additional      flexibility to close Guantanamo responsibly. They replace a      cumbersome certification and waiver regime with sensible,      factor-based standards designed to minimize risks. They lift      the ban on transfers to the United States for criminal      prosecution, which is critical now that we see how federal      criminal courts offer a more experienced and less costly way      to try terrorism suspects than the flawed, costly,      inefficient, and perhaps unconstitutional, military      commissions system at Guantanamo Bay. The experiment of the      military commissions of the 21st century has proven      inadequate to its promises of justice, transparency, fairness      and speed.       It is more than twelve years after the heinous attacks in      which our loved ones died. During that time some of our      fellow 9/11 family members have died waiting to see justice      done. Enough is enough! It is time for the U.S. to      demonstrate its commitment to the rule of law by moving      detainees cleared for release out of Guantanamo, by making      federal trials for those who are accused of terrorist crimes      possible, and by taking steps to close the Guantanamo      facilities that have earned the U.S. the enmity of the world.      We exhort you to pass the NDAA without transfer restrictions      on Guantanamo prisoners, and help to bring this horrible      chapter to a close in our lifetimes.       Our relatives died on 9/11; they would never have wanted      the U.S. to compromise its principles in their names, nor do      we.           Sincerely,                                     The Members of September 11th                                  Families for Peaceful Tomorrows.
