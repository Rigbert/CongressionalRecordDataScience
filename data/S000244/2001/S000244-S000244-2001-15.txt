Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as we have learned in recent months, the only effective way to fight terrorism is to fight it on a global scale. In order to accomplish this, it is important that we build an international framework for combating terrorism in all its forms. The first and most important piece of this framework is international cooperation. Passage of the bill before us today will allow the United States to reinforce the international community's intolerance for and condemnation of terrorist acts and their financing.  Mr. Speaker, on December 5, 2001, the Senate gave its advice and consent to ratify the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism. H.R. 3275 makes appropriate changes to Title 18 of the United States Code in order to implement these treaties so that they can be ratified by the President.  The Terrorist Bombings Convention addresses the most utilized form of terrorism, the bombings of public places, State or government facilities, public transportation systems or infrastructure facilities, with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury. H.R. 3275 enacts a new statute which would criminalize these acts if they have an international nexus, such as the bombing of a foreign embassy located in the United States. Nations who are a party to this treaty agree to extradite orprosecute persons accused of such offenses, and also agree to provide assistance in connection with the investigation of such crimes.  I am sure everyone is aware that there are already State and Federal laws that criminalize terrorist bombings. This legislation will supplement those laws and close any loopholes that an accused terrorist may try to exploit in a court of law. Furthermore, the legislation covers biological, chemical, and radiological weapons, as well as conventional explosives.  The Terrorist Financing Convention addresses a common element of every terrorist act, financing and other support. This treaty recognizes that the financial backers of terrorism are just as responsible as those who commit the terrorist acts themselves. H.R. 3275 makes it a crime to unlawfully and willingly provide or collect funds with the intention or knowledge that such funds are to be used to carry out any act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian. As with the Terrorist Bombing Convention, there must be some international nexus with the terrorist financing, such as someone operating outside of the United States. Likewise, nations who are a party to this treaty also agree to extradite or prosecute and assist in criminal investigations.  The Terrorist Bombing and Terrorist Financing Conventions follow the general model of prior terrorism conventions negotiated by the United States. These conventions will significantly strengthen the network of anti-terrorism treaties built over the last 30 years by requiring nations to criminalize terrorist conduct identified in the treaties and to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of the offenses. Given the global way that terrorists operate, it is imperative that we make sure that as many countries as possible have comparable laws against terrorism for an effective framework of investigation, extradition, and prosecution.                              {time}  1015  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
