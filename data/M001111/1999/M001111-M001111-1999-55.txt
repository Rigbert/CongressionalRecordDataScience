 I have been a preschool teacher. I have been a school board member. I have served in my State legislature, been on the education committee there, and I now serve on the Education Committee in the Senate. I have seen all sides of education. Probably most important, I have been a parent of two students in our public education system and participated in everything from PTA to all the activities that go along with being a parent.
