Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for yielding.  General aviation is of vital importance to our Nation's economy. In my home State of Alaska, general aviation aircraft are the only pipeline bringing supplies to those living in remote areas, and we are experiencing our small communities. We are experiencing a shortage of pilots to fly those, and a failure of the flight school industry will cause severe economic hardship to not only those in Alaska, but to those living in remote areas of the U.S. Therefore, it is my intention to present to this body by next week a bill, if possible, that will provide real economic relief to those in need.
