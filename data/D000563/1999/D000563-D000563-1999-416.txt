I don't think that is wild-eyed thinking.  The Republican plan makes no contingency plan that suggests we might have a downturn in the economy. We should be reducing the debt and pledging our surplus, whatever it may be, to reducing that debt and making certain Social Security and Medicare are there for years to come.  I yield the remainder of my time.
