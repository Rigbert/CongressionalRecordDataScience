Speaker, on September 11, 2003 communities all across America held observances to remember those who fell in the events two years before. In my own hometown of Toledo, part of our observance included a reading of the names of those who died on that fateful day, and inspirational readings and poems. I would like to quote one of these poems for the record. It is a special tribute to firefighters, written by Toledoan Ernest Fodor and entitled ``Just Because You Call.''     There is a well-known fact in heaven     All the firefighters tell     When they put out their last fire on earth     They did their job so well     Some how they had the strength     To do what they could do     Sometimes they even gave their life     For the likes of me and you     But now that they're in heaven     If they hear a fire call     They would try so hard to come back     And bravely save us all     There are so many people     With lives that are much brighter     Just because a call was answered     By a firefighter  Thank you Ernest Fodor for remembering, and for your inspired words.                          ____________________
