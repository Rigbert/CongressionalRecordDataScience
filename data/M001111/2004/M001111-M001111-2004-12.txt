 President, I come to the floor today to talk about this scandal to which the Senator from Massachusetts alluded. It is mentioned in the New York Times today, ``Banks and the College Loan Loophole.''  I talk to families all over the State of Washington, and they are struggling to pay for college for their kids. They all agree college education is far too expensive for many families. You would think the Federal Government would be doing everything possible today to make college more accessible for all of our families. Sadly, that is not the case.  Last week in the Senate we had a chance to help students to get to and get through college. Unfortunately, the majority on the Appropriations Committee blocked my commonsense, student-friendly proposal. Instead of standing up for students, unfortunately the committee stood up for banks and other special interests that have been gaming the system for years, at taxpayer expense.  I am on the Senate floor today to say that students should come before special interests. Student loan programs were started to help our students. They were not started to line the pockets of lenders. It is time to end the taxpayer ripoff that is occurring today and do more to help our students afford college.  Back in the 1980s, interest rates were high. Many people were concerned that our lenders would stop making student loans, so Congress created a temporary--and I emphasize ``temporary''--measure to keep college loans affordable for our students.  At the time, it worked. Lenders kept making loans, and students were able to afford college loans. This was supposed to be, as I said, a temporary measure. In fact, it was supposed to be phased out in 1993, when interest rates started coming back down. Interest rates came down; this subsidy lived on. For the past 11 years, taxpayers have paid these lenders far more than they should have. Taxpayers are actually subsidizing profitable companies to make loans that are far above today's interest rates. Clearly, taxpayers are paying a huge bill while special interests are taking the money to the bank.  Who is paying the price? Our college students. This year we are throwing away $1 billion that we could be using to help more students go to college. So in the Appropriations Committee last week, I offered an amendment to finally stop this taxpayer ripoff. My amendment would have used the savings from this ripoff to help 700,000 students get another $3,000 for college. It would have helped the parents of 25,000 low-income students get child care on campus. It would have helped another 200,000 students get $800 in grants. It would have helped 180,000 low-income and first-generation students prepare for college through TRIO and GEAR UP. And it would have helped thousands of migrant students attend college.  When I offered my amendment, everybody on the committee seemed to agree that this subsidy should end. But when it came time to vote, every Republican member voted against my amendment. They voted against taxpayers, they voted against students, and they voted against our families. They said they wanted to deal with it later. I am here today to say that taxpayers are getting ripped off every day we delay. If we wait 6 months, as was suggested, taxpayers will lose billions of dollars, and students will not get the help they need. The time to do this is now.  I am not willing to waste another dollar that could be in the pockets of our students today, and that is why the Senate needs to act now. The Government is paying 30 times more than it should for these special interest subsidies--30 times more. That is a ripoff.  This is as if you walk into a college book store and a textbook on the shelf costs $100. If that textbook had the same outrageous markup as these loans, that student would be paying $3,000 for the same textbook. Taxpayers are paying $3,000 for something that only costs $100 because of this runaway subsidy, and that is outrageous. There is no reason for taxpayers to be paying a markup of 30 times the real cost.  We were all outraged when Halliburton charged taxpayers $45 for a case of soda that sells for $7 at the supermarket. Halliburton marked those prices up 6 times. Today, lenders are marking up student loans at a price 30 times higher than they should. No wonder the Washington Post called this a scandal.  I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post editorial on this printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 10, 2004]                          Student Loan Scandal       There are bureaucratic errors, there is congressional      negligence--and then there are bureaucratic errors and      congressional negligence on a scale so vast that it is hard      to believe they can be accidental. The hundreds of millions      of dollars in unnecessary government payments to the student      loan industry in the past 18 months amount to such a scandal.      The loans in question, established in 1980, are guaranteed by      the government at 9.5 percent. Yet most students are paying      interest rates of 3.5 percent or less. The difference--all      taxpayers' money--is pure profit for the companies that have      taken advantage of a loophole in the law.       According to a recent report by the Institute for College      Access and Success, a nonprofit education think tank,      Congress had actually intended to end in 1993 the 9.5 percent      loan guarantee, one of many programs that provide incentives      for institutions to lend to students. In May 2003, one      company, Nelnet Inc., wrote to the Education Department to      confirm its intention to expand its holdings of old loans      with the 9.5 percent interest rate. Nelnet received no answer      from the department for a year, during which time the      department continued paying the company. In June of this      year, the department replied inconclusively--at which point      the company's stock price climbed 20 percent. Although Nelnet      is the largest holder of loans guaranteed at 9.5 percent--and      its holdings of such loans have increased by 818 percent      since January 2003--it is only one of many such lenders.      According to a preliminary Government Accountability Office      report, commissioned by Reps. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and      Dale E. Kildee (D-Mich.), 37 lenders receive payments for      loans with guaranteed interest rates of 9.5 percent, at a      government cost of $1 billion annually, and the volume of      such loans is rising.       Why wasn't the loophole shut long ago? Education Department      officials argue strenuously that only a two-year regulatory      process could have done so, and they didn't initiate one,      they say, because they thought Congress would deal with it.      Congressional Republicans say they expected to deal with the      problem in a comprehensive higher education bill, but that      has failed to pass (and in any case the proposed language      would not have ended all the payments). Yet, other solutions      could have been found: In the wake of revelations about the      scale of the payments, the House yesterday passed an      amendment to an appropriations bill, offered by Mr. Van      Hollen and Mr. Kildee, that would close the loophole      completely, albeit temporarily. (Of course, there is no      guarantee it will become law.) And one former Education      Department general counsel has written to the secretary of      education, Roderick R. Paige, arguing that the loophole could      have been closed immediately if officials had wished to do      so.       There could be other explanations for their reluctance. One      is that the president of Nelnet, Don R. Bouc--who has called      for the loophole to be shut and the money to be better used--     is well-connected enough to have been appointed to Mr.      Paige's advisory committee on student financial assistance.      Here is another: According to a report in the Chronicle of      Higher Education, Nelnet is the second-largest contributor to      congressional campaigns in the student loan history, beaten      only by industry giant Sallie Mae. Over the past 18 months,      the student loan industry has contributed about $750,000 to      the 49 members of the House Committee on Education and the      Workforce, of which $136,000 has gone to the committee      chairman, Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), and $175,000 to Rep.      Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon (R-Calif.), chairman of the      subcommittee on higher education. Mr. Boehner's spokesman      vehemently denies any connection between the contributions      and the issue and maintains that the committee's bill would      have fixed the problem, which was mentioned in the      president's latest budget. Still, it is difficult to      understand, given the sums involved, why neither Mr. Paige      nor Congress made this a higher priority.       For nearly a decade we have argued that Congress should      reduce subsidies for banks that lend to students, and instead      expand the direct-loan program, which provides about a      quarter of student aid--or else reform the system to make it      harder to manipulate. This scandal provides an excellent      reason to look again at these questions.
