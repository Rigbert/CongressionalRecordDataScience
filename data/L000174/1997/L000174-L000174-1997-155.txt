 I am also concerned about whether creation of the working group tasked with developing a CALEA implementation plan will delay, rather than facilitate, implementation of this law and compliance by telecommunications carriers with the four law enforcement requirements enumerated in this important law. Indeed, the report places no time constraints on creation of this working group or on when the Bureau-working group implementation plan must be submitted to the specified committees.  Further delay in implementation of CALEA poses risks for the effectiveness of our law enforcement agencies. As the committee acknowledges, they are already encountering problems in executing court-authorized wiretaps. The industry, with the input of law enforcement, has drafted a specifications standard for CALEA. I am concerned that objections from the Bureau over elements in that proposed standard are delaying its adoption. I would like to see the Bureau accept that standard and get on with CALEA implementation.  I am also concerned that the working group proposed by the committee will work behind closed doors, without the accountability that CALEA intended. We should make sure that any meetings of the working group will be open to privacy advocates and other interested parties.  I fully appreciate that questions have been raised about how the implementation of CALEA is proceeding. That is why, over a year ago, Senator Specter and I asked the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group, a diverse coalition of industry, privacy and government reform organizations, for its views on implementation of CALEA, and other matters. We circulated to our colleagues on June 20, 1997, a copy of this group's ``Interim Report: Communications Privacy in the Digital Age.'' The report recommends that hearings be held to examine implementation of CALEA, how the Bureau intends to spend CALEA funds, and the viability of CALEA's compliance dates. This recommendation is a good one.  We should air these significant questions at an open hearing before the authorizing Committees. I would rather see the authorizing Committees work in that fashion with the Appropriations Committees to make funds immediately available and insure thosefunds are spent to establish a minimum standard that serves law enforcement's pressing needs, without some of the enhancements being proposed by the FBI that industry claims are delaying the process of implementation. The committees should insist on some priorities in terms of geographic need and capability. I think we could resolve this with a little oversight, and return to the spirit of reasonableness that characterize the drafting of CALEA.                         technical corrections
