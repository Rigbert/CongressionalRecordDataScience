My friend from Alaska and the chairman of the authorizing committee made the point that this is not an appropriations issue. I disagree with that. This is an appropriations issue. In fact, the first language I saw, which was about 7:30 tonight, would have taken this $15 billion from this supplemental emergency that we passed today to help recovery in New York and in Pennsylvania and in Virginia. I did not like that because we struggled to get that bill in the condition that we could all accept and vote for, which we all did. So I suggested some different language, and I believe that this new resolution or this new bill includes the language that I suggested, which was that any money coming from this bill would be subject to a subsequent appropriations bill. Am I correct?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).
