 President, adoption is the right thing, at least as opposed to foster care. As I have been working on adoption issues for a long period of time, there is one thing I hear from kids who have been floating from one foster home to another, who have been in the system for a long period of time. What they want is a mom and a dad. What they really are saying is they want some permanency.  One of the greatest sins of governmental policy is in the adoption and foster care area, where people grow all the way through their teenage years and get to be 18 and are adults and never have a mom and a dad.  Every child has a right to grow up in a safe and loving home. I hope my work on the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which succeeded in shortening the time lines for children in foster care, is a major effort towards this goal that we all seek.  Included in the Adoption and Safe Family Act was a provision I authored to break down barriers when a family living in one jurisdiction wants to adopt a child in another jurisdiction.  I compliment Senator Landrieu. She has been steadfast in her advocacy for adoption. Senator Craig has joined her to make adoption tax incentives a very strong bipartisan objective. I have been pleased to join these two distinguished Senators in the past on efforts they have made in this direction. I don't know what the future holds exactly, but I promised the Senator from Louisiana I would work with her and Senator Craig on their amendment and see what, if anything, we can do. We will have the weekend and Monday to work on that. Hopefully, we can accommodate in some way.
