 President, I indicate to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania that I strongly support his amendment. My hope is we will be able to accept it without a vote. I have spoken with the ranking member, and I believe he is vetting it and hopefully we will be able to do that shortly.  I thank the Senator very much. I yield the floor.
