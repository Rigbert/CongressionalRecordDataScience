 President, this legislation that Senator Baucus and I are introducing addresses an important issue--preserving the integrity of the Tax Code. Recent public offerings, effected and announced, by private equity and hedge fund management firms have raised serious tax concerns that if left unaddressed have the potential to fundamentally reduce the corporate tax base over the long run, leading other individuals and business taxpayers with a greater share of the Nation's tax burden.  Congress enacted the publicly traded partnership rules in 1987 out of concern with erosion of the corporate tax base. Given the ease with which taxpayers can choose the type of entity for their business, an appropriate ``bright line'' to define entities that should be subject to a corporate level tax was considered to be those entities that are publicly traded. A hallmark of corporate status is access to public markets. Another concern was that the ability to be publicly traded without paying an entity level tax would create an unwarranted competitive advantage over publicly traded corporations.
