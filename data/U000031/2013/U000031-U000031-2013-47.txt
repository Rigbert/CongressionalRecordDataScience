Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, we would have liked to have had some amendments when the Affordable Care Act passed. The rule denied us any amendments.  Why are we here this afternoon?  Most observers of the legislative process would say that the President's health care act would never have passed back in 2010 without the assurance that the President gave, even many times this year, that you could keep your health care if you liked it. If you liked it, you didn't have to do anything, period. I don't think it would have passed in this Chamber or in this Senate without that promise that the President gave.  Then, millions of Americans in the last couple of months have gotten mail. In that mail, there are the cancelation notices. They are seeing their rates go up 200 percent, 300 percent, even 400 percent. Deductibles are going up in the thousands of dollars. People were coming to us all last week when we were home for our veterans events and parades and all the things that we did. They were bringing those letters to us and saying, Hey, what is going on? I thought I could keep this?  Until yesterday afternoon, when it looked like we were going to get as many as 300 votes, including perhaps Mr. Doyle's and others, when it looked like we were going to get 300 votes for a bill that we introduced only a week and a half ago, all of a sudden the President felt that he needed to act. It wasn't until this bill that he came to the mic and said, You know what? I made a mistake. I am sorry. Maybe this thing will fix it.                              {time}  1230  But until then, he was going to sit on his hands and just watch us, watch millions of Americans literally watch their health care, watch maybe their economic lives, just go over the cliff. He was prepared to do that, until we showed that we had some bipartisan zip around here to try and, in fact, enforce, make whole his promise that he has said over and over and over again.  That is what this bill does. Read it. It is not too long, a couple of sentences long.  I commend our leadership for bringing this bill to the floor as fast as they can. Man, 5 or 6 legislative days from when it was introduced, that is pretty good.  More importantly, it got a wake-up call to someone down the street on Pennsylvania Avenue, saying, hey, something is wrong. Let's restore what we might have said. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
