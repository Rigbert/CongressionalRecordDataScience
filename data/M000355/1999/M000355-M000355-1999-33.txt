 President, I shall take just a moment before the Senator from Colorado leaves the floor to thank him. This is his third year in the Senate. As he knows and as has been discussed, we seem to have this debate every year. He has participated every single year in the debate in an extraordinarily insightful way. His speech made a whole lot of sense. I listened to every word.  I thank him for the important contribution he has made to this debate, not only this year but in the other years since he has been in the Senate. I thank the Senator from Colorado.
