 President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, when the Senate resumes consideration of the Lynch nomination on Thursday, April 23, there be 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to the vote on the motion to invoke cloture; that if cloture is invoked, there be up to 2 hours of postcloture debate equally divided between the two leaders; and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the nomination.
