Speaker, it is with great sadness and respect that I wish to commend United States Army Specialist Nick Idalski for the service and sacrifice he paid to this country. Specialist Idalski was tragically killed in the field of battle, while bravely conducting combat operations in Ramadi, Iraq, on June 21, 2005, just over a week shy of his 24th birthday. Specialist Idalski served our country with great honor, valor, and courage.  Specialist Idalski was assigned to the Army's 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, and 2nd Infantry Division in Fort Carson, Colorado. His sacrifice will be remembered at funeral services on Wednesday, June 29, 2005, by a community that has been devastated by the loss of one of its own.  A native of Crown Point, Indiana, Specialist Idalski graduated from Crown Point High School in 2001. After graduation he went on to work for a local construction company and then to train as an emergency medical technician, where he finished at the top of his class. Instead of taking a more conventional route, Specialist Idalski bravely decided to enlist in the army to make a difference and to make his family proud.  Many of his friends and his family recall him as a free spirited teenager, so it came as a surprise when Specialist Idalski decided to join the Army. However, as his time in the army progressed and he finished basic training in 2003 at Fort Benning, Georgia, he made his friends and family proud. After spending time in Korea, he was sent to Iraq in August of 2004, where he courageously served his country. Specialist Idalski had chosen to make a career out of his service in the Army.  He loved his country and the members of his unit; however, Specialist Idalski treasured his family above all else. He is survived by his Mother, Kim Greenberg; Step-Father, Rick Greenberg, a retired Marine; Step-Brother, Army Sergeant Kevin Greenberg; and girlfriend, Lisa Wheeler. His community mourns with his family, and he is missed tremendously. The city of Crown Point, Indiana will honor Specialist Idalski with a moment of silence at the beginning of their Fourth of July parade.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Specialist Nick Idalski. Specialist Idalski sacrificed his life during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and his passing comes as setback to a community already shaken by the realities of war. Specialist Idalski will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country; thus, let us never forget the brave sacrifice he made in order to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1377-E1378]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                TRIBUTE TO ARMY SPECIALIST NICK IDALSKI                                 ______                                                         HON.
