Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the illustrious career of Mr. Roy Johnson, who is retiring from the Federal Bureau of Investigations after serving 23 years with great distinction. Mr. Johnson first came to our corner of Michigan in 1985 when he was assigned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Detroit Division in St. Joseph, Michigan. During his initial years of service, he was responsible for a wide range of investigative duties ranging from abductions and bank fraud-embezzlements to homicide and Presidential appointment research.  In 1986, Special Agent Johnson was appointed to manage, direct, and coordinate participation throughout Michigan with the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. This unit has received worldwide praise for its excellence in crime scene assessment/profiling and threat analysis. Special Agent Johnson's vision has extended beyond his assigned duties and I commend him for establishing multiagency partnerships which have allowed for various resources to be shared during complex investigations.  Roy has continually gone above the call of duty and acted for the betterment of our community. He has taught numerous law enforcement programs and lectured to public and civic organizations throughout the state of Michigan.  Johnson's knowledge and professionalism have led others to call on him to testify before Federal and State courts, Federal Grand Juries, and Congressional committees. Moreover, he has received various Congressional, regional, and departmental awards for his investigations and service.  I am proud to call Roy Johnson a friend and thank him for his many years of selfless service. His contributions to law enforcement have made community and great national a safer place. We are all better off for Roy's distinguished career in the FBI.                          ____________________
