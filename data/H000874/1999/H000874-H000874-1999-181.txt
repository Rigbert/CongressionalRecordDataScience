Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I simply want to commend the gentlewoman for the work that she has done on this issue. I also want to mention the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard) who has also in the Committee on Appropriations worked on this issue. Obviously this is, we think, a very fundamental and appropriate policy. The Federal Government ought to be encouraging this healthy activity on behalf of families in America and would hope that we would adopt it.
