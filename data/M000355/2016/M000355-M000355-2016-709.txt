 President, I wish to pay tribute to a distinguished Kentuckian and talented physician who has sadly passed away. Dr. James Crase, a good friend of mine who was a veteran and a former State senator, departed this life on May 28. He was 78 years old.  Dr. Crase, born in Letcher County, KY, practiced medicine for over 53 years, 40 of those years in his beloved hometown of Somerset, KY. He servedas chief of staff at the Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital.  As a Somerset doctor, he provided care to over 10,000 patient families and was named ``Citizen Physician of the Year'' by the Kentucky Academy of Family Practice. He previously practiced medicine in Berea, KY, McKee, KY, and in Norfolk, VA with the U.S. Navy.  Dr. Crase was elected to the Kentucky Senate in 1994 and became well known for his dedication to constituent service. After retiring from his medical practice, he helped create ClubMD, a healthcare clinic that focused on improving the patient experience.  Dr. Crase was deeply involved with the community and committed to volunteer service with many organizations, including the Lake Cumberland Lincoln Club, the Lake Cumberland Performing Arts, the Kentucky Medical Association, the Berea College Board of Trustees, the Somerset Community College Athletic Directorship, the First Presbyterian Church of Somerset, the Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital, the Pulaski Civil War Round Table, and the United Way.  Elaine and I wish to send our deepest condolences to Dr. Crase's family and many beloved friends during their time of grief. Dr. Crase was a friend, a caring and empathetic physician, and a devoted public servant. The Commonwealth of Kentucky is poorer for his loss.  An area publication, the Lexington Herald-Leader, published an article detailing the life and career of Dr. James Crase. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, June 1, 2016]           Longtime Somerset Physician James Crase Dies at 78                            (By Bill Estep)       James D. Crase, a longtime Somerset physician who served a      partial term in the state Senate, died May 28. The Letcher      County native was 78.       Crase was a U.S. Navy veteran who worked as a physician for      53 years, including more than 40 years in Somerset, where he      served as chief of staff of the Lake Cumberland Regional      Hospital and an elder at First Presbyterian Church.       Crase's obituary said he was proud to have provided care to      more than 10,000 families during his time in Somerset. The      Kentucky Academy of Family Practice named Crase its Citizen      Physician of the Year, the obituary said.       Crase, a small-government Republican, was elected to the      state Senate in December 1994 to finish the term of a      lawmaker who had been convicted in a corruption case.       Republicans control the Kentucky Senate now, but were in      the minority then. In a newspaper commentary, Crase expressed      some frustration about the relative lack of power of the      minority, and with the legislative process.       ``First, one must convince his or her own party to support      the measure. Then comes the dubious chore of convincing the      opposing party of its merits, thus the trades--you vote for      mine, I'll smile upon yours,'' Crase wrote.       He did not seek election to a full term in 1996.       U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a      statement Wednesday said Crase will be missed.       ``As a veteran and former state senator, Dr. Crase was      well-respected in the community and worked tirelessly to      improve the lives of his constituents,'' McConnell said.       Crase is survived by three children.  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                          ____________________
