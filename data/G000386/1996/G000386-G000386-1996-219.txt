 I have one more point I want to make.  I have been told two individuals want to speak, one who wants to speak for my amendment and one against it. I do not think Senator Stevens cares to prolong the vote on this amendment. When the time comes, I will be willing to do that. I am saying, a couple of others want to speak. I am not sure they will be able to speak. I notified their offices. If they do not come over, as far as I am concerned, we can go to the completion of the amendment. Is that all right with the Senator from Alaska?
