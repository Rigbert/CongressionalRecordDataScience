Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  [[Page H3606]] Texas [Mr. de la Garza], former chairman and now ranking member of the committee.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time, and I appreciate his interest and his effort. All of us are of course in favor of reducing fraud, waste and abuse, and certainly this is an area of very strong interest to us.  What I would like to ask of the gentleman is that there is concern that there needs to be further refinement of his amendment. Am I correct in that?
