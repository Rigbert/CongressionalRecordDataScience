President, consistent with my practice of announcing publicly my intent to object to unanimous consent requests, I am asking to have printed in the Record a letter to Senator Reid dated January 18, 2006. It explains that I will use every legislative and procedural tool at my disposal as a U.S. Senator to block any attempt to affect in any way Oregon's Death With Dignity Act, which the Supreme Court upheld yesterday.  The letter follows.                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, January 18, 2006.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Minority Leader,     The Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Leader Reid: I am writing to inform you of my intent      to object to any unanimous consent request to consider any      measure or matter that might affect end of life care      generally and Oregon's Death With Dignity Act in particular.       As you know, the U.S. Supreme Court yesterday upheld      Oregon's unique Death with Dignity Act, and I intend to use      every legislative and procedural tool at my disposal as a      United States Senator to block any attempt to overturn,      invalidate or otherwise affect Oregon's law in any way.       Consistent with my practice of publicly announcing my      intent to place a ``hold'' on a measure or matter, I will ask      that this letter be printed in the Congressional Record. If      your staff has any questions, please feel free to contact my      Legislative and Policy Director, Carole Grunberg, or my      Senior Health Policy Advisor, Stephanie Kennan at 224-5244.           Sincerely,                                                        Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senator.                          ____________________
