President, I have two amendments I have already filed. The second amendment is going to require a new number. The two I am going to be discussing are the ICRC amendment. I have several cosponsors of the amendment, including Senator Kyl. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Enzi be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 1313.
