 President, I rise today in tribute to a noble Iowan who has given his life for his country. 2LT Richard ``Brian'' Gienau was killed on Sunday, February 27, in Ar Ramadi, Iraq, when his military vehicle was struck by an explosive device. He was 29 years old, a fellow alumnus of my alma mater, the University of Northern Iowa, and a member of A Company, 224th Engineer Battalion, Army National Guard, Burlington, IA.  Second Lieutenant Gienau is remembered as a hard-working family man with a history of military service. He joined the U.S. Navy in 1994 and enlisted in the Iowa Army National Guard in 1999. After graduating in 2003 from University of Northern Iowa, he was commissioned in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps as a second lieutenant. He was mobilized last October.  Second Lieutenant Gienau is survived by his mother, Debbee Way, of Dunkerton, IA, and his father, Richard Gienau, of Waterloo, IA. He also leaves behind a young son. My prayers go out today to his family and friends in their time of loss. Let us today rememberhis life as we honor his sacrifice on behalf of all of us. We are forever in his debt.                          ____________________[Pages S2143-S2144]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES                      corporal travis eichelberger
