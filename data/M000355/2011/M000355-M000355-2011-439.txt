 President, yesterday, Republicans in both the House and Senate, led by Senator Hutchison, introduced a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to repeal the so-called net neutrality regulations recently adopted by the Federal Communications Commission.  We believe, as most Americans do, that the Internet has transformed our society precisely because people have been free to create and innovate free from government intrusion. As Americans become more aware of what is happening here, I suspect many will be as alarmed as I am at the government's growing involvement in this area of our lives. They will wonder if this is a Trojan horse for further meddling by the government. We intend to use the tools available to us to push back against this meddling, and I want to thank Senator Hutchison for taking the first step in our effort.                          ____________________
