President, for several years I have envisioned a way to give schools affordable and sustainable access to locally grown foods--a system that would benefit schools, children, and farmers alike. To make this a reality, I introduced the Pilot Project for the Procurement of Unprocessed Fruits and Vegetables as an amendment to the 2014 farm bill. I was very encouraged that the final bill included this pilot project and optimistic that my home State of Oregon could help lead the way--as it often does--by hosting one of the eight programs. That is why I am so pleased to say today Oregon was chosen to participate in the pilot project. This is a win for communities and school districts across Oregon who can now offer meals made with the locally grown produce we are famous for, everything from apples to zucchini, blueberries to tomatoes and everything in between.  This is a win for the local farmers who will gain new customers to buy their fruits and vegetables, and this is a win for the school children who will grow up knowing what fresh produce really tastes like.  This innovative and exciting project establishes a competitive pilot program with up to eight demonstration projects, each representing a different region of the country. These demonstration projects will help schools source healthy, local fruits and vegetables for the breakfasts, lunches, or snacks served to students. It is more important today than ever to ensure America's children have fresh, healthy eating options when they are increasingly exposed to unhealthy, processed foods. The partnerships that the pilot projects will surely grow will put money in the pockets of local farmers while also ensuring that our school kids are eating healthily. I look forward to seeing these projects grow and contribute to the healthy lives of our Nation's young men and women.                          ____________________
