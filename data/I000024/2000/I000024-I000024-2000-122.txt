President, I am pleased to introduce the National Institutes of Health EPSCoR Program Act of 2000 with my colleague, Senator Landrieu of Louisiana. This legislation we are introducing today, when passed, stands to make a major impact on the scope of biomedical research done in America today.  Small and medium sized states, like ours, have been unfairly discriminatedagainst in their competition for federal research dollars. In 1978, Congress created the EPSCoR program (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research), to make sure that all states would have the opportunity to compete for scientific research funds. Despite this intention, the EPSCoR program only served to exacerbate the exiting funding disparity. You may ask, how can this be so? The answer is really quite simple.  The EPSCoR program does not extend to one of the biggest sources of scientific research--the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are all aware, the NIH budget is growing rapidly; NIH's FY 2000 budget is $17.9 billion--up 8.43 percent in the past 5 years. Yet, despite this tremendous boom, 24 states receive 93 percent of NIH research grants, while the other 26 states split the remaining 7 percent.  Although the NIH budget has resulted in great scientific gains, the research divide continues. One-half of the states have seen little benefit in the recent NIH increase. The time has come to correct this allocation program, but in a way that insures we have the best biomedical research in the world, and that those benefits are extended to the entire country. Research institutes provide a great opportunity to improve the health care delivery and quality in their home state, but only limited opportunity exists in half the states, because of the existing funding divide.  The legislation we are introducing will provide $200 million to NIH-EPSCoR states will enable states that currently receive historically low amounts of NIH grants to participate in two special funds.  The first fund is to finance new infrastructure needs in these states. Because of their continued lack of equitable funding, many EPSCoR states have fallen behind in their infrastructure needs and are unable to compete against non-EPSCoR states. Our legislation will allocate $3.5 million each year to every NIH-EPSCoR state, to be used for projects the state EPSCoR committee targets as meeting the state biomedical research committees' goals. Because the state is responsible for choosing its infrastructure needs, we may finally be able to get away from the yearly requests for special projects in our states and allow federal funds to be spent in the most efficient manner possible.  The second fund is dedicated toward research in the new NIH-EPSCoR. This research is for meritorious projects, co-funded by the NIH-EPSCoR fund and the NIH Institute or Center. These projects must meet existing NIH standards or merit and quality, but will not have to compete against proposals from the non-EPSCoR states, which already dominate the grant process.  Finally, this process will be self sustaining. Because research is typically less expensive to perform in NIH-EPSCoR states, the savings in administrative costs are recaptured to fund additional research. In FY 1999 we estimate these savings would have added up to $49 million, which would have flowed back to NIH-EPSCoR states for additional research projects.  In recent years, we have made great strides in biomedical research, however, that research has been limited to only a select few. I ask you to join us in resolving this discrepancy and restore equity to the NIH process and would invite my colleagues to join us in this effort.                                 ______                                       By
