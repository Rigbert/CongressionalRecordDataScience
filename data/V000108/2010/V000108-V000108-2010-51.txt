Dharathula H. ``Dolly'' Millender on a momentous milestone, her 90th birthday, which will be on February 4, 2010. Dolly will be celebrating this milestone with family and friends on Thursday, February 4, 2010, at The Stadium Restaurant in Gary, Indiana. For 50 years, Dolly's complete dedication and endless enthusiasm put forth toward her community has allowed her the opportunity to enrich the lives of countless people.  Dolly Millender was born on February 4, 1920, in Terre Haute, Indiana, to Dolly and Orestes Hood, and became a third generation Hoosier. Dolly's grandfather, Nicholas Hood, settled in Indiana after becoming free. From her family, Dolly learned the importance of community. They taught her to work unselfishly for the people of the community because it is ``right'' and it should not be done for any other ambition. It was during these early years that Dolly was taught to strive to make a difference in the lives of others. In 1941, Dolly went on to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Education with a minor in Music from Indiana State Teacher's College, which is now Indiana State University. It was during her college years that she met her late husband, Justyn Millender. In 1944, Dolly and Justyn were married and later had two children, Naomi and Justine.  The family moved to Gary in 1950, and it was here that Dolly became a librarian at Pulaski Junior High, where she was fondly known as the ``library lady.'' It was during this time that she became enthralled with the history of Gary and its roots. Dolly's passion for history and selfless devotion to her community began to take shape, and her lifelong career as a historian and advocate for the community of Gary continued to grow. In 1967, Dolly wrote and published the first of her five books, Yesterday in Gary, which has become a collector's item today. Continuing her education, in 1969, Dolly went on to graduate from Purdue University with a Master's degree in Educational Media. Dolly then began her active political career as a precinct committeeperson and later became the first elected Gary City Councilwoman-at-large. She has held many impressive political positions throughout her career which include: library trustee, school board trustee, and Chief Executive Officer of the Gary Historical and Cultural Society, an unpaid position she continues to hold today. Dolly's many friends and family members share a common respect for her commendable qualities. For her many years of service dedicated to making the community of Gary a better place, Dolly is to be commended. She is a role model for us all.  Madam Speaker, Dolly Millender has always given her time and efforts selflessly to the community of Gary throughout her illustriouslife. She has dedicated her time and effort to serving and inspiring her community and its people, and for this she is worthy of our deepest admiration. I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in wishing Dolly a very happy 90th birthday.                          ____________________
