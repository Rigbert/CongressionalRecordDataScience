President, I rise today to commend The Aroostook Medical Center, TAMC, in Presque Isle, ME, for its efforts to improve its energy efficiency with compressed natural gas, CNG.  Dedicated to environmental stewardship and improving the community, TAMC is at the cutting edge with its conversion to CNG to meet the hospital's heating, cooling, and other energy needs. CNG represents a sensible effort to use a viable and affordable domestic energy alternative. This event demonstrates TAMC's efforts to create, sustain, and grow a modern health care organization to continue making a positive difference in Aroostook County. The countless and continuing efforts this northern Maine hospital is making to energy efficiency are to be commended for their lasting impact.  Converting to CNG is just one of the ways TAMC has reduced its carbon footprint. This efficient source of energy is safer to work with, will lower costs, and will burn more cleanly. The conversion to CNG will not only benefit the hospital and its patients and employees directly, but also will benefit the entire community by reducing emissions.  TAMC is quickly becoming a leader in environmentally friendly practices in northern Maine. The hospital has made changes to its nutritional program by eliminating disposable kitchenware, which has reduced the amount of waste it sends to the area's landfill. In addition, TAMC partners with the University of Maine at Presque Isle to improve composting. TAMC also purchases produce from MSAD No. 1 school farm, local farmers, and other small local growers to support the community and reduce transportation emissions.  Whether it is taking actions as small as reducing waste or as large as converting to CNG, TAMC is making a positive impact on the area, improving both public health and the environment. I commend TAMC for its commitment to conservation and improving efficiency. TAMC is truly standing up to its motto, TAMC: More Than a Hospital.                          ____________________
