As he indicated, he has proposed an amendment, and he is also allowing us to prepare a second-degree amendment, which I would like to offer as soon as it is ready and then conduct debate on a very important topic; that is, investing in our national security in the broadest sense and doing it wisely and well. Then, I would hope again--subject to the deliberations of the leaders on both sides--that we could have a vote on both the underlying amendment and the second-degree amendment tomorrow or the succeeding day.  Again, I thank the chairman for not only bringing this issue to the floor but also for giving us the opportunity to prepare an appropriate amendment.  Thank you.
