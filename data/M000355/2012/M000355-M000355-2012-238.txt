 President, I rise today in honor of a group of men from the Commonwealth of Kentucky who all acted bravely and valiantly during their time of service in the United States Armed Forces in World War II. Glenn Combs, Toleman Combs, Mansell Stone, Benjamin Garrison, Walter Garrison, Rufus Miller, Earl Hobbs, and Elvy Roberts, who are all from different towns and hollers in Clay County, KY, each has a fascinating story of his experiences while in the military. And it is my hope to share a few of those with you today.  When the United States of America decided to enter the Second World War, we did so with an insurmountable level of patriotism, dedication, and determination to defeat the Axis Powers. Men were going to extreme lengths to enlist and answer the call to serve their country, and protect freedom and democracy in the foreign countries around the world in which it was being tested.  Earl Hobbs, one of the men in this group of eight, had learned that he was just 2 pounds shy of the minimum weight required by the U.S. Army at the time of his enlistment. Upon hearing this news, he hurriedly ran to the nearest convenience store and purchased 3 square pounds of bananas. He gobbled them down right there outside the grocery, every last one of them. Later that day he passed the physical, including the weight requirement, and was an official member of the U.S. Armed Forces. It was instances like Earl's that truly inspire me; instances of men and women going to such great lengths to secure their freedom and the freedom of the ones that they love.  Earl's action that day so long ago was just one of many from what we call the ``Greatest Generation.'' Men and women alike across the Nation assumed new and unfamiliar assignments and positions that they may not have been comfortable with, all for the cause of defending liberty and securing freedom. We must look to the veterans of not only the Second World War, but the veterans of all the Nation's conflicts and struggles, with the utmost respect. We must not take for granted the inalienable rights we have so passionately fought to gain and maintain, and we must never forget those who have made the greatest sacrifice made by many on behalf of those rights.  I truly cherish the opportunity to stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate today to speak on behalf of these eight men and relate a true story of a local Kentucky ``Band of Brothers'' who decided to honor God and country and selflessly serve all those who inhabit this great Nation.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the great contributions of Glenn Combs, Toleman Combs, Mansell Stone, Benjamin Garrison, Walter Garrison, Rufus Miller, Earl Hobbs, and Elvy Roberts to the cause of freedom.  In July of 2011 there was an article published in the Manchester Enterprise, Clay County's local newspaper, which featured the truly unique journey these eight World War II veterans have experienced in their lifetimes. I ask unanimous consent the said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the Record as follows:            [From the Manchester Enterprise, July 28, 2011]                       A Chapter in WWII History       Note: This week's feature story covers eight individuals      who aided their country to take part in World War II. This      story was graciously sent in by Ted Garrison.       After a thorough debate on the world situation, expressing      their personal opinions and obligations for a month, they      made a decision. They would honor God and country, and defend      the Republic of the United States in WWII.       Glenn and Toleman Combs, Mansell ``Dude'' Stone, and      Benjamin and Walter Garrison enlisted in the U.S. Army.      Another of the Garrison brothers, Theo, wanted to join, but      he was informed that it would be more important to the war      effort for him to remain at home and continue to mine coal.       When I first began my research on this small group, I      thought Rufus ``Jamup'' Miller and Earl Hobbs were with them.      I found that they entered the military at a different date,      but these men (as did so many others) endured enormous      hardships during their service, so I decided it necessary to      include them in this brief history of patriotism and uncommon      valor.       The small group of recruits departed Manchester on October      16, 1940, to be inducted into the military at Ft. Thomas, KY.      Walt Garrison was 18 years old at that time. Walt and a      friend from Kentucky earned the top scores for expert      riflemen in their company. Later, Uncle Walt laughed and      blamed snow for causing him to lose to his friend by one      point the day they were at the rifle range.       Toleman Combs, Ben Garrison, and Walt Garrison were      assigned to Anti-Tank Company of the 10th Infantry Regiment      attached to Lt. General George S. Patton's 1st Armored      Division of the 3rd Army. Glenn Combs was assigned to      Headquarters training and was a Glider Wing of the 82nd      Airborne Division.       I believe we should mention that Capt. Elvy Roberts, born      on Beech Creek in Clay County, commanded a Glider Wing in the      101st Airborne at Normandy. He also participated in two      parachute jumps there. Elvy Roberts made a career of the U.S.      military and led the 6th Army as a Lt. General in Vietnam.       The 10th Infantry, with other Army units, including      segments of the 101st and 82nd Airborne, were stationed in      Iceland. The troops weren't informed that this location was      actually a staging area in preparation for the Normandy      invasion. Normandy was one of the most important events of      WWII. They shipped out of Iceland bound for an unknown      destination. After arriving offshore, the 10th Infantry      Regiment stayed aboard ships during the first three days of      the battle. Their orders were to wait until inclement weather      cleared enough to move the tanks and anti-tank guns onto the      beaches.       The day before the landing, in the pre-attack briefing,      they learned the location was Normandy, and details of the      mission were revealed. At that time, they were unaware that      their friend, ``Dude'' Stone, was in the initial attack on      the German-held beaches. Soldiers of the 82nd and 101st      Airborne had already fought a fierce battle, starting June 3,      1944. ``Dude'' had gone in with a glider wing. There were 200      men in his wing, and only nine survived.       10th Infantry Regiment and other units prepared to attack.      The Anti-Tank company departed the USS Republican by landing      crafts and stormed the beach on June 6 at 6:30 AM. Uncle Walt      said, ``The scene was terrible, but we had a job to do. We      could see fortifications blown apart, tank wreckage, and the      bodies of American airborne troops lying on the beach.''       I asked him if he was afraid when they hit the beach, and      he answered, ``No, but I was very angry when I saw how the      Germans had treated our soldiers.'' American troops had      sustained approximately 6,036 casualties during the first      hour of the invasion and over 2,400 at Omaha Beach alone, but      they had gained a toehold.       American troops were able to fight their way over the      beaches and hundred-foot high cliffs to move ahead a few      miles and dig in for approximately 24 hours, thus securing      the area. This was a process they repeated, moving the line      forward. During these advances, Uncle Walt and a soldier of      German ancestry performed sniper and reconnaissance duty for      their company. On one occasion near the Modelle River in      France, A-T Company came under mortar and rifle fire from a      small town. Walt and Wolfgang split up and worked their way      toward each end of the village, firing on the enemy positions      as they moved in. When they were close, Wolfgang yelled to      the enemy troops using the German language, telling them they      were surrounded and ordered them to surrender.       Approximately 150 German soldiers surrendered. There was at      least one SS Trooper with them. Walt and Wolfgang referred to      that episode as their Sgt. York Trick!       Earl Hobbs was discovered to be two pounds under the      required body weight at the induction center. He ran to a      nearby grocery store, bought three bounds of bananas,      hurriedly ate the fruit and passed the physical. Was this an      example of youthful patriotism or what?       After basic training, Earl was schooled in armor at Ft.      Knox, KY. He was assigned to a tank crew in the 1st Armored      Division. During a battle near Algeria, Africa, his tank was      disabled and the crew was forced to evacuate. They were      captured by German soldiers and taken to a POW camp, Stalag      3B in Berlin, Germany, where he was a prisoner for 27 months.       While he was in this camp, fellow Clay Countian Squire      Baker was incarcerated there for three or four months, then      moved out to a different location. Squire and surviving      members of their bomber crew had been shot down and captured.      Stalag 3B was liberated by Russian allies. Earl said, ``The      Russians were much more cruel than our former German      captors.''       Rufus ``Jamup'' Miller, Jr. was inducted into the military      at Cincinnati, Ohio, August 13, 1943. After basic training at      Camp Blanding, Florida, he was assigned to K Company of the      339th Infantry, Third Battalion. They were heavily involved      in the assault on the Gustav line.       This location was in Italy. K Company's losses were very      heavy, nearly 55 percent. Most of the casualties in K Company      were from the minefields. However, they also encountered      mortar, rifle, and machine-gun fire. ``Jamup'' was among the      wounded. The 339th Infantry was one of the three regiments of      the 85th Infantry Division. In WWI, they were nicknamed the      ``Polar Bears.''       The 85th had a proud and famous history. The second time      ``Jamup'' was wounded was in the North Apennines Campaign in      bitter fighting east of Mount Verruca. He was also involved      in the PO Valley campaign as well as the Rome-Arno Campaign.      After being wounded twice, Miller was transferred to the      military police. June 5th, 1944, the 339th did their victory      march through Rome.       Glenn Combs was at the induction center when doctors      decided his feet were a little flat for the infantry. He went      through basic training and into Headquarters Company of the      1st Armored Division. In December of 1942, they traveled to      North Africa by ships. Glenn was involved in battles at      Anzio, Kasserine Pass, Tunisia, and Algeria. After avoiding a      near disaster at Kasserine Pass, the commanding general was      relieved and Col. Robinett was placed in charge of      operations. Because of his excellent strategy and leadership      in attaining victory in a very negative situation, Col. Paul      ``Little Man'' Robinette was promoted to Brig. General.      Kasserine Pass was considered to be the first major battle      won by American forces in North Africa. Glenn Combs was      promoted from staff sergeant to junior warrant officer, and      in a few months to chief warrant officer. Glenn said, ``One      of the reasons I was promoted through the enlisted ranks to      officer was due to so many men getting killed in my      company.''       These men served approximately five years. Walt Garrison      was one of the fortunate. He didn't receive a scratch. Uncle      Ben wasn't so lucky. He was wounded in the shoulder by      shrapnel from an exploding artillery shell on a hill near the      Moselle River in France.       Walt Garrison was one of those veterans who could talk      about his war experience. Ben, ``Dude,'' ``Jamup,'' and many      others were too scarred emotionally, mentally, and physically      to recall their combat duty.       I apologize that I'm unable to provide more complete      information concerning the sacrifices these men made for our      country. They and many more of those veterans are heroes and      should never be forgotten. The American people who lived      during the WWII era earned a reputation as ``The Greatest      Generation.'' I truly believe they deserve that compliment.      Not only in military service, but also in different walks of      life, many of them had exemplary attitudes and      accomplishments.       At this time, Glen Combs is the only one of these men still      living. He is 92 and in poor health.       Toleman Combs passed away November 29, 1995, and is buried      at Nancy, KY. Rufus ``Jamup'' Miller died February 3, 1997,      and is buried in Manchester. Benjamin Franklin Garrison died      at Wilmore Veteran's Hospital December 27, 1997, and is      buried at Memorial Gardens in Manchester. Walter Garrison      passed away on May 22, 2002.       Years ago, Uncle Walt decided to be buried with some of the      soldiers he served with at Normandy. He was laid to rest in      Butler County Memorial Park ``Field of Honor'' near Hamilton,      Ohio.       Earl Hobbs died November 25, 2003, and is buried at      Memorial Gardens in Manchester. Mansell ``Dude'' Stone passed      on July 2, 2004, and is buried in Harts Branch Cemetery      outside Manchester.                          ____________________
