Speaker, this evening I would like to dedicate my remarks to Social Security, its trust funds and our growing national debt.  In January of last year, our Nation finally moved to an annual balanced budget after decades of being awash in growing debt as far as the eye could see. Many of us fought very hard tobring that budget back into balance and, in fact, the Congressional Budget Office at that time projected that we were on course to have the publicly held debt, the over MMMM$6 trillion of accumulated debt, paid off in about 10 years, by 2011.  Now, not even one and a half years later the Congressional Budget Office projects that under the Republican budget passed here in March, there will be a $1.8 trillion in budget deficit over the next 10 years. So instead of paying off our Nation's debt by 2011, under the Republican budget the publicly held debt will stand at nearly $3 trillion.  I can remember when they took the debt clock down in Time Square and everybody across America cheered. Well, I would encourage those folks up on Wall Street to put it back up because it is growing again.  Now, what is the biggest reason for this radical reversal in our Nation's financial health? Primarily, the Bush tax gives away mainly to the super rich.  Now, what does this burgeoning public debt represent? First and foremost it means Social Security trust funds are being drawn down to pay for those tax breaks. And what is really amazing is that the Republican majority here in this Congress voted seven times to protect the Social Security trust fund in a lockbox. They said they wanted to ensure that not a penny of the Social Security surplus would be used for other programs. They have vowed that every penny of the surplus would be used solely to buy back outstanding Treasury bonds in a manner that would shore up Social Security for the future. So the Republican budget they passed in March does not simply break the lockbox and dip into the Social Security surplus, it calls for a grand and extended raid, tapping the surplus every year of the next decade. The timing could not be worse. We must balance the Federal budget and protect Social Security surpluses for the 44 million baby boomers set to retire over the next ten to 15 years. Working families have earned a secure retirement and we must put Social Security solvency first. Congress is the main protector of Social Security. It is the people's program intended by Franklin Roosevelt and every Democratic president since, to allow generations of retirees to live with independence and dignity. And it is time for the Republican majority to stop raiding Social Security. But so long as they continue to do so I will be down here every week telling the American people exactly how much they have taken from the one remaining portion of the Federal budget that is in surplus and that is the trust funds.  Last week we reported that they had taken as of June 5, $207,232,876,712, which last week amounted to about $717 per American. This week, they have now taken over $5 billion more.  As of June 11, 2002 they have now dipped into the trust fund $212,246,575,342 averaging about $754 per American. I do not think that this is responsible budgeting. I do not think this is what the Republican majority promised. I am generally not quite this partisan on the floor of this Congress. However, when it comes to Social Security and Medicare, and what it has meant to lift half a Nation out of poverty, there is absolutely no reason that Kenneth Lay and his likes should get a $350 million tax refund while average Americans are having their future retirement funds raided every single week. So I would just ask those who may be listening in New York City, if you could find that old debt clock and put it back, I think we need to tell the truth to the American people. It is time that we begin putting money in the trust fund, not drawing it down for purposes that are unrelated to the purpose for which it was originally organized.                          ____________________
