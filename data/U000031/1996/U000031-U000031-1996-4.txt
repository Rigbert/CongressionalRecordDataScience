Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would like my friend from Massachusetts to respond to the question that the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Ganske] raised in his opening statement about the Heimlich maneuver. Does the gentleman think that that should be patented and get a bill for that? That is one of the things that this goes against.
