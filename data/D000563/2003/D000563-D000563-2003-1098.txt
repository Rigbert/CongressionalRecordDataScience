President, I say to the Members of the Senate, I hope they have listened carefully to their hospital administrators across their States, particularly at teaching hospitals which we count on to deal with some of the most complicated medical cases that are presented, and also hospitals that are responsible for teaching the next generation of specialists, including children's hospitals.  If the Senator from New York does not prevail, I can tell her that in my State of Illinois, some of the very best and most important care will be compromised, and we will see the next generation of doctors who we want to be the best and brightest in America not being prepared. How can that be in the best interest of medical care in Illinois, New York, Iowa, or Oklahoma?  I salute the Senator from New York. We have talked about a lot of amendments to this appropriations bill, but I wish to ask the Senator in closing----
