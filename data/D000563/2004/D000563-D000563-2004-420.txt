President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota because I think he has raised an important issue of concern in this debate and that is one I have initiated in my opening remarks. We need to have a constructive bipartisan conversation about a serious national problem. Instead, this bill, S. 2061, was introduced just a few days ago without a committee hearing, reference to committee, without any attempt to find common ground and find a solution. In fact, it is being called today so there will be a vote on record and nothing else. It is anticipated the bill will not go forward.  I spoke to doctors in Illinois over the weekend, doctors who share my concern about the medical malpractice premium situation in our State. I have told them what we are doing today is frankly a political exercise. It is an exercise to come up with a roll call vote so those on one side of the issue can go to their supporters and say, we have worked hard. We brought this bill to the floor, we have been stopped, and we cannot get back to it because we are so busy. Frankly, that is no solution. In State after State, including my State, there are areas where there are serious medical malpractice premium problems. They arise for a variety of reasons. Memorial Hospital in Belleville, IL, has lost numerous obstetricians and gynecologists in the last year due to rising malpractice premiums. Community leaders in that town, which I am familiar with--it is an area I grew up in--have come to me and said, this is a real source of concern. We are losing doctors. They are doctors who are leaving the practice to retire early, and I met one doctor in that circumstance. There are some who are moving to rural counties where the malpractice premiums are lower and they are further away, of course, from the people they originally served. Some are moving across the river to Missouri where they are finding malpractice premiums are a fraction of what they are in Illinois.  There is no doubt in my mind there is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. It is not just in the obstetrical/gynecological area. The OB/GYN issue is an important one, but there are other areas of need relative to trauma care, neurosurgery, and orthopedic surgery. The list is long and we need to address it in a serious and responsible way.  This bill, however, is being brought to us on a moment's notice. This bill is being brought to us in an effort to really check off the box that says, yes, we considered medical malpractice and now we are going to move on. That is unfair and it is unfortunate, and we can do better.  I will tell my colleagues a story about some of the situations I know of in my State. Eduardo Barriuso, who is a physician in the Humboldt Park area of Chicago, pays $104,000 a year for malpractice insurance. He earns about $175,000 because the patients he sees are poor patients, Medicaid and Medicare patients. Doctors who depend on Medicaid and Medicare are not wealthy individuals, but they perform a valuable function because if they are not there to serve the poorest of the poor, then who will?  This doctor says that faced with $104,000 in annual premiums and a $175,000 annual income, he cannot continue his practice, and he certainly cannot pass on the higher costs of medical malpractice insurance to his patients who are poor people.  Another Chicago area OB/GYN has announced he is going to study to obtain his pharmacist license. Right now he is paying $115,000 a year for liability insurance.  Let's go to the root cause of the issue. Why are we even debating this issue of medical malpractice? There are several reasons. First, the men and women who are engaged in the medical profession are some of the most important people in our lives, some of the most important people in America. These are men and women who at great personal sacrifice go to medical school so that they are trained and skilled to be there when we need them, when our families need them. Time and again, my family and most who are following this debate have turned to a doctor in the hopes that he or she can cure an illness, provide some hope, give people some reason to believe they can overcome a disease, disability, or an injury.  Doctors are so critically important to all of us and yet when one takes a look at a doctor's practice, at a doctor's skills, there is a human side to the equation. They are human beings. They do make mistakes. Some are simple negligence. Some are far worse. When these mistakes occur, when a patient is in a hospital or a doctor's office and the wrong thing is done and that patient is injured, what should happen? In most walks of life in America, we are held accountable for our actions.  If I decide this evening to take my car and go out speeding on a highway, strike another car and injure someone, I will be held accountable. I was negligent. I did not reach the standard of safety that is expected of me as a driver and I must pay the price. That is true for businesspeople, for individuals, for virtually everyone in America. It is certainly true for medical professionals. When they make a mistake by negligence or intentional misconduct, they can and should be held accountable. I think that is part of our system of justice. Very few, if any, people argue that is not a reasonable thing to do.  How serious then are the number of medical errors and medical malpractice cases that occur across the United States? Well, the most far-reaching study of the extended cost of medical errors in hospitals and doctors' offices was published by the Journal of the American Medical Association last October. This is a dispassionate, objective analysis of the likelihood of medical errors and medical negligence in America. The authors of the study analyzed 7.4 million patient records from 994 hospitals in 28 States, representing some 20 percent of all the hospitals in America. This was an exhaustive study.  They concluded medical injuries in hospitals ``pose a significant threat to patients and incur substantial costs to society,'' and ``are a serious epidemic confronting our health care system.''  A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has told us as we go into this debate the first thing we can acknowledge is we have an epidemic of medical negligence in America. Now this was not the Journal ofthe American Trial Lawyers. This was the Journal of the American Medical Association. They published a study that told us and warned us we have a serious problem in America.  The study found injuries in U.S. hospitals in the year 2000, for just one year, led to approximately 32,600 deaths, at least 2.4 million extra days of patient hospitalization, and additional costs of up to $9.3 billion. These injuries did not include adverse drug reactions or malfunctioning medical devices.  Dr. Carolyn Clancy, Director of the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, called medical errors ``a national problem of epidemic proportions.''  This was at a hearing before the Government Affairs Committee last June. She said Congress and the Bush administration need to make sure health care professionals work in systems that are designed to prevent mistakes and catch problems before patients are injured.  According to the Institute of Medicine, the medical errors epidemic has caused more American deaths per year than breast cancer, AIDS, and automobile accidents combined. It is the equivalent to a jumbo jetliner crashing every 24 hours for an entire year.  More than 70 studies of the past decade have documented serious quality problems in medical treatment, yet this bill before us today, S. 2061, does absolutely nothing to address this underlying problem of patient safety. How can we in good conscience talk about a medical malpractice problem and conclude the only place we need look is to the courtroom, to the patient once injured who goes to the courthouse seeking some compensation, some accountability for an injury that was absolutely no fault of their own? Yet the bill before us is absolutely silent when it comes to making doctors' offices, hospitals, and patient treatment safer.  This last Sunday in the New York Times, an interesting article on patient safety was published. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 22, 2004]            Running a Hospital Like a Factory, in a Good Way                           (By Andrea Gabor)       On the face of it, SSM St. Joseph Health Center, a small      hospital in suburban St. Louis, does not seem very      revolutionary in business terms. The hospital is a nonprofit      institution run by the Franciscan Sisters of Mary. The chief      executive, Alan Kevin Kast, is a former seminarian who begins      his meetings with prayer and refers to his hospital as a      ministry. A crucifix hangs in every room.       Yet St. Joseph is also guided by worldly objectives. The      364-bed hospital, part of SSM Health Care, which has 20      hospitals in four states and is led by Sister Mary Jean Ryan,      is in the vanguard of health care change. By using the      quality and productivity techniques that helped strengthen      American industry in the 1980's, the hospital has improved      patient care and reduced medication errors, waiting time in      the emergency room and infection rates. It has even sharply      reduced nursing turnover, which prevents many hospitals from      delivering consistent care.       Other hospitals are also starting to use some of the      techniques that have made industry more efficient in its      quest to improve quality and save money. Every year,      preventable medical errors cost $9 billion, and tens of      thousands of lives, according to a recent study by the Agency      for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the Department      of Health and Human Services, and Johns Hopkins University.       Whether in industry or in health care, a quality strategy      ``gives a unified vocabulary for thinking about production as      a system with a focus on customers,'' said Donald Berwick,      founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, an      advocacy organization based in Boston.       Many hospitals are using a road map provided by General      Electric, which has been selling its productivity-enhancing,      cost-cutting elixir known as Six Sigma, along with medical      imaging equipment, to hospitals around the country. Six Sigma      is a statistical measure that can be applied to any industry      and refers to a goal of reducing errors to 3.5 parts per      million. Two years ago, for example, the North Shore-Long      Island Jewish Health System contracted with GE Medical      Systems and the Harvard School of Public Health to help start      a leadership training center. Similarly, after close to a      decade of cost-cutting, the Yale New Haven Hospital also      recently signed up with GE.       New devotees of quality are beginning to measure and      analyze everything from waste and waiting time to infection      rates and the narrow avoidances of mistakes in treatment, as      well as organizational barriers to improvement.       In a culture ruled by a fear of malpractice, the focus on      quality involves a shift from secrecy to transparency--     including reporting and dissecting mistakes.       That shift may be helped by a provision of the Medicare      legislation passed in December that withholds a small part of      Medicare payments if a hospital refuses to disclose quality      data. ``It's not a lot of money, but it's incredibly      historic,'' said Robert Galvin, director for global health      care of G.E. and a founder of the Leapfrog Group, an industry      consortium aimed at improving health care.       A few hospitals, including Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical      Center in New Hampshire and the nine hospitals that form the      Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality, have begun to      publish comparative quality data on their Web sites,      including statistics like mortality rates.       At St. Joseph, where a quality strategy was first embraced      in the late 1980's, measurement, standardization and analysis      are obsessions.       ``When I came here, everything was done differently,'' said      Filippo Ferrigni, who has led the hospital's intensive care      unit since 1987. ``We didn't even measure blood pressure the      same way in everyone. We decided we needed to have internal      standards for measurement of at least blood pressure,      pulmonary artery pressure, temperature, the fundamental      building blocks of medicine.''       The quality push at St. Joseph and the other hospitals in      the group has led to systemwide benefits. In 1999, the      company was in the red, but in 2002 it had net income of $17      million, on revenue of $1.8 billion. Amid nationwide nursing      shortages, it lowered annual turnover to about 10 percent in      2002 from 15 percent in 2000. The national average turnover      rate is more than 20 percent.       At St. Joseph, the zeal for quality improvement is helping      the sickest patients. When Dr. Ferrigni read an article in a      recent issue of The New England Journal of Medicine linking      high glucose levels to an increased chance of infections, he      knew that he had found his next big opportunity for improving      patient care. Infections acquired in hospitals and intensive      care units are common, according to a report released in      December by the government's Agency for Healthcare Research      and Quality; about two million patients are infected each      year at a cost of more than $4.5 billion.       The stress of illness results in higher gluclose levels for      most patients--not just those with diabetes. Dr. Ferrigni      decided to see if lowering glucose levels in the intensive      care unit by giving patients intravenous insulin would lower      infection levels. Initially, the project ran into      ``tremendous resistance,'' he said. Doctors were concerned      that giving patients insulin might result in brain injury and      seizures. Dr. Ferrigni, however, persuaded his colleagues to      allow him to gradually reduce blood sugars of patients in the      intensive care unit. As blood sugars declined among the      patients, overall mortality in the unit declined by 40      percent.       The results were so astonishing that the hospital decided      to make the reduction of glucose levels for all patients, not      just those in intensive care, a quality goal. Today, all      patients are given glucose tests and, if necessary, get      insulin. Hospitalwide, that change is credited with reducing      deaths over all, not just from infections, by 28 percent from      the average recorded from 1998 to 2001.       Because each serious infection costs about $35,000, the      savings are also huge. ``This is the single most important      leverage point for reducing mortality that's available to      hospitals,'' Dr. Ferrigni said. ``This is incredibly powerful      stuff.''       The effort, however, also demonstrated a major      organizational challenge. ``Doctors write the orders, but      nurses have to make it work,'' Dr. Ferrigni said, explaining      that the glucose initiative significantly increased nurses'      workloads.       Blood sugar, once measured four times a day, now must be      measured 12 times a day in intensive care. Once nurses saw      the impact of the glucose testing, however, ``they got all      over it,'' Dr. Ferrigni said.       Some of the greatest quality challenges involve persuading      employees in various departments to cooperate. Consider the      effort, known as 30/30, to cut waiting time in emergency      rooms. The goal is to evaluate patients with life-threatening      illnesses or injuries in just 30 seconds and to reduce the      time needed to admit patients to a hospital bed from the      emergency room to 30 minutes.       Improvements in the emergency room involved a number of      departments. When X-rays were needed, it often took an hour      for an X-ray technician to get to the emergency room. To      solve the problem, one X-ray technician was permanently      transferred there. Or, in admitting psychiatric patients, the      hospital had to wait for an evaluation by an outside      psychological social worker before moving patients out of the      emergency room, a process that averaged 90 minutes. To reduce      the wait, the hospital hired a psychological social worker.        Within two years, SSM St. Joseph has met its objectives in      the emergency room 94 percent of the time, up from about 65      percent when the project began. To help keep the organization      from becoming complacent, patients receive a coupon for $10      of groceries when SSM misses its 30/30 target. The hospital      spent $14,450 in 2003 on coupons.        The hospital now spends about $200,000 more each year on      increased emergency-room staffing. But a jump in admissions      has     more than made up for that cost. In 2002, St. Joseph garnered      about 68 percent of all new emergency room admissions in St.      Charles County. After years without growth, the hospital also      had a 7 percent increase in patient admissions in general in      2001, and the same increase in 2002.        Some major health care institutions, like Johns Hopkins      and the Mayo Clinic, have been pursuing quality initiatives      for years, but generally the mantra has been slower to      penetrate big institutions.        Large teaching hospitals, which juggle teaching, research      and patient care, have special challenges. Because of their      residency programs, many of their doctors are temporary. At      Yale-New Haven, one big question is whether a hospitalwide      quality effort can succeed when only 10 percent of the      hospital's 2,600 physicians are full-time. The rest are      community physicians or professors at the School of Medicine.        The hospital began its Six Sigma effort in the intensive      care unit, which had its own staff of nurses. The project      involved reducing a relatively high rate of blood-stream      infections that occur in patients who have catheters.        When management broached the subject with Heidi Frankel,      director of surgical critical care at the hospital and a      doctor at the Yale School of Medicine, she was skeptical.      ``This isn't an assembly line; it's an I.C.U.,'' Dr. Frankel      recalled saying. ``But it turned out to be a brilliant and      inspired thing to use rigid corporate improvement techniques      in a patient model because there are many things we do that      are repetitive, and that we could standardize.''        After winning over fellow doctors and residents, Dr.      Frankel standardized the catheterization procedure and      created a training video for the regular influx of new      residents. During the last year, the surgical intensive care      unit cut its catheter-related infection rates by about 75      percent. A rigorous quality strategy appeals to many      hospitals not only because it controls costs, but also      because it can improve care. But the process can take years      to master. That is why, at St. Joseph, the true believers      would also recommend a little prayer.
