  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the budget proposal of the Congressional Black Caucus.  I am voting for this budget, not because I favor every detail, in fact there are choices that the authors of this budget have made to which I strongly object. However, the general trust of this budget is on target.  This is a balanced budget. It gets to balance through reasonable cuts in corporate welfare and reductions in waste at the Pentagon.  This budget protects Social Security and Medicare. And it provides for an increase in the most important investment we as a nation can make--education.  The Republican budget, on the other hand, gives a huge tax cut for profitable corporations an the wealthy. It actually increases military spending, while making deep cuts in Medicare. What's worse, it cuts Social Security cost of living adjustments, violating the promise made by Republican leaders.  The Republican budget is a prescription for the continued decline in living standards for working American families.
