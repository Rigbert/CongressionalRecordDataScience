 Because of their participation in the GREAT Program, this school in Sioux City went from a high-risk school to being recognized as one of Iowa's First In the Nation in Education [FINE] schools this past year. This is a significant and very important turnaround. I would urge my friend, the Senator from Alabama, to give serious consideration to adding Sioux City to the GREAT Program during the conference on this bill.
