Speaker, I recall one of the compromises that got the Constitution through the convention in the States was one that permitted slaves to be imported for the first 20 years of the Constitution and did not specifically omit slavery. Now, was Madison enlightened at that time, or did we need to amend the Constitution to get rid of something that my State fought to get rid of in the Civil War?
