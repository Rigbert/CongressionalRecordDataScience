 President, today, Senator Baucus and I are introducing legislation that will update and clarify the tax rules for business clients and that use professional employer organizations, PEOs. This legislation will improve the efficiency of small businesses by eliminating any uncertainty about the ability of qualifying PEOs to assume liability for paying wages and collecting and remitting Federal employment taxes.  Business owners are overwhelmed with the challenges of meeting Federal and State employment and tax responsibilities. Many businesses, particularly small to mid-sized businesses are turning to professional employer organizations for assistance with these employment obligations. A PEO works with its business clients to provide comprehensive employment services. The PEO assumes responsibility for the management of human resources, employee benefits, payroll, and workers' compensation, allowing their business clients to focus on their core competencies to maintain and grow their bottom line. In short, this legislation is about improving the efficiency of America's small businesses.  Businesses today need help with the increasingly complex employment related matters. The most important of these matters is the payment of wages and the collection and remitting of employment taxes. Increasingly, businesses are turning to PEOs to assume these responsibilities. Our legislation will eliminate any ambiguity about a PEO's ability to assume employment tax responsibility while providing important safeguards for the PEO's small business clients.  Tbe Small Business Efficiency Act will permit PEOs that are certified by the IRS, CPEO, to collect and remit Federal employment taxes of their business clients' employees. The certification process is voluntary and was designed with significant input from all stakeholders, including the Department of the Treasury and the IRS. To be certified by the IRS, the CPEO would have to meet financial and other standards and maintain ongoing certification by the IRS. The CPEO would be required to assume full and sole responsibility for the collection of Federal employment taxes.  In addition to the many benefits for business clients, the government benefits from improved employment regulatory compliance and tax administration The IRS has stated that CPEOs would facilitate tax administration by reducing the number of returns it processes and by reducing errors in calculating and paying employment taxes. This is a win-win situation. The PEO arrangement not only reduces the governmental burden of collecting employment tax and unemployment compensation obligations, it also assures consistent compliance with complex tax laws and timely and expedited payment of taxes. This is clearly an improvement for PEOs, the business clients of PEOs, and the Federal Government.  The Small Business Efficiency Act will substantially simplify employment tax obligations for businesses that use PEOs. The legislation will provide clarity for PEOs, their business clients, and the IRS regarding the rights of a PEO to assist business client with employment tax responsibilities while significantly improving tax administration. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section description of the bill be printed in the Congressional Record and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address this issue in a timely manner.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2913       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Such rules shall be designed in a manner      which streamlines, to the extent possible, the application of      requirements of such amendments, the exchange of information      between a certified professional employer organization and      its customers, and the reporting and recordkeeping      obligations of the certified professional employer      organization.       (f) User Fees.--Subsection (b) of section 7528 of such Code      (relating to Internal Revenue Service user fees) is amended      by adding at the end the following new paragraph:       ``(4) Certified professional employer organizations.--The      fee charged under the program in connection with the      certification by the Secretary of a professional employer      organization under section 7705 shall not exceed $500.''.       (g) Effective Dates.--       (1) In general.--The amendments made by this Act shall take      effect on the January 1st of the first calendar year      beginning more than 12 months after the date of the enactment      of this Act.       (2) Certification program.--The Secretary of the Treasury      shall establish the certification program described in      section 7705(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 not      later than 6 months before the effective date determined      under paragraph (1).                                  ____                   The Small Business Efficiency Act                     Section-By-Section Description       Section 1. Short Title: The Small Business Efficiency Act.       Section 2. No Inference Language: The legislation is      narrowly drafted to provide expressly that except for the      payment of employment taxes as provided in the bill, there is      no inference regarding the determination of who is a common      law employer under Federal tax laws or who is an employer      under other provisions of the law.       Section 3. Certified Organizations: Creates a voluntary      certification program for Professional Employer Organizations      (CPEOs) by establishing basic requirements which must be met      in order to be certified by the Internal Revenue Service      (IRS).       Section 3(a) describes the responsibility of the CPEO with      respect to the covered workers performing services at its      business client's worksite, with the CPEO being treated as      the employer of those covered workers for employment tax      purposes. This section provides that after certification, a      CPEO assume the responsibility and liability for payment of      wages and collection of Federal employment taxes for covered      workers. This section also provides that a CPEO and its      clients will be treated as ``successor'' employers for      employment tax purposes with no additional taxes owed simply      because a client engages or disengages a CPEO. Finally, the      section imposes rules that prevent abuse.       Section 3(b) describes certification requirements which a      PEO must demonstrate to the IRS by written application. As      established by the Secretary of the Treasury, these could      include requirements with respect to tax status, background,      experience, business location, and annual financial audits,      as well as verification of the continuing accuracy of      representations and information on a periodic basis. In      addition, this section requires CPEOs to obtain financial      reviews from independent CPAs and to post a bond for the      payment of employment taxes. A worksite employee is a worker      who performs services at the CPEO's business client worksite      if the worker and at least 85% of the individuals working at      the worksite are covered by a written service contract that      provides the CPEO will (1) assume responsibility for payment,      reporting and withholding of wages, employment taxes and      employee benefits, without regard to the adequacy of payment      by the client business. The service contract would also be      required to expressly provide that the CPEO assumes shared      responsibility with the business client for firing the worker      or hiring or recruiting any new worker and for maintaining      employee records.       Section 3(c) provides conforming amendments with respect to      certain credits and reporting rules.       Section 3(d) makes certain clerical amendments.       Section 3(e) creates regulatory authority to develop      appropriate reporting and recordkeeping rules.       Section 3(f) authorizes the creation of a CPEO      certification user fee not to exceed $500.       Section 3(g) provides that the provisions of the Act will      take effect on January 1 of the first calendar year beginning      more than 12 months after the date of enactment. This section      further requires the Secretary of the Treasury to establish      the certification program not later than 6 months following      the effective date.                                 ______                                       By
