President, I filed an amendment to the bill on Tuesday and look forward to an opportunity to offer that amendment and have it considered by the Senate. My amendment is the honest services amendment, No. 2924.  The purpose of my amendment is to articulate more clearly the line that cannot be crossed without incurring criminal liability. If we are serious about lobbying reform, the Senate will adopt this amendment. It was only with the indictments of Jack Abramoff, Michael Scanlon, and former Representative Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham that Congress took note of the scandal that has grown over the last years. If we are to restore public confidence, we need to provide better tools for Federal prosecutors to combat public corruption in our Government.  This amendment creates a better legal framework for combating public corruption than currently exists under our criminal laws. It specifies the crime of honest services fraud involving Members of Congress and prohibits defrauding or depriving the American people of the honest services of their elected representatives.  Under this amendment, lobbyists who improperly seek to influence legislation and other official matters by giving expensive gifts, lavish entertainment and travel, and inside advice on investments to Members of Congress and their staff would be held criminally liable for their actions.  The law also prohibits Members of Congress and their staff from accepting these types of gifts and favors, or holding hidden financial interests, in return for being influenced in carrying out their official duties. Violators are subject to a criminal fine and up to 20 years' imprisonment, or both.  This legislation strengthens the tools available to Federal prosecutors to combat public corruption in our Government. The amendment makes it possible for Federal prosecutors to bring public corruption cases without all of the hurdles of having to prove bribery or of working with the limited and nonspecific honest services fraud language in current Federal law.  The amendment also provides lobbyists, Members of Congress, and other individuals with much-needed notice and clarification as to what kind of conduct triggers this criminal offense.  In addition, my amendment authorizes $25 million in additional Federal funds over each of the next 4 years, to give Federal prosecutors needed resources to investigate corruption and to hold lobbyists and other individuals accountable for improperly seeking to influence legislation and other official matters.  The unfolding public corruption investigations involving lobbyist Jack Abramoff and MZM demonstrate that unethical conduct by public officials has broad ranging impact. These scandals undermine the public's confidence in our Government. Just last week, the Washington Post reported that, as an outgrowth of the Cunningham investigation, Federal investigators are now looking into contracts awarded by the Pentagon's new intelligence agency--the Counterintelligence Field Activity--to MZM, Inc., a company run by Mitchell J. Wade who recently pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe Mr. Cunningham.  The American people expect--and deserve--to be confident that their representatives in Congress perform their legislative duties in a manner that is beyond reproach and that is in the public interest.  Because I strongly believe that public service is a public trust, I urge all Senators to support this amendment. If we are serious about reform and cleaning up this scandal, we will do so.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my amendment be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  (Purpose: To make it illegal for anyone to defraud and deprive the   American people of the right to the honest services of a Member of Congress and to instill greater public confidence in the United States                                Congress)       At the appropriate place, insert the following:     SEC. __.
