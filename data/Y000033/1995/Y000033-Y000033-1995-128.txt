Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that if I knew the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] was going to be so cooperative and so understanding on issues of fisheries, he should have joined our committee many, many years ago.  The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Studds] and I have had a great working relationship concerning the seas. We have worked, I believe, although we had our discussions about to which degree we can go, but we have always sought to protect the species, provide the species, and make sure that the American fisherman does exist.   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from California has offered an amendment that has great merit. Again, I want to compliment the gentleman. One of my biggest fears over the years is after we Americanize the fleet, through no fault of the fishermen themselves, those that had the great, deep pockets from overseas, and other areas, would have the possibility of obtaining total control of the fisheries and thus we would have avoided what we were seeking to begin with, and that is an Americanized-type fishery, especially with the communities that live along the coast.  So, I do compliment the gentleman and would suggest respectfully that he look forward to the future when we have this continued cooperation regardless of who sits in the chair. Regardless of what happens, that we work together on these important issues.
