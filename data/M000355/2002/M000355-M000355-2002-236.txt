 President, I say to the majority leader, Senator McCain, and Senator Feingold, who have labored so long on behalf of this legislation, if there were an effort to unduly delay the bill, it would probably be led by myself. I do, however, want an opportunity to talk with some of my colleagues who have returned today.  We did have an opportunity to take a look at the House-passed bill over the past week and discover what is in it; it was a mystery to many of us. Once those discussions are complete, I believe we ought to be able to come to an agreement on how to complete the bill in an orderly fashion.                          ____________________
