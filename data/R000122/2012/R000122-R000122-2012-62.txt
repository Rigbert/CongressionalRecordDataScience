2126, which would ensure that there are no future delays on theimplementation of new sunscreen labeling and testing standards, was adopted as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.  Because sunscreens have been considered a cosmetic, they have largely avoided government oversight and the FDA hasn't changed its recommendations for sunscreen standards in over 30 years.  However, last June, after years of prodding by our former colleague Senator Dodd, me, and others, the FDA finally acted.  The agency finalized comprehensive new sunscreen regulations that were scheduled to go into effect on June 18, just a few weeks from now and in time for summer. Indeed, this was considered a victory for families across the country that spend more time outdoors and under the sun's harmful UVA and UVB rays during the summer months.  But just 2 weeks ago, the FDA announced it is now giving the industry an extra 6 months to make changes, meaning the standards will take effect in mid-December instead of this summer.  For too long the FDA has allowed manufacturers to get away with inaccurate claims about sun protection. My amendment will protect against any future delays and ensure the new sunscreen safety and labeling standards go into effect no later than the end of this year.  I am pleased that the Environmental Working Group supports this amendment, and the Consumer Health Care Products Association, which represents sunscreen manufacturers, has agreed to the amendment's inclusion in this bill. Finally, the Congressional Budget Office has informed me that my amendment would not result in any additional cost to the Federal government.  I thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Enzi for reviewing this amendment and including it in this FDA reauthorization bill.
